7 December 2009,Moles And Rats,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2170460/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2020,10 out of 10 and WOW does this film deserve it! Absolutely Brilliant!!,Blood Diamond 2006 was the film which turned me into a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and he must have been on a roll that year as The Departed 2006 was not only made that year but is just as good as Blood Diamond with again phenomenal acting from almost all The good and the bad The film is 14 years old at the point of writing this and is still as good as the day it was released first saw it The acting is phenomenal with the award in my opinion going to Leonardo DiCaprio One of the beauties about this film is Just as you think you ve grasped what is going on it throws another twist in The only let down for me and it is minor irritation was Matt Damon whom I m not a fan of or his acting With all the great reviews it should do without saying that is outstanding A fantastic great story with twists and turns and that will keep you guessing to the end and even then you will mostly have guessed wrongly The film has it all suspense thrills and tense moments the brilliance of the cannot be overstated A must watch So this is one of those rare moments where 10 out of 10 is deserved Recommended,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6303620/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2006,Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!,He has made good musicals New York New York surreal comedies After Hours satires The King of Comedy and biopics The Aviator but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he s dealt with life on the streets and gangsters Mean Streets Goodfellas and Casino and to some degree Taxi Driver are proof of that It doesn t seem strange then that his finest film in over a decade Goodfellas was released in 1990 sees him return to that familiar ground With a few changes The Departed based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs 2002 is Scorsese s first gangster film not to feature Italian American criminals In fact this film is set in Boston where the Irish rule One of these godfathers is Frank Costello Jack Nicholson the man the State Police want the most After years of investigation they re finally getting close thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan Leonardo Di Caprio Because of his family all Irish all bad becoming a member of Costello s crew isn t that difficult Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors Queenan Martin Sheen and Dignam Mark Wahlberg who will pass on the information to Ellerby s Alec Baldwin Special Investigations Unit What they don t know is that Colin Sullivan Matt Damon the most promising element of said unit has been on Costello s payroll since he was 12 Soon enough both cops and crooks become aware of the situation beginning a manhunt that s gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier By moving from Hong Kong to Boston Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration Another significant factor is the running time a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs 150 for The Departed This is due to new characters Dignam and Costello s henchman Mr French played by Ray Winstone were missing in the original and subplots such as the one concerning Madolyn Vera Farmiga a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld whereas IA was stylish without being excessive Scorsese s vision comprises very colorful language some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up and of course buckets of blood the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking None of the scenes ever reach the gross out level of Casino s head in the vice scene but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent also notable is the music perfectly setting the mood scene after scene alongside Thelma Schoonmaker s impeccable editing Amidst these brutal surroundings the director handles a spot on cast Baldwin Sheen and Wahlberg the latter finally back on form make good use of their little screen time Damon fine tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies and Nicholson playing the villain again at last delivers another OTT but classy turn original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety A special mention is needed for Di Caprio working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image thanks to a vulnerable gripping and arguably career best performance With its clever plot excellent acting and expert direction The Departed is without doubt the year s best film so far If this really is going to be his last gangster film he has said so as well as his last studio endorsed picture Scorsese can be proud given the masterpiece he has given us If only they gave him the Oscar in return,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1511201/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2009,"Lies, Betrayal, Sacrifice. What will you believe?",First off this is an American stylized remake of the Hong Kong hit Infernal Affairs I have to give credit to that a good film I have seen both Infernal Affairs and The Departed I personally prefer The Departed and I think because of one thing Martin Scorsese This is the master behind such greats as Taxi Diver Raging Bull Goodfellas and he s at it again The film has an all star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin The Direction was amazing maybe one of the reasons why he won the Oscar for it I loved how some of the scenes were shot and set up Especially regarding the Chinatown and police interrogation scenes among many others The film is perfectly set up with intense suspense scenes while adding in amounts humor at times It works really well The script is top notch Also Oscar winning Realistic strong dialogue from scene to scene Another thing I liked more in The Departed as opposed to Infernal Affairs was the acting DiCaprio really seemed to earn a lot of respect from this role Here he takes on the tough guy persona so well Sure it was known he was a good actor from his Oscar nominated performances in What s Eating Gilbert Grape and The Aviator but he really takes it to another level here I can t see anyone else as the character he fits so perfectly with it Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg being Massachusetts natives also give solid performances with their natural accents Nicholson works well in his role as well Everyone was extremely solid and everything seemed so real Set in Boston The Departed takes in all the Boston like atmosphere Beautifully shot scenes of the Massachusetts Golden Dome State Capital building is just one part of the landscape The Dropkick Murphys song I m Shipping up to Boston really fits great use of songs Scorsese usually works music into his films really well Cops or Criminals When you re facing a loaded gun what s the difference This quote really represents the film Matt Damon plays a state officer in the Police working for the crime boss of the area Frank Costello Nicholson While Damon s character can be described as a bad guy he is really misunderstood As a kid he is sort of mentored into crime business by Costello while Costello becomes the father figure Damon s character never had Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young guy coming from a bad crime ridden family He s decides to become a police officer to get away from the crime life he s been surrounded by Taking all this into account Captain Queenen Sheen and Seargent Dignam Wahlberg decide to send DiCaprio s character undercover to find out more about the criminal underworld and Costello With his family s crime record he fit s perfectly into the situation Now you have a highly ranked officer working for bad guy and an undercover cop in the criminal underworld working for the State Police From here it s an all out suspenseful thrill ride Who s who Who s working for who Who can you trust Paranoia threatens everyone Lies Betrayal Sacrifice How far will you take it At the heart of this film is character development We really feel for the characters We feel like we know them It s really amazing part of this story and film Tremendous story telling here This is one of the most entertaining and suspenseful crime drama s I have seen in a while While Infernal Affairs came first I think The Departed expands on it in so many ways Really solid crime drama Check both out when you get a chance It s really worth it 9 10,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2014673/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2006,Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!,Please don t make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven t seen the film yet I have seen it at a press screening last week Not only is it the best film of the year so far it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films I m a fan of the Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS upon which this is based While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original it is very much its own movie so much so that the screenwriter William Monahan didn t even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay thus enabling him to infuse the script with his and Scorsese s respective visions All the actors are first rate yes even Leo for all you DiCaprio bashers out there and turn in some of their best performances to date THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods if not wins including hopefully Scorsese s long overdue statuette for Best Director Plus with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for THE DEPARTED is tough stuff not for the faint of heart That said it is a must see for adult viewers who long for intelligent gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1488938/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2023,"Amazing movie, with an ensemble cast.",Boston Police are trying to bring down Gangland boss Frank Costello Billy Costigan goes undercover to try and nail him from the inside but his actions are countered by Colin Sullivan a criminal who has infiltrated The Police handing information to Costello This film doesn t date as I m watching it it is now seventeen years old and apart from the flip top phones oxycontin and the fresh faces of DiCaprio and Damon it has hardly dated Intense fast paced gritty and violent it doesn t hold back for one second I d place The Departed in my top ten list of greatest films The action sequences are tremendous and there s a subtle humour rubbing through it Even if this film doesn t quite fit into your favourite genre bracket I suggest you still watch it s an incredible movie It s one of those films that gets better with subsequent viewings you may struggle to put some of the pieces together first time round knowing what s happening only seems to make it more satisfying The cast has there ever been a more incredible cast assembled it s a tour de force from Jack Nicholson but Damon DiCaprio Winstone and many more are all fantastic 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9344656/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2006,Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling,Now I know that The Departed is based off of the Hong Kong movie WuJianDao but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn t stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was Then there s the acting in which the lead actors Nicholson DiCaprio Damon not only give stunningly entertaining performances but you become engulfed in each one s perspective and dilemmas The smaller roles that of Baldwin Walberg Sheen are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from The Big Lebowski by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in Alec Baldwin especially The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting but you ll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys If you re a Scorsese fan which I am I think you will appreciate this film You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music it s great to hear Gimme Shelter again but Comfortably Numb played in so well It s another gangster flick from Scorsese yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best so why not let him Oscar worthy the acting I certainly hope this is DiCaprio s best role since The Aviator which was his best role since Gangs of New York am I seeing a pattern here But my lasting impression wasn t concerned with the politics of the golden statue my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling Thank you Mr Scorsese,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1488926/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2006,Enjoyable thriller but there are failings and missed targets across the running time,The war between the police and the organised crime in Boston has reached new heights Both Oliver Queenan and target 1 Frank Costello have placed a mole into each other s organisations Billy Costigan is selected to infiltrate Costello s ranks thanks to a family background of criminals and working men meanwhile Colin Sullivan has been groomed since youth to come up inside the ranks of the BPD As Costigan makes progress it becomes clear to his police superiors that they too have a rat feeding information outwards With only Frank knowing Sullivan s identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan s a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning Having enjoyed the original film I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn t realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone so surely America can only do it better Well if not better then this is certainly bigger with stars oozing out of every pore a big director and a long running time In regards the latter the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is The fact that it is cool engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and as a Sopranos viewer I was surprised by this A secondary downside of this although not totally to blame is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat n mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character s neck as they raced to hang the other first The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because added to the original s strong ending is an extra scene that doesn t have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been Ironically for such a starry affair some of the performances are a bit weak and I m thinking specifically of Damon He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello s gang of murderers He works well alongside a scene stealing Nicholson At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and funny as he was he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better while Sheen is a nice touch of class The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story she adds very little beyond the writing on the page Overall though this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn t as good as I wanted The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1516492/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2018,The Departed is Scorsese's most overrated film.,Now now before you go and comment dislike and lambast my opinion hear me out This is by no means a bad film in fact it s better than good Yet a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade I m afraid I strongly disagree An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster On the flipside a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho It s a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust Scorsese is back to what he does best crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess Motives are shrouded in mystery minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies Scorsese brings in an A list cast comprising of Damon DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken Monahan s screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters It s a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny Wahlberg s sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure There are no surprises in this it s a thriller that doesn t excite me Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting It s only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head literally Lazily underwhelming especially after 140 minutes of character development The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors particularly Farmiga as she exclaims harrrrrdest A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4114028/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2006,"Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers",Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it It is a very good if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden The plot is simple a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy Thats not the case here here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston Its different enough to discourage comparisons which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film The cast is mostly excellent with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical Jackisms Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination I really liked this film but I didn t love it The film carries a sense of having been down this road before not because its a remake as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs State of Grace in particular so it didn t strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie Definitely worth seeing but I m not sure you re going to love it so much as you re going to like it 7 out of 10,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1512439/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2019,"Twist endings and Leo, name a better duo",Nicholson Damon and Dicaprio make for an absolute powerhouse trio in this classic film I have had this on my watch list for quite some time and although it wasn t as rock solid as I was expecting it s ending was right up my alley Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double rat story was told I never felt lost trying to keep track of who worked for who and who was spying on who because the filmmakers laid it out so clearly for me,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4973019/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2006,Fantastic Bro,Excellent A great great movie I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city Coming from that area I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive However with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard most of the time The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city In Boston when you are really close with someone or not really it is more or less a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area or at least visited at some point would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were As for Scorsese s direction I think he scored big with this one While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved There were some classic Scorsese moments here my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment Beautifully cut and stylistically directed Is it his best effort No But it still is truly mesmerizing He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1488082/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2009,One of the 50 best movies of all time? Really??,The Departed isn t a bad movie but it s certainly not one of the best movies ever made yet as of this writing it is 49 on IMDb s Top 250 a list which reveals far more about the reviewers than the films One look at the Top 250 is enough to make any cineaste curse transient gods like Michael Bay and the Wachowskis The list is so slanted toward movies that are both American and recent that a serious list of excluded movies from 1919 s Broken Blossoms to 1939 s Rules of the Game to 1959 s 400 Blows makes the Top 250 look downright silly How silly It includes the following all of which have good qualities but nothing approaching best ever levels Inglourious Basterds The Prestige District 9 Kill Bill I V for Vendetta In Bruges Benjamin Button Big Fish Crash and an Eastwood quadruple threat Gran Torino Changeling Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River News flash Eastwood is as talented a director as he was an actor Ranking The Departed at 49 is particularly strange because it isn t even as good as the Hong Kong original Infernal Affairs 2002 which lands at No 249 Foreign films take a real beating on this list which is why I cite many non American filmmakers here The USA is after all only one of more than 150 countries producing movies The Departed at 49 is also odd because it s far from the best work of any of the actors Damon DiCaprio Nicholson Winstone Farmiga As for Oscar nominee Marky Wahlberg all I can ask is WTF His apparent facial paralysis wasn t a particular handicap in his role as Sgt Dignam maybe that s why he was lauded All he had to do was deliver profanities but even at that Wahlberg is to R Lee Ermey as Bud Lite is to Guinness Stout It s probably also true for obvious reasons that a lot of IMDb ers have mainly seen movies made after they were born and mainly American movies besides No wonder they produce a list as lame as the Top 250 A lot of young people I know categorically dismiss black and white movies which is probably a fair reflection of the number of idiotic fusspots in the world But if you ve never seen Gregg Toland s cinematography how can you evaluate Wally Pfister s One 20ish couple I know movie buffs who are well read and savvy haven t even seen The Third Man or Grand Illusion or Rashomon so I find it really impossible to take their uneducated opinions about film seriously I also wonder if they really are fans I don t see how they can be if they re not searching out Ozu and Leone and Lubitsch Ultimately IMDb s Top 250 is a good list if your teeth need grinding As for the actual written reviews some of which are very very good the only profitable way I ve found to read them is to customize them by eliminating all ratings of 1 and 10 Try it It s an astonishingly effective filter because about half the reviewers don t seem to know that numbers 2 through 9 even exist I just checked an unquestionably average to above average film Rushmore it had 592 comments and 452 76 rated it 1 or 10,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2183556/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,Whatever I say does not do this film justice,The Departed The screenplay Top Notch The performances all star cast delivering all star performances The music perfect The Directing Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way There are moments of incredible tension violence and drama moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said Maybe he Scorsese got what he deserves exclusion from the mediocre This film is Scorsese s finest work since Raging Bull but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan it is more than an amazing score and great cinematography While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all star cast many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin Jack Nicholson Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg Mark Wahlberg s Sgt Dignam stole every scene he was in and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors He gets to deliver some of the best lines and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more and anticipating his next scene Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck for so long mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long as his major competition Flags of our Fathers has yet to be released I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more this time for best actor Monahan will be nominated for writing and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director Also it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed That was the long version the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances direction music and visuals If you like a layered story that is not formulaic in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493956/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2010,Whom Do You Trust?,Wow this was exhausting We have a cast of characters each of which has a dangerous side They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor Some are spies some are mobsters some are weak and some are strong The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it s coming There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner The performances are great particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane continuous process of interaction among crooks and police They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone Leonardo DeCaprio s character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it s at times hard to like it Still it never stops right up to it s dramatic finish,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2183948/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2007,major let down,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1603603/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2006,A Truculent Pancake,What a shame Scorcese the old one lived in a world that worked differently than the world of most folks His world has no God no laws no fate no environment His world is a world of characters who exude the world If there are apparent laws it is because of the force of people creating the space they project into He works in this way because its his heritage an Italian legacy both in culture and film And because it works A filmmaker s job is to define a world in a film ideally in the first few moments of a film There are all sorts of ways to do this and the way we digest what we see has a lot to do with how it is served in this way One way the way the old Scorcese used was to invest wholly in bodies Focus the camera completely on people a few very very strong people and grow the world and a whole world system usually based on simple ethics around it It means you have the latitude to develop some loud apparently full characters but it also carries disadvantages we never can fold his movies into our lives We can never overlap our world into his because his doesn t exist He knows these limits He s spoken of them privately and in his last two films you could see him trying to outgrow the limits of the old Scorcese With Gangs he reached far into space defining places a city underground havens mobs the flow of rumors through society He reached to groups His camera flew not as expertly as DePalma s but wildly compared to old filmmaker s which was tethered to single bodies Gangs overreached and ran out of money time and the patience of his patrons so it was wrapped up with some explosive characters Aviator showed us a new man I hailed him as the best new filmmaker of that year He drifted into the world away from characters He designated a watcher in Blanchett something he has never done before and he let he bring her tools of folded narrative to bear It was film worth watching his first one in my opinion And now we have the old fellow backsliding into his easy manner his cheat His way of delivering apparent power with no power Yes it is well put together Yes it has serious actors doing their bit without worrying about how it fits in the symphony There is no grand design just speechifying Yes the use of music is perhaps the most competent you will ever find But it is empty Again We lost a filmmaker this year Ted s Evaluation 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1514483/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2006,Brilliant,Before seeing this I knew I was in for a treat given that it s a Scorsese movie but The Departed was even better than I expected The acting is outstanding Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job It s turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr Ripley and As Good As It Gets Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines Ray Winstone Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too Definitely one of the best films of the 00 s And easily one of the best remakes of all time It s intense funny exciting suspenseful superbly acted violent has great characters and has one of the most shocking scenes I ve ever seen And there s not a boring moment in it s two and a half hour running time The film will most likely be nominated for picture director and adapted screenplay and in my opinion it deserves all three of them DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations See this as soon as you can,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1519375/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2023,Great Movie,Rating 9 4 Overall a movie that is a must watch even with its small faults as it uses Boston wit and humor laced into a story and screenplay to show the effects trauma and crime can have on people stuck in the rat race as the push through through what is ethical in what is a Martin Scorsese masterpiece Incredible Direction Incredible Acting Incredible from the cast as a whole Standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio in his 2nd best role behind Wolf Mark Walburg and Jack Nicholson Even though its pretty over the top Incredible Story Filled with symbols of the dark nature of the subject manner the quest of the rat Incredible Screenplay Mixes humor and trauma extremely effectively Decent Cinematography Not a huge fan of the still cuts edited with the shifting cinematography Decent Editing See cinematography Plot Structure was good for the most part but the beginning was a bit hard to understand but can get past this after the first 20 30 mins Pacing was generally good but there are some slower parts meant for character development not a huge problem The movie was a bit on the longer side but there really isn t that many scenes that could be cut so it gets a pass Build to the climax is incredible with the ending being extremely suspenseful and unpredictable,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9117634/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2022,The Film with it All. Perfection.,Arguably Martin Scorsese s most action driven production sees a high brow cast rise to their assignments and add their own special touches on an already glossed finished product The Departed is simply flawless An undercover agent and a spy constantly try to counter attack each other in order to save themselves from being exposed in front of the authorities Meanwhile both try to infiltrate an Irish gang The Scorsese collection is a breathtaking phenomenon epitomising his dedication and class in the industry still today the 79 year old continues to provide entertainment for our film loving pleasures The Departed was released in 2006 with Jack Nicholson Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg as well as many more great actors star in the crime drama DiCaprio even called his only one to one scene with Nicholson as one of the most memorable moments of my life Scorsese described the film as one of the few he has directed which actually contains a plot as absurd as it may sound at first hearing The Departed is a controlled picture which isn t forced it understands the correct balance of speed in its depiction of the timeline and doesn t sway a favourable way The watch is well measured and keeps its audience enticed by its uncertainty and regular sharp turns 5 Academy Award nominations and 4 wins only Mark Wahlberg s Supporting Actor nod was turned away the film picked up a total of 97 awards most notably for its sensational image and the magnificent artistic work of Scorsese who catalysed the production s success The writing in the play is infectious with clever exchanges implying nothing to its spectators credit to the crew who unpicked Alan Mack and Felix Chong s thrilling Hong Kong picture Internal Affairs and adapted it into a trope of cinema An Irish Mafia tale fuelled with excitement and amazement Entertainment Weekly put it on its end of the decade Best of list saying If they re lucky directors make one classic film in their career Martin Scorsese has one per decade A signature Scorsese stunner strikes again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8361759/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2023,A movie that makes you want to watch non stop,This is definitely Martin Scorcese at it s finest Something I must warn about is that this is not an action movie even though there are fight scenes and deaths it s not like a Jason Statham movie with the main character kicking everyone and easily beating his enemys plus the action isn t the main focus The main focus is the cat and mouse chase between the police informer and the mob informer with many scenes that make you think that they will finally find the truth but end up failing This movie is also full of twists and surprises that don t feel forced or random and actually make the story better The acting is amazing but it was to expect because of the casting And the direction the soundtrack everything is perfect in this movie Truly one of the best movies of all time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9076983/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2007,Remakes are seldom as good as the original,I started my day with 2046 I won t recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung Mou gaan dou Ying xiong Li Gong Miami Vice Memoirs of a Geisha and Ziyi Zhang Memoirs of a Geisha Ying xiong The music was excellent and Tony Leung s performance was spellbinding but the movie was hard to follow I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed which is a remake of that film I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version I just couldn t wait any longer so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent I have never been a big fan of Leonardo I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can but this performance was over the top Having said that I can t really think of another character s performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film The setup in the beginning was really a bore Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas one of my favorite films I really don t see him winning an Oscar for this film though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1601604/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,A terrific movie.,A white knuckled crime thriller depicting the cat and mouse game of two cops one an overworked and overstretched undercover and the other a two faced fa ot rat holed up in the police department trying to figure each other s identities out Both are in too deep and thus will lose their lives if they re found out So stakes are at an all time high and they will run over anyone and anything to keep themselves hidden Leonardo DiCaprio out of all the star studded cast in this flick impressed with his outstanding performance He was anxiety ridden and dreadful of the uncertainty of his constantly fluxing situation This is his best role so far in my opinion Leo truly morphed into his always unnerved and deeply depressed character William hated the mob life he walked into the god awful mass murderering psychos he was hanging out with the part where he wasn t able to be his real self the loneliness of it all and him lacking a normal life His only escapade was his shrink and even though all he got from her was pity love she was his sole catharsis That part was truly heart rending His character felt all too real Fantastic performance from Leo who made William Costigan Jr seem human Matt Damon s portrayal of the deceitful and self serving nasty rat was also excellent His hubris totally being crushed inside the elevator and seeing him beg to be killed was just funny and a clear display of Damon s broad acting range Leo and Damon made this movie worth watching Impressive performances from both The Departed was a captivating and a truly nail biting experience A well conceived well written well acted and an entertaining thriller that deserves it s popularity and top rating Sad William Costigan Jr passed the way he did after all the agonizing hell he went through but at least he got avenged Even though that s no fulfilling it gave the movie an acceptable ending A terrific movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8490430/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2006,not a patch on INFERNAL AFFAIRS,this movie is completely inferior to Infernal Affairs on just about every level possible IA anticipated an audience with a brain cell or two and so explains during the title sequence what it takes this remake around 30 minutes or more to explain repeat during the title sequence we are given all of the information we need to know about the informant plants which btw were realistically placed some considerable time in the past rather than several months ago and are then straight into the movie scorsese takes this fabulous material and then dumbs it down to spoon feed it to a western audience all of the sharp and intelligent dialogue of the original is gone in favour of your usual Hollywood 4 word expletives every other word in this film is an F word and they are mostly totally unnecessary all of the stylish camera work of the original is lost for example the ultra cool roof top meets and to top it the casting and performances are dry and bad nicholson gives us a performance which is no more than good old bottled vintage jack here s jack doing an impression of a rat etc etc yawn di caprio is good as usual but still doesn t nail the performance mostly because he doesn t physically suit the part he just doesn t look tough enough for the challenge as presented in the departed wahlberg on the other hand tough s it up to the Nth degree and is just absolutely atrocious this man is working in a high level intelligence department and he plays it like a street cop it s a totally inappropriate display and really reveals his limitations as an actor matt damon is just too plain he is just totally unmemorable in this movie for a director who used to be at the cutting edge of cinema this is a fat and lazy remake of a lean and mean original movie trilogy which i urge you strongly to see time for scorsese to hit the gym and go back to basics for people unaware of the original i m sure they ll be blown away by the incredibly intricate plot in scorsese s departed unfortunately what they probably won t know is that this is a dumb rehash of Infernal Affairs,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1562245/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2011,Sublime Scorsese,Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater Very intense action and violence twisting plot lot s of misdirection The story line is a bit overly whelming at times this isn t a good movie to watch if you re tired and follow the action the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who s who of the movie but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won t be too confusing While it s certainly not a love story there is that element with a bit of a morality play going the whole time I can t make some of the statements I d like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews but I ll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently All that said if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I d recommend to you,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2375071/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2007,The Good & Bad Of 'The Departed',THE GOOD A big collection of well known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if will be found out Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg the only female with many lines Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone give superb support My favorite was Winstone a guy I m familiar with from Sexy Beast and The Proposition Despite the length of this movie it keeps your interest all the way I never got more bored BUT THE BAD I did get tired of all the f words Usually I could care less about that but over 250 of them Sometimes it seemed like every sentence It was ludicrous and after awhile your senses seemed bombarded with it such as too much action can numb you It just wasn t necessary to have it said THAT many times and by practically everybody in the film That s my other main complaint every character in here is a scumbag an untrustworthy person who will sleep with anyone and lie to everyone Baldwin s character as an FBI director was the most ridiculous of them all Both of these faults are typical for a Martin Scorcese film He s pathetic Sorry Marty but not every person in the world is a low life as you must be OVERALL Nonethelss to be fair his movies like this one are usually interesting just the sordid stuff done to excess If you can put up with the latter you ll like this film a lot,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1604785/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2007,"Vastly Overrated. Worst ""Good Film"" of 2006 POSSIBLE SPOILERS",Maratin Scorsese has been a fixture in Hollywood for decades and members of the Motion Picture Academy must have felt that they owed him this Oscar for being Martin Scorsese certainly not for this film which has more phony elements in it than any movie in recent memory True it has 3 1 2 high profile stars Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg Plus it has more violence than can be found anywhere outside a war zone and enough blood to fill your average blood bank Scorsese has plowed this field before in Goodfellas a vastly superior movie Why didn t I like it Because the plot is stuffed with unbelievable elements including a three way romance between Damon as a cop DiCaprio as an undercover agent posing as a criminal and a police psychiatrist who is treating them both As for Jack Nicholson he is reprising previous roles as the Devil this time in the person of a crime boss who is also get this an informant for the FBI Damon is Nicholson s mole inside the police department and DiCaprio is the police department s mole inside Nicholson s organization The question is who s going to find whom first and eventually after many bloody twists and turns who gives a damn anyway Scorsese has made more bad films than good ones but what the hell it s time to give him his Oscar As for the principals DiCaprio presents himself as a cool but tortured soul living a dangerous lie Damon is Damon once again and Nicholson is out there in front of the camera chewing the scenery as he is increasingly wont to do Wahlberg does quite a decent job in a completely over the top role as an overseer in the under cover section of the police department Martin Sheen distinguishes himself in this movie as DiCaprio s ultimate boss primarily because his character is almost believable and he s low key where everyone else is hamming it up big time This movie is expensive trash and its success proves once again that you can t underestimate the taste of the American people or of the Motion Picture Academy,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1645836/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2013,Breathless But Bewildering,This has enough violence and gritty street stuff to be another intriguing descent into the world of crime and punishment for Scorsese and his blend of attractive brutality but it is vastly overrated It can be confusing and less than engaging as its myriad of mobsters and cops parade in and out of frame with varying results of believability The acting and characterizations are all over the place with wide ranges of volume and machismo One example is that the affairs of the heart here are never founded and come across as less than real Take the scene in the restaurant Is that for one minute real with its forced laughter Or the bedroom sex scene It is a movie that seems full of itself rather than full The complexities are so twisted and run by so fast that its hard to keep up with it all It could be that the pacing is such to give it that dizzying feeling of being trapped like a rat in the bowels of the beast but its breathless energy sucks the life out of the story and its just whiz bang bang bang bang While not without its attractions of audacious anarchy and it delivers so much that it is hard not to get involved in the goings on But the Director has made many better films and one cannot get the feeling that the adulation for this one is misplaced or in place of past disregards,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2730492/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2006,"Bad acting, non-existent character development, confusing plot.",First of all I must say this is THE worst Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen I usually like Scorsese s movie but this one is the first one I have encounter that totally blow me away in its awfulness My first problem with The Departed is the casting They got a bunch of baby face fruitcakes like Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg which totally throws the suspension of disbelief out of the window It is like watching a bunch of boy scouts playing cops and robbers None of them look like cops more like boy scouts Secondly the acting is just wooden There is no subtlety in the acting and they try to cover that up by over acting and constant swearing Perhaps it is to make them look more mature for their part Now about the plot it is pretty thin and confusing at times lacks clarity or resolve The several scenes made me cringe particularly when Jack Nicholson tries to torture Leonardo DiCaprio it just seems totally unbelievable after Jack Nicholson violently tortured DiCaprio and he trusted him AGAIN Now about Matt Damon s acting in this movie it is pretty god damn bad In fact what acting Matt Damon just doesn t emote at all He is as souless and as wooden as a robot It is extremely wooden as if he is the living proof that Pinocchio exist Leonardo s acting is more of his usual self pretty boy in distress with endless whinings to anyone who would lend his ears to him but in this movie he seems particularly out of place The character development lacks subtle internal conflicts presented in the original character so involving and multi dimensional Jack Nicholson is just his usual sly scoundrel self Totally uninspiring acting Same goes with Martin Sheen s super stiff acting Anthony Anderson is totally mis casted in this movie as if he is a comic relief and yet there is nothing comic about it The character development and inter character dynamics are almost non existent between the two rivaling characters Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon it is as if they are in two separate movies The movie not only lacks any subtlety but blatantly plays up the caricatures of what we perceived as mafia loud mouth constantly swearing goons it is both extremely clich and uninteresting The plot is also pretty confusing due to extremely bad direction it lacks focus and the camera work is also chaotic and uninteresting,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1521379/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,This one is about the mark of a great director,Like i said this film is about the mark of a great director in this case a well paced well written violent movie with a great choice of songs a mark that Scorsese is known for doing so well but this one here is not his best film not saying it s bad far from it but definitely not the one he should have won the oscar for in my opinion the film that the Academy should give his best director award was way back for Raging Bull also not forgetting that he wasn t even nominated for Taxi Driver but anyway judging this film it have a great cast full of good performances especially by Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Wahlberg Also this movie is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film called Mou gaan dou the second time that Scorsese did a remake the first one being Cape Fear 1991,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6901026/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2023,Scorsese probably had great fun directing this,Frank Costello Jack Nicholson is a gangster of Irish heritage running crime in South Boston The police are always trying to build a case against him but nothing sticks so they enlist somebody who is training to be a cop BIlly Costigan to go undercover to get the goods on Costello From a criminal transaction that is supposed to go down that does not Billy does surmise that there is a rat in the State Police And he d be right while the bad cop Colin Matt Damon realizes that there is a rat in Costello s organization But the records of who is undercover are off limits for everybody but the two police officers who recruited Costigan so Colin is going to have to find out through old fashioned probing who the rat is And so it goes for the rest of the film with the undercover cop and the bad cop both trying to find out who the other is first because finding out second would be too late Complications as well as a police psychiatrist being lovers to both Colin and Billy and not realizing who either of them truly is ensues There is something of a prologue with Irish mobster Frank Costello narrating about his environment the Knights of Columbus JFK and black people with the kind of language about the latter of which Disney would disapprove but it s necessary to paint a picture of what kind of guy Costello is upfront To me it s the fast food of Scorsese s catalog but then everybody enjoys fast food from time to time It does a great job of building tension and suspense and there are good pay offs for sticking to the end Plus it is just plain fun to have a bunch of great actors running around shouting microprocessors in thick Boston accents,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9128563/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2008,Making Decisions with a Gun Instead of a Gavel,I am not saying that I think this movie is in the category with other Scorcese greats such as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver actually King of Comedy is my favorite Scorcese film however The Departed is a relatively remarkable film The acting in this movie is simply incredible The plethora of acting talent simply overwhelms you Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen Jack Nicholson Leonardo Di Caprio and of course Matt Damon I thought Matt Damon s performance was the best acting performance in this movie The comment he made which I found to be very interesting was The Irish are impervious to psycho analysis I went to grade school at an Irish parish and even though they were affluent they did seem more visceral than many other ethnic groups are Boston is the only city in the country where the Irsih control the syndicate The Italians are accustomed to ruling organized crime in virtually every other city in the United States Boston is where the movie The Departed takes place The F word replaced a lot of semantics in this movie and the violence seemed to have some kind of tenet of amelioration attached to it The Departed won for best picture in 2006 as it would appear as though the copious quantity of top notch talent in this film would almost mandate such an accolade How were all the problems in this movie solved WITH A GUN The violence in The Departed was almost satirical as it signified a precarious set of checks and balances Everyone s anger seemed to reflect a sordid and justifiable pontification for everything Many techniques of agitation and vindictiveness with this movie told the movie audience one thing This is a Scorcese film His style emanates a proverbial belligerence through frustration that he has incorporated in so many of his past movies I enjoyed this film and I can definitely see how it won best picture in 2006 What is the best way of saying The Departed is an excellent movie by saying this The Departed is a really good F word picture,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1877168/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2023,This is an all-time great picture that is an absolute must see,The Departed 2006 is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX The storyline follows two young men who grew up on the mean streets of Boston with troubled pasts and shady associates They both register for the police academy and have two different experiences with one being put on the fast track to promotion and leadership and the other being dragged through the mud sent to jail and placed on a secret undercover mission As they head in opposite directions their paths are bound to cross again This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese Casino and stars Leonardo DiCaprio What s Eating Gilbert Grape Matt Damon Goodwill Hunting Jack Nicholson The Shining Martin Sheen Apocalypse Now Anthony Anderson Hot Tub Time Machine and Alec Baldwin It s Complicated The cast for this picture is absolutely amazing and everyone delivers a tremendous performance This is likely one of the greatest casts ever assembled The storyline and script is perfectly written The back story of each character is perfectly developed the dialogue illustrated the knots inside the characters and how the inner demons impact their decisions and direction Nicholson is a perfect villain and his cunning and ruthlessness is entertaining in itself The narration is legendary and the ending is both shocking and rewarding Overall this is an all time great picture that is an absolute must see I would score this a 10 10 and consider it a must see,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9034075/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2013,"Better watch the original – Infernal affairs""",Talk about undeserved Oscars This movie definitely didn t deserved them It s a sad thing that Academy decided to honor Scorsese with Oscar not only so late but also with movie that didn t deserved it one bit It s even more sad that so many people think it s a good movie I disagree with that opinion The movie suffers from bad acting from the three leading stars DiCaprio Damon and Nicholson Matt Damon doesn t act at all He just is in this movie He breaths he has open eyes and he speaks That s it Jack Nicholson plays his part in such way that would fit Burton s Batman returns He s overacting He s campy cheesy and not one bit dangerous Unless you think that killing and eating a fly makes him dangerous DiCaprio is also overacting but at least he s switching from being very nervous to very angry from time to time And who the f casts Anthony Anderson in a serious role of cop That fat and unfunny piece of meat sticks out here like a sore thumb The supporting actors are surprisingly much better than the trio of stars Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen and oh my God Mark Wahlberg give the best performances of the movie I wasn t surprised by the fine performances of Baldwin and Sheen I didn t expect Wahlberg to give such a good performance as the tough asshole cop It s his best role since Boogie nights The movie has it s share of rather ridiculous twists that are hard to swallow There is a big plot hole involving a certain object that seems to be important for the story for almost 70 of the movie yet it strangely disappears and none of the characters seems to care Not to mention the indestructible cell phone The movie is badly directed Scorsese fails to recreate the psychological tension of the original so he uses the simple way to do it by making characters shout very often and punch each other The wonderful sense of sorrow and tragedy that you could feel in the Asian movie is also gone Instead there is a lot of loud music And the shootouts look absolutely terrible like something that Michael Bay could direct The movie ends differently than Infernal affairs and it s a really bad thing Not to mention that the whole symbol with the rat is just pathetic In the end you might realize that you have just seen an empty and bad cop thriller I give it 4 10,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2853571/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2007,Just as the nay sayers said,This movie sucked big time I agree with all of those who complained about the abusive and unrealistic cursing specially when coming from the cops It makes no sense that educated people whose job it is to run investigations would keep talking like that all the time But even if you choose to suspend disbelief on that matter there are just too many inconsistencies to be able to let yourself taken in for the ride Other viewers have described them very well so I thank them for saving me the time I also felt a great disappointment since I used to think that Martin Scorsese was a great director Well no more I guess Just another big commercial production which just doesn t fly Too many heavy weights and too much pandering to the lowest common denominators this recipe usually favored by Hollywood only succeeded in giving me an indigestion buuurrrp,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1608638/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2007,"That's It Hollywood, Just Keep Slaughtering Those Foreign Flicks",When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1608595/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2008,Very good but not Scorseses' best,Film takes place in Boston It deals with two men Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon who are both working to bring down a crime lord Jack Nicholson Problem is they re both working for different agencies and neither knows about the other Things quickly go out of control OK this is not Martin Scorsese s best film That goes to Raging Bull and Good Fellas However it is one of his best The plot has many twists and turns and surprises I didn t see coming There s excellent use of music throughout and Scorsese really manages to capture the mood and feeling of Boston not easy to do Also since this is a Scorsese film the word f is used a few hundred times and the violence is VERY extreme and bloody This isn t for weak stomaches My only complaints here are that the movie is too long it has one climax too many and some lousy acting lessens it DiCaprio is excellent in his role I was very impressed I never thought much of him as an actor but now I ve changed my opinion Nicholson Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too Vera Farmiga holds her own in a male dominated cast But Matt Damon is a blank in one of the main roles His face never changes expression and I didn t know how to take him Mark Wahlberg is bad too How he got an Academy Award nomination for this I ll never know He s as blank as Damon and just swears non stop for no reason and keeps giving obscene finger gestures I was just hoping somebody would kill him off soon He wasn t playing a character he was doing a caricature Those two bad performances lessen this Also some of the cast fake Boston accents pretty well Damon and Wahlberg are from the area so they didn t have to fake it It got Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards because Martin Scorsese was long overdue for both So it is worth seeing but not Scorsese s best by a long shot I give it an 8,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1885125/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2022,Need more like this,I ve watched these gangster or gangster esque movies before goodfellas the godfather training day se7en this one the departed etcetera etcetera but I was too young to appreciate them or remember so watching them again now and all I can think of is why don t they make movies like this anymore I mean they try to Usually when I see a cast lineup this good now first thought is I hope I don t get disappointed but in this movie the plot is just as good as the characters playing in it And the end often when a movie or series is full of twists and turns towards the end it s either too dramatic or just there to make up for a mediocre movie but it s perfect in this watching this I can t think of a much better way to end it Great actors great directors and great writers came together in this It s a simple cat and mouse cops vs gangsters thriller and it s enticing without being too complicated What I love most is the viewer knows everything that s going on and you re just waiting to see which character in the movie is gonna figure it out first More often than not the writers always keep a trump card in the script and you only figure it when the characters involved do which is exciting but it s nice to see a simple thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat like this one,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7712696/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,"What happens to rats trying to ""out-rat"" each other?",A good guy playing the bad guy or a bad guy playing the good guy who will prevail in a standoff like this The answers sort of lie within this movie though the narrative is more about them trying to out rat each other What did that lead to Well more casualties than anyone could expect for one It also resulted in a lot of hurt feelings Finally we were left with an ending that leaves quite a lot of questions even though by that point we had almost all of the answers If there s a message that this movie tried to deliver I d guess it would sound something like being a rat doesn t lead to any good Seeing the rat in the final shot also gives a similar impression I don t know why but the ending was pretty blank for me After losing one of the key characters it started going downhill It just felt like that meme when someone is aiming a gun at the person in front of them while also having a gun pointed at themselves from the back and the guy in the back is also in the scope of the 4th person getting ready to shoot him from the rafters Rats were trying to keep their head above water sacrificing other rats in the process while someone from above tried to drown them all The problem here is that all the rats only showed up when water began running from the faucet and that someone from above was absent To explain it using a different metaphor the movie was like a lit cigarette that required harder and more rushed breaths to finish The twists didn t feel like twists because some of the characters involved in them were so minor and insignificant The way it collapsed on itself was a bit of a letdown Even though I didn t like how the final chapter unfolded I can t say that about the rest of the movie There were a lot of ups and downs that worked in favor of the rat in the gang or the rat in the special force The central piece somehow ended up being a psychiatrist who got involved with both of the rats It s both a pity and a blessing that neither of them realized that they had their eyes on the same woman I feel like her part in the story is monumental for both of the rats Another key character that was monumental to both of these guys is Staff Sergeant Dignam In a way he s the secondary true protagonist in the story only made it clear in the end but throughout the movie he s being a pest to both of the rats By a pest I mean he s a hard head that questions both of their intentions and he got into a fight with both of them His choice of words when confronting them is entertaining as he cusses them out in ways a stereotypical cop with a short temper would but he does it a bit better It s just too bad that his screen time was pretty much limited though maybe more input from him would begin to get tiresome What s worse is that he turned into a ghost for a good portion at the end of the movie Like his reintroduction just barely made any sense for me Just like what was in the psychiatrists package that didn t get another mention Though it probably is what led to Dinam reappearing at least that s my guess I just feel it wasn t explored enough Overall I liked the movie even though the majority of my ramblings were about what I didn t like or didn t get Hey just a friendly reminder if I didn t get it it doesn t mean it s bad or it s wrong there s always a possibility that I might have missed a thing or two And I don t want those few scenes that I didn t like towards the latter end of the movie to speak for my whole impression of the movie I guess that Scorsese s style and the formula he uses in his movies are just beginning to look a bit old for me and I find myself being less impressed with every movie of his that I watch That may not be it but it s a thought that I m beginning to have in my head It s a movie that I ll need to rewatch again sometime under a different set of circumstances Maybe I ll find it better then maybe I ll find it worse but I ll likely feel about the same,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8472772/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2006,No reason to vote,I was excited to see the movie because of the cast and the story I was very disappointed after 5th minute because it is the same exact copy of the movie INFERNAL AFFAIRS The scenes the story everything is the same I would understand if they used the story as a base and made a movie out of it but I will not accept it if the only thing they changed is the cast I cannot make a good comment of the movie because it definitely is not a movie of it s own There is no excitement of watching the movie because I know what would happen on every scene I will give my vote to the actors only because their performance especially Leonardo Di Caprio was very good but that s all,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1547395/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2006,Wow! You people are easy to please.,I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called Internal Affairs If you have never seen the original then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese Why do I hate Departed First Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie Nicholson is that talented Plus Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio Second Matt Damon s character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character He was simply bad In Internal Affairs the bad cop was more complex In that movie you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future Third there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film Fourth the dialog was fine but again it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing It was simply mediocre at best Fifth and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters Oh sure Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that In the original there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore the audience is torn What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap That being said if you have never seen Internal Affairs then you will like this movie But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well then you will be disappointed In fact for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1499777/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2009,A Perfect Blend Of Vintage and Contemporary Scorsese,The Departed is a great film to say the least The film centers around an entire police department s chase of a top boss in Boston The plot may not seem original but the film gives you a feeling of something new with the intensity of that of a drama and the awe of an action flick The acting of the cast all around is great with the likes of actors such as Leonardo Dicaprio playing a rookie cop getting his first assignment As a result of his family s history of criminal activity his first job is to be working undercover gathering intelligence in the dealings of a mob boss played different yet brilliantly by Jack Nicholson This goes without notice as Nicholson has his man on the inside as well On the opposite side of the spectrum Matt Damon also plays a rookie cop starting out of the box with a good job though as a result of his honorable family history There also plenty of great supporting performances by Martin Sheen and Ray Winestone as well as a breakout performance given by Mark Wahlberg Despite so many explosive performances this film is driven by its story so perfectly directed by Martin Scorsese With this film Scorsese uses his skill to show the hard and gritty tough life on the streets as he once did so often as well as his fine attention to detail with amazing plot dynamics What both of these things culminate into is a well rounded and balanced film with an unlimited scope of cops and gangsters The depth of the film is limitless as it is so well layered Scorsese here makes the film of his life here throwing out everything he has Scorsese and William Monahan who so adapts this film so vividly combine for one of the most thrilling and psychologically explosive movies in ages as the film so perfectly illustrates nothing is as it seems as well as a chain is only as strong as strong as its weakest link We may think we know it all from profile and background checks but as long as we don t know whats going on inside a person s mind we won t ever know what the person is truly about,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2017529/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2007,Tripe,I m still in shock that Martin Scorsese who had such a hungry look on his face all through the preambles got an Oscar for this senseless blood filled curse filled demeaning poorly acted and executed effort I saw the ratings on IMDb and thought after I had sat through the painful time it took me to watch this dreadful dumbed down copy of the Japanese original Internal Affairs that this is a joke right It must be whole truckloads of families of the many involved in this shambles rating the movie on IMDb Anyone with even a knuckle dragging IQ couldn t couldn t couldn t admire this effort Seriously I don t understand what Mark Wahlberg was doing in it At all Apart from insulting the all male team by calling them GIRLS Oh what an insult I should have walked then And the shrink breaching every ethic in the book without a blink and a moronic dialogue burbling from her lips One doesn t believe her for a second And Jack Nicholson right out of The Shining and this performance continued even to Oscar night Jack leering at one and all and showing a lot of teeth and just being POPULAR Irish Mafia Indeed More like the court jester to Martin s king And on I could write pages and pages but what s the point There was no character development no bonding of the chief and the mole a very basic part of the original plot downright plagiarism in parts I was constantly confused between the characters played by the ingratiating Leonardo DiCaprio and the smarmy Matt Damon They look act behave hairdyed the very same The movie paying public shouldn t have to work so hard at character identification with each scene A plot and better direction and a modicum of a screenplay would have helped Appalling waste of time and money 1 out of 10 because IMDb doesn t allow a minus or a zero Avoid,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1611393/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2007,What a wretched pile of f**k.,Over directed pointless virtuosic touches that add nothing to what s happening on screen with the plot or characters over scored save me from the freakin metal Irish jig and the Stones both heard twice in this thing over edited the movie is awkward scenes flow neither internally or into each other and over acted by Jack Nicholson so far beyond the point of self parody that it ceases to be funny this horrid horrid film is filled with two dimensional characters except for Madolyn the worst psychiatrist who never lived who lacks even a second dimension and more profanity and violence than you can shake a stick at Really I ve never been a Scorsese fan but this movie owes any praise it deserves for its twisty turny plot to whatever was left over from the original Infernal Affairs Yes in case you didn t know this movie is a remake of a far superior Hong Kong film As with Dreamgirls another inexplicably over praised 2006 release there s just no denying the nudity of this emperor Tedious where it should be crackling and dull when it should be suspenseful Marty and crew have made a nasty cinematic mess that really does not deserve the all too predictable praise that s been heaped on it Instant classic best film of the year etc I m sorry but the technical competency of the filmmakers is questionable and the emotional impact of the story is zip By the last few minutes as blowing a person s brains on the wall is becoming more of a clich than you would ever think possible I found myself hoping that some deus ex machina would descend from the sky and just kill everyone so it would just be f king over already,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1607616/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2007,Everyone shoots everyone. ooops I gave away the plot!,Jack Nicholson does his impersonation of Rip Torn Dicaprio and Damon are distinguished only because one of them but which has some facial hair and all of them and everyone else puts on a lousy Southie Boston accent so even the actors natively from there come across as fake Except a few actors put on a fine Irish Brogue so you know they re Irish Such entertainments are needed in this remarkably plot free orgy of camp grumbling meaningless shootouts and poignant cell phone usage I haven t counted to see if cell phones are used as often as guns but no doubt a future thesis on the theme is lurking Jack Nicholson at one point refers to the John Hancock building That s a building in Boston Wow Nicholson was so in character he might have just winged that Everyone calls everyone else a rat or an undercover and sometimes they say things like He s undercover What undercover No he s my undercover Abbott and Costello more humorously expressed it Who s rat s on first There s also authentic Hollywood crime lingo like were you tailed a play on rats perhaps Everyone informs on everyone else and in the end everyone shoots everyone else except one person who s character is so vague you can look him or her in the eye and not know who I want my identity back says one character mysteriously All of this highlights the key themes of the film that everyone is everyone else and in the end only cell phones survive There s also a lot of looking in cell phones presumably because to Hollywood types even more than the rest of us looking at cell phones is done often and always is a thrill This movie is a really good argument for having movies directed instead of run by mugging improvisers alternatively a future film can dispense with actors entirely and focus entirely on cell phones and computer screens However the City of Boston played largely by itself is convincing T,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1776284/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2020,Scorsese at his best,I ve just been binge watching the Scorsese movies for the first time recently have yet to seen taxi driver as the considerable one I ve missed but pretty much all his other famous flicks I ve watched very recently I completely understand why people say goodfellas is his best film and I do love that film but this is truly special Not only is the acting and directing phenomenal but I believe this film has slightly better pacing compared to Irishman or even king of comedy I think this has the best ending to any of his work and I think mark wahlberg gives a very underrated supporting performance Overall I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s and is truly a cinematic masterpiece,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5865043/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2007,"Tight, intense thriller",The best cast of the year 2007 makes this Americanized adaptation of an original Hong Kong film Internal Affairs shine William Monahan s adapted screenplay has been nominated for an Academy Award the film is nominated for best picture Scorsese for best director and there are a couple other nominations out somewhat inexplicably including Mark Wahlburg for supporting actor for his roles in this film Wahlburg s performance though excellent is really little more than a cameo and he has actually done better work e g his roles in The Yards and Perfect Storm But the Academy won t give him an Oscar for this especially since he is up against a few Academy favorites and a veteran Arkin While I do not think this is Scorsese s best film nor the best film of the year it is one of the finest serious crime thrillers I have seen in a very long time The film is set in Boston and relies on stereotypes of that city and its ethnic groups that only slightly detract from the film s believability Despite the fertile ground for psychological examination the film s slightly absurd pace DiCaprio becomes a trusted confidant of a crime boss in 3 4months the film is not a character study and rather relies on archetypes of good cop bad cop which are employed pretty consistently and to varying degrees throughout the film Leonardo DiCaprio gives a performance that exceeds his own high standards opposite Matt Damon in a life and death cat and mouse game DiCaprio is undercover for the police infiltrating organized crime Damon is undercover for an organized crime boss Nicholson infiltrating the police Vera Farmiga is excellent as the police psychologist who ends up connected to both Damon also gives a nice edgy though a little detached performance and stalwarts Nicholson Baldwin and Sheen do some of their best work in years The Boston accents only occasionally slip into exaggeration and surprisingly are only over done by actors who have lived in Boston The acting is generally outstanding The cinematography is above average there are too many straight pans and rhythmic fast cuts but the action is always well framed and nicely emphasized by the camera The direction is as with most Scorsese work tight economical and clean The script is excellent and in my opinion is likely to give Babel a run for its money for the adapted screenplay Oscar Contrary to some opinions I have seen here I did not feel that the soundtrack added much to the film In fact if I were to fault the film for anything it would be sound Excellent film well worth seeing if you can handle the nihilism and violence it portrays,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1597071/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2016,An impressive remake of the Hong Kong film trilogy 'Infernal Affairs',When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3499639/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2007,a good film but less compelling than Goodfellas,In Martin Scorcese s The Departed Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling moles working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law Di Caprio is Billy Costigan a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson Damon is Colin Sullivan a seemingly straight laced detective who in reality is a rat planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations The film a remake of the Hong Kong flick Infernal Affairs finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough talking ethnic gangsters although for once the Italians are let off the hook and urban violence In terms of box office receipts and year s end awards ceremonies the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director Yet for all the accolades it has garnered The Departed falls short of the Goodfellas glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom On the positive side Scorcese never one to stint on his performers has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion In addition to Di Caprio and Damon who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far the movie boasts Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic scenery chewing bad guy he s done countless times before but since nobody does that shtick better than he we don t mind watching it yet another time The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline as the parallel cat and mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion There s a near balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side One must credit Siu Fai Mak who wrote the original screenplay here skillfully adapted by William Monahan for much of the film s success Yet despite its many virtues of script and performance there seems to be something oddly lacking in The Departed a kind of unity and focus that turned Goodfellas into an instant classic of the gangster film genre The deliberately clipped editing which results in abrupt awkward transitions between individual scenes gives the film a self consciously hurdy gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama think back to how Sydney Lumet s managed that feat in The Verdict The story is interesting in and of itself but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters which is the last charge one could ever level against Goodfellas Moreover even the violence in The Departed is handled much less effectively than it was in Goodfellas In the earlier movie the violence and even the threat of violence was cringe inducing unsettling and disturbing with the Joe Pesci character in particular keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout but in The Departed the blows land with very little impact and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed garden variety action film Perhaps it s unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to Goodfellas a standard that let s face it very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of film making It s just that Scorcese set the bar so high for himself as well as for others with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product A good film but not a great one,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1604800/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,"Better than Infernal Affairs, but still more of a mess than it is a masterwork.",Unfortunately there are millions of people out there who will watched this movie with a positive bias as most believe that Martin Scorsese is utterly infallible but I am strictly in the middle with this director I know I am going to be totally controversial and perhaps SHOCKING when I admit that I really hated Goodfellas Now before you immediately vote against my review just please read on so I can explain myself I find Goodfellas to be one of the most ridiculously over rated movies in history along with DePalma s phenomenally misinterpreted pile of crap Scarface but I do LOVE Casino They are almost two sides of the same coin so you can see how I am split over Scorsese I saw the original Infernal Affairs a few years ago and I hated it too Yes some good moments but mainly an over wrought bore It s not because it is an Asian film as I often enjoy them but I just found it to be slightly inaccessible and alienating Scorsese s remake is easier to identify with but is also a whole 50 minutes longer The plot has undercover cop Leo Dicaprio infiltrate the Boston Irish Mafia in order to flush out a mole in the Police Department Matt Damon is that mole and his job is to flush out the undercover cop in the Mafia Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicolson play the respective bosses lawful and lawless Within this set up characters bounce back and forth off each other swearing shooting swearing and swearing Man this film is effing hardcore Sarcasm Asking Jack Nicolson to play evil is like asking a Rottwieler to bark It s what he does best Ooh but what about all the subtle nuances Come on it s an easy easy performance for someone like him and it s nothing you ain t seen him do before The best performance actually comes from Matt Damon closely followed by Mark Wahlberg if you ever had trouble telling the difference between them then don t see this movie The cinematography is ugly as sin Scorsese has gone for the same dull as hell color pallet of brown brown and dark brown he used in Goodfellas Yes I know this film is not supposed to be bright happy colors and blue skies But if the dank colors are supposed to reflect the gritty realism of the doomed plot threads then they totally contradict the perfectly set up camera angles I am not saying that this film could only have been shot in a Paul Greengrass style jitter but a little less and a little more of the former and latter could have set the balance straight And the plot is completely all over the place If you get into this movie you ll walk out of the cinema shocked and astonished which will make you forget about some things that simply don t add up Since I had already seen Infernal Affairs I didn t gasp at the ending when the rest of the audience sucked the air out of the cinema I was too busy trying to make sense of it all but you can t because there are too many holes in it Remakes are becoming more and more common these days and they are increasingly scoffed at even when they are really good such as Dawn of the Dead 2004 or Poseidon but as soon as apparently unimperfect Martin Scorsese does one most of you turn a blind eye to the fact that the film is near enough a shot for shot remake itself I don t think it took a great amount of talent to crank out a film like this And where the hell the 90 million budget went to is the REAL mystery But lads will love it The screening I went to was sold out to many groups of 10 or 15 guys and metrosexuals with their blonde girlfriends I am mentioning this because The Departed like 2004 s Crash is a film that philistines go to see because it makes them feel clever Sort of like penance for watching crud like When a Stranger Calls or The Fog I just wish that people would find THEIR OWN good movies instead of always choosing what everyone else likes Which is the only reason I can give for Goodfellas being so mysteriously well regarded Martin Scorsese is not the Mafia expert he thinks he is Boston is not his turf It s not a world I think he understands And the result is a cartoonish exaggerated shoot em up in which every character is lined up for the sole purpose of eventually being gunned down,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491381/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,A Disappointing Remake,Being Chinese I have already seen the original Hong Kong version a trilogy in fact Honestly I am very disappointed by Scorsese s remake Matt Damon s character does not seem to struggle in his double identity The ending of The Departed surprises me in a negative way It is really lame and dull compared to the original However it is not fair to evaluate The Departed by constantly comparing with the original Infernal Affairs trilogy I hereby turn my focus to The Departed as a movie of its own This is my first time watching a Scorsese movie He achieves a marvellous job in terms of directing the actions although they are excessive DiCaprio and Damon are very good in acting but the best actor has to be Jack Nicholson Playing Frank Costello Nicholson s facial expression and acting demonstrate the charisma of a gangster leader Scorsese does an excellent job on generating the tensions between characters too I did not want to leave my seat for the most part of the movie Damon used to be an altar boy at the church that Damon can see from his home s window He has then become Nicholson s mole in the Special Investigative Unit of Boston police It reminds me about Damon s past But if Damon has some struggles Scorsese ought to do a better job illustrating them I experience Damon s character to be naturally evil in The Departed The Departed probably has a different focus from Infernal Affairs The Departed comes across to me as an emphasis on the ones that depart after doing good works for the society Infernal Affairs emphasizes the tension between people s goodness and wickedness If this is the case the ending of The Departed makes very little sense I give it a 5 out of 10 mainly because of the poor ending In addition the actions well choreographed and foul languages are too much They become too unnatural as the movie progresses If you enjoy pure actions The Departed is worth watching But I recommend the original trilogy even more Infernal Affairs is miles better than The Departed,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494226/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2010,Haunting...,A remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs Scorsese s The Departed is a haunting film so effective that I still have a hang over of it Scorsese actually shatters himself by getting into a world of blood back stabbing and cruel intelligence For those who haven t seen this box office smash yet take time out from other non sense and watch this This Masterstroke takes place in Boston Massachusetts where Irish Mob boss Francis Frank Costello played by Nicholson plants Colin Sullivan played by Damon as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police Simultaneously the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan played by DiCaprio to infiltrate Costello s crew When both sides realize the situation each man attempts to discover the others true identity before being found out The original Hong Kong flick was a masterstroke And this is a true and best remake possible Scorsese has made so many remarkable films that I ve lost count by now He s at his fiery best and his executes the subject with tremendous ease A True Legend His biggest accomplishment was that He was finally respected by the Academy Awards for his work here Halleujah Michael Ballhaus s Cinematography is eye catching William Monahan s adapted screenplay is marvelous In the acting department Mark Wahlberg steals the show with a brilliant performance The rawness and overdose of abusive language help the talented actor steal the show in this multi starrer Jack Nicholson as always is flawless Leonardo DiCaprio is superb he lives his character from start to end Matt Damon is amazing as ever Martin Sheen proves yet again he s a talent that we ll never forget He s exceptional Alec Baldwin is in command after a long time The veteran scores Vera Farmiga is perfect Ray Winstone does full justice to his part Anthony Anderson leaves a mark as well The Departed is a winner all the way The film keeps you at grip from start to end and will leave you thinking about it for a long long time It s amongst the finest films ever made Two Big Thumbs Up,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2277801/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2007,Scorsese did a good job remaking an awesome movie,Most of the people who went to see the Departed didn t know anything about the movie Infernal Affairs A great Chinese movie part one of a trilogy that left viewers yearning for more cop thrillers like these Although no one actually thought of an US Remake But if you make an American version at least use a great director Which they did with Scorsese The story isn t exactly copied from the Chinese Original but you get many high points from the Original And some shock moments might not shock you as much as they did with people who haven t seen the Original Some roles are also changed here And here comes a funny fact it might be written here on IMDb somewhere that of one Jack Nicholson who changed his role and the script as they went along with the filming And even if his co stars didn t mind at least they didn t say otherwise Ballhaus cinematographer DP wasn t amused And it seems as if this incident like changing the whole set up for a scene just for Nicholson and lighting kind of everything just to be sure to have Jack s spontaneous outbursts on film causes Ballhaus considering not working with Scorsese anymore But that s just behind the scenes What matters is the result on screen And that is good enough to watch After reading the Oscar nominations one could feel that it might be Scorsese time And although it s not his best film he ever made Scorsese was overdue for an Academy Award I haven t said anything about the movie s plot because I think you should watch the Original for the full impact but only if you re not afraid or have prejudices against Chinese movies,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1652562/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2006,"Very disappointing; poor writing, hamminess sink it",Matt Damon is a sergeant in the Massachusetts State Police who s secretly working for Jack Nicholson s gang Leonardo DiCaprio is a former bad boy deep undercover in Nicholson s gang But whose side is each really on And will this end in anything but total major bloodshed The answer to the first question is Who cares to the second duh Like many people I went into this movie with high expectations but unlike most judging from the early returns I was pretty disappointed with the result Let s take a look at some of the good and bad points 1 Martin Scorcese directed it so I was expecting not only a lot of gunplay and a lot of profanity but a lucid screenplay I mean this is the guy who did Goodfellas for crying out loud which this movie should have closely resembled In case you forgot he also did Raging Bull and Mean Streets Now granted Scorcese didn t write the script but cmon He s got the clout to make changes to it on the set 2 Jack Nicholson is just all right I like Jack Who doesn t Seriously But nowadays he plays the same basic character no matter the role no matter if he s a Good Guy or a Bad Guy He s Jack Apparently Robert DeNiro was approached to play the role of Frank Costello but he was busy working on his own film The Good Shepherd So enter Smilin Jack and I dunno I think DeNiro would have been much much better 3 Profanity No I like profanity Love it Even gratuitously it s usually perfectly okay See for example the aforementioned Goodfellas But it seemed here that profanity was used merely to see how many times the f word and c word could be said in a movie After a while say an hour it quickly got tiresome sounding more like a high school locker room than anything else 4 Comic relief Who said there needed to be comic relief Someone must have thought so because we had not one but two comic roles Alec Baldwin s Ellerby and Mark Wahlberg s Dignan Okay they weren t there solely for comic relief but they were given funny lines that seemed wholly incongruous with the rest of the picture Instead of being a subtle change in direction you re expecting drama and they shift to comedy the result is jarring When the timing is right it works but more often than not I wondered what the actors were doing in the same movie as Nicholson DiCaprio and Damon 5 Damon and DiCaprio I ve never been a huge fan of either one although I ve like Damon s Bourne movies to a degree I think my primary complaint is that they both perpetually look about sixteen years old not the kind of persona you want in a purportedly gritty crime drama They both have more gravitas now than they did say ten years ago but still nowhere near enough to carry the heavy workload characterwise that this particular type of movie demands 6 Accents The setting is Boston and most of the leads are playing Irish Americans Damon who s from Massachusetts and DiCaprio sounded fine but Nicholson s Boston accent came and went it was usually absent come to think of it Like I said the screenplay didn t feel particularly tight it s as if the writers William Monahan and Siu Fai Mak just borrowed from all of the cop films of the past without providing any nuance to hold interest For example there was a subplot involving the girlfriend fianc e wife of Damon s character Why I m not saying we shouldn t know anything about her but she didn t seem to be much of an influence on Damon s character anyway so why bother with her Oh I see so that we could include a second romantic angle with her and someone else But why would we want that Bring on the guns bring on the cussin and ditch the romance it neither enhances the plot or titillates the audience Kristin Dalton who played the love interest in question didn t turn in much of a performance but I don t think she exactly had a layer rich character with which she could work Then there s the obligatory sex scene which should have felt erotic but came off as awkward as did the two yes two first date scenes Bah Here s a positive remark though Kudos to an on target performance by Martin Sheen as DiCaprio s boss Might be his best work in movies in years kind of an expanded version of his role in Catch Me If You Can also starring DiCaprio Another plus perhaps is the high body count Lots of death in this one and it s not just unknown extras who get whacked And the deaths are particularly gruesome at times bullets through the skull plenty of em leave huge splatters of blood on the back walls of elevators That sort of thing A loudmouth audience member to the left of me wailed that it was just like a Shakespeare play True enough because so many of the main characters of those tragedies were slain usually quite unceremoniously So maybe I m just a grump Maybe I ve reached the point where no movie can satisfy me particularly when I pay nearly ten bucks to watch it in a theater full of incredibly stupid and or rude people Maybe I m too jaded to appreciate true genius But I don t think so I think a year or so from now we won t even remember The Departed as anything more than a slight footnote to Scorcese s great

18 October 2006,Entertaining but Nothing Spectacular,For a movie over two hours long I felt like there was a lot missing A lot of the story felt rushed while at other times it felt like it was dragging The movie just seemed to fall flat despite all the talent assembled on the screen I don t know if it was the dialog or all the plot holes there are a lot of loose ends in my opinion I just always felt like I had a lot of interesting characters but I kept asking myself as I watched this film what the heck is going on How much got lost on the cutting room floor Maybe this film needed to be four hours I would like to see an unedited unrated director s cut or read the original screenplay for this movie It covers such a large span of time and seems to jump all over the place without neatly putting things together And the end seems like a desperate attempt to close off as many open plot lines as possible Entertaining yet frustrating I expected a lot more out of this film and I don t really feel like it delivered I recommend waiting for DVD,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1500705/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2007,Departed should have been DOA!,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1583641/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2022,In hindsight- basically a masterpiece,I didn t see this in cinemas when it came out but I ve watched it many times since then And as it got the Oscar people denigrated it and said it was Scorsese s worst film at the time I never agreed with that One thing is for sure this film is starting to look more and more like a masterpiece as time goes on while at the same time the quality of films in the streaming era just continues to plummet I m not going to bother going into the various things this film does well but sufficed to say you could do a lot worse than watch this for the 3rd 6th 10th time It s such a great ride I love it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8154431/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2006,Dreadful,Here we go again Another chapter in Scorsese s love affair with slimeballs Whether it be Italian or Irish he has an unreasonable fascination for the genre The central baddie is played by Jack Nicholson who does nothing but play Jack Nicholson He chews every piece of scenery with a reprise of the malevolence he exhibited in The Shining You would think that a director with the skills of Scorsese could control him But perhaps he didn t want to do so In any event his performance is operatic and intolerable Damon and De Caprio do well as do Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg but not well enough to make sense or meaning of an atrocious script Scorsese showed us that he can be skilled in material other than sewer trash with The Age Of Innocence Please Martin give this garbage a rest,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1497954/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2006,One of Martin Scorsese's finest movies. Period.,It s hard to start a review about a movie when you re still so excited you don t know where to begin Let s take a deep breath for a moment okay and here we go Although he was snubbed by the Academy over and over again Scorsese never stopped working on ambitious projects He just kept making movies and they were all solid and good Still somehow Scorsese s work lost the importance and the excitement of the director s best movies The Departed brings back a Scorsese that glues your eyes to the screen that makes you forget time and space around you This is a film that keeps you thrilled for the entire two and a half hours running time Truth be told Scorsese doesn t reinvent himself with this movie The violence the callous dialog and the soundtrack including Gimme Shelter and other classic songs from the 60 s and 70 s none of that is new territory Still it s a hell of a treat to watch the master at work There s no one who makes a gangster movie like Scorsese He understands exactly what the story needs how it needs to be paced Scorsese s direction serves the plot and not the other way round which is what sets The Departed apart from some of his other masterpieces such as Raging Bull Quite a lot of movieshave five six or seven top stars in their casting list In the end you re often let down because some of them don t really have important roles or only very limited screen time In this movie all of the big names make something of their role Mark Wahlberg as the amazingly unfriendly but unbribable cop Martin Sheen as Nicholson s opponent and DiCaprio s father figure Alec Baldwin as the frustratingly idiotic boss and Matt Damon as the slippery traitor The two actors that make The Departed what it is however are of course Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson is just Jack Nicholson He does what he always does which means that he s great He was born to play the bad guy It s quite amazing that he hadn t worked with Scorsese before and it s like a fanboy s dream come true to see their collaboration working out so well One can t help thinking What if DeNiro had played the part Sure that might have been interesting too but it s doubtable whether DeNiro would have been able to pull off a villain as clownish and sexed up as Frank Costello Speaking of DeNiro Leonardo DiCaprio clearly has proved himself a more than worthy successor as Scorsese s steady collaboration partner His performance as the tormented undercover cop is once again outstanding His hounded look alone creates half of the movies tension It s quite amazing how versatile this little babyface is The Departed should convince even the last skeptics of this guy s talents At the age of 64 and after movie classics as legendary and influential as Taxi Driver Raging Bull and GoodFellas Martin Scorsese has delivered one of the very best movies of his entire career Its characters may not be as iconic as the ones from the movies mentioned above but the superb storytelling and the amazing acting in The Departed make this nothing less than a true masterpiece It s Oscar time Baby,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1539916/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2009,No respect!,This remake of Internal Affairs a great movie in its own right adds a Whitey Bulger John Connolly Boston twist that just BEGS for brilliance it s a can t miss story line with a powerhouse cast However it s a huge disappointment Despite such compelling material Scorsese only skims the surface opting for gloss instead of substance adding confusing sub plots that serve mainly to hook the audience These sub plots destroy the momentum of the film and pull the whole thing off the tracks Without these no spoilers the film may have had a chance Scorsese s trademark violence stingers are now overripe at best Am I the only one who started to yawn when people were getting pounded over a loud soundtrack in Casino I doubt it There is some pretty silly ensemble work here too we re not talking Glenngary Glen Ross or The Usual Suspects here by any stretch Most of the bad highlights usually involve Wahlberg s profane fool of a character Overall the individual characterizations seem to be either shrill as in the case of the annoying Wahlberg and chest thumping Damon or flat like Sheen s police captain Nicholson s Whitey Bulger take is completely lacking in menace it s amusing if nothing else Only DiCaprio s brooding Billy Costigan stands out but he s got nowhere to go both literally and figuratively the sub plots basically turn his character to face the wall Much has been made of the ending here but I would describe it with one word cowardly I just couldn t respect this film much particularly in light of GoodFellas and other Scorsese masterpieces Overall 4 stars and only because it s him probably the worst best picture Oscar since American Beauty,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2098213/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,Certainly Up There with Goodfellas and Other Classics,Scorsese s faultless prosecution of Monahan s script with exceptional performances throughout promises masterclass cinema gold topped by brutal violence rats within the cops and gangster departments and razor sharp turns around the plot This is also sort of his remake of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs surrounding the concept of an undercover cop and a spy trying to figure out each other s identities while trying to infiltrate a gang It s very hard to point at one of the two films and call it better but if you re a fan of Scorsese s work The Departed is the one worth checking out first Directed with such talent and potential the camerawork and cinematography in each shot of this film is to perfection and alike some of his other big movies this film has an extended length of 2 and a half hours with each scene being very entertaining and plot holes being difficult to search for Sitting down concentrating properly and just watching the film is sensational on its own Not only is the plot very complex and compelling it s not a film you can watch lazily but it s filled with twists that you would never even see how the film could still function properly with them especially considering the events of final 20 minutes being absolutely shocking The cast is equally as phenomenal and as a masterpiece always does leads you to forget what s playing out is all staged Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover cop with Matt Damon as a disguised spy Jack Nicholson almost appearing as a criminal father figure towards the two and even Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga being so convincing in their supporting roles that they deserve their own credit If you liked this review check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8562639/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2020,Huh ?,After sitting through this lengthy story I came to its end with the realisation that I had hardly understood anything of what had been going on I was also quite sickened and gravely puzzled and more or less bored senseless Since the film had collected 8 5 points on this site I felt I must be going senile and that my next stop would be the funny farm Fortunately I then decided to check whether there had been any low star reviews and was delighted to find that there had indeed been a very large number of reviewers who had nothing whatsoever good to say about this film I m with them Perhaps it s because I m a committed un Catholic,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5716383/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2006,A gripping and unique crime drama about the duality of undercover work,I got to see a sneak preview of it and I must say the BEST film of the year so far Scorcese is at his best and truly deserves his anticipated first Oscar for this film Also notable are the performances of Matt Damon such a great bad guy he really must do stuff like this more often Leo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson as always and Mark Wahlberg best since Rockstar However some in the theater with me who had seen Infernal Affairs did say that Departed did not live up to the original I have yet to see Affairs but I honestly believe that Departed was pulled off well enough to really bring in some respectable awards in the upcoming season,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1489275/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2010,Sell-out!,In a society where being rich and famous is everything it s sad to see a former rebel succumb to his nation s core values Martin Scorsese decided being a celebrity with all the material trappings were what mattered most to him and dreadful films like Departed and Aviator are the result Perhaps Mr Scorsese can rationalize his admirable work on film restoration and figure he s doing his part for the greater good but I m not buying it In fact I no longer will see a film simply because Martin Scorsese is the director I wish he and Mick Jagger would take their champagne and yes men to France and leave the film and music making to more eager and less corporate fellows Also as much as I respect Roger Ebert s analysis and writings I can not take seriously his review of a Scorsese film Don t know if their buddies but if Scorsese directed The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh Ebert would give it four stars,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2216583/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2016,A terrific film. Always worth watching.,Has there ever been a film with a better cast than this I can t think of one Comment if you can The acting in this is amazing and every actor did their job I think this is Leonardo s best performance He did it so well and it was actually like he was the character and not actually performing The music is awesome Especially Shipping Up to Boston which is done by one of my all time favourite bands dropkickmurphys The song was the perfect choice for the film and they played it at just the right times The plot is ingenious and Scorsese directed it superbly This film even managed to be better than Infernal Affairs which is what this film was based upon I love the opening scene with Jack Nicholson s monologue and it really set the film for what was to come The film also had it funny moments thanks to Mark Walberg This film is extremely entertaining and I love the characters There is nothing to complain about in this film and I could and probably will watch this over and over again One of the best this century I was actually sad when this film was finishing because I didn t want it to end Acting 10 10 Dialogue 10 10 Plot 10 10 Characters 10 10 Entertainment Value 10 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3386650/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2006,What a Disappointment! .. The Departed Goes Actually Nowhere!,What a Disappointment The Departed Goes Actually Nowhere I m not saying the movie is awful but it isn t great yeah there s a big load of excitement but I think it is too big for the movie to handle it and most parts of the movie aren t even it is an OK at its best Martin Scorsese did cast a bunch of Hollywood s class A Actors and he was relying on the good performances that they could give to empower the movie but unfortunately they all were So So except for Mark Whalberg who gave an OK performance but his little role didn t give him a chance to do any better Leonardo DiCaprio s performance was bad disappointing so is Matt Damon Nicholson s performance is OK but not at his best What I miss in that movie is the depth I feel like if it is a cheap thriller movie with a great excitement but it makes no sense sometimes I felt that the movie is disconnected and not very solid When you read most of the reviews that praising the movie you feel that it is the movie of the millennium or of the year but actually The Departed goes nowhere it was going to be an OK thriller that you watch and forget about it the next day until the horrible ending blew up all the OK work Martin Scorsese did a great job on cinematography but he didn t give a depth to his exciting story I m a big fan of Scorsese s Martin Scorsese has directed great movies that we loved such After Hours Alice Doesn t Live Here Anymore Taxi Driver Raging Bull and Goodfellas I wouldn t call The Departed one of his best probably his worst I m not comparing the moving with any movies I even haven t seen Infernal Affairs It is an exciting thriller you will enjoy it but by the ending you will feel that you are lost in the middle of nowhere because of the lacking of the necessary minimum depth and it was just a stupid ending I highly doubt that the movie will receive any big nominations at the Oscars or any other big film awards That s what Hollywood dose to a movie it makes it only pretty pointless picture Overall it isn t a bad movie it is enjoyable most of the time watch it without high expectations and you will save the big disappointment,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1517041/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2007,"Scorsese got his Oscar out of sentiment, not for this embarrassment",Very very very disappointing given the all star cast I love much of Nicholson s work but in this he s not very believable as a crime boss Nicholson can certainly do the man in charge but not in this Leonardo is fairly believable although he seems to be working hard on looking sullen Damon is okay nothing special Sheen is fairly good but Wahlberg is awful Sheen has to pretend there s not a bad smell in the room when he s with Wahlberg We are to believe that his Dignan is expressing real emotion this is a real tough guy This story relies on so many twists to carry itself but the weakness of the characters and to some degree the plot is surprising I didn t hate it I just hated not seeing the performances I expect from these actors It was okay as late night entertainment but this thing won Oscars,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1775874/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2011,"One of the most overrated films of all time, but hey... when you got star power like this film had, who would dare say a bad thing about you?",Note This film has too many big named actors for me to list them according to their roles There is a such a plethora of characters in this film that they start to blur so I m only going to refer to character names for ease sake Actors you may recognize DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Vera Farmiga Alec Baldwin Synopsis In the beginning of the film we are introduced through montage and monologue to Frank Costello the ruthless crime lord of South Boston He preaches about power grabbing life by the reigns and about his general philosophy of the similarities between cops and criminals Next we are then thrown into another montage of Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan young cadets going through the police academy After they graduate we see that Colin is a straight A climb the ranks kind of officer but also a double agent working for Frank Billy on the other hand wants nothing more than to serve However as a man whose family history is littered with low life criminals he is stuck feeling a bit out of place Noticeably the black sheep of his family Billy is given a super secret top mission to fail out the Staties and instead work undercover infiltrating Frank s gang Billy thinks long and hard about his decision but in the end is persuaded by the father like figure Captain Queenan After a 20 minute long intro the movie begins as the two undercover operatives work on separate sides doing their best to conceal their dual identities In doing so there lives begin to morph and derange to the point they don t know if they re more cop or criminal The story is less to do with a singular event and more to do with when the two will be found out and gutted There is a thing about some military microchips being sold to the Chinese but that story abruptly ends mid movie The driving force of the movie is more about how Colin and Billy must maneuver bluff and lie their way out of trouble Both sides suspect a double agent among their ranks which increases the tension Madolyn is the on sight psychologist and while getting into a serious relationship with Colin she starts develop an attachment to Billy as their mandatory therapy sessions bring them closer Review First of all this movie is almost 3 hours long No movie should ever be that long unless it contains elements of fantasy or sci fi This film has so many stars and characters that instead of choosing who to focus on Scorsese gives screen time to EVERYONE It excessively gives moments of emotional development to Frank and Madolyn Yes Jack Nicholson plays a cool bad guy but he acts almost like a narrator spitting diatribe after another about cops foreigners and every other social intuition on the planet Why in a movie that has to deal with identity and suspense is there so much other stuff added There are themes about church race relations and about settling in your romantic life All things that are great and interesting but simply should have been set aside for another movie The cinematography is nothing special and in fact can be distracting at times best example is when Billy is being grilled by Wahlberg for his intent on making the force The camera gets a little movement happy constantly closing in on heads while they talk Although this film won for best editing I have to forcefully disagree with that recognition The film is adequately edited but in no way is the editing outstanding A well edited film has great pace which this film struggles with in its entirety It s a stop and go viewing experience with scenes ranging from a couple of seconds to five minutes Maybe it was purposely done that way to keep the audiences awake but you shouldn t have to sacrifice flow for attention Otherwise you re simply shaking the viewer to pay attention instead of enrapturing them The acting is pretty good but none of the performances other than Wahlberg s is something new DiCaprio mannerisms continues to be the same in almost everyone movie and only different thing about Matt Damon s performance is his accent The Departed is an American remake of the Hong Kong trilogy Infernal Affairs which is probably why I am being harder on this film than usual Also the premise of dual undercover characters has been done before the action film Face Off so I don t understand all the buzz this film has gotten Scorsese was a frontier shattering director and I loved his work in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver However The Departed is far from ground breaking cinema and the clearest example I know of success by name Who this film is not for People who don t like gangster cop films People with short attention spans,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2423043/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2007,Scorsese Doesn't Score in This One,It amazes me how the fact that a director has made his mark will cause him to garner praise from the movie going masses It s like all of those who stare at a white canvas with a black dot in the center an proclaim it to be masterful art Martin Scorsese used to be masterful at generating emotions through violence Lately all he seems capable of is generating yawns I watched the Gangs of New York for a second time a couple of months ago I felt like I was watching a National Geographic special There was nothing particularly special about it and Daniel Day Lewis s voice accent in it reminded me of Popeye Scorsese seems to love irritating accents The Departed is replete with a Massachusetts grate among the most annoying to me accents the English language possesses The movie is overlong and takes forever to get anywhere I loved Leonard DiCapprio in Titanic but after trying to watch this blubbering whale of an attempt at good cinema I kept thinking it would have been so much better if his career had stayed submerged Dicapprio Walhberg and Damon are all identical pieces of cardboard when it comes to acting and they are all the same type It s like putting Marilyn Monroe Jayne Mansfield and Anna Nicole Smith all the the same picture There s just no telling them apart The dialogue is flat The story moves at soap opera pace The cinematography is the opposite of John Woo If I hadn t been watching this at home on my wasted DVD purchase I would have walked out on it and I was almost tempted to regardless I remember I actually did walk out on What Lies Beneath years ago But here there is no beneath There are no layers Hey give me 90 million and I can make a film too So watch out Michael Cimino you have a contender for the Golden Raspberry Award because this film is a bowlful An additional note Yesterday I tuned in the last half hour of the Academy Awards and have mixed feelings about the fact that the Academy is apparently allowing those who are both blind and deaf to vote the best picture and best director Apparently all the sympathy votes for Scorsese finally came in Argh Gratia Artis,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1601816/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2006,Should have been better,Organized crime organized crime fighting Corrupt policemen and undercover agents They seem to be connected at the hip and this film plays with that from the start to the very last minute of it telling the tale of the actions of a FBI police combination fighting to bring a hotshot criminal down Apparently it is a remake of the Japanese film Mou gaan dou 2002 I have not seen that original but will be on the lookout for it now The Departed is intense A tad slow in the beginning and maybe a little too fast in the ending but I guess keeping a very good balance in a 150 minute film can be a very daunting task The most of it is rather interesting and builds a tension that runs somewhere until the last 15 minutes of the film but that is where it all fails For me the last 15 minutes of film feel glued to the rest but not really connected to that rest and that more or less breaks the film in half destroying its quality All in all A lot of good looking imagery good sound track nice story until just before the end of it Cut of 15 minutes and you ve got a thrilling good film 6 out of 10 dirty cops,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1558399/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2009,Yet another grossly inflated piece of directorial and actors' self-indulgence,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2088758/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2023,A Tale of Two Rats,I absolutely loved The Departed Excellent performances from Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio I didn t particularly care for Matt Damon but that has more to do with me not really liking his character I liked Leo s character a lot more This movie has the viewer navigating through all of the lies and deception It plays out almost like a thriller where the audience is kept in suspense at all times over when certain characters are going to be clued in on vital pieces of information It s the game of cat and mouse that both of the main characters play with each other that s very exciting to me And both characters revolve around the sick and twisted actions of Jack Nicholson s character The I smell a rat scene is so good Definitely a recommended viewing from me It s spectacular and easily one of Scorsese s finest films,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8979877/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2007,"Good film, but certainly NOT Scorsese's best...",THE DEPARTED is a long and intriguing film where opposite rival bands infiltrate each other to gain inside scoop info The guys who do the infiltration are Matt Damon doing the bad guy on the good side and Leonardo DiCaprio vice versa The story develops slowly and you have to pay close attention to all the minor details because so much is given that you might lose some info The bad guy of the story Jack Nocholson doesn t appear to be all that mean and bad In fact you don t feel much for any of the characters except maybe for DiCaprio s This aside the movie moves at a fair pace although the beginning is a bit slow By the time the movie s over you hardly notice what s going on This is a finely crafted movie big budget and stuff and a fine Martin Scorsece film but in my humble opinion don t think it deserved a best movie award I think most of you out there will agree with me that Scorsece has done way better in the past TAXI DRIVER CASINO GOOD FELLAS RAGING BULL etc I think the Academy felt so wrong and sorry for not awarding ANY of his past movies that they just had to give him an award this time around Having this said THE DEPARTED isn t a bad movie by any terms But it is certainly not Scorsese s best,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1628430/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,"Average Scorsese - which means it's still a fine film, just not one of his best",Scorsese s long awaited remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs Infernal Affairs was a good film but it always seemed to me like a gimmick and more like a skeleton of a film than a real film Scorsese predictably fleshes it out so it doesn t seem as much like just a good concept The actors add a lot to it too though the Hong Kong actors including Andy Lau and Tony Leung were very good as well I don t think it stands anywhere near Scorsese s best work myself It doesn t carry near the weight of Goodfellas for instance It starts to get a little silly near the end and the director makes a few really bad choices especially including that awful image in the final shot That s just plain embarrassing film making And that s not to mention the awful choice the filmmakers made to change a certain part of the ending of Infernal Affairs the original is definitely stronger in that respect Of the actors my favorite was Mark Wahlberg Matt Damon comes in second and DiCaprio third Nicholson has a lot of fun as the gangster The best comparison with previous Jack performances is actually the Joker from Burton s first Batman movie Alec Baldwin has probably the most memorable moment where he expresses his love for the Patriot Act Well worth seeing but definitely not best of the year material I would rank it quite below Scorsese s previous two films from this decade The Aviator and Gangs of New York,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493316/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2009,Don't understand the hype,I know everybody is crazy about this movie But just because everybody switches sides on each other doesn t make this a deep movie How did Nicholson not know that DiCaprio s character was a cop He acted so nervous and it was obvious But you know what I didn t know what anybody was supposed to be by the end of the movie either Way too confusing To me this movie was boring complicated and nothing amazing Definitely doesn t live up to all the hype it gets One thing I did like was Nicholson as a mob boss I thought it was a cool role for him Otherwise I just didn t get this movie If you re like me it will leave you scratching your head,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2023570/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,Departed From Good Film-making,The Departed a gangster flick with a twist is one of the biggest disappointments to date The film was overly laced with foul language that would make a sailor blush extremely violent and overly witty something that I can look past if the story is there but The Departed was all over the map The dialog was forced and without life The story was predictable The direction was static And the writing well let s just say I ve read crossword puzzles that were more interesting The only reason I can see why this movie was ever made is that Jack Leo Matt Alec and Mark said they would do it And the only reason they said they would do it is because Scorsese was directing and they trusted him He let them down This film has one thing going for it It won t be in theaters too long Don t bother renting the DVD either,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493516/?ref_=tt_urv

29 February 2008,Masterpiece,Departed The 2006 out of 4 I went and saw Martin Scorsese s latest film today and afterwards one thing jumped into my mind and that was the word masterpiece From the time I first got on the internet I ve always told people they shouldn t label a film a masterpiece for at least 10 15 years so you could see how a film would sink into you However I guess I m going to have to break my own rule because I thought this film was absolutely flawless and it s certainly the greatest thing I ve seen in a very long time I had a top ten of this decade but this here jumps right at 1 I was a major fan of Scorsese s previous two films but this one here is vintage Scorsese I really feel sorry for those who have to pick Oscar winners because this film is full of possible nominees DiCaprio once again turns in a super performance and Matt Damon gives the best performance I ve ever seen from him Jack Nicholson is someone you can always expect greatness from and he delivers here again but it was great seeing a great performance from him outside of a romantic comedy As with Scorsese this legendary teaming has Nicholson doing vintage work I m sure Nicholson will get a Supporting Actor nod but you could also throw in Damon Mark Wahlberg Adam Baldwin and even Martin Sheen In most Hollywood films the movie would spend too much time with Damon and DiCaprio but I thought it was a brilliant move to make this thing more of an epic and give all sorts of character detail to the supporting players Sheen really shines the most and I d probably give him a nod before Nicholson I haven t seen the film this is based on so I m not sure how much is the same or how much is different but I felt Scorsese grabbed you from the very start with Nicholson s narration cut to a beautiful camera shot and then of course The Stone s Gimme Shelter Seeing the rise of Damon s character through the division was something else that really worked and I personally feel the film could have told more of his story at the start When the two eventually get undercover I thought Scorsese showed his master s touch again Most Hollywood films would have just set up several bang bang scenes but this one here carried the suspense throughout Little by little plot developments would occur and little by little Scorsese would build the suspense I was a little worried about the 150 minute running time but the way everything was moving this here could have been doubled in length and still worked just as good No spoilers here but I thought the ending was brilliantly played out I can t remember the last time I watched a movie and thought it was over only to be hit upside the head with a complete and utter shock where I was asking myself if something really happened,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1830762/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2006,An actor's extravaganza,With this remake of the Hong Kong actioner Internal Affairs Scorsese makes his mark again with a gripping crime saga in the vein of GOODFELLAS 1990 and CASINO 1995 This time he ventures into what must be somewhat less familiar territory for the director the Irish milieu in South Boston but screenwriter William Monahan is a Boston native and seems to know his targets inside out The cast is to die for with a line up of almost exclusively A list actors First there is Jack Nicholson as Jeff Costello a reference to Alain Delon s character in Jean Pierre Melville s 1967 classic LE SAMOURAI a psychotic Irish crime boss Jack Nicholson simply doesn t give bad performances but here his performance borders on caricature but somehow he manages to check it in such away it remains acceptable Perhaps Scorsese should have toned him down a little but who can control Jack Nicholson Who wants to Perhaps over the top but hugely entertaining Perhaps he is the only actor who can get away with this The rest of the cast is simply outstanding with Leonardo DiCaprio in a very impressive role as Billy Costigan an undercover cop infiltrating Jeff Costello s gang Matt Damon as sergeant Sullivan is somewhat more one note but it seems to fit his role just right Perhaps he intended it this way Mark Wahlberg is very amusing as the most twisted hostile and foul mouthed cop in recent screen history On a credibility level the film put me to the test a couple of times Why is Jeff Costello who runs multi million dollar drug transports still collecting protection money in person from Pakistani shop owners The sub plot with the delivery of microprocessors to the Chinese for the fabrication of advanced weaponry was truly laughable especially the encounter between Nicholson and his cronies and a Chinese gang in leather jackets It looked like a scene from a grade Z 80s action flick At times the setting in the film plays more like the 70s despite the very 2006 cell phones that play such a crucial role in the film they almost grow into a character of their own This must be the film with the most close ups of cell phones so far In South Boston all little Irish boys seem to grow up as cops or criminals I am not sure whether this film should be seen as a realistic depiction of the Boston crime world In the core it probably is but it s more a like a mixture of 70s values clothes and family ties with some modern elements thrown in the mix Irish blokes standing in front of a restaurant with their caps and all I don t know Somehow it seems more like a throwback to another age Or perhaps in some places like South Boston things never change But probably that s the whole point Scorsese always presents us an over inflated dreamworld where in the end every person runs wildly amok With Scorsese bad guys are not just bad guys They are out of control monsters whether it is Jeff Costello in this film or Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS or CASINO they all have an almost comic book flair which doesn t make em any less interesting On the contrary after all this IS the movies The truth is no excuse Often the imagination is far more interesting I still have to chew a little on this but this film is quite an overwhelming experience One of those films that was already a classic before it came out Besides some of the aforementioned reservations these still were a dynamite 149 minutes Camera Obscura 8 10,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1523995/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2007,"I departed, and so did everyone else",This film should be rated for language not suitable for any age I saw it in Argentina At the cinema there was one showing a day at 11 45pm and there were stern warnings that only adults could buy tickets The language was so coarse and untranslatable that the audience gave up and left I was the last to leave eerily watching the images continue on the screen in front of an empty room I did discover that nearly all the characters were lying to each other so it did not really matter that we could not understand what was being said Upon my return to the US I saw that the DVD is available and is labeled not authorized for sale or rental outside the US and Canada If only that had been the general policy for this film we would not have exported such an embarrassment for US culture and especially for the City of Boston and Massachusetts State Police In Spanish the title of the movie is Los infiltrados which does not have the meaning of departed but everybody in the theater joined the departed anyway,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1646179/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2015,A cat and mouse game done at it's finest.,An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston Let me start off with saying that this is my favorite movie no doubts about it the movie starts out slow with it s LONG intro but picks up and never breaks pace I normally hate pace breaking in movies so this is already a big in my book the story is interesting to watch as Dicaprio and Damon struggle with their identities while Jack Nicholsen has some fun as the bad guy This movie has a great plot cast music score length and almost all elements of movies possible such as drama comedy action crime thrills and suspense and many more The Departed is a great movie and should be recognized as one I find nothing wrong with it maybe the lack of female characters but it ain t that bad,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3383425/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2007,"Good, but Overrated",From what I had heard The Departed was supposed to be an amazing flick but it really ended up being just a little above average I was one of the big supporters of the film at the beginning I had people all around saying That looks so bad but I knew it looked like a great movie How can you possibly go wrong with a cast consisting of Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nickolson and Mark Wahlberg First off the performances were probably what made this movie If not for the sensational acting The Departed just would not be worth watching Leonardo was great as the lead and Jack Nickolson was classic as the crime boss Matt Damon was good but he didn t really play that big of a part until the very end However the performance that really stood out here was that of Mark Wahlberg He REALLY proved he can act here with an incredibly memorable character The plot felt like something new and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie However I had many issues with the film For one the ending made me want to throw up One of the worst endings to a film I ve ever seen Secondly there were just too many plot elements that were left wide open and many things that were never given any explanation whatsoever The Departed was good but if you want to see an amazing crime movie stick with Alpha Dog Alpha Dog is underrated so you won t really know what to expect,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1596225/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2012,Love It When a Plan Comes Together,Yea that s right I made an A Team reference regarding The Departed Despite the quality differences between these media stories this film went exactly as planned So when Brad Pitt and his production company Plan B decided to help remake a Chinese classic they decided to go all out Aside from getting the great Martin Scorsese on board to direct and William Monahan to write an excellent script they felt like it wasn t enough They hired Leo and an All Star cast that could only be matched by a corny romantic comedy Valentine s Day Then as they say the rest worked out itself The acting was superb with Leo leading the way along with Mark Wahlberg Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson not far behind Not to mention the ten other actors who did their jobs well and when it was all said and done Mr Scorsese didn t get denied and he finally won his Oscar Plus he found his new De Niro with Leo and with this and Shutter Island the future looks bright as long as Scorsese is still kicking,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2723734/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,scorsese's winner,The Departed offers you one of the best stories of mafia Certainly the best combination of mob and police in the same movie There are many good mafia films but this one sticks out because of its great usage of police The value of this movie does not shrink to the fact that the film is mostly a remake to the Hongkong movie The value is based how this one has been done I gotta tell you it s pretty damn high And the reason behind that is Martin Scorsese He absolutely nails this film He like Francis Ford Coppola has a special eye for a mob films And quite simply this is his finest product Leonardo DiCaprio Billy is one the best actors around He is always so good Never seen him underperformed He gives a great shot here too Jack Nicholson Frank is always reliable Matt Damon Colin was good But Mark Wahlberg Dignam was most impressive Quite a performance from him Very confident In overall it s just a first class cast The Departed is perfect film for a movie night It s intense has plenty of action great story and great performances Plus there are two huge bonuses First one the movie comes about Boston which is a great city Second one the movie has an awesome soundtrack which many films do not have It has everything a winner should have,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2366752/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,Pathetic remake of a masterpiece,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448238/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2020,Good movie but story paces at a slow rate,The movie is about two rats trying to find out who is the rat That s it that s the plot Now wait until 2 5 hours to watch how the story unfolds Script is lackluster and struggles to grasp audience attention at times The movie builds up slower but it becomes interesting in the middle the majority of main scenes are in the last 45 minutes of the movie so much is happening in them that its kind of overwhelming Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon gave satisfactory performances in their respective roles The story is weak and too many scenes seems too dramatic Also the role of Damon s wife seems out of place it feels like her scenes were forced in rather than having an actual relevancy to the storyline If you re a DiCaprio fan then go ahead you ll love it but don t expect too much out of it,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5793980/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2006,Good but it's being over-rated,Okay yes it s a good movie Interesting script loaded with good actors and nicely directed But I read one reviewers remarks that said to forget Goodfellows and Raging Bull as this is Martin s finest work To him I say 2 things 1 put down the pipe 2 step away from the keyboard Goodfellows is still the definitive Mob movie The Godfather being the definitive Mafia film and there is no movie ever made that rivals the visual style that Raging Bull brought to the screen To me The Departed is a movie about corruption I never felt any sense of organized crime it was more like organized chaos Characters are never developed or made memorable thats all sacrificed to make more room for showing how intense the movie is suppose to be Maybe because 2006 was such a lackluster year this will get more praise than its due I enjoyed it for what it offered and will leave it at that I think Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon were fine but it was Leonardo DiCaprio that gave the best performance Since Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar for Best Director he will probably be given the lead to win it come next Spring Even though I see nothing here that he hasn t done better in other films Once again its good just not as good as it s being touted,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1500287/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2007,"A testosterone-fuelled turn, The Depahted",Two newly graduated police officers Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio and Colin Sullivan Matt Damon are hired by the Massachusetts State Police one to simultaneously infiltrate the Irish mafia lead by the colourful Frank Costello Jack Nicholson and one to investigate leaks within the bureau Their respective tasks parallel each other at all times but they never meet Cue intrigue en masse coated with tense cat and mouse games and green and white Irish culture in Boston making The DepAHted something of a Goodfellas lite This is essentially all that is achieves For a Best Picture nominee The Departed lacks heart and makes up for it by trafficking in violence suspense and swearing The aforementioned naturally gets it a long way with most people and indeed even with me but since Martin Scorsese is incapable of making a film shorter than two and a half hours the substance stretches thin I m no math whiz but things simply do not add up to a complete film Much like in Goodfellas The Aviator and Gangs of New York Scorsese gets so taken with the setting and atmosphere that he positively dawdles on scenes and the majority of these serve no other function in the story than to get us a feel for the way and the venality with which things are run The acting by contrast is actually good Jack Nicholson may simply be rehashing his psycho Jack routine but it works as well as ever and he chews scenery whenever he is on screen Leonardo Dicaprio inhabits something of a lead role in the film but his acting regimen consists of shouting as loudly as he can Billy Costigan is a difficult character to capture the nature of for he is both contradictory and confused jockeyed between the Irish mafia and his allegiance to the police department Matt Damon s slick character Colin Sullivan is a joy to watch as he rises faster than a twelve year old s dick in his career but much credit is also due to Mark Walhberg s streetsmart Dignam who is given some excellent and brilliantly funny dialogue in the script such as the latter observation about Sullivan The only problem is that he is at the mercy of a grossly underwritten character The big problem that The Departed has is that its story rotates around genuinely unlikeable anti heroes I m not even sure if they d qualify as heroes for these are characters with good qualities that are so distant that you need binoculars It is difficult to slot them in protagonist antagonist positions because while Sullivan is corrupt and selfish he is funny charming and we follow him from childhood Costigan by contrast lacks all the enjoyable theatricality of his polar character and comes across as whiny moody and desperate in his actions but certainly he is morally right in the film and quite firmly on the side of good in spite being taken under the wings of Nicholson the mob boss himself Without likable characters a wide array of problems follow but the direction pace and action of the film cleverly mask most of these Who cares that all women are hookers often literally Who cares that these is product placement by the bucketload And who cares that the ending is one huge mess The fact is that Martin Scorsese knows how to craft a compelling film and much of this expertise has translated into an enjoyable crime cop drama with Boston accents and slang that snap and crackle like kindling in a fireplace Ultimately the actors sing tunes we have all heard before and the story may be intricately sketched but we have been down this road before so this is nothing revolutionary And where pray tell is the tracking shot 7 out of 10,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1581648/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2011,Poor execution ruined this.,I expected a lot from this movie based on its high IMDb rating and big names on both side of the camera but it just didn t work Most it comes down to lazy execution average acting directing and script writing from people you expect better This movie should have been a tense mole hunt thriller but there was no attempt to give the viewer any suspense There were no surprises and no reason to care about the fate of any of the characters As if that wasn t enough the soundtrack did nothing to help the atmosphere of the movie and the ending was rather unsatisfying I wouldn t go so far as to recommend avoiding this movie just don t expect anything great Not a patch on the Hong Kong original,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449179/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2010,A great plot that spirals out of control,The Departed is very instructive in showing us how to write a crime thriller and how not to It starts with a terrific premise cops and criminals have a mole in the each other s organization But this is also a premise that is loaded with pitfalls In the Great Screen writing Class I talk extensively about how you develop your premise to learn not only the potential strengths of your idea but also the hidden structural weaknesses In The Departed the writers must immediately confront the difficulty of two main characters Again the need to cross cut between two leads first takes a toll on the definition of the characters The writers are so interested in getting the plot going they fail to give Billy played by Leonardo DiCaprio a motive for going undercover As the story progresses it becomes clear that no one in this movie has a motive for what they do Lack of character motive which is connected to the first major structure step the Need is always a big weakness But in a story already dominated by plot this is a disaster The characters are nuts and bolts being moved by plot mechanics The premise does highlight the strength of The Departed which is the plot But it also shows us how even the best plot can spiral out of control Plot in crime stories is all about opposition under the surface and The Departed is worth studying to see how to create that not only in a crime story but in any work of fiction But when you are creating your plot you have to be aware of the fundamental trade off between plot and believability The more you try to hide the opposition under the surface thus giving you more plot the more you push the believability of your characters to the extreme You become so conscious of creating surprise that you force the characters to take actions that they and indeed no human being would logically do This believability problem surfaces right away when Billy who has been to the police academy becomes the mole in the Costello crime family It would be so obvious that this guy is the snitch that I was immediately reminded of Clark Kent and Superman Somehow when Superman puts on a suit and a pair of nerdy glasses no one can see that he is Superman In a fantasy superhero story the audience accepts that convention and lets it pass Not so in a realistic crime story The writers keep the believability problems at bay for most of the story But any story that emphasizes plot always pushes the reveals to the end where whatever believability problems it has will be magnified as the reveals come fast and furious Sure enough The Departed rapidly disintegrates into farce and stupidity The final sequence is filled with reveals and assassinations but they are based on actions so mindlessly dumb that the audience is left muttering No No No Even worse this sort of false plot sprung at the end kills the audience s sense of investment in the film itself If it s so easy to assassinate these characters why didn t they just shoot Costello in the first place and save me 2 1 2 hours of my time FOR MORE REVIEWS please go to www truby com,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2187587/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2006,Dark and brutal.Scorsese's most accomplished and entertaining film to date.,One could look at The Departed and can get the idea that this is less a remake than it is a re imagining of the riveting crime Drama INTERNAL AFFAIRS It s more of an inspiration than it is a direct lift off The story may be the same but there s a vast difference between Scorsese s epic and the Hong Kong Classic And for that this film is truly a fascinating look at the ugly worlds of the two sides of the law Rookie Cop Billy Costigan goes undercover and is assigned to work for Crime Boss Frank Costello and get really close to him to deliver some information about his crimes Costigan gains Costello s trust and gets involved a lot deeper in his crimes On the other hand a rising police office is actually a mole in the department informs everything about the Police Department s movements to Costello But things get deadly when both men are about to have their secrets exposed and the Mobs and the cops discover that there is a mole informer and a traitor who s getting things messed up on both sides And then they both try to save themselves from each other and the Mobs They slowly get confused with their dual identities and things get deadlier for the both of them as their delicate balance with the Mobs and the Cops gets them too involved with the world they re into While both men are in love with the same women one of them has to suffer the consequences Leading to a shocking conclusion to this epic There are intense scenes of violence and action and twists that you never see coming A Martin Scorsese film is always dark graphically violent raw hard edged and filled with memorable powerhouse performances And this film is no exception The Departed is something new and different Its complex plot unfolds to an even more powerful story with characters colliding with one another and facing terrifying situations Scorsese shows that what it is like to be a cop Your life is in danger 24 7 and that every minute is a risk when you re undercover Your only fear is having your true identity be exposed And then it s all up to the person who s holding a gun to your face It s a tough film he carved out and to be honest it s a perfect example of how a remake should be made It s actually as good as the original even better at times And shows that when it is helled by a legendary director who knows what he is doing the results are always great for a remake To compare the original and this one I would say this one is slightly better than the original Otherwise it s just as brilliant as the Hong Kong version But the thing about this film is that even if you ve seen the Hong Kong version you ll still be blown away by the Hollywood version However comparisons are inevitable What else can you ask for when you have a cast this big I could only recall one such film that had such a huge cast at the moment and that was Ocean s 11 Where that film didn t do full justice with its cast this film makes use of its actors and gives you a rare piece of entertainment that is thought provoking and ingenious Scorsese really have given a great piece of work I wouldn t say this is his best work ever his best directed film was GANGS OF NEW YORK which he should ve won an Osacar for but it certainly is one his best work since Goodfellas in the crime genre It s got the usual trademarks of the director The script is fantastic The writer has done a terrific job in this remake It makes the film a standout from the original Rich CinematographyThe cinematography is rich and the editing is sharp The Score is superb Scorsese s choice of music is great And the look of the film and its sets are brilliant getting us old and new Boston And lots of cell phone use Well you re wondering who s the show stealer out of a giant cast like this Everyone got to do something with full satisfaction But the real standout here is Di Caprio and Damon The actors have only gotten better and better recently and here they pull it off again They are complex and tough characters to play and they play their part brilliantly Di Caprio s emotional stature is strong He manages to bring the character s fear and confusion with full conviction You do feel sad in the end for what happens to him You will be shocked and it was unfair for the character Damon on the other hand is superb as the mole who informs the crime bosses Their face off and rivalries are intense and suspenseful And of course Jack Nicholson couldn t have had more fun doing a film like this than doing another sad comedy His and Scorsese s collaboration is another reason altogether a different reason to watch this film At this age he could still pull off juicy performances and do all that he s done on screen really makes you wonder if he s ever gonna do another film with Scorsese again And his over the top performance is really fun to watch Wahlberg is great in his role as the tough cop who talks tough to his co officers Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are both terrific Vera Farimiga was a real surprise as a women who falls in love with both leading men She plays her part really well and you kind of feel sad that why didn t she chose the character that deserved her Of course this film is not without its flaws and I expected it to end with a bang whereas the writer seemed to have abandoned the script s energy and just concluded it somewhat like the original film It was an uneven conclusion And I just wasn t sure why was it necessary to do what the writer did to the main characters in the end But regardless of that the rest of the film is a tour de force raw drama A modern classic and a definite must see of the year This film can count on its chances of being at the Oscars next year A sure fire success The Departed is the most exciting fun and thrilling dark crime Drama of the year And it s fully satisfying and very entertaining Highly

1 December 2006,Inferior Remake,This film should have just been called Infernal Affairs Slightly different ending All the ranters and ravers of how glorious a film this is are those obviously oblivious to the existence of the far superior Hong Kong original I ll admit I m a huge fan of most of Scorsese s other work was highly anticipating this release but upon watching this I was hugely disappointed so much so that I almost fell asleep the only other times that has happened was during the remake of The Wicker Man enough said there Advice for anyone who has not seen this would be see the original pray Hollywood doesn t make a sequel,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1534403/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,Inferior remake,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491415/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,"Good, but it lack the resonance of Scorsese's more notable works.",I watched The Departed the day after it s general release While watching I tried to set aside thoughts of the move it s a remake of Infernal Affairs aside to be able to assess the movie clearly Now I haven t seen Infernal Affairs in a while so this wasn t too hard to do however since I was privy to plot foreknowledge nothing was all too surprising Since I d lived in Boston for three years it was quite a treat to get to see that city again well some of it wasn t Boston but enough of it was The presence of the Yankee accent was okay although I honestly wished that some of the less successful users had just gone without the accent altogether because having it come and go sort of dropped me out of believability at times There are enough long time Boston natives that don t have it that it wouldn t be weird for someone to lack the accent Almost all of the performances were overwhelmingly solid At times Nicholson and Baldwin seemed to go a little too over the top but it was forgivable The direction was canny careful and generally nuanced Scorsese has always been an able director of actors and pulled out performances and matched it with an eye for visual that s both invisible yet entirely specific at the same time I did have some issues with the film First of all Nicholson s character got too much screen time He s not the emotional center of the film and a lot of what we see of him throughout the film may do a fine job of characterizing him as a badass devil man but we get that at the start We need to focus on DiCaprio and Damon s characters and their stories they are the centerpoint to the film adding in all this excess Jack actually detracts from the film The film s already a little bloated running 2 5 hours so a little chopping of extraneous scenes would ve been good The ending was another problem It all came a little too fast and was a little ridiculous causing the audience to burst out in laughter when Scorsese should ve taken a little care to lead the emotions to that point And then there s also the groan inducing last shot that really just took the ridiculousness of the end over the top So what needed to be done to the ending More attention needed to be paid to the moles Towards the end of the film DiCaprio s Billy comes across as wanting out so much that there s little motive for him to do what he does The lack of motive leads to a lack of believability I think focusing a little more on Billy and how the life of crime is breaking him down would ve helped the drama especially towards the end This also goes for Damon s Colin The impact of the life of being a good guy on his life really should ve played a bigger impact The events towards the end partially don t make sense because there s not enough motive for him to do what he does with Jack s Costello Since his characterization breaks down towards the end the finale just doesn t have a whole lot of resonance This movie really needed to be more about these two characters even with the intricate plot That s where the core of the drama should ve been focused but the attention of the film was spread too thin to allow the end to be convincing Now I m going to start comparing with Infernal Affairs The encapsulation of the two female characters from Infernal Affairs into one had a lot of potential In IA the female characters seemed less whole Unfortunately the Departed doesn t give her enough attention to pull any real drama This is made worse by some cheap dramatics thrown in via a photograph and made a little ridiculous by the change in relationship between her and Billy which wasn t really believable based on her characterization Although I liked Walhberg s performance his character wasn t necessary The only reason for Dignam to even exist is to create the American ending This is where Infernal Affairs manages to get it better It better crafts a relationship between Leung s Chan DiCaprio s Billy and his police boss the boss is the only one who knows and so when the later events occur it s that much more devastating and gives sufficient motivation for Chan Billy to do what they do in the finale It also prevents the believability hole that Billy wouldn t seek Dignam after those events And this is another place where Infernal Affairs shines the focus on the two moles The movie really explores how pretending to be someone else can affect the way someone thinks and behaves Chan is just as desperate as Billy to get out but Chan also keeps a better eye for justice despite his problems Likewise Lau s character Damon s Colin has to grapple with the life afforded him by being a goody two shoes and figure out just where his loyalties lie and why This leads Infernal Affairs ending to be more effective than the Departed s because it s not cheap and the impact of Lau s decision weighs with him even after the credits roll No one laughs at the end of Infernal Affairs The Departed doesn t have Infernal Affairs flash and bang but that works to its advantage it s restraint at least stylistically really helps what drama it has Having come from a long tradition of Hong Kong films the style pushes melodrama at times in IA All complaints aside The Departed really is still quite an enjoyable film The craftsmanship of all involved is highly polished and immensely engaging Even though they share the same base Infernal Affairs and the Departed are both different films although they could ve learned something from each other The Departed is really good but it lacks the resonance needed to bring it to the level of Scorsese s more notable works 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492569/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,"What the f... is it with all the f..ing swearing in this f..ing boring, slow, confusing f... movie??",At the time of watching The Departed I never realized it was a remake of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs I didn t find Infernal Affairs captivating or memorable Instead I found it slow and confusing The same applies to The Departed slow and confusing but in this case also quite boring The film jumps around A LOT in the beginning I thought this was simply to tell Colin Matt Damon and Billy Leonardi DiCaprio s back stories but this erratic and scrambled editing continued throughout the movie I mean honestly who the heck edited this film The dialogue is ridden with so much unnecessary swearing and with all the confusion I almost stopped watching less than 30 minutes into the movie I should have All the swearing made for a very unpleasant watch There hardly was a scene with less than about a dozen swear words or so The Departed might be an all star cast but I honestly didn t like ANY of the character and therefore rooted for NO ONE There was not a single likeable character here I didn t like the neo noir style narration either In fact come to think of it I didn t enjoy ANYTHING about this movie Being slow boring and overlong this is the kind of movie critics love As for me no thanks I was not entertained I mean what the bloody hell was it actually all about And then comes that what the f k ending What a terrible waste of time The best thing about this bore fest was when the credits rolled Being the 39th highest rated movie of all time on IMDB there must be something wrong with ME for not liking this multi award winning film But by golly this is so not my kind of movie Would I watch it again Once was torture enough so definitely no,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8844125/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2019,A Knockout,The Departed is arguably the greatest cop movie ever made and certainly one of the best movies of the 2000s period What Scorsese did with this movie was masterful he took a perfectly good crime thriller the original Infernal Affairs and elevated it even higher to become a saga of class race betrayal and families always rising and falling in America The Departed is one of the most hard edged dramatic and gripping movies that I ve ever seen with a multi layered story that keeps you coming back to the film again and again I love the central premise which takes classic Scorsese tropes like Catholic guilt and ethnic identity and fuses them with true crime history Frank Costello after all is based on Boston s infamous Whitey Bulger On a technical level this movie is outstanding the direction musical score and cinematography are amazing but nothing is more impressive to me than the editing Thelma Schoonmaker well deserved the Oscar for Best Film Editing on The Departed which might not have been half as good if not for Schoomaker s past pacing and experimental style As always in a Scorsese picture the performances are phenomenal everyone from Leo DiCaprio to Martin Sheen is on their A game in this one Though by far my favorite performance is Jack Nicholson as Costello he brings together humor sleaze and menace simultaneously and it makes for a truly terrifying villain The decision to set the film in Boston where the movie s rich themes are deeply ingrained in the city s history was brilliant The casting of real life Bostonians such as Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg and the choice of Dorchester s William Monahan as screenwriter gives The Departed an authenticity that many other Boston set movies lack After watching this movie again I ll say that I do have a slight problem with the running time you do sometimes feel the movie s two and a half hour length and there s a handful of scenes that could either be cut down or removed entirely But it by no means ruins the viewing experience in fact despite its length The Departed remains endlessly entertaining The fact that Scorsese took good material and made it even better is the reason why The Departed is perhaps the best remake ever made and certainly one of my favorite crime dramas 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5119879/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,The Renaissance,Martin Scorsese has reached a point in his career where he has free reign to do whatever he wishes as a director It s hallowed ground for an auteur and as such every actor worth his salt would kill to work for him knowing full well that whatever Scorsese chooses to do will be an uncompromising work of art With The Departed he has quite possibly one of the greatest casts ever assembled The deliciously convoluted plot based on the recent Asian flick Infernal Affairs showcases Jack Nicholson as an Irish mob boss Leonardo DiCaprio as an undercover cop infiltrating the crime ring Matt Damon as the crime ring s inside man with the police unit assigned to bring them down Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg as the cops working above Damon and DiCaprio and a breakthrough role for Vera Farmiga as a police psychiatrist in a love triangle with Damon and DiCaprio This brief but confusing rundown is merely the tip of the iceberg and reveals nothing of the plot twists and tension riddling every aspect of the film like bullet holes from a machine gun massacre By now Scorsese is to crime dramas what Hitchcock was to psychological thrillers Comparatively he s at the same point in his long career Hitchcock was when he gave us Rear Window Psycho and Vertigo Scorsese could ve directed this blindfolded and it would ve still been first rate What s so thrilling about Scorsese as a filmmaker is that he s always directing full throttle with his eyes wide open The Departed is so ridiculously good it left me with chills afterward After a brief departure to big budget Oscar pushes with Gangs of New York and The Aviator Scorsese returns to the familiar ground of his most revered projects like Taxi Driver Raging Bull Goodfellas and Casino All his hallmarks are here fantastic use of music brilliantly choreographed bouts of violence heart pounding editing deep and meaningful camera shots and movement religious iconography an epic and detailed sense of place in this case Boston and highly quotable dialogue that is dramatic and funny and full of pathos in all the right places With its rising tension and cat and mouse theatrics The Departed is easily the most viscerally thrilling studio film to come down the pike in many moons Scorsese doesn t just treat us to his usual bag of tricks he re imagines them and in exorcising perfectly balanced performances from an amazingly talented cast that in the hands of lesser director may have gone over the top he delivers a modern day tragedy on par with greatest works of Shakespeare For Scorsese the big screen is his canvas the camera his paint brush and the blood splattered across the screen his awe inspiring brush strokes He s a veteran he s a master and The Departed is his Renaissance,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493945/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2007,Masking Good and Evil,The 2006 Academy Award winning director Martin Scorsese has brought us some of the greatest films of all time to American Cinema and stands as one of the greatest directors to ever live With films like Raging Bull Taxi Driver Goodfellas and more recently The Aviator and Gangs of New York Marty now has the best film of 2006 to add to that list of greats with The Departed When you re facing a loaded gun what s the difference This is coldly and meticulously uttered by Boston Mob Boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson The significance of the memorable quote tells us that no matter who you are or what you ve done when death is staring you in the face it takes no prisoners Costello says this to a group of young impressionable kids and among these impressionable kids is Frank Costello s next and future pawn the wise savvy charismatic charming and slick talking Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon who gives his best acting performance of his career on the heels of another great performance in Robert De Niro s The Good Shepherd From the start we see Colin headed down a path of corruption and deception as he is groomed to become a spy in the Massachusetts State Police for Frank Costello and his Boston mafia His counterpart Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio is a cadet who has been kicked out of the academy and the only way he will ever be able to serve the commonwealth is by going undercover and infiltrating Frank Costello s crew for Captain Queenan Martin Sheen Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam Mark Wahlberg are the only two people that know Billy is a cop Academy Award nominee Mark Wahlberg does a great job as the fast talking always ready for anything humorous cop that will make you think this is a comedy at certain points in the film instead of a thrilling drama Dignam can be cold callous and most of all a dirty cop like the rat he hunts for in SIU As Billy and Colin rise in their respective fields the tension mounts as suspicion in both the State Police and Costello s crew heats up in search for the rat s There are twists and turns in every direction As they become more and more aware of each others presence the anticipation becomes almost unbearable as both look to find each other and take each other out to protect their own skins The film brings in plot twist after plot twist and manages to maintain its structure thanks to a perfect script by Academy Award winner William Monahan The two opposing figures in the film Colin and Billy frantically search and scheme their way to the top all the while sharing a sexual relationship with a psychiatrist named Madolyn Both characters fall for her and both unknowingly become twisted in a love triangle that only she knows about but has no clue how grave her situation is The motives for each falling in love with the psychiatrist is something to pay close attention to Look for the reasons Colin wants a girl and look for the reasons Billy wants a girl One is putting on an act at all times and both men struggle to keep their identity in check Costello puts fear in the heart of both Billy and Colin as he starts to question everyone around him as the heat is turned up on him Jack Nicholson gives one of his greatest performances of his career and an Oscar worthy one at that The psychological fear and mind games that he plays with both Colin and Billy make them fear that their conscience might be getting the best of them This is something to truly admire and become utterly stunned by as both actors do such a great job of portraying the paranoia Costello is not your typical gang leader He is upper class with a little L Street mentality still left in him He like s to go and listen to the opera He loves fine wines and lobster dinners with a side of bloody hand that could make anyone queasy especially the nervous wreck that is Billy Costigan He also doesn t mind indulging in a little annoying fly that may be crossing his face at the wrong time or even a little coke to set the mood so that he s comfortably numb He has his flaws as every man does but Frank doesn t recognize any weaknesses because he s just so good at making a habit of getting away with murder The very deep characters surrounding Costello along with Costello himself make this a must see We watch the drama unfold as the pressure on both Colin and Billy mounts as their guilt of deception and criminal activity makes both men start looking for a safe way out They realize they both can only take so much and neither sees a way out that doesn t result in death Colin wants to become a political influence in the community as he goes to law school at nights while Billy just wants his identity back Neither are able to depart from Costello as he has a strangle hold on their every day lives This is where we see the characters become three dimensional and where we start to gravitate towards the characters good or bad We see what they are and how far they ve fallen Their weaknesses make them so humane that it s impossible to not feel or root for them As the body count rises and the pressure is turned up one notch at a time before the final standoff the film becomes mesmerizing The shocking and surprising ending will leave some pleasantly surprised or some looking for answers and disappointed For most directors this would be their crowning achievement but for Martin Scorsese it just another classic to add the resume,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1711221/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2016,As Good As It Gets,Martin Scorsese perhaps the greatest American film director of all time delivers in a major way with The Departed The movie represents a return to the material that made him a superstar in the first place And the result is one of the best American crime dramas ever made Aided by a brilliant script William Monahan and an outstanding ensemble cast Scorsese is in top form here It should be noted that The Departed is technically a remake of the Chinese action hit Infernal Affairs unseen by me It also uses the true story of infamous Boston mobster Whitey Bulger as a template for the Jack Nicholson character But I think it would do the film and the viewer a disservice to think of it as a Bulger picture It is not It is its own story with its own characters that stands on its own The film opens with a young Matt Damon in a local diner listening to Nicholson s notorious local gangster spouting off in his own poetically vulgar way about how cops and crooks aren t so different Instant flash forward to the future and Damon s character is being sworn in as a Massachusetts state police officer Meanwhile so is another character played by Leonardo DiCaprio We learn that Leo s character comes from a family with an unsavory non law abiding past He s confronted by his superior Martin Sheen and his sidekick Mark Wahlberg Wahlberg might be the single most enjoyable aspect of the film which is saying a lot He steals nearly every scene he s in as a foul mouthed results driven hothead They present Leo s character with an ultimatum quit the force or join their undercover operation as a mole in Jack s gang It s a risky proposition but one they all know is feasible including Leo On paper he ll quit the force and get back into crime including an assault conviction and a short jail sentence Then work his way into the Nicholson character s world At the same time Damon s character has been handpicked to run a top secret task force out to snag Jack once and for all But it appears he s still in Jack s debt One cop who s really a gangster pretending to be a cop and another who s really a cop pretending to be a gangster What unfolds is an epic wholly believable and ultimately satisfying tale about just how thin the line between good and bad can be It s difficult to overstate the quality of the acting performances in this film DiCaprio is incredible as a vulnerable savant looking for some sort of salvation spending his spare time sitting next to a hospital bed occupied by his dying mother Damon delivers a strong performance as the wormy overachiever who says all the right things and shacks up with the department s psychiatrist Vera Farmiga in a very effective performance Alec Baldwin has some great lines in a small but solid role as one of the squad commanders Sheen is perfect as the wise and cautious bureau chief or something like that When Scorsese has material like this as in Goodfellas or Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Mean Streets its as if he s transported to another time and place that allows him to tell the story with an impeccable sense for placement color angle emphasis and tone It s like watching Michael Jordan or Jimi Hendrix It s a special thing when an artist has such control over their craft If you re the sort of person who likes a well written impeccably acted crime drama and for some inexplicable reason have not seen this movie do yourself a favor and see it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3392636/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,Not as good as the original,I know that it is not difficult to say that in every remake s case but this one really got my hopes high Unfortunately it wasn t the case this time Don t get me wrong the movie is still great it just falls below expectation Yes Di Caprio is great for the first time he was good in some movies before but here he is just superb Nicholoson is over the top being 69 years old he is still much more charismatic and believable than his young rivals The rest of the cast is just good no flaws Whenever they tried to stick to the original everything worked great For some unfortunate reason they decided to over complicate already sophisticated screenplay and spoiled it There are some unnecessary characters creating the mess some FBI storyline in the movie that only God knows what that was intended for And also the ending I do not know ending in the Hong Kong movie was reasonable and understandable here it is basically the same but messy In the original all of the characters had very clear reasons for everything they did and they lost it here My biggest problem with that one is that in the original neither one of the main 2 characters was either complete bastard or saint and here they actually made it black and white And no don t forget about Taxi Driver this one is very good especially if you have not seen the original but not great,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1490771/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2007,Ridiculously Over-hyped,Martin Scorcese s The Departed won the Oscar for Best Picture last night 2 25 07 Simply by that large achievement my review will be posted here just to get off my chest a few personal opinions of this film This film by large was applauded by virtually every critic that has a area to express a view for movies While that alone will not be enough to get me excited about a movie especially nowadays I am a big fan of Scorcese s work particularly Raging Bull which I believe to be the best film to have come out in the last 25 years So to say that I was looking forward to The Departed with it s dream male cast of Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Matt Damon criminally overlooked for a Best Supporting Actor Nomination Alec Baldwin and Leonardo DiCaprio would be a bit of an understatement To save some unnecessary details about the film which incidentally if you look at any other reviews you would have seen already I will simply say that this film suffered from largly Scatterbrained attention deficit disorder editing screen writing where the average scene seemed to be all of 14 seconds long especially in the first 45 minutes Deriviative plagiarized writing that Scorcese has done much better before Gangster picture with violent non sensical action meaning nothing and rapid fire scenes with music loud and in your face gee haven t I heard that Rolling Stones song before Undeveloped unlikeable lead character in DiCaprio There is no substance to his character and doesn t receive on bit of concern from the audience goer Also while he is a very capable actor he is just still far too young looking to head a clearly very adult natured film The only thing that saves this movie is the mildly surprising ending and Matt Damon s unheralded work He is truly a gifted actor and deserves more acclaim for his work 4 10 rating,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1607803/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,10/10 acting and montage,The acting of Jack Nicholson and Leonardo Dicaprio was brilliant Love the movie Scenario and montage was perfect Amazing cast Definitely goes to my fave lists,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8416558/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,Elite,Brilliantly adapted Accents can be a little hammed up but you get used to it Actor selection was perfect Shoutout to Alec Baldwin for his subtle comedy performance The love story within the main plot was a typical pointless Hollywood requirement that added nothing to the movie and could have been removed and no one would have noticed You ll always pick up something new every time you watch it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5903160/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2006,I Couldn't Wait to Depart from the Violence **,Martin Scorsese the master of gang epics is at it again This time in The Departed he uses modern technology to show what mobsters et al can do to create mayhem The acting here is first rate as Jack Nicholson who portrays a vicious criminal is right on target His antics are terrific Leonardo De Caprio delivers a knockout performance as the guy working secretly for the police Matt Damon does a fine job as the guy going in the opposite direction The film deals with 2 young men recruited to serve in various capacities One works for the mob to infiltrate the state police department in Boston the other is a cop working for the mob boss You would think that their lives would connect sooner as both see and fall for a female doctor The violence and use of the 4 letter word is really too much to bear Look for nice supporting performances from Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg as veteran cops The film goes downhill in quality as the body count begins to mount This film is certainly not for the squeamish,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1507308/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2006,Departed is example of what's wrong with movies,Bad bad bad All that big named talent and they were terrible sleepwalking through a horrible script that was never ending in its repetitiveness Poorly directed it was like a junior college student s idea for a movie It needed to be 30 minutes shorter Hasn t this movie been done before and done better This is clearly a movie that was done by committee and not a committee of people who love movies I still maintain we will never see Matt Damon in a love scene with a woman Reason he s not a good enough actor to play a heterosexual leading man It would be too much of a stretch for him I want my money back,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1508359/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2014,Most annoying soundtrack.,Frankly i think Scorcese suffers from a personality crisis for quite some time This movie is another example that this director who made milestones of Hollywood history once totally lost his style and constantly tries to follow tired trends That he s successful with it tells more about his audience then the quality of his recent movies A good example for this is the nerve wrecking soundtrack of this mediocre remake which dive bombs the viewer with one blaring rock song after another Who does Scorcese thinks he is Quentin Tarantino It would be excusable for a beginner to over spice his first movie with his favorite mix tape I like music and i like movies What i don t like is to be pestered with someones dated musical taste when i want to see a gangster movie My God just read the list of songs at the end credits It s insane You have to be numb to endure this,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2975406/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2007,Oscar Nominated and Winner? Another Shameful Joke of Hollywood,Two just graduated officers from Massachusetts Police Academy follow opposite sides of the law William Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio is assigned to work undercover with the Irish mobster Frank Costello Jack Nicholson to get evidences to arrest him His true identity is only known by his superiors Dignam Mark Wahlberg and Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen The prot g e of Costello Colin Sullivan Matt Damon is promoted in the Boston Police Force and is the informer of Costello Each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other rat The Departed is a good movie with a great cast but never deserved to be nominated to the Oscar There are dozens of better movies and even Donnie Brasco is better and better The exaggerated and absurd story and situations have no credibility some dialogs are simply ridiculous shows prejudice against the Catholic Church with free aggression the romance between William and the incompetent psychiatrist is senseless and the character of Jack Nicholson is full of clich s and awful lines A guy with such stupid attitudes could never be a powerful boss Now I understand why Martin Scorsese asked to double check whether his name really was in the envelope of the Oscar He probably knew that this movie could never be an Oscar winner and he was afraid that it could be a joke Actually it was another shameful joke of Hollywood My vote is seven Title Brazil Os Infiltrados The Infiltrated,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1610867/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2006,Not Recommended!,I ve had more thrilling poops than The Departed Where to begin Leonardo DiCraprio is NOT the sort of man he portrays here Instead he borrows a page from the Gutzon Borglum handbook What I m trying to say here is he s a poopy actor in this one Nothing against him personally though I just felt like I was watching my Aunt Freda s home movies pumpkin pie not Also what is the deal with Jack Nicholson The man s in his 80s and this is what he s supposedly doing Running around like a squid that just had its ink squeezed out I miss him when he was the Penguin He should have been replaced with Bull the bailiff from Night Court Up your nose with a rubber hose I actually love Marty Scorsese but what was he thinking We have a word for movies like this back home but I can t repeat it here starts with a y if you know what I mean Hopefully he rebounds after this effort As I sat through this one I was really wishing that I was departed Overall I do not recommend The Departed,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1502670/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2007,"This time, they gotta give Martin Scorsese an Oscar.",The 79th Annual Academy Awards will run tomorrow night and The Departed is one of the Best Picture nominees All that I can say is that they have to award Martin Scorsese this time The Departed hits you like I have almost never seen in a movie It is an absolutely great movie in terms of the acting First we get narration from aging mafioso Frank Costello Jack Nicholson He s been pragmatic about many things throughout his life but he s never given up his life of crime and being one of the nastiest people whom you could imagine Then there s Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio joining Boston s police force but secretly infiltrating the mafia Next there s Colin Sullivan Matt Damon one of Costello s acolytes secretly infiltrating the police Add psychologist Madolyn Vera Farmiga to the mix and you have a practically explosive situation One thing that you should understand about this movie is that almost every character is a total creep and there are basically no good guys Dignam Mark Wahlberg is particularly bad With all these characters being so vile it is no surprise that we see violence and brutality that movies almost never show It s the sort of stuff that makes you feel like the characters are pounding your face in Don t be surprised if you walk away from The Departed feeling very shaken up And you ll probably never want to be a cop after watching this Anyway I say that even if they don t give the movie Best Picture they gotta give Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar His direction is top notch as is almost every other aspect of the movie I wholeheartedly recommend it Also starring Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Kevin Corrigan,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1606246/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2006,Best Scorsese Film. Period.,Oh my God I can say without overstatement that I just saw the most gripping and entertaining American film to come out in at least the past ten years I was lucky enough to get a pass to an advance screening of The Departed this past weekend in Boston I wasn t sure what to expect and actually planned on being a little disappointed with all the expectations and hype of such an all star cast From the moment the opening credits came up the movie grabbed me by the neck ripped me out of my seat and didn t let go until the final scene Each performance is more masterful than the next Damon was a tour de force as the lead tapping every ounce of his acting reservoir for this role Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his already sterling resume His mob boss would almost steal every scene he was in if it not for every other actor being so fantastic However the biggest surprise for me personally came from Leonardo DeCaprio Having never warmed up to any of his roles or movies I found myself blown away by him in this I m not sure if it was the material he was given or if DeCaprio has grown this much as an actor or a combination of both but he finally won me over with his role in this instant Scorsese classic Every character is pitch perfect every scene is right on the money The plot builds to a crescendo of such dynamic proportions rarely seen on film I don t want to give too much away but I m still shaken from the ride I was taken on People go to the movies in the hopes that maybe once in a hundred times you get to experience storytelling so masterful and transcendent that it changes the way you view cinema This is one of those spectacularly perfect times Forget Taxi Driver Forget Raging Bull Forget Goodfellas As much as I LOVE those movies and as much as they have affected me in my lifetime The Departed will hands down be Martin Scorsese s Master Work,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1489297/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2006,left me numb...,I came away from this film feeling very confused and numb I thought the acting was quite good Dicaprio Walhberg Damon and Nicholson although a bit over the top but what is the point of a movie that is all smart ass talk appears no one respects anyone else and blood and guts The female actress was added I m sure just to give us a break from all the testosterone flowing from foul mouth males and she was rather weak and pointless One scene that really sickened me was Jack in the restaurant scene with his hands and shirt covered in blood what was he doing Breaking in a new crew or butchering a pig My husband thought the movie too long and and I sometimes felt that the director was just off camera saying lights camera action especially the scene on the roof top near the end of the picture with Dicaprio and Damon It looked too staged as if Dicaprio was looking for direction The blood bath on the elevator was horrible mainly because some of the audience 20 in total started to laugh and because a second mole was introduced and quickly dispensed What But the last frame with the you know what was laughable So did we like it Well the hype was there so we caved in and spent 17 40 CND but it wasn t what we expected My husband wondered if it was a waste of 2 long hours and I m still so numb I ll have to get back to him with an answer,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1501407/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2006,Movies script is made up of continual cursing.,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496563/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2011,Don't f**k with Nicholson,This is Scorsese s masterpiece I love most of Martin s work but this is his gem He won best director for this movie and this also won best picture All well deserved In my top ten list this is 3 A lot of people don t like this movie because they say the plot is too confusing Frankly I thought the same thing after first viewing it After several watched I know what was going on and who was who The dialogue is sharply written and the performances are outlandishly entertaining Everything about this movie is great and frankly I don t find any flaws in it People might think I m being too generous and that I m blinded by my love for Scorsese No I just know a damn good movie when I see one This is a gangster drama that hits all the right notes and has a great soundtrack to go along with it I also love how much they swear in the movie It s hilarious and its used well too A lot of times swearing is abused and overused in movies Now I have heard people cuss this movie out for how much swearing there is but realize that people talk like this Maybe not all the time but they do The cast is beyond superb and all of them do a great job I love this movie and hopefully someone who reads this then watches it will uh love it too All thumbs up,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2465036/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2007,The Departed--and not a minute too soon.,This is a terrible movie It s two and a half hours of obscenities instead of script violence instead of acting and Jack Nicholson playing who else but Jack Nicholson I m sure a lot of people will say all this was necessary to give the grittiness to the movie It isn t think of the great gangster movies of the thirties forties and fifties Bogart and the lot never said any more than darn and most violence was implied rather than cataloged It s no wonder society is running out of control when this type of sick movie wins an Oscar Bruce,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1724227/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2006,A very clichéd movie. The acting is what is so truly great about it.,This film had got great ratings great reviews everywhere I went All my friends where saying it was a masterpiece so I decided to check it out My theater was full I guess everyone else heard the same thing from their friends and the internet The moment this film started I thought to myself awww jeez big mistake The acting was always good through out the movie So don t get me wrong there The plot was poorly written The direction could ve been a lot better This movie was just a big clich An undercover cop Let me name some films right now with that idea Reservoir Dogs Sin City Airheads The Punisher Go Donnie Brasco Miami Vice The Whole Nina Yard and much more There was not one character I liked either All of them acted childish and just cursed each other or bashing each other up Believe it or not but my theater was laughing all the way through it Everything about it was laughable All in all not terribly bad But boy was it very Hollywood Will never make sense to me why people love this Hollywood movie 5 10,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1505266/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2007,"Terrible Film, simply awful",I have seen Infernal Affairs the original and the Departed is really terrible in comparison The scene for example where Damon s character pretends to be a lawyer was MUCH better acted by Andy Lau in IA Jack Nicholson character was over the top and annoying IMO Jack comes off as a low class dirty scumbag than a mademan mafioso top dog The scene with Nicholson holding the severed hand in front of Dicaprio was just an stupid scene all together Mark Wahlberg What was the point of his character All he seems to do was act like a hoodlum and curse when he is speaking I was very impressed with the storyline the acting and subtlety scenes in IA but TD just left me uninterested in the story all together and this is the SAME FILM THE Departed is a terrible film with bad acting by Hollywood A list actors Sorry but I didn t buy the plot the acting the emotions in TD But then again what do you expect its a Hollywood knock off of an original I couldn t finsh the film that was how terrible it was,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1613195/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2006,A Quick Review,I was never one of those people who thought that Martin Scorsese had lost his touch I just thought that as he had grown older his interests had changed and that was completely fine No because I believe this would not say that The Departed is Scorsese s comeback The Departed is his best film since Goodfellas and is a complete masterpiece The performances are top notch If Dicaprio isn t at least nominated I will be extremely mad Wahlberg and Nicholson are also both stand outs and I hope both get nominations Damon and Farmiga are both also amazing The rest of the cast are very good but don t stand out in the amazing cast The script is also great The dialogue is brilliant and they manage to give each and every character enough development to work well I also hope Shore is nominated for his brilliant score Those Irish strings and bagpipes pipe at exactly the right time The Departed is Scorsese s best in years and truthfully one of his best ever,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494953/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2006,Better than Goodfellas?,Dare I Dare I say it This movie is better than Goodfellas There I said it I saw this latest Scorsese film at an advance screening Needless to say I was expecting a lot more than I thought this director of classics like Taxi Driver but lately of Gangs of New York would deliver I was very wrong Though the exact plot is unimportant The Departed is about the blurred lines that distinguish good guy from bad guy and cop from robber in present day Boston With a packed cast which I need not mention that includes great supporting roles by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin the acting in the departed is stellar Living legend Jack Nicholson flawlessly delivers one of his best performances in years as the execrable mob boss Frank Costello Nicholson s nuanced acting was so on point that at times I felt like I was actually about to be shot by the slimy capo The Departed is nothing short of spectacular Funnier that most comedies Scorsese is still able to amplify the bloodshed and meticulously deliver a stunning cinematic achievement Bravo Mr Scorsese you have outdone yourself,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1489965/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,Am I the only one?!,Sorry thought this was very bad Terrible story have not seen Infernal Affairs but State of Grace and even the pilot of The Shield were far superior and credible Wahlberg too weak for the role his scenes with Baldwin and Damon were comical Alec Baldwin enough said Nicholson overacting wildly the rat impression made me cringe DiCaprio s performance was going OK until the line I can t believe you are so vulnerable right now Vulnerability couldn t see that emotion anywhere but it seemed I was supposed to which made me question the whole performance Matt Damon was actually quite good Direction the film looked good sounded good but all to no avail when tied to such a poor story Not trying to pick a fight just my opinion Nearly every review has been positive surely someone else hated it,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494440/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2007,What great acting,I waited to see The Departed with antisapation and having just seen it my wait was not in vain The acting in the movie was the tops including Leonardo De Caprio Matt Damon and of course Jack Nicholson who is great in anything he appears in Even the bit parts by Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were outstanding The problem I had with the movie was how similar DiCaprio and Damon looked in this movie I got sort of confused as to who was who This is a different kind of cop story and I am sure you will enjoy watching the artistry of this unit of actors in this fine movie It is the best two hours I have spent in a long time so go see this outstanding movie and you will certainly enjoy it as much as I did This is Oscar material for sure,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1598220/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2019,"2,5 hours of brutality, violence and massacres",The film is well made with great actors that are doing an excellent job but it s actually a remake of a Korean film which are notorious for their excessive brutality and violence That is certainly not lacking here The Korean original is much shorter more efficient and intensive while Scorsese has made his version as long and tedious as possible There is very little action the first two hours and mainly only talk and paranoid intrigue But the worst thing is the language The word f k occurs in almost every sentence and at least in every scene This extremely base and vulgar language with very little vocabulary and mainly used aggressively in constant outbreaks of anger and violence ruins the film and makes it deplorably void of style Of what use then is the brilliant technique the excellent actors and the splendid direction if the film is just 2 5 hours of brutal criminality atrocious violence constant massacres and only foul language Sorry Scorsese has made a few great and interesting films like Bringing Out the Dead and Shutter Island but this is not one of them,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5301927/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2022,The Rat Pack,I ve been after the 2007 Oscar s badge for a while now and have had a couple of aborted attempts to rewatch The Departed It s arrival on Netflix though gave me the impetus to sit down and watch it Though I know it s rather thought of as Scorsese s honorary best picture Oscar winner there s an awful lot to admire in this remake of the Japanese organised crime thriller Frank Costello Jack Nicholson runs organised crime in the Irish controlled areas of Boston Taking a smart young boy under his wing he convinces Colin Sullivan Matt Damon to join the police force and be his man on the inside An organised crime department within the force takes young recruit Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio who has dubious characters in his family and convinces him to worm his way into Costello s crew With both moles in place the pressure on the pair rises and the risk of exposure becomes all consuming If Scorsese tends to prefer to make character study type movies The Departed is a bit of an anomaly not because it s lacking in performance Nicholson excels as the truly awful crime boss Costello and is matched in memorable turns by Mark Wahlberg s foul mouthed cop but because the film is driven by it story The duality of the two rats both perhaps the only two people who could understand each other but driven to acts of violence by fear of exposure Admittedly Scorsese has made the odd organised crime film before though the shift from an Italian accent to an Irish one provides the smallest big of variety Speaking of accents it s another misfire from Ray Winstone not quite Black Widow bad but certainly more What s unarguable is the quality of the rest of the film the cinematography score as well as the depth of the ensemble cast It doesn t for me get close to a true Scorsese classic like Goodfellas but it s certainly a worthy enough film in its own right,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8154951/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2007,The Best Film of 2006,You accuse me once I put up with it You accuse me twice I quit You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a f cking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else Okay Billy Costigan Walking into The Departed the latest Scorsese picture I didn t know what to expect The way it used to be back in the 70s and 80s was when Scorsese released a film you knew it was going to be spectacular and a contender for Best Picture Now unfortunately you cannot say the same thing Besides blessing us with some of the Best American Films Ever Made Mean Streets Taxi Driver Raging Bull GoodFellas in his recent years some of his other films have been more than a little disappointing Kundun Bringing out the Dead Age of Innocence The Aviator I wanted to think positive and think maybe this could be on par with Scorsese s early efforts Despite the talent of Jack Nicholson of the bad guy I was pretty sure it was going to be good but the same old disappointing stuff we got from him in recent years But when those ending credits started to roll I realized I could NOT have been more wrong Believe most of the critics and myself when we say The Departed is not just excellent but a masterpiece and one of the best films Scorsese has EVER made The Departed is based on the superb 2003 Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs Remakes usually are inferior to their originals but in this case The Departed is 10 times better than Infernal Affairs featuring acting and direction that is literally 20 times better Instead of Hong Kong the story of the remake is set in Beantown or Boston An up and coming rookie cop with a criminal family history Costigan DiCaprio is commissioned by his superior officers Captain Queenan Sheen and Sergeant Dignam Wahlberg to go on a secret undercover mission and infiltrate the crew of the charismatic yet incredibly violent crime boss Frank Costello Nicholson At the same time a street hood practically raised by Costello Sullivan Damon is commissioned by Costello to go undercover and infiltrate in the Boston Police Department The film quickly becomes a thrilling cat and mouse game of wits between Costigan and Sullivan to see which of the two will come out victorious Scorsese s riveting Boston crime drama also stars The War Zone s Ray Winstone as Costello s equally twisted 1 man Mr French The Manchurian Candidate s Vera Farminga as a psychiatrist working for the Boston P D who forms a relationship with Colin and Alec Baldwin as the sarcastic easily irritated but constantly fun to watch police Lieutenant who tells Colin one of the benefits of getting married is that the other cops won t think you re a homo Analyzing the different aspects of this film there is really nothing to complain about but so much to praise First off the acting is perhaps the best out of any motion picture released this year Jack Nicholson is absolutely outstanding not to mention bone chilling in his supporting role as Frank Costello creating what is his best bad guy yet It will be virtually impossible for Nicholson to be denied an Oscar nomination for his work in this seeing as though whenever he s on screen he steals the film even if he doesn t have lines Matt Damon is magnificent in his role as the calculating gangster posing as Bostod P D but the real breakthrough and the finest performance of The Departed is Leonardo DiCaprio In a tour de force performance that gave me goose bumps DiCaprio completely makes up for some of his lack luster performances in the past and then some I predict DiCaprio might receive another Best Lead Actor Oscar Nomination for his work in this God knows he deserves it 100 In smaller roles Mark Wahlberg is hysterical and scene stealing as the demeaning police Sergeant who always has some smart ass nasty comment to say to someone Martin Sheen is solid to say the least as the Police Captain Alec Baldwin is quite humorous in a tiny role as the Lieutenant and Vera Farminga is fantastic in her role as the precinct shrink Rounding out the cast Ray Winstone is perfect as one man no one wants to screw with Mr French and The Shield s Anthony Andersen is merit able in an almost unnoticeable role as another cop who works with Sullivan William Moynihan provides a masterful screenplay which redeems him for the scattered and stilted screenplay he provided for Kingdom of Heaven The dialog in The Departed never seems stiff and most of the time it is laced with side split tingly funny yet gritty one liners from both the criminals and the cops The cinematography and film editing are astounding but the real secret to the success of The Departed is Martin Scorsese s breathtaking directing abilities Scorsese outdoes himself with The Departed which is as stylish as Raging Bull and as entertaining and engrossing as GoodFellas Scorsese has been nominated seven Academy Awards for Best Director and has never actually won but mark my words The Departed is probably going to be the film he finally gets the trophy for Not just because he s overdue but because his surprisingly exceptional work in The Departed is more than deserving Out of all these nearly perfect aspects of the film the only down side is that the first fifteen minutes of the film aren t very gripping No worries though the rest of the two hours and fifteen minutes fly by and will have you pinned to your seat It s one of those films you don t want to end because you are having such a fun time in the movie theater The Departed is the best film of the year thus far and is a reminder of why we as a people go to the movies Grade A screened at AMC Deer Valley 30 Phoenix AZ 10 07 06,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1605717/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2015,Intense and Gripping Throughout,The Departed as many as declared as Martin Scorsese s masterpiece What s surprising here is that this is not an awards seeking film rather The Departed is purely a thoroughly entertaining mainstream blockbuster designed more to be enjoyed than to be analyzed The Departed has been praised for several years especially since it s immediate release It is a great example of the difference that a visionary director can bring to relatively conventional material The overall premise is clever the action is gripping production values solid all around What really makes it stand out though aside from Scorsese s style is simply how much good fun it is Laughs come frequently and loudly throughout the film with almost all being character based rather than cheesy one liners or goofy sight gags The result is some tremendously smart and snappy dialogue interplays mixed with scenes which give the actors room to breathe and add their own style As a rewatch 03 16 20 the Departed remains a great and highly entertaining watch and one of the greater crime drama s of its time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3335143/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2006,Say Cheese!!!---Rat Traps.,Director Martin Scorsese gets back to the seamy mean streets of metropolitan America after a decade long hiatus that took place after Casino was released in 1995 with this fiery and mean spirited masterpiece that focuses on double agents attempting to infiltrate the inner most sectors of those very groups they want to take down Matt Damon is the bad guy in deep with the Massachusetts State Police and Leonardo DiCaprio is our hero who may drown in an abyss of crime and wrongdoings with sadistic Irish Mafia crime boss Jack Nicholson We have law enforcement officials galore Alec Baldwin Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen evil henchmen led by Ray Winstone and even a female element in psychiatrist Vera Farmiga who gets torn between Damon and DiCaprio herself in the tangled and winding mixture William Monahan s script rises above most all other film noir styled classics of the genre mainly due to the overwhelming star power led by Nicholson in arguably his best role since One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest and of course Scorsese s out of this world talents as a legendary American film maker Fast moving tense and devastatingly brilliant in most every way The Departed is easily one of Scorsese s finest efforts and quite possibly the best film of 2006 Based on a Hong Kong product titled Infernal Affairs of the same translation from 2002 5 stars out of 5,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1553313/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2023,A top notch cat and mouse game for undercover cop Billy Costigan played superbly by Leonardo DiCaprio,There are very few crime genre films that can hold up as good as when they were first released but I must say that every time I watch the 2006 The Departed I feel like I am watching it for the first time again and again It was that good The suspense of wondering if and when the undercover cop Billy Costigan played superbly by Leonardo DiCaprio will be discovered by crime boss Frank Costello played by Jack Nicholson before the actual rat cop Sergeant Colin Sullivan Matt Damon is identified by the good guys carries throughout the extended 151 minutes of the film Kudos to the deserved 2007 Oscar winners first class director Martin Scorsese William Monahan Best Writing Adapted Screenplay Thelma Schoonmaker Best Achievement in Film Editing and last but not least producer Graham King Best Motion Picture of the Year The film was woven together like the masterpiece of cinema it has been acclaimed for with an all star A Lister cast a fantastic music score suspense from start to finish and the cinematography that any film producer would be envious of I don t know how Leonardo DiCaprio was overlooked not only as an Oscar nominee but as the winner of Best Actor alternatively DiCaprio was nominated for Best Actor for his role in Blood Diamond I give this first class crime genre film a highly rayed 9 out of 10 IMDb rating,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8899421/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2017,Irish copy (dad),This movie is similar to Pacino s movie Donnie Brasco but for one time we leave the NYC and Italian underworld for the Irish and Boston Thus having Damon playing in it is interesting as he deepens his local ties from Will Hunting and in a way his meeting with DiCaprio is the new generation confrontation of Pacino De Niro However the pleasure doesn t go farther as this movie is just totally unbelievable the new thug becomes close to the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the police rat the policeman grows up with the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the criminal rat With that the movie just take fun to tell the most bad words and to show the most blood All the characters are pathetic badly played by the ordinary big names who does their same show over and over Baldwin Wahlberg Nicholson who has absolutely no charisma as the boss The scenes with the shrink are totally useless and just add minutes to get a long movie Sure many would praise it as it s a Scorcese but frankly i won t watch it again while DB is much more engaging,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628508/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,Matt Damon gets hit in the face many times,This movie had an all star cast that delivered Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg delivered some great dead pan lines Leo DeCaprio was great as a tortured soul and Jack Nicholson was a fantastic bad guy But this movie could have under gone some serious editing Jack Nicholson had a girlfriend that served no purpose heck for that matter the love interest of Damon and DeCaprio didn t really serve a purpose either DeCaprio s love scene served no purpose There was symbolism with a church at the beginning and end that really wasn t tied into the movie as a whole and Nicholson s character starts to go mad and we don t really know why or it isn t show in a fluid manner I know this movie is a remake I ve never seen the original so that doesn t matter to me While over all it was entertaining the best thing about it was that Matt Damon was hit in the face numerous times Bottom line save your money and rent this on video instead of going to the theater,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492671/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2010,What a mess,Oh dear it s Scorsese does Tarantino with some Goodfellas thrown into the mix even down to using the Human Beanz Nobody But Me for a fight in a shop The first third of the film is excellent despite the constant sound of the Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter every five minutes but then it goes downhill fast The basic premise of a cop infiltrating the Irish mob and a mobster infiltrating the cops is good but soon so many other things are thrown into the plot it becomes a farce Why make Costello am FBI informer Pointless other than maybe to give Matt Damon a reason to kill him although it would have been a thousand times more interesting if Damon s reason was Nicholson s dismissive treatment of him since a teenager Why did Matt Damon s character have so much power to do as he liked in the force after only joining a few months back able even to call a surveillance of Sheen police chief Stupid How come Damon didn t figure out immediately that Dicaprio s character used his phone at the meet with the Chinese He knew the whole of Nicholson s crew apart from Costigan but Scorsese just needed to drag the film out for another hour Why was Baldwin s character camping it up like a pantomime dame all over the screen The acting from Baldwin was so bad it made me think he was play acting for Damon s character and actually new he was a mole but he didn t Baldwin just can t act The mess of shootings at the ending wasn t a twist either it was very dull ho hum and so what and i had lost interest half an hour earlier when Nicholson exited the film After the first hour this film is silly contrived and with no clever plot twists at all but just pointless adding of layer on layer of meaningless guff If someone tells you this is an intricate and well plotted film don t believe them point them in the direction of The Usual Suspects,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2224233/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,Identity,This is kind of the ideal remake It takes a concept with great potential that the original didn t fully realize deepens it does more with it and transplants it to a completely different setting This isn t just Infernal Affairs in America this is Infernal Affairs in Boston The script by William Monahan a Boston native ends up so intimately tied to the reality of the city its different cultures locations and even history that it gives the movie such a wonderfully distinctive flavor that sets it apart from the original Add in Scorsese s incredible skill behind the camera his ability to coax great performances from all of his actors and the editing prowess of his long time editor Thelma Schoonmaker and you ve got one of the most entertaining mob movies of the past twenty years This film follows the original plot point for plot point and yet they feel like entirely different movies They re made differently with vastly different focuses that provide incredibly different experiences Those who value plot over every other element of narrative would probably gravitate towards Infernal Affairs more naturally while I see The Departed as a much more well rounded experience that provides wonderful characters to enjoy It s the story of two young men one a police recruit and the other a prot g of the local mob boss going undercover in the oppositional organization There s Billy Costigan who goes from the police academy to the mob and then there s Colin Sullivan who follows the local mob boss Frank Costello around as a very young man who enters the police academy as his mole The two moles end up on each other s tails just behind as they try to figure out who the other is Where this movie really differs from its predecessor is ability to really let its characters breathe That starts with Leonardo DiCaprio s Billly Costigan A young man of two worlds from the start his mother lived on the north side of town while he adopted a Southie accent when he went to visit his father he s pulled from the police academy and given an undercover job to infiltrate the mob organization of Frank Costello played by Jack Nicholson DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Costigan especially deeper in the film when he begins to feel cornered desperate for a way out The other side is Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan Overconfident probably to mask some inner turmoil potentially some homosexuality he s a star trooper helped along by Frank who offers up ironclad proof for crimes against unconnected people that Sullivan can present to his bosses and wrap some bows on cases Sullivan is the much more improved version of Lau His inner turmoil combined with the actual relationship with Frank he has that steadily frays as Frank gets more and more commanding and paranoid is a fully believable train of thought and action that sells the final act completely Both Costigan and Sullivan are at war with themselves They both want to be good and loyal but to whom should they be loyal Should Costigan be loyal to Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam who leave him exposed to danger for years Should he be loyal to Costello who takes him under his wing and ends up trusting him more than anyone else in his organization Should Sullivan feel support to Costello who treats him terribly threatens him constantly and could potentially be an informant to the FBI like Whitey Bulger an inspiration for the character Should he feel loyalty to Captain Ellerby who promotes him and gives him greater authority It s really interesting how often the two characters journeys mirror each other and it never feels heavy handed like when Costigan has to get his broken arm recast while Sullivan is on the fancy date with Madolyn the pretty psychologist Madolyn represents one of the major improvements from Infernal Affairs None of the female characters in the original Hong Kong production could have been really called characters They were thin placeholders for dialogue and little else Madolyn gets into relationships with both Costigan and Sullivan and she ends up being a driver for both characters She meets Sullivan first falls for his easy charm moves into his nice apartment overlooking the state capitol and gets engaged They seem happy but he s at war with himself and he can t open up to her outright telling her that he can t tell her things Costigan on the other hand is a patient that she sees a single time in a meeting so mean spirited but honest that she can t see herself helping him on a professional manner but he manages to ask her to coffee immediately afterwards There comes an honesty between the two that gives Costigan his one safe outlet in a dangerous world She becomes his guiding light in the fog Played with intelligence and poise by Vera Farmiga Madolyn is a very good addition to the story Matthew Modine in this video from the Criterion Collection said that in theater actors create performances but in film it is directors who create performances based on their choices of takes Jack Nicholson s Frank Costello is quite a creation that fits this theory pretty well I think From the stories I ve read of this film s production Scorsese gave Nicholson a very wide berth to create Costello The scene where Costello confronts Costigan on whether he s a rat or not was filmed with a few props just out of view that Nicholson could pull from if he was feeling like it The take that Scorsese left in was where he grabbed the gun and pointed it at Costigan What I m saying is that Scorsese has learned how to both allow his actors to go off in any direction they want but to piece together a cohesive performance through the chaos It helps that Nicholson is playing a man who s steadily feeling cornered and out of control a psychopath struggling to keep control of his environment but that could be a recipe for getting lost like what Scorsese oversaw in New York New York The film s resolution as the moles work their ways out of their holes Costello comes to his end and Madolyn discovers the true natures of the two men in her life is a surprisingly affecting ending There s a lot going on across a fair number of characters but while ensemble pieces are hard they are far from impossible to pull off Everyone s dealing with similar issues centered around the idea of duality Even smaller events have this implication like when Costello confronts the older priests about how they abuse young boys the men of the cloth being corrupted Costigan finally facing off with Costello s mole is the ultimate bringing together of all the parts though and the suddenness of the turns in this scene fit the story fill out details and it never feels cheap The Departed is the work of a screenwriter providing concrete settings and intelligent character work to an existing plot while an incredibly talented director builds performances that fill out the characters and pulls all of the other disparate elements into a complete package It really is a great film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6757158/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2018,not worth the hype,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4322980/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2013,Watch the original before this one,I don t understand how can it have such great marks when the original version is way better It s pretty much the same as the original except for one particular thing that was one of the best parts of the original film And the thing that really pisses me off is that it was given the Oscar for the best adaptation it was adapted from another film tell me how difficult it can be and the good parts are all the same It may be true that the actors did it very well and that the plot is excellent but the original actors are as good as these ones and the original plot is even better so I highly recommend to watch the original one first Infernal Affairs You won t regret it,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2830956/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2008,Best Mafia movie since Goodfellas,Wow this movie really takes you re breath away What an all star cast you have Jack Nickolson Alec Baldwin Mark Wahlberg Anthony Anderson Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio i think i like Leo s character the best though there are a lot of plot twists in this one i think this is also probably Jack Nickolson s best work in a very long time this kind of role seems to suit him Mark Wahlberg s character was very intriguing too Matt Damon did a fairly decent job here this is much better than the Good Shepard which Leonardo passed on wisely This gangster movie has it all people getting thrown off of roofs blood splattering everywhere hey i almost forgot Martin Sheen is also in this and he did a superb job as well i think this is the best since Goodfellas this movie has a lot of twists like i said i won t ruin the ending but you will be in suspense right up until the end no matter who you choose to root for all in all i have to give this movie a very big thumbs up,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1900898/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2015,Just didn't get it,Quite frankly it took me a few viewings to figure this one out This movie seemed a bit too long and contained several unnecessary characters and events Mark Wahlberg s character in particular just seemed way over the top and was just plain annoying I still haven t figured out why this character is even included in this story As for the other performances Nicholson seems a bit out of place in this one and Martin Sheen is a little too low key I must agree with other reviewers that state that this movie contains way too much information plot twists and should have been a lot shorter I have yet to see the original Internal Affairs but will now seek it out and compare the two Again I agree with other reviewers that I just didn t see what the big deal was about this movie This was not one of Scorsese s best as far as I m concerned,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3198967/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,"Mediocre, the original is FAR superior",Scorsese isn t what he used to be and as a Scorsese lover this pains me to say so He must have sat down watched Goodfellas and thought hmmm What did I used to do that made me great I ll just copy that It s Scorsese imitating himself and not doing a very good job of it The editing is quick and choppy like in Goodfellas but too much so the whole film is like one big montage with very little innovative direction DeCaprio and Damon aren t great but neither are they bad they just suffice The actors that really shine are Mark Walberg who finally ditches the breathless confused moron he usually plays and does something way different and innovative with himself Alec Baldwin is fantastic he has some of the best lines and is an actor who just seems to be getting better with age Normally I d say the same for Jack who s performance in As Good As It Gets was groundbreaking but this time he s just playing The Joker in Batman he s too over the top for such a seriously acted movie He was also made too nasty just to make us dislike him with no seeming root for all his hostility The original is far superior the only thing the remake does better is establishing DeCaprio in the gang before the fireworks start Basically all the elements that make a Scorsese movie great weren t there The violence was comic book especially the number of head shots at the end the film making is sub standard Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491818/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2019,NOT the film Scorcese should have won an Oscar for,I ll join in the minority opinion dissenting from appreciation of this overdone absurdly exaggerated mob cop melodrama Though I certainly can appreciate all the talent involved here I mean what a cast Nicholson DiCaprio Damon etc and Scorcese directing who should have won the Oscar for his masterpiece Goodfellas the ridiculous plot remake of one of the commonly ridiculous Hong Kong cop genre films is frankly an insult to the intelligence and to watch it attempt to justify itself with ever more absurd plot points Sheen s character falls off the roof and lands right on top of another character I mean PLEASE was tedious and even painful to watch at times I give it the stars just for the effort of particularly the actors involved but the normally extremely talented Scorcese should simply have taken the basic plot and had it rewritten to a more terse realistic thriller something Robert Redford and his director Sidney Pollock did with Three Days of The Condor which came from a book called Six Days of Condor and had much more exaggerated action scenes in it Hopefully Scorcese can put out another masterpiece before he s done and then finally be rewarded for the level of work that he s so obviously capable of,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5200095/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2009,Almost good,This could be a good film if it weren t for a few loose ends in the development of the story and a couple of strange coincidences made up to maintain the plot in line with the general structure of the script This said what is left to remark first of all the superb performance of Jack Nicholson perhaps one of the best of his career as Costello the Mafia gang chief Then the good technical quality of the movie and the excellent acting of the other performers One word too for the good form of all the violent scenes which are truly made and convincing In conclusion a movie that can have you agreeably occupied for about 3 hours without adding any special event to the history of cinema,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2087718/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,Scorsese nails the cat-and-mouse dramatic thriller,Scorcese does like himself an intricate plot and The Departed arguably has one of the better storylines in film today pitting two acting heavyweights against one another for 2 5 hours Strong acting throughout this cast DiCaprio Damon Nicholson Sheen etc helps push this story along interspersed with some decent action and more than a few twists There were points where I felt the story was lagging somewhat and the romantic interest seemed overly forced to me However these were infrequent disturbances and on the whole this cat and mouse story is better than most you will find today On the whole definitely one of my more preferred Scorsese flicks and well worth sitting down and devoting attention on,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6517314/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2019,Yes,The Departed is a really good movie The weird thing about it is that when it was released it was just as good as cinema could get It went above and beyond any of the crime films made before or anything Scorsese could possibly do Years later however it doesn t have that same impact But nevertheless it s a cool flick The movie is similar to The Wolf of Wall Street in that the scenes change rather quickly It has a fast pace and never gets boring There are plenty of memorable actors playing cool character In fact the list is endless Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg Jack Nicholson Matt Damon Alec Baldwin etc It s definitely a good movie about crime I would highly recommend it 8 stars,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5155285/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2007,My favorite film!,I finally saw the long awaited classic film from Scorsese This is one of the best films in the last decade and I am still having a personal discussion with myself on comparing it with some of the my ultimate favorites such as Goodfellas Casino Rounders A Bronx Tale The Deer Hunter and I am pondering even ranking it higher than my top 3 films the first two godfather s and taxi driver I think i will need to watch it a couple more times before making such an important decision but after seeing it once one thing is for sure The Departed is a masterpiece Everything put together by Marty in his own perfect stylistic fashion The violence is perfect the cursing is perfect the actors absolutely committed Nicholson Wahlberg and Dicaprio check in for 3 of their best performances of their careers and thats saying a lot for nicholson whose had an amazing career Matt Damon was also good here a bit subtle and overshadowed by his peers but nonetheless always convincing Vera Farmiga was charming and very good in the female lead Alec Baldwin Ray Winstone and Martin Sheen were perfect in their selective small roles as well Marty did a great job with this one I liked Howard Shore s score a lot and Michael Ballhaus s cinematography was amazing absolutely Oscar worthy IMDb Rating 8 4 My rating 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1598497/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2015,Martin Scorcese's The Departed is a modern gangster drama masterpiece,No director has boasted a stricter understanding of the gangster genre than Martin Scorcese at least not yet His filmography dating back to Goodfellas and Casino greatly prove this We have seen a devilishly gritty portrayal of Henry Hill in the former movie we have seen the portrayal of a crime family caught in the hazardous world of illegal gambling in the latter If there is any director who s shown competition against Scorcese in breathing grit into the image of mobster families it is Francis Ford Coppola with his uncompromising cinematic classic The Godfather This violent gritty crime thriller sees Scorcese continues his trademark cinematic ambition with showcasing an authentic take on the life of mobsters in the complicated world of crime What many filmgoers may not to know is that this modern gangster piece happens to be a remake of a Chinese film Internal Affairs following roughly the same plot and story structure Set in the crime ridden city of Southern Boston Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan a brash undercover cop and former convict of the Boston Police Department who is assigned by Captain Queenan played by Martin Sheen and Staff Sergeant Digman played by Mark Wahlberg to infiltrate an Irish mob gang run by Frank Costello played by Jack Nicholson With FBI informant Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon set as Costello s mole and trusts of long time friends and business partners put to the test Costigan gets involved in a deadly game of cat and mouse as the two fight to uncover each other s identities In the world of modern day mobsters things gets complex in a brutally ugly way And director Martin Scorcese more than just demonstrates here Keeping the high stakes high and the story engaging Scorcese places a nasty twist on the mobster genre with this crime drama where almost none of the characters are who they say they are or make out to be Then the question that lies throughout the entirety of the plot is who are the good guys and the who are the corrupt ones The question which lies among the characters escalates into a tautly paced race against two of the main characters Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan racing to discover each other s identities With gunfights erupting in the streets of Boston and the lives of close allies threatened by corrupt individuals handled by the antagonist and crime boss Frank Costello the film proceeds with an appropriately dark atmosphere Scorcese does a magnificent job on propelling each scene with near constant tension and substance and persistently maintains absorbing character development to keep things engaging without losing track of momentum Leonardo Dicaprio s Billy and Matt Damon s Colin along with the roaring tyranny of Jack Nicholson s Frank Costello are driving forces of the plot as one of an undercover cop fighting for the truth and the other is a backstabbing mobster who disguises an law enforcement to put the other in the pawn of their dubious plan As the body count rises and the identities of the aforementioned characters are exposes everything builds to a startling climax that seals the deal Like many of Scorcese s pictures there is plenty of bloodshed and hard hitting violence to paint the ugly but true portrait of the crime underworld Leonardo Dicaprio who last collaborated with Martin Scorcese as Amsterdam in Gangs of New York suits up in the center figure of the film here and propels himself with plenty of fortitude and intensity in the role Dicaprio has proved he is capable of playing roles of both the right and wrong side of the moral compass His powerhouse portrayal proves is talented at channeling with both anger and striking humanity Matt Damon often known for playing the hero role or perhaps an ordinary human protagonist is given a whole another ball game here Shifting from his good guy persona to a corrupt individual with a perplexing agenda Damon gives a genuinely versatile performance that marks easily one of the highest points of his career Mark Wahlberg plays the trusted supporting figure of Dicaprio s protagonist and certainly makes a big name of himself here His performance is strong and shines of emotional depth But perhaps none of these actors are able to compete with Jack Nicholson who boasts a gritty portrayal of the ruthless mob boss Frank Costello Although Nicholson is no stranger to playing character with violent tendencies especially after playing the psychopath Jack Torrance in The Shining Nicholson propels with a sinister appeal to the role that makes this long time actor stand out among the rest His character greatly inspired by real life Boston gangster James Whitey Bulger is about as darkly charismatic as many gang bosses in cinematic entries nothing more nothing less The Departed is a thrillingly enthralling modern day gangster drama powered by Martin Scorcese s superb direction and powerhouse performances by a brutally talented cast This Scorcese piece is an astounding cinematic effort that not only transcends the gangster genre but marks a powerfully stunning masterpiece that is more than likely to stand the test of time in many years to come,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3377052/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2019,"An Adaptation Of ""Infernal Affairs"" Finally Wins Scrosese An Oscar? The Clueless Academy",Infernal Affairs is a superb film and so is this ingenious remake I didn t think Scorsese could top two of his previous gangster masterpieces Goodfellas and Casino but he has This film has superlative performances by all the actors involved The plot revolves around two moles one who infiltrates South Boston s well known criminal organization and the other who infiltrates the police investigating the organization Once it becomes known by both sides that these moles exist the cat and mouse fight for survival between the two begins For years Scorsese worked with DeNiro which earned him a Best Actor Award for Raging Bull However Scorsese has been continuously snubbed for a Best Director and Best Picture Award which he has deserved many times over Recently he has taken DeCaprio an excellent artist under his wing and finally the favor was returned At last Scorsese has been rewarded for bringing out the best performances from his actors This film does an outstanding job examining the mobster lifestyle authority politics and corruption This film has masterful acting directing cinematography editing and screenplay It is one of the finest in it s genre and a bravura film by Scorsese Bravo Academy You finally got it right,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4858301/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2022,Pretty much perfect,I m not a massive fan of either Leo DiCaprio or Matt Damon but this movie has to be up there with their best in my view Both playing up and coming cops in Boston their lives are intertwined in ways neither realises Nicholson is superbly cast as Irish mobster Frank Costello as are Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg as the cops tasked with catching him Featuring some great turns by supporting cast members Ray Winstone Vera Farmiga Alec Baldwin and James Badge Dale The movie has more twists and turns than a rat would take up a drain pipe and the soundtrack is great featuring the likes of the Rolling Stones Pink Floyd and Boston locals The Dropkick Murphys Definitely definitely worth a watch,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8155195/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2006,Scorsese Gets Back to Basics,Critics and fans alike are hailing The Departed as a return to form for director Martin Scorsese and though I don t exactly know what a return to form is for a director who s made such a list of diverse films I understand the sentiment The Departed is not as good as Taxi Driver or Raging Bull but it is as good and maybe even better than GoodFellas Like Fellas it s fast brutal and wildly entertaining But also like Fellas it comes off as fairly glib and lacking in the greater psychological or social meaning that made Taxi Driver and Raging Bull such great films It s nearly intolerably exciting at times I came out of the theatre actually sweating Scorsese gets terrific work out of his male ensemble and lone female Vera Farmiga especially Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio who play moles on either side of the cops and robbers divide and end up hunting each other Scorsese s point that the line between those that break the law and those that enforce it is hopelessly blurred is obvious and easy But the film is so well acted and so technically accomplished that you feel that you re in the presence of greatness even if the story itself is standard issue pot boiler stuff The ending is somewhat of a let down It feels like the screenwriter got lazy and instead of resolving matters in a creative fashion decides that the best way to tie up loose ends is to kill off virtually the entire cast with one blow your brains out shot after another But the overly tidy ending does not diminish the impact of this propulsive addictively watchable and disturbing film Grade A,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1501703/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2011,"Return to form, return to greatness.",Martin Scorsese has long been seen as one of if not the great American film directors Film after film he has continued to explore new pathways and areas of both cinematic and storytelling greatness in classic films that have stood the test of time The Departed is such a film This was Scorsese s most mainstream film to date it has since been replaced by Shutter Island and it featured an all star cast that very few directors could ever pull together All gave standout performances particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon They are the key characters everything goes through them and Scorsese uses close ups of their respective faces to emphasize and emulate all the feelings and ideas he is presenting With that in mind they both are very convincing with the Boston accents with the constant profane interactions and the extreme deviousness Perhaps because they are both professional liars some viewers tend to criticize them more harshly it can be difficult to feel empathetic for someone not necessarily true to themselves The main underlying theme here is one Scorsese has tapped into again and again guilt Ever since his first film Who s That Knocking at My Door in which Harvey Keitel played a young man wary of his relationship with his girlfriend after finding out she was raped the notion of guilt and its relation to faithfulness to the Catholic Church has dominated Scorsese s mode of thought Here guilt lies on all the characters Each of them completely embody the new life they are to now acquire Colin Sullivan Damon is a clean cut kid with an immaculate record as well as a former gangster turned State Police sergeant He is the perfect tool for Frank Costello Jack Nicholson to use to keep the cops on their toes and his business alive On the flip side Billy Costigan DiCaprio is a kid with family connections to South Boston gangsters attempting to make it into the State Police He is assigned to inform for the police into Costello s organization Right from the get go Scorsese establishes the pain and pressure these two will face in regards to their professional compromise Another buried element here is the idea of identity What exactly is it to these men What is their true identity and how can they get it back Because Sullivan and Costigan spend so much time pretending to be what they are not eventually they get caught up in attempting to succeed at a job that isn t really theirs In some ways Scorsese creates an atmosphere that is deliberately contrary to that of his 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas In that film everything rested on the joy Henry Hill had in committing crime and living the mafia life Here these emotions must be subdued lest someone get caught and possibly murdered In the end I believe this is one of Scorsese s best films along with Taxi Driver Raging Bull After Hours Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence All of the aforementioned films tell stories of men conflicted with living how they are told and how they are able to Here Costigan and Sullivan symbolize that On top of all the underlying themes this is just a very well made cop and gangster picture The acting is superb the editing is so sharp and jolting so as to keep the tension and suspense alive the cinematography greatly captures the tender living conditions in Boston and of course Scorsese s Oscar winning direction corrals everything together to create one gloriously entertaining film It is a return to classic Scorsese form as well as Scorsese greatness,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2369862/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2006,Living a double life is not different either as a cop or a criminal when you are working undercover,Synopsis The city of South Boston has been taken over by the Irish mob boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson The Massachusetts State Police Department has set up the Special Investigations Unit to collect evidence and put Costello and his men in jail Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio has just graduated from the state police academy and has been assigned to infiltrate Costello s gang by the unit chief Billy joins the mob and begins to earn Costello s trust Years earlier Costello was able to get one of his men Colin Sullivan Matt Damon to infiltrate the state police Colin is assigned to the Special Investigations Unit the same unit that is trying to take Costello down The only problem for the police is that Colin keeps Costello informed as to what the police are about to do Eventually the police and the mob discover that a mole has infiltrated their ranks Each man is living a double life where one misstep will mean life or death if he is caught My Comment This was a noteworthy movie with many memorable performances Jack Nicholson s performance as an evil psychopath will get him an Oscar nomination Several others probably will also be nominated for this film The movie is graphically violent and shows the dark side of crime It shows what it takes to work uncover as a cop or as a criminal Costello said does it matter who is holding a gun to your head it is all the same Both sides risk their lives every day It is a long movie but the time passes very fast Warner Brothers Pictures Run time 2 29 Rated R 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1489730/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2007,This is the Martin Scorsese I missed for such a long time.,Let s face it Martin Scorsese has made some good movies the past few years but nothing too brilliant or remarkable at least not compared to his more early work from the 70 s 80 s and early 90 s The last real brilliant Scorsese was in my opinion the remake Cape Fear which dates back from 1991 But The Departed is really again a movie that deserves to be on the long list of brilliant Martin Scorsese movies From the opening sequence on it s obvious this is a typical Scorsese movie For this movie he went back to the genre were he already was successful with in the past the gangster movies It s a nice touch for a change that the movie is set in present time After all why should the best gangster movies always take place in the past The Departed is a greatly told and constructed modern crime movie about an infiltrator in the state police and an infiltrator in a crime syndicate who have to hunt each other down It s a movie that provides the movie with some thrills unexpected twists especially toward the ending and some great confrontations between different characters The story on its self is already quite good Just loose the love story next times It adds nothing to the characters or story and interesting but it s made all the more great by the way it is told Not only kudos to Scorsese s directing for that but also most definitely for the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker with lots of good quick flash forwards and other tricks All I can say is that she really deserved her Oscar for this movie It really helps to tell the story and give the movie a look and identity of its own The movie its cast doesn t seem like the most likely won but it works out perfect in the movie I think a lot of people were screaming for Robert De Niro but also Jack Nicholson is perfectly believable and just great as a gangster boss Mark Wahlberg was great as a bastard cop and Alec Baldwin as a nice cop The other way around would seem more logical but they work out surprisingly well in their roles It was good to see Matt Damon in a more villainous and tougher role for a change mostly because it shows how great as an actor he actually is Leonardo DiCaprio also shows once more that he is more than just another pretty face It s not a movie that relies on its action but more on its characters and story The movie is exciting tense and spectacular regardless of that it hasn t a lot of action in it Of course this isn t Scorsese s best which really says something about the extremely high qualities of this man so is it fair that he finally won his Oscar for this movie I mean after all if this movie won then should had movies such as Heat Training Day and so on As a matter of fact it is of course true that if this movie was completely the same but had another director s name attached to it this movie would probably not had been nominated at all It s just not the Oscar type of movie but alas I m glad that Scorsese finally has an Oscar now only just 3 decades too late 9 10 http bobafett1138 blogspot com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1654291/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2007,And the Oscar goes to...,Well Martin Scorsese finally got his Oscar Long overdue Some may quibble and say the film for which he was rewarded was not his best Those who say that may have a point But that s really not important The questions which must be asked are whether this film is worthy of being an Oscar winner and worthy of being forever remembered as the film which broke the infamous Scorsese Oscar curse The answers to those questions Resoundingly yes The Departed stands in its own right as a remarkable film one of the best to come along in quite some time and clearly worthy of any and all awards it has received Maybe not Scorsese s best but if not it s pretty darned close Where to begin So many different things come together to make The Departed the standout film that it is There s a great story a terrific cast full of big name performers clearly on top of their games wonderful visuals a perfect soundtrack all capped by that unique Scorsese touch In this film Scorsese goes back to the familiar world of organized crime This time the mobsters are Irish rather than Italian and the story unfolds in Boston rather than New York but it will all seem rather familiar to the Scorsese devotee But this is not just another Scorsese mob movie It s as intense and gritty and violent as you would expect but The Departed is quite unique thanks mostly to the wonderfully involved and intricate story which unfolds in the film For everything else the film has going for it in the end as it usually does it comes down to the story The plot really revolves around two figures Leonardo DiCaprio s Billy Costigan and Matt Damon s Colin Sullivan The two both come from Boston s rather proud but rather rough Irish community After very different experiences in their youth both end up in the same place becoming Massachusetts state troopers But soon their paths will diverge again and the story really begins to pick up steam Sullivan has become a cop for one reason to provide inside information to Frank Costello the gangster whose presence is always looming over Boston s Irish neighborhood Sullivan s a mole Soon Costigan will be too assigned to go undercover and infiltrate Costello s gang Quite a tangled web Soon both the police and Costello are well aware they each have a rat inside their organization and Costigan and Sullivan will be racing to unmask each other before being discovered themselves A very high stakes drama this is as the potential consequences of being discovered are painfully obvious for our respective rats While the story is thoroughly engrossing great actors are required to bring that story to life And one thing The Departed surely has no shortage of is great actors DiCaprio and Damon are both terrific each bringing just the right personality to their respective characters who are quite a bit alike but also so different in many important ways Damon seems more calm and collected DiCaprio more edgy and intense and those emotions work perfectly for the two characters Playing Frank Costello is Jack Nicholson who is typically brilliant Authoritative menacing diabolical and always dangerous that s Frank Costello and who better for such a role than Nicholson DiCaprio Damon and Nicholson have the three meatiest roles but there are plenty of opportunities for other actors to shine as well Mark Wahlberg breathes great life into the character of Sgt Dignam one of Costigan s handlers within the police force Dignam is a man of great conviction and passion and whenever Wahlberg is on the screen you get the sense there is always something fierce simmering just beneath the surface Well played There are other big names in the cast like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin who fall perfectly into their smaller roles And there are countless less familiar faces who also do fine work It seems Martin Scorsese has brought the best out of each and every member of his cast And in doing so he has been able to wring as much drama as possible out of the terrific story with which he had to work A great story performed wonderfully by a terrific cast all touched by the hand of a master director Add it all up and you have something truly special a wonderful film worthy of all the accolades it has received,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1639809/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2016,Ratted Out,I haven t been living under a rock and neither have I been in a coma but I just watched The Departed for the first time I know where have I been My love for Scorsese films runs so deep how did this movie pass me by for so many years Anyways I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when putting this on I thought it would be some kind of worthy successor to Mean Streets GoodFellas and Casino Another Scorsese mob classic Well I wouldn t call it a classic It s a very good film i assure you but it in no way compares to the genius of his very best films It is hard to compare any mob film to the greatest mob film of all time but when it s made by the same director and you notice all of these little setbacks it s hard not to be slightly disappointed The acting is by far the film s greatest strength DiCaprio and Damon provide great intensity in their scenes no matter how subtle Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello definitely delivered the best performance It s that same brand of craziness and evil that Nicholson does so well As an interpretation of Whitey Bulger it s pretty creative This is much more of a grandstanding version of Whitey Watch Black Mass however and you ll see a more entrancingly real portrayal of Whitey by Johnny Depp The movie s mystery aspect had me very interested and so did it s brilliant direction from Scorsese himself This is at the end of the day an action picture Reminded me a little of a Geezers with Guns Guy Ritchie film Perhaps that is why I felt so differently about this film than his others It doesn t have Scorsese s words or even his ideas That is kind of what draws me to his movies the most When Marty has his own idea and puts it to work you can really tell the difference His heart and soul is in the picture Here I think he just does an excellent job directing someone else s idea What s sad is that this is the film that granted him his long overdue Academy Award for best director Really This is the film that deserved it Where were you all during Raging Bull I m being too harsh on a good film It is a good film Just not one that I ll think about when I think about one of my favorite directors,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3394621/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2006,Not Marty's Best.....But Better Than Most's Best!!!!,A really good old fashioned film with an excellent story and an unbelievable cast This film really keeps you interested all the way though as you want to know what will happen to the protagonists and how they will or won t get caught We have all seen All Star cast films where they just did not gel but Marty seems to have got a good performance out of everybody You can tell that Jack Nicholson has been given huge leeway in how he wanted to take his character through the story and as always seems larger than life but do not mistake that for a recycled performance Without giving nothing away his meeting with Matt Damon in the cinema is certainly worth watching for novelty and imagination in introducing yourself to someone you know This is the sort of film you come out of the theatre with a big smile on your face and surrounded by good spirited chattering There are twists but you do not lose track of events and just lap up the quality that laces the film from beginning to end Sure it is not Goodfellas but then they say that genius only touches you once but this is head and shoulders above the best that most other directors can make,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1532502/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,Might as well be a Christopher Nolan movie.,What I mean by that is that it can get a bit confusing not the plot but the dialogue So many of the words and phrases in the movie I assume most average people won t have heard and the movie dose t care to explain what they mean this leaves some of the conversations to be bland and boring The first half of the movie is really there to build tension which it does very well and it doesn t disappoint as the end of the movie is insanity so much happens and your mind explodes with everything that just occurred The acting didn t stand out to me even with a extremely famous cast it wasn t bad though The tension is really what makes this movie good you just want to know what s going to happen but it s delayed further and further making you keep watching Very nice 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6441135/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2007,Double dealing with a vengeance,The debates will probably rage on for years Has Scorsese done his best work here Like many in this forum I ve seen all of his movies From the aspect of thrills a minute edge of your seat action I think I d say this is his best movie However as gangster movies go I still prefer Gangs of New York 2002 For suspense Scorsese s remake of Cape Fear 1991 beats them all I think And for characterization Raging Bull 1980 the movie that should have got him an Oscar is still without equal for me Having said all that however The Departed is still the overall winner mainly because the story is so well constructed and delivers the best double twist or is it triple I ve seen for many a year In fact I d be hard pressed to think of a better one So I won t be saying too much about the actual plot the sequence of events but the story is basically this two young graduates of the police both act as undercover agents one as a mole inside the Boston Irish mafia the other as a mole for the same Irish mafia inside the Boston police force The story centers around the two moles trying to unmask the other and it s a race to see who gets in first so to speak Aaaah such irony With a stellar cast of just super actors this film just had to turn out right too many careers were on the line I think And it did turn out right There s not a false note by any of them with one exception I wasn t convinced that Madolyn Vera Farmiga as the police psychiatrist could be so stupid to become the lover of both moles I can suspend my disbelief about a lot of things to carry on with a narrative but that just doesn t ring true However it serves a purpose as you will find out and that suggests to me that such artificiality was injected for that very reason But I could be wrong Generally it s fast paced as I implied but there are a few slow spots for me mostly to do with Madolyn with the moles To keep pace with the action the editing is quite the best I ve seen the sequence when a body lands from a great distance on a city street in front of one of the moles in unbelievably precise timed to the millisecond but believably gruesome Jack Nicholson is just superb as the gangster boss affable yet entirely menacing Ray Winston always my favorite gangster is an excellent sidekick and trusted friend for the boss Alec Baldwin again shows his implacable nature as one of the police heads Ellerby just as affable as the gangster boss and almost as menacing when needs be Martin Sheen as Queenan the head of the undercover section brings perhaps the only honest face into the story and Mark Wahlberg an actor I ve ignored for a long time gives a very good impression of a terrier that just won t let go he s actually terrific in the role of Dignam As to Di Caprio and Damon the two young cops both very accomplished actors and both acquit themselves with very believable portrayals apart from sharing Madolyn The only sour note for me was the closing scene and I mean the very last shot as the camera pans across the balcony of an empty apartment to show Well I ll let you find out Tsk tsk how banal and how unnecessary,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1637565/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2006,Not Martin Scorsese's best film; lame towards end & unnecessary profanity as filler,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492505/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2020,The Departed is outstanding,From the start The Departed had me with all its intriguing characters and storyline The story flowed and moved along nicely the opening of the movie was brilliant and does what a film should do it grabs your attention and makes you ask a lot of questions and it only gets better from there with the ending being a absolute masterpiece This film is perfect The characters are all interesting and their personalities are shown through the great acting from the cast Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg do some of their best in The Departed with their witty and down to the point characters and Leonardo DiCaprio is outstanding as always and all the acting is very good throughout The thing I really like about this film is how it flicks between the two characters Billy Leonardo DiCaprio and Colin Matt Damon and the contrast it shows of the two but also the similarities From start to finish The Departed is excellent with its twists drama and humour The Departed is one of the best films I have ever watched and if you haven t watched it yet your missing out,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6042789/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2007,America filling her cup,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1603224/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2014,So-So Effort,I watched this movie again last night and it finally dawned on me what bothered me about it the first time I saw it It s actually a pretty weak story Too many big names very distracting Pretty weak acting Especially Sheen Nicholson and Wahlberg I really like Scorsese and Goodfellas is one of my all time favorite films but The Departed isn t even in its league Jack shows up well as Jack I think the last time Nicholson actually played a character other than himself Reagan was still in office I don t buy him as a powerful Irish Mob boss for a minute Wahlberg just yells and cusses a lot for no good reason And Sheen looks kinda like he had a minor stroke before filming started He looks like he s trying not to soil himself in every scene he s in Not a bad movie but Best Film Really I also noticed the Boston Police Department is portrayed as an inept bunch of clowns who do nothing but yell cuss and argue instead actually doing any police work 5 stars,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2982984/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2006,Good Movie,The Departed was good but not excellent Jack Nicholson hammed it up through most of the movie If he had less screen time I would have thought he made the movie but there was too much of him being too much Matt Damon portrayed the nasty little sh t I always thought was in him He was great Leonardo DiCaprio was also very good portraying the mental stress I would think a mob mole would have Mark Wahlberg could have been a bit over the top but I think his character s personality evolved from working with big ego macho cops and for me he was very believable Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen Ray Winstone were good in their supporting roles Vera Farmiga was OK I guess I didn t believe her as a therapist I think she need a bit more meat emotionally and as the girlfriend physically I didn t see the original Infernal Affairs so I can t compare the two This version s story especially towards the end seemed rushed and forced to finish with the big gun battle but the mechanics of the movie s cop story was secondary to the story of the two moles If the movie is examined for the story of the cops trying to get Jack Nicholson it comes up short but the mole parallel story was intriguing and Matt and Leo were great It was a violent movie and the ending was a bit much Well worth seeing but not Scorsese s best His best are icons Raging Bull Taxi Driver Mean Streets The Departed was just a good movie,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1498732/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2006,One-third as good as Donnie Brasco,I guess film critics and movie buffs are going to give four stars to any old Scorcese directed gangster movie huh Even ones that don t deserve four stars like The Departed I must admit that it s not a bad film by any means The performances are mostly solid the Boston setting is unique and interesting and there are some genuinely suspenseful scenes But on the other hand there are also plenty of scenes that feel either completely unbelievable or totally flat or a noxious combination of both The plot which gets needlessly convoluted at times involves a mob mole in the police department and his counterpart a police rat in the mafia Apparently it s based on a Chinese film called Internal Affairs but I ve never seen that movie so I can t make any valid comparisons Personally I couldn t stop thinking about Donnie Brasco the similar Johnny Depp Al Pacino movie about a rat in the mafia That film contained genuine emotion complex character relationships realism all qualities that are pretty much absent from The Departed which feels like an unrealistic Hollywood production all the way The only apparent advantage that The Departed boasts is that it has a trendier director than Donnie Brasco But I think Scorcese pretty much drops the ball in this case and doesn t deserve to be automatically credited as a genius just how cutesy and self indulgent is the last shot of The Departed anyway Some people complain about Jack Nicholson s performance but it didn t really bother me His scenery chewing is a nice change of pace from watching DiCaprio and Damon act all earnest and depressed all the time Incidentally I also thought Mark Wahlberg s foul mouthed cop was very funny and entertaining The real weak link in the acting chain is Vera Farminga as the love interest She s supposedly a psychiatrist but she gets so emotional and confrontational with her patients that she completely fails to come across as a professional She s also a bit insipid and doesn t really have chemistry with DiCaprio or Damon My other major gripe with the film is that the editing is often choppy and strange Scorcese doesn t linger long enough in most of the scenes he simply dives into the middle of the action and jumps out again as quickly as possible This MTV style editing doesn t really enable me to get immersed in a movie And some of his choppy little scenes are downright bizarre and don t seem to fit in the movie like the weird one where Nicholson goes to the opera I suppose that modern films are so bad that critics freak out when a remotely competent movie like The Departed shows up in theaters It s a welcome relief from movies about CGI animals and superheroes sure But is it really a masterpiece A top 100 movie on IMDb Hardly,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1512965/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2007,"Cops and Criminals, what's the difference?",Taxi Driver was hailed at the movie of the seventies Raging Bull was the film of the eighties Good Fellas was the film of the nineties now in this decade Martin Scorsese returns to his mafia roots not in New York or New Jersey but brings his mafia to Boston where in this update of Infernal Affairs it s mean violent frightening with full of surprises and Jack is Back making The Departed Martin Scorsese s definitive film of this decade When you re faced with a loaded gun what s the difference In The Departed Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon play different sides of the law that go in the opposite directions in their careers Leo is Billy Costigan a smart recruit who flunked the academy but is hired by Capt Queenan Martin Sheen and the foul mouth Sgt Dignam Mark Whalberg to go undercover inside mob boss Frank Costello s Jack Nicholson team and get any information Matt is Colin Sullivan who is not only a smart prodigy to Frank but once he is promoted to the Special Unit Investigations leaded by Capt Ellerby Alec Baldwin it s up to Colin to make sure that he gives Frank the early step In a game of cat and mouse both sides of the law want to find out who the mole is in their operative sources while at the same time both William and Colin are taken in by the father son figures of their work with Frank thinking of William as a son despite his henchman Mr French Ray Winstone breaking him down Just like most movies there is always the love interest Vera Farmiga who is unknown to a lot of general film freaks like myself plays the police psychiatrist who falls in love with Colin s Suffolk education attitude while she sees Billy as her patient and falls for both characters despite not knowing that both are undercover operatives Everyone gives top notch performances but everybody knows that the one who steals the show is none other than Jack Nicholson s Frank Costello Nicholson s performance as Costello brings back the devil s grin that made everybody loved villains in the first place compared to the sadistic Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York Jack s performance is one that people will be talking about and reenacting On another note about the film the editing of the film is top notch with Thelma Schoonmaker giving it all she s got bringing energetic life to the movie The screenplay by William Monahan is excellent after reading the script from purchasing the two disc special edition on February 13 2007 and this is Martin Scorsese s best film ever,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1696126/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2007,terrible,How can anyone think this is a good movie We know the ending from the beginning and this can t be good for a movie that actually pretends to mix suspense with action and a touch of comedy Here s the story Jack Nicholson is some mafia guy who pays for Matt Damon s education Matt Damon becomes a cop who helps Nicholson continue to be the bad guy Then there is Leonardo Dicaprio who is an informant who works for the police trying to help them catch Jack Nicholson by pretending to be one of Nicholson s men Now Nicholson wants to know who might be betraying him The policemen want to know who is the bad cop helping out Nicholson What is the ending of the movie suspense suspense surprise They find out In the meantime everyone gets killed Damon and Decaprio have sex with the same woman and Nicholson and the cops swear a lot Wow how creative How interesting This movie is stupid very stupid This says a lot about those people who picked it as Best Movie at the Oscars,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1609720/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2006,not really scorsese's best work,The Departed is a great movie that suffers towards the end from an excessive number of plot twists Everything else is in it s right place and yet and yet and yet it still does not have the feeling of greatness that casino or taxi driver had Why i m not sure I have the feeling though that this will eventually grow into a descent drinking movie thanks in most part to Jack Nicholson s one off mafia boss Plenty of laughs to be had there The movie for me had the unfortunate luck of following a preview for 300 which i couldn t get out of my head for most of the movie 8 out of 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1510281/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2007,"Strictly for Fans of Exploding Heads and Naughty Words; Otherwise, a Complete Bore",The Departed is garbage I don t care how many awards it got I don t care if Martin Scorcese is such a capital J Genius that his feet don t stink I don t care if critics reached for their thesauruses in competition for synonyms for Brilliant The Departed s appeal is strictly to those who like watching heads explode on camera and think that if a movie uses every naughty word in the book in every line that makes it deep and profound Anyone who swallowed The Departed needs to have his stomach pumped Good grief Shakespeare the Greek tragedies classics like The Third Man would be lost on these people As would a truly fine movie from 2006 The Lives of Others beside which The Departed looks at best amateurish and adolescent I want my money back And I saw this movie for free I was so bored I started rearranging the groceries in my bag about ten minutes in I looked at my watch at least half a dozen times I thought up drinking games you could play every time Jack Nicholson utters the word Several characters are shot or dropped to death on camera A man s eyes are poked out One character is reduced to a drug dependent quivering wreck I didn t care I was amazed at how much I didn t care I thought about why I examined the desert emptiness of the script other than for its resplendently brandished naughty words reflected that the plot was so bankrupt it could be in chapter 11 I noted how absent characterization was except to mete out how often each character said or his posture when exploding a head I pondered gossip column narratives involving Alec Baldwin and remembered how cute Mark Wahlberg was in that Calvin Klein ad I wondered if Leo were still dating the model An hour into the marathon that was this Guantanamo torture I realized that I had been so pounded into boredom and apathy that the only thing that would have aroused me was if the entire oh so manly cast were suddenly to don black net hose and stilettos and sing the rest of their lines in Gilbert and Sullivan musical style I hoped against hope that Leslie Nielsen would appear and reveal the entire thing to be a very obscure farce whose humor would gel once Nielsen put it all into Airplane esque perspective Was Martin Scorcese trying to prove his own manhood by creating a dystopic Disneyland in which every ride is manned by a cop or a mafioso exploding heads and blurting out swear words Scorcese insults manhood worse than Andrea Dworkin As for art I guess Scorcese never heard the phrase less is more As it happens I had just seen 1947 s The Third Man the night before The Third Man is black and white its budget compared to The Departed s was tiny The cast excepting Orson Welles consisted of character actors or unknowns In The Departed Jack Nicholson playing a Very Bad Man toys with a severed human hand What hits you is not the shock and awe the scene demands but the pathos that the movie is so desperately needy for its audience to respond and so without skill at provoking that response that it resorts to the kind of gory tricks a Halloween prankster would pull In The Third Man Orson Welles delivers the cuckoo clock speech All he does is talk and what he says chilled me and frightened me so thoroughly I ll never forget it Now that s a classic film The Departed Garbage,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1681524/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2006,Departed is Never close to being Good.,Whoever says The Departed is Good brilliant or Even Purfect is clueless about how a good movie should be 10 points to prove Departed isn t close to being a good movie 1 The entire show was unbalanced when Jack Nicholsan allegedly changed his script on top of the demand for a meatier role Scorsese was believed to have rewritten the script to suit him and to make Jack agree in joining the cast This led to awkward focus on him for the first half of the movie Totally unncessary and time wasting 2 Poor choice of Leo s mentor A better choice would be Robert DeNiro Someone tough in appearance but with an angel s heart Sheen jus looked too too soft and powerless 3 This remake took in a few points from Infernal II where Tony Leung s Leo character s family history was explained in detail Leung s dad in the younger days was much a baddie than the present Jack traid gang leader Thus Jack when lunching with Leo said your dad Uncle would kill me and my family if he saw me sitting here with you However what the film didn t do was to show the viewers HOW would Sheen guide Leo into meeting Jack All the show did was to show Leo beat up a few guys the next moment viola Jack was lookin up for Leo by a short intro from Mr French All the intimate heartfelt exchanges between Leo his mentor was totally absent 4 The show was BORING for the first hour with lots of talking and talking a couple of fights and fuck you and that s it No wit for wit game for game kind of moves that have the Infernal Affairs so famous and cutting edge It was Only in the last half an hour that the show borrowed heavily from the original featured a mental game fight between the two male leads 5 Also in Infernal Affairs II the feud between Jack s and Sheen s characters was explained That resulted in a long time mutual understanding for each other Here Jack and Sheen were seen only exchanging superficial talks I will get you Frank Get me if you can Queen Duh My choice of Robert DeNiro fits perfectly into a scene Frank sipping coffee with Queen DeNiro at an English caf both chatting casually about their lives and memories but with an undercurrent running fiercely in the air Both know exactly what each other thinks and wants and laid down all their cards on the table except for their own lead It would be much enjoyable to see these two tough guys hitting hard on the other 6 Wahlberg s Dignam wasn t as someone said non existent in the original Infernal There was a character Inspector Cheung played by Ng Ting Yip in the HK version A powerful shoot from the hip kind of cop who stood by Leo s mentor Dignam was created with some motive BUT alas what he did was idiotic resigned but not contacting Leo WTF was he thinking 7 The fact that the show ended with all people dead well except for Dignam clearly shows that there s no thread for any Part II extension Just that simple It s certainly NOT as someone commented a brilliant move by Scorsese Geez some people just like topping Scorsese s head with tall hats and praises foolishly 8 Someone actually revealed that the scriptwriter deliberately did NOT watch the original Infernal while writing the Departed script so as not to get too close with it If this is true he should be given two bloody knocks on his d ck head Departed went so departed that the whole tension was absent for almost 2 3 of the show 9 Another commentator said Damon s character Sullivan was empty and deviated from the Infernal s He was spot on on this in Infernal Andy Lau wanted to be a good guy right from the beginning He always had wanted to be Out of the triad and be a good cop a good man Thus he killed all who would threaten his position In Departed we see Sullivan killing for virtually nothing Did he feel remorseful Or guilty Nooo a bloody empty soul created by the brilliant Scorsese 10 The WORST of all the classic scene of both leads pitting their wits against each other in the infamous two gangs transaction In Infernal Leung Leo was using Morse Code a brilliant move via an antenna to contact his mentor while on the other hand Andy Damon was to use comp to send out text messages to his boss for notification There was an info leakage and Leung s mentor made a switch in radio frequency and called for a retreat but to realise at the last sec that the transaction would be at a beach Immediately the retreat was again cancelled with full force to head for the beach whilst the triad boss would call for a disposal of Cocaine All happened in a breath s time of few mins This in comparison to Departed is two knots higher Departed s scene of no camera installed for the back exit was laughable and idiotic,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1497645/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2021,A Deeply Absorbing Masterpiece by Scorcese,This film employs a brilliant plot device of parallelism by contrasting two characters one an undercover cop working to do good with another character a cop who appears to be pristine and ethical but has actually been planted to rise to the highest levels by the arch criminal and tragic Greek figure Jack Nicholson Thus the storyline follows classic elements of Greek drama over the course of nearly three hours Yes it s about Boston crime yes it s about a Boston crime figure who flourished for years by informing to the FBI on his rivals thus eliminating the competition which the FBI willingly turned a blind eye to for decades and yes it s a film with dozens of great actors spot on directing writing and epic Greek Tragic Dramatic level story arcs and resolutions One of cinemas great achievements A beautiful brilliant transcendent film luminous in its perfection,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6787893/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2006,Infernal Affairs Please..!,Stylish Exciting Thrilling ORIGINAL Oh Sorry I m talking about Infernal Affairs So you already know now that I do not feel positive about this remake This isn t the standard expected from the guy who we loved after Taxi Driver Raging Bull Casino GOOD FELLA s All I will say is the film just attach s clustered elements of the original The characters psychology is seriously weak compared to IA but even if we do not compare the 2 The Departed just doesn t make much sense and is I really am choosing my words carefully here LAZY Who What Where When Why There is too much talking too much unnecessary scenarios too much confusion on the characters the film dived straight into the characters and not revealing why Damon becomes a cop Things just happen in this film There is no sense of compassion towards DiCaprio unlike Tony Leungs portrayal I really respect Andy Lau he was very polite to rate this boring 2hr film 8 out of 10 The only thing he did comment on was the character psychology Now I know why Sometimes you don t need to try so hard to be effective As Infernal Affairs was effortlessly cool Departed even with Jack Nicholson is just Painfully Bad Slow paced not much happens audiences do not feel too involved Overall Poor Remake or a Classic,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1497579/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2006,Martin Scorsese as we like it,Leonardo DiCaprio shines in Martin Scorsese s new gangster movie The Departed Mat Dammon Jack Nicholson Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen and especially Mark Wahlberg throw in their talents as well to make this one of the most entertaining films of the year I would go as far to call this the most entertaining film Scorsese had made since the great Goodfellas although his Casino came pretty close This is simply what the man does best lifting an average story up to greatness This is not an attack to the original Infernal Affairs on which this film is based on which was great as well but the Scorsese magic is seen here in all its glory The plot circles around two infiltrating people One of them is an undercover cop named Billy DiCaprio who joins the team of a gangster named Frank Costello Nicholson The other is one of Costello s man named Colin Sullivan Damon who joins the Boston police department These two young men are trying to discover the identity of the other and at the same keep their own identity covered Sheen Baldwin and Wahlberg belong to the Boston police all playing their part in this complex tale I say complex but Scorsese makes sure the audience knows who is who and why they act the way they do I have said about enough about the plot which is more fun if you do not know too much For this film is probably best if Infernal Affairs is not seen either If you do not have too much problems with the bloodshed we have seen in earlier Scorsese films this is the film for you Technically brilliant uncompromising and arguably the most entertaining film from 2006 from start to finish,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1536963/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2007,Just an amazing example of cinema ...,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1597935/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2009,weakest cop film i have ever seen,i watched the whole movie just to understand what was in this movie that entertained the people and made martin Scorsese win an academy award and i would say there was nothing that i found this movie was awful in each and every aspect the story was weak it was simple and there was no twist or thrills people who liked this movie were talking about how corrupt those cops were come on this happens in each and every country there was nothing to be surprised I still don t understand how did martin Scorsese win an academy award for best director infact i found this movie to be poorly directed i give it 1 10 this movie is not for those people who are expecting thrill or plot twists,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2178176/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2007,"Right award, wrong movie!",No film buffs or Scorsese fans are going to take my word for it but here goes a warning I need to get off my chest THE DEPARTED is a wretched way to slowly waste 2 5 hours of your life We get Marty s little auteur flourishes all of which we ve seen repeatedly since GOODFELLAS sprinkled heavily over the blandest spaghetti bowl of a plot The actors don t lack for talent but here they seem to have been directed to give flashy soliloquies and never actually interact with each other The film is like a whole series of audition readings where each actor is reading his part alone on a stage There can t be much chemistry if each chemical is kept in its own test tube Jack reprises his Joker role except here he was encouraged to ham it up a little more That said he s the only aspect of this train wreck that kept me from giving the film one star instead of three Sorry Mr Nicholson it wasn t your fault Sure sneer at me because Marty won the BD Oscar I can only conclude that 2006 was a year weak enough to console him for being robbed when he made GOODFELLAS a great film that he has been remaking over and over But this version stinks and its success at the Academy Awards just means we will get loads of copycats who think this is what they should be chasing OK now go ahead and waste your time watching it,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1625823/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2007,The Departed vs Infernal Affairs,The Departed is one of the best cop moves in years I hadn t heard of Infernal Affairs before watching The Departed and had only a vague inkling that The Departed was based on some Hong Kong film For the first 90 of its length The Departed promises to be a classic an all time great It s a film of restrained violence that serves the plot A cop DiCaprio is planted as a mole in a crime gang headed by Jack Nichoson His task to report on the gang s activities with the eventual object of nabbing the whole bunch including Nicholson The ingenious touch is that Nicholson too has a mole Damon in the police Damon s task is to report to Nicholson on the police investigations on his gang so that Nicholson knows when to go ahead with a deal when to keep low or in some cases Damon would clear the way of police so that Nicholson can go ahead with his plans Both these moles have been operating in their respective roles for years So much so that Damon is actually becoming quite a good cop with a moral dilemma while DiCaprio is becoming quite a bad ass with an equally desperate dilemma he knows if he plays gangster too long he might actually be one for the rest of his life DiCaprio is desperate to get out of his predicament and begs the only two cops who know of his identity as a mole Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg to let him back into the police Before his career as a mole began his records with the police were all deleted Without Sheen and Wahlberg no one could identify Dicaprio as a cop This already tense situation is compounded no end when each side discovers at around the same time that each has a mole in the other s ranks To ensure their own survival Damon and Dicaprio work feverishly to find out each other s identity and the tension grips you We are taken through several set piece sequences to what seems likely to be an unbearably tense finale but at this point the move lets us down There is one too many killings at the end and I was left wondering whether the serious film making I had witnessed approaching the end was meant to be taken seriously as the end sequences are almost comic Nevertheless the ingenious plot device the powerhouse performances by the leading cast led by DiCaprio make this a very good highly watchable film But I was a little disappointed by the ending Not long after I found out that this was based on the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs made in 2002 and proceeded to get my hands on it My main motive was to find out if the ending was handled any better Since this is a review of The Departed I ll keep my comments on Infernal Affairs very brief Suffice to say that the latter is much the better film It s 50 mins shorter but in no way loses out in terms of character development As far as I can see The Departed was 50 mins longer only for the sake of character development The ending of Infernal Affais is more restrained and far more effective Indeed Infernal Affairs is one of the great cop movies in history in any language The Departed cannot be considered as anything other than a remake All the key set pieces are copied wholesale from Infernal Affairs as of course is the plot Martin Scorcese is long overdue for an Oscar and as everyone knows is nominated this year for The Departed For a Director who has made such original classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull to win for this would be almost an insult No doubt he feels differently,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1604652/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2006,"Too long, too noisy, too boring - a pastiche",What IS it with Scorsese and endless VIOLENCE actual violence communication violence interpersonal violence and on and on Another East coast violent gang movie in 2006 I don t think so thank you very much If it had been made in 1990 then maybe But today we have enough real violence on the TV news each night about a real increasingly violent world Nothing fictional can compare any more and it is pointless to try Where was all the subtle character analysis and growth and inner dilemmas and on and on And Jack Nicholson hammed it up good and proper what else could he do at various points the audience in my theatre in the UK were LAUGHING And the movie was too too too L O N G And as for the number of tedious F words seemed like the scriptwriter was trying to vie with J D Salinger in The Catcher in the Rye for the number of G D s In today s world Pathetic Come on Marty baby you CAN do better than this before you get too old to try,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1502652/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,Scorsese Can Do Better And The Original Is A Masterpiece,Infernal Affairs is one of the genuine classics of HK crime cinema This remake though directed by the legendary Scorsese is not nearly ass good and represents one of Scorsese s weakest films The story is still good and the performances are fine but as a viewer I am constantly reminded of how this story has been told and presented in a better way previously Check it out and form your own opinions but please watch Infernal Affairs too Sadly a mediocre remake of a classic 5 out of 10,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5490608/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2020,A very particular crime movie,This is one of Martin Scorsese s best movies maybe his best The movie is shot and directed in a very good way I haven t really seen before The characters are played amazingly Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson and all the other A list actors were a lot of fun to watch on screen But Mark Walhburg takes the cake for me To leave it as vague as possible I love how he ends up The twists and turns of this movie are amazing and the ending is just mind blowing,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5963314/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2014,Ridiculously overrated.,Maybe it deserves a 7 It is quite to very suspenseful with a valuably complex but not arcane plot well made solidly acted meaning in part that Jack Nicholson does not just re enact his job as the Joker DiCaprio was better in Blood Diamond The cast is indeed stunning But right now it is ranked above such trivial fare as Citizen Kane The Shining North by Northwest M Vertigo To Kill a Mockingbird Eternal Sunshine Bicycle Thieves citing only a few whose lower ranks make me want to vomit I know I am beating a dead horse It probably is after all better than Shawshank dumb fanboy movie of the world I guess Cuckoo s Nest Inception Forrest Gump and arguably 5 to 15 others in the top 46 But it has limited to no imagination and makes no contribution to film history Its best picture Oscar should ve gone to Pan s Labyrinth or Volver or conceivably The Lives of Others or Letters from Iwo Jima or Little Miss Sunshine three to five other films to rank ahead of Departed I haven t yet seen Infernal Affairs so I can t make that comparison But in a nutshell I know Taxi Driver and Departed is no Taxi Driver 68 Makes me nuts,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2934754/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2010,I can't believe this dross won any Oscars at all,A wonderful cast an interesting story reasonably good performances If only Scorcese hadn t directed it and whoever edited this over extended self preoccupied and frequently irrelevant series of plot points should be shot Plainly the stellar cast have congregated around Scorcese and it probably wouldn t have been made without him Obviously everyone involved were pretty pleased to be together on the project That comes through and that s good However a whole heap of entirely unimportant improvised tooling about by the ensemble desperately needs to be hacked out of the final reel which Scorcese plainly couldn t bring himself to do His affections for the cast have got in his way There is a good film hidden in this bad film Judicious cutting of VERY expendable material that does nothing for either character development or plot would deliver a terrific tight packed little thriller with enjoyable performances by most cast members Agree Mark Wahlberg did a great job and Di Caprio was very watchable Matt Damon extended his range a little but overall finds it hard to be anyone other than himself in this film and most others Fortunately he happens to be an interesting kind of guy,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2193241/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2018,Disappointing,It had so many stars and famous director yet it was boring and annoying with too many F words Plus Matt Damon tried too hard to act his character but he still failed to interpret such a complicated and paradoxical character or only paradoxical in the original version for in The Departed I did not find much paradox and struggling which should exist I guess people should let Damon continue to play roles who need to be saved That d be much better,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4022161/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2016,A Great Addition to an Amazing Filmography,Any film student or film aficionado can tell you the man behind such iconic movies as Taxi Driver Goodfellas and Raging Bull Martin Scorsese Scorsese may often work with the same actors and direct stories around criminal life but there is not a specific distinct style when it comes to his films as you would find with directors such as Tim Burton John Carpenter or Christopher Nolan I mean how can you compare Hugo to Casino stylistically What IS behind a lot of Scorsese s films is great storytelling and The Departed is no different Though Scorsese deserved an Oscar long before 2007 The Departed lives among some of his greatest work While it may not be a very diverse ensemble the cast in this film is simply phenomenal It consists of iconic white male actors both old and young pulling off their roles as cops and gang members perfectly and Vera Farmiga doing a good enough job as a therapist for young cops and undercover workers While Mark Wahlberg earned himself a deserving nomination for best supporting actor the actor who steals the show is Leonardo DiCaprio who probably would have also received a nomination if he had not worked on Blood Diamond the same exact year We don t know whether to be terrified of Costello Jack Nicholson or if we should nervously giggle at his dark sense of humor Alec Baldwin is at his A game as an excitable investigator Matt Damon is Boston personified and Martin Sheen reminds us why he shouldn t be associated with Charlie Sheen in this day and age Phenomenal work all around and one last note is as odd as this may sound Mark Wahlberg excels at swearing in this film Funny s Based on the foreign script Infernal Affairs which this critic is eager to watch The Departed is unsubtle in its focus on rats double agents both in the Irish mafia of Boston as well as the state police force Matt Damon is a man who was practically raised by Frank Costello to become a rat within the state police while Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young man who grew up in a notorious family who wants to turn his life around by becoming a true cop Nobody would believe him in a uniform so Sheen and Wahlberg ask him to gain Costello s trust and he becomes a rat within Costello s gang Morality is what is at stake in The Departed The morality of lying is the most notable since the film is focused on double agents but even the love triangle developed between Damon DiCaprio and Farmiga brings this into question DiCaprio tries to get under Farmiga s skin at first asking if she lies in general and as she gets closer to him she confesses that she would lie if her boyfriend Damon saw her together with DiCaprio As we realize that Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are not the only rats in the story it brings not only the morality of lying into question but also it calls for the audience to ask how we can determine who is on which side of the law Is there a line Is the law black and white Or are there exceptions when it comes to double agents While the narrative is amazing it is important to note that this film is littered with swearing and violence so keep that in mind if you re sensitive to these issues or if you are considering letting a child view this movie Regarding these same issues do NOT watch this film on cable TV as it is censored to the point where the dialogue becomes ridiculous and you cannot take the film seriously Other than that this film should one day become a required screening in college level film courses a true masterpiece 4 0 4 0,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3432572/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2015,Just An Ugly Film,OK First off I m glad to see that The Departed has as many detractors as it has admirers My objections to it for the most part have been filled in by other users Therefore I ll keep it brief The movie s characters just like its gushing audiences seem to suffer from attention deficit disorder As if they ve never read a book in their lives And it appears as if Scorcese had that in mind knowing fully well in advance that the film would appeal to people who seemingly have no problem with the F word being uttered every twelve seconds whether it s in the movies or in their actual everyday pedestrian conversations Which I ve found to be a problem with those who quite simply did not stay in school long enough And who would believe even for a second that two members of the Boston P D played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg would engage in banter graphically describing how each of them had sex with the other guy s mother at a meeting where the bulk of the attendees consists of top level Federal Agents What are these guys in the 8th Grade If I held that position in real life FBI CIA etc I while walking out on the two of them would look both in the eye and let them know what slobs they are Finally to switch gears I guess nobody thought the film went awry when Leo DiCaprio has apparently no trouble beating the hell out of two grown men from the Rhode Island branch of the Cosa Nostra man that s some muscle that got sent in from Providence huh All of it punctuated by the unnecessary not to mention perfunctory accompaniment of The Human Beinz Nobody But Me And later when one of Nicholson s men is being interrogated we are treated to about six and a half seconds of Sail On Sailor If you re anything like me when you think grueling questioning you think Beach Boys And don t get me started on the fact that this is an Oscar winning film the last ten minutes of which consist of not one not two not three but four count em men getting a bullet through his brain Lovely Just like the conclusion of Babe where the talking pig wins the Sheepdog Contest Guaranteed when you re at some guy s house apartment and you don t see any bookcases that if the subject of this film comes up he ll tell you just how terrific it was Childish pernicious drivel,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3193113/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2006,Unbelievable film,The Departed was one of the best movies I ve seen in awhile The characters including the minor roles were spectacular an humorous The story itself was well done and for a movie over two hours long it sure wasn t boring Martin Scorsese is one of the premiere directors of his generation He helped make Robert DeNiro one of the greatest movie actors ever and with the Departed he shows that he still has what it takes to make a clever movie With movies like Taxi Driver Raging Bull and Mean Streets to his credit The Departed fits rather well in that great selection of movies The plot is not real complex Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello the leader of the Irish Mafia in Boston The police department is trying to find hard evidence on him so they can finally arrest him They use a spy of their own named Billy Costigan Lenardo DeCaprio to try and get the information they need too finally catch the man However unknown to the police department Costello has his own mole planted in the FBI His name is Colin Sullivan Matt Damon and he always lets Costello know what s going down before the police can ever catch him This cat and mouse game is played throughout the entire movie and has the audience wondering how both characters Costigan and Sullivan are going to manage this all without being caught themselves This all leads to a violent conclusion which had everybody in shock Some people were disappointed and some were just plain surprised I was one of those that was surprised by what went down because it happens so quickly that the audience of the film has no time to react The final scene on the other hand is somewhat predictable and that alone is probably the only weakness of this film Overall this film is probably one of the best I ve seen all year All the characters were great even the minor ones Mark Wahlberg in particular has a hilarious role and I mean that in a good way Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin were also very good as was Vera Farmiga who plays a clinic psychologist for the police department Very well made movie and worth the ticket price,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1495081/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,"""...Do you lie?""",The Departed is the most entertaining kind of non stop intense crime thriller of the year maybe in the past few years Some critics have said that it s the best film that director Martin Scorsese has made since Goodfellas I understand where the compliment comes from though I slightly resent the subtle criticism in the charge as well meaning that Scorsese hasn t made a film as great or powerful or entertaining in over fifteen years I would even go far as saying this is Scorsese s best since well Scorsese s last film or at least since Gangs of New York Some may forget or maybe just not really take in how consistently strong Scorsese s career has been overall how he keeps on taking chances and still keeping his style so instictually cinematic he is possibly the biggest film geek ever so distinctive and even so fresh in the 21st century that his is a career akin to the likes of Kurosawa many masterpieces and otherwise very good to excellent efforts The difference though this time from some of his previous outings and this is perhaps the correlation with Goodfellas besides the obvious of genre linking is that it s pure devilish fun it goes by quickly but supremely satisfyingly over what doesn t really feel like 2 1 2 hours and it s cast is uniformly good Leonardo Di Caprio in particular is so impressive here and this may be the first viewing buzz talking it might be my favorite of all the performances I ve seen him in up till now Under Scorsese these past several years he s kind of grown up more and more from the oddly pubescent look to him even in his 20 s His performance as Costigan is often very ferocious and tough but he also makes it a fully rounded character one that he makes very much his own He has a dark past almost too dark to even be an informant for the Boston PD His whole family is messed up and there were even links to Frank Costello Jack Nicholson So what better way then to send Costigan into Costello s wing and see what comes out Then the flip side comes with Matt Damon s Colin who infiltrates the police department in legitimate fashion Damon s is the flip side as well in performance quality to Di Caprio while Di Caprio even when lying through his teeth is truthful to the bone and always believable Damon is pitch perfect as a bold faced liar as he never flinches for a moment even when caught like a deer in the headlights And the performances end up making a sort of square with Damon and Di Caprio in their own corners the bulk of the excellent supporting players Martin Sheen Marky Mark Wahlberg Ray Winstone Vera Farmiga in a breakthrough role on one and Jack Nicholson all on his own That was the first thing about hearing of the Departed that had me psyched knowing that one of the great stars actors of the past 40 years was teaming up with someone with a stature and track record like Scorsese s With Nicholson in the role Frank Costello is at first already a character to feel is the man in the room when he walks in and talks But as far as performance goes it s vintage Nicholson all the way digging into it with the style vigor wit charm and all that and a bag of shark grin chips that have made Nicholson so remarkable His is such a dastardly character that it teeters on becoming self parody but both director and actor know how to reel the part in to being someone to fear while also being someone who s a helluva lot of fun It s worthy of an Oscar nomination and not just because it s Nicholson in a movie As for the director and his crew they have assembled what could be by the bare essentials nothing more than a genre film with a premise that seems a little cooked up But of course it is a remake of a trilogy of Hong Kong police pictures so that may be why the premise and story feels not completely original even as it s passing itself off as one Yet that too didn t detract If anything I felt as if Scorsese was doing what very few filmmakers working today particularly this year if you look at what s come out don t do which is to take material and not just do a simple remake but to do a re imaging a refashioning a full on reinterpretation into the deeper aspects in this case the morality and sense of loss among all of these characters There s some religious bits put in as it IS Scorsese after all but this time there isn t something like in Mean Streets where it s always there in the background Here the characters are on like in Goodfellas a version of hell where things all do come to a head the last thirty minutes had me laughing cringing and mouth agape in equal measures In other words go see this film if you think it might be up your alley and you think you were burned by Scorsese ever since he left behind modern time crime pictures ten years ago,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491272/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2012,A real shame,This film is so overrated Martin Scorsese gave us a poor copy of the masterpiece Infernal Affairs and everybody applause He received an Oscar for best motion picture for it It s such a shame it s revolting I can understand that they wanted to reward Scorsese for his career but they rewarded a bad remake 1 It s a lame plagiarism 2 DiCaprio is very good as usual Maybe HE is the only good reason to see it But Tony Leung is unforgettable for this character 3 It s rude for no good reason 4 It s a 2h30 film Scorsese did a confused remake that s almost 1 hour longer than the original There s definitely something wrong here I m sure that the people who love this film didn t see the original Well if you read this go watch Infernal Affairs You will see that s an amazing film And you will understand why some people think Departed is awful,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2612730/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2008,User Rating: 8.5/10?? why?,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1911021/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2020,The Departed: Filmmaking at its Peak,What a magnificent movie this was The acting directing writing production design song choices all were brilliant I think Jack Nicholson is the movie s indispensable factor The Nicholson Leo and Nicholson Damon relations were by far the best part of this movie The dialogues were sharp the acting was fabulous and the directing was awe inspiring Just like all the Scorsese pictures this movie takes its time at the start and delivers magnificently at the end There were a lot of unexpected events in this movie compared to Scorsese s other movies which I really enjoyed Brilliant movie go check it out if you haven t already,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5886454/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2011,King Martin conquers Boston,Martin Scorsese hits the mean streets again in his triumphant return to the crime genre that has justified his position as arguably the world s greatest living filmmaker The Departed a remake of the well acclaimed Hong Kong grit fest Infernal Affairs follows the complicated lives of Billy Costigan former criminal turned undercover cop Colin Sullivan current criminal who s weeded his way into the police force and Frank Costello the seemingly infallible Don who s array of memorable quotes have made The Departed the most naturally quotable film since Mean Girls This film is always contained in the mind and hands of Scorsese we never forget that this is his project and his influence is constantly felt throughout the film The cinematography employed reminds us of some of the director s earliest projects and that he certainly hasn t lost his touch The trademark quick cuts flashbacks and general detail offered to every aspect of every scene are all on display The integration of dated yet actual footage of the Boston race riots with the commanding satisfied voice of Jack Nicholson s Costello creates one of the most engaging opening scenes in recent film history Frank Costello reminisces about years ago when we had the church and that even today no one gives it to you you have to take it all to the tune of Gimme Shelter a song that has largely defined all Scorcesean works post Goodfellas But don t be fooled this is not the stereotypical Don who can t believe business is no longer conducted the way it was in the old country Flunking out of the Corleone School of Business it appears that Frank controls every aspect of his universe with an iron fist and a silver tongue until his own flaws come to the forefront in a denouement scene that could be seen as uncharacteristically clich if it weren t so masterfully acted out in front of us For all intents the acting in its purest form is the strongest suit of The Departed Essentially an ensemble film Dicaprio and Damon exceed expectations while Crazy Jack adopts his most blatantly villainous role since The Shining Marky Mark is delightfully hateable and the rest of his Funky Bunch Sheen Baldwin and Farmiga make themselves known as well One of my film osophies is that one can distinguish a good director from a great one on how they apply a comic relief character within the plot of their film Baldwin s portrayal of Ellerby is witty used sparingly a crucial quality and has a genuine respect and passion for his work within the force giving him a somewhat larger scope for character development than just being the laugh generator in what is otherwise a very serious film While The Departed goes against the mould of earlier Scorsese dramas which typically focused on the goings on around a single crucial protagonist it does retain the fact that each primary character has very obvious flaws that will be inevitably extracted and exploited as the film progresses I find this to be not only a treat to watch unravel from a creative perspective but also the central message of the film humans by their very condition are morally flawed and that the consequences of their actions upon society have greater reaches than the effect of those consequences on any one person If there was to be any criticism imposed upon this film it is that the intended plot controls the characters rather than the character s dictating where the story is going This might need to be made a little clearer In films such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull the story does not go anywhere unless Travis or Jake respectively choose to steer it in that direction With The Departed the characters merely serve as a vehicle for getting parts of the story from A to B or to connect the plot in a plausible manner and several scenes towards the conclusion seem somewhat too convenient for a film that has a lot to say about the implications humans have on the world around them That said this remains a highly enjoyable film but one that benefits infinitely from multiple viewings After eventually deciphering who dies where they die and why they died in your first sitting it is advisable that you re watch the film This allows you to delve very deeply into the persona of each major character and gain a subsequent understanding and appreciation of one of the best examples of ensemble cast filmmaking in the history of dramatic cinema There s nothing I love more than a bit of feedback good or bad So drop me a line on jnatsis iprimus com au and let me know what you thought of my review,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2379309/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2006,don't believe the hype,just saw this movie absolutely pointless everyone can fluff Scorsese Nicholson etc but this movie is not that good everyone may think its good because all movies now are garbage however a better smelling bag of garbage beside a worse smelling bag of garbage is still a bag of garbage DiCaprio does a good job and Damon is surprisingly good but the story is just so blah and predictable that it is easy to fall asleep while watching the movie in my opinion the movie does not focus enough on one character to facilitate viewer involvement also the music is not prominent enough and some of it is recycled from other Scorcese films which makes a veteran movie goer such as myself think Scorcese should ride off into the sunset,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1501851/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2006,HUGE disappointment,Never boring but the actors are so wired the dialog so colorlessly profane and the plot so thin you realize it s a puzzle where the pieces don t fit The most laughable scenes are Mark Wahlberg s at the beginning where he is taunting DiCaprio it never leads anywhere and you don t know why he is doing it Martin Sheen sits there doing nothing either as an actor or a character The only female character who isn t a whore is part of a plot so predictable you wonder why they bothered it has so little payoff There are plenty of good moments good violence and exciting chases But the ending of the movie gets so cluttered with so many twists it undermines the original cat and mouse war between DiCarpio and Damon The movie makes you think it is building to this classic showdown but strange plot diversions endless double crosses and lame exposition from secondary characters ruins the tension and you are left with violence as a substitute for suspense You have never seen so many great actors assembled for so little purpose and such mediocre results Goodfellas represents ensemble work at its best The Departed is selfish solo work that allows all the actors to do what they do best except realize they are in the same movie together,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492390/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2007,"Scorcese's Long Overdue Oscar win is quite simply, a masterpiece",Martin Scorcese finally snagged a Best Director Oscar for THE DEPARTED and though there are some myself included who do not feel this was his best work the film is more than worthy of the Director Oscar it finally nailed for Scorcese as well as the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year that it also received This exquisitely mounted epic tale looks at the war between the police and the mob in South Boston supposedly during the 70 s and 80 s centering primarily on three characters Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio is a young cop with a shady family legacy who is sent deep undercover to get the goods on renowned Boston mob boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan a young man who grew up working for Costello a la Ray Liotta s character in GOODFELLAS but also becomes a police officer A two way cat and mouse game ensues as Costello tries to learn which member of his organization is a cop while the police try to figure out which one of their officers is a stooge to Costello The race to learn which rat is where advances to the point where Sullivan is actually assigned to in so many words rat out himself Scorcese offers one of the greatest examples I have seen in years of storytelling on screen with a meticulous and detailed screenplay that requires complete attention not to mention multiple viewings to fully appreciated the multi layered story presented here Scorcese s direction is crisp and in your face as always and surprises are offered around every corner of the story told here Every time you think you ve figure it out the story takes another detour and if you miss anything you will be confused DiCaprio offers the best performance of his career as the tortured Costigan and he might have won the Oscar if he had been nominated for this instead of BLOOD DIAMOND Matt Damon s richly complex portrayal of Collin Sullivan hits the bullseye as does Nicholson s expectedly ruthless mafioso Mark Wahlberg received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his razor sharp performance as DiCaprio and Damon s 2nd commanding officer who allows matters to get personal Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen Ray Winstone and Anthony Anderson also register in strong supporting roles but it is primarily the compelling story masterful direction by Scorcese and the three electrifying lead performances that make this film an instant classic not to be missed,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1766319/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2007,"Not bad, but undisciplined, unoriginal and silly",Goodfellas was generally worthy of a best picture Oscar Unfortunately it was released the same year as Dances With Wolves and lost out to it rightfully so to be honest but only becayse Dances With Wolves was a rare masterpiece The Departed faced little competition the year it was released and Scorsese did deserve a best picture Oscar so this film seems to have been given that accolade but probably didn t deserve it This is far from Scorsese s best work There are a number of problems First this film was based on a foreign film called Infernal Affairs and in my view the film really doesn t depart from the original much at all if you ll forgive the pun Ultimately this made the film easier to make and there s an obvious lack of originality at the end of the day Then there was the undisciplined Jack Nicholson Somehow it felt like they told Jack what the scene was generally about and let him improvise his entire dialog and acting It was way too over the top and muddled the film s tone even though it was fairly amusing I think keeping him in check and directing him properly would have made for a better film The fact that it borrowed some cinematic styling and even songs from Goodfellas and Casino resulting in a bit of a recycled finish to the film In addition there are some scripting issues and over exaggerated portrayals such as Marky Mark s crude and often stupid character Similar for Alec Baldwin It didn t add anything to film s depth and seemed contrived and overdone for the sake of contrast Di Caprio played the same old part he always plays and while some disagree I don t rate him as a serious actor Though Scorsese seems to like recasting him Matt Damon played his part well though The long winded far fetched twists and turns became ridiculous by the end Not a film that one would bother re watching in the years to come unlike Scorcese s previous efforts,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1654937/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2011,Serious men,IMDb Top 250 58 The Departed is like Goodfellas for the next decade It has crime music and Scorcese at the reigns While it cannot replicate the magic of Goodfellas which will never happen The Departed tells a different kind of crime story with great success If you didn t know The Departed is about the Irish mafia in Boston shown from both sides of the law The tale is quickly paced with lots of angry looking men There s several twists and unexpected moments that will affect you in various ways Gritty and violent The Departed gets in your face The film centers on men who are on both sides of the law or so it appears DiCaprio is excellent as Bill a rookie cop in a family with a history of crime who is sent undercover His anger is very well conveyed Leo does a great job He is backed by Queenan Martin Sheen and Dignam Mark Wahlberg Sheen may be the only reasonable person in the entire film and he s a good foil for the vulgar Digham played well by Wahlberg who acted from experience They re all going after Costello in another superb performance this one by Jack Nicholson He s a little crazy and a great villain His informant in the police is Sullivan played by a mostly straight Matt Damon He does the role justice but doesn t stand out This is very evidently a Scorcese picture Great shots including a cool intro with Costello where his face is just out of the light until the reveal The pace is fast and the film is well edited Music accompanies but ends abruptly or is nearly silenced It doesn t work as well as Goodfellas or Casino For some reason Gimme Shelter is played twice as is the most fitting Shipping Up to Boston Crime fans and fans of Scorcese need to see this and those who can stomach the brutal violence and copious amounts of swearing should see why this won Best Picture Serious men indeed 8 6 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2482649/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2006,Departed...? Left the building more like...,You can include Martin Scorsese in that Was looking for greatness tonight in this film and I knew we were in trouble when Ray Winstone opened his mouth Why hire the guy then give him some odd transatlantic accent He should be a no nonsense gorblimey Londoner And so the film went down the pan Crap plotting didn t know or care who was who or doing what to whom Jack was 2 dimensional like The Joker without the makeup and the rest of it was like a foul mouthed Ocean s 11 Michael Mann s Heat was a better two handed cop flick by miles and I never thought I d find myself saying that about Martin Scorsese Two of the greatest films of all time under his belt need you ask Raging Bull and Goodfellas And now this Lack of attention to detail and a pursuit of the box office have brought the Master low Yes Di Caprio worked for it but his best ever performance was in Catch Me If You Can And when will Matt Damon stop swanking around and get back to playing Jason Bourne And why oh why the Psycho and Third Man ripoffs Just to show he can do it The rest is silence Gone Departed,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491738/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,"Beautifully directed, acted, written and edited",Martin Scorsese has had many collaborations with Leonardo DiCaprio The Wolf of Wall Street is my favourite of them but The Departed comes at a close second The Departed follows Billy Costigan who is an undercover cop working to infiltrate Frank Costello s gang whilst Colin Sullivan is a mole in the police force working for Costello as he pretends to infiltrate Costello s gang Scorsese is known for his mob flicks and The Departed is an example of one of his best works What makes this film work so well is the direction acting writing soundtrack and editing The performances are all fantastic and it s sad that only one got nominated for an Oscar This is one of Leonardo DiCaprio s best performances His acting is a major reason as to why the audience cares about his character It s amazing how he switches emotions when he s with the police and when he s in Costello s gang in order to avoid suspicion He does it so naturally and should ve got a nomination at least Matt Damon is also fantastic here as usual and suits his role extremely well Jack Nicholson is mesmerising in every scene he s in truly embodying the character of Frank Costello He s fierce funny and has a huge presence when he s on screen Mark Wahlberg gives probably the best performance of his career Despite his short role he completely steals the show in every scene he s in as the foul mouthed abusive cop He s absolutely hilarious a joy to watch and deserves his Oscar nomination Martin Sheen is also terrific and Alec Baldwin is also great and hilarious during some scenes The film is very long but Thelma Schoonmaker s incredible editing and Scorsese s impeccable direction keep it from being a bore There is a sense of tension as we see this cat and mouse game unfold especially with DiCaprio s character as to whether or not he will get caught The film gets more tense as it goes on leading to an epic finale that completely shocked me as it happened The song choices are also wonderful and fit very well with the film s location and tone which is expected from a Scorsese film A massive contribution to The Departed s greatness is William Monahan s smart and witty script The dialogues are sharp funny and the actors make them sound so natural Some of the lines are absolutely hysterical especially the ones given to Wahlberg Baldwin and Nicholson which provides great levity to the suspense and serious tone The Departed is yet another fantastic Martin Scorsese film It s great to see him finally get his overdue Oscar because he deserved it a long time ago I would definitely recommend seeing The Departed It s beautifully directed acted written and has enough thrills to enjoy,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7082579/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2007,Entertaining Gangster Movie,If you like Scorsese you will definitely enjoy this movie For those like me who are less convinced of his genius it is still an entertaining gangster movie Many critics voted this as the best movie made in 2006 The film is well made but I have always failed to understand his Scorsese s films are so loved by critics I know cops and I ve worked with the Russian mob and the characters in Scorsese s movies have always seemed phony to me Colin Sullivan Matt Damon and William Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio are Boston police officers Costigan agrees to go undercover to catch local crime boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson Costello runs a protection racket and sells drugs Some of Costigan s family members have a background in crime so he is accepted into the gang Sullivan has known Costello since childhood and becomes his mole in the police department Costello s tips allow Sullivan achieve accelerated promotion and become the superstar of the police department Damon and DiCaprio spend most of the film trying to unmask each other They also become involved with the same woman Vera Farmiga a therapist In Scorsese s world everyone men are macho sociopaths There is plenty of high decibel screaming and swearing His characters don t mind killing and torturing and violence is just another form of communication Women are either whores or mothers or like Vera Farmiga s character they act like both The cops and villains seem interchangeable In fact half the thugs seem to be working for some government agency Police Captain Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen seems to be the only normal guy in the movie The police behavior is occasionally so extreme that the movie loses credibility Sullivan s boss Alec Baldwin beats up a police technician because he makes a mistake Sergeant Digham Mark Wahlberg abuses everyone and gets into fisticuffs with both Damon and DiCaprio who are supposed to be on his side Sullivan seems to be in it for the money but none of his colleagues questions how a police officer in his twenties can afford to live in a large expensive apartment in the Beacon Hill area of Boston It s not clear why DiCaprio with a 1400 SAT score would agree to go undercover and mix with psychos for an indefinite period The movie has a cast of superstars but Damon and DiCaprio both seem a little too familiar and congenial to be believable tough guys Nicholson looked as if he had wandered in from a romantic comedy He seemed too old and lacked the menace the part demanded DiCaprio gives a one note performance as a grim angry man That said if you like crime dramas you will be entertained There is plenty of action and the actors ham it up to attract your attention,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1624250/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2007,Marty would have won the Oscar if he used trained chimps in this movie...,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1625202/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2009,"F***ing s***, this won the f***ing Academy f***ing awards??!??",First is it me or is it still the in thing these days to act tough by saying f ALL the time This movie is littered with f every other word It makes the movie so 80s All the subtleties are lost by the poor dialogue As you know this movie is based of a hong kong made movie Infernal Affairs If you have the chance watch that version The plot is similar but it has a lot more subtleties that this movie failed to produce I m very surprised that this movie won the best picture and directing It s an entertaining movie no doubt but it s definitely not up to par,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2032444/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2015,Scorsese Classic,This is as great of a movie as you can get Undoubtedly it is one of the most complete movies of the 2000s The story line is engaging breathtaking and genius The cinematography is what you would expect from an Scorsese movie and directing is top notch It won the Academy Awards for Best Picture Best Directing Best Writing and Best Editing to back that claim Then comes the cast of absolute all stars DiCaprio Damon Nicholson Wahlberg Martin Sheen and Baldwin In today s movies it seems like every time too many starts are placed in a movie it backfires but not in a Scorsese movie DiCaprio delivered an Oscar deserving performance and was absolutely robbed by the Academy Nicholson once again proved to everyone why he is one of the best actors of all time as if anyone would disagree Damon was great although he struggled a bit to establish himself in accordance to his character s personality however he was able to pull it off one way or another and complete the story Whalberg was as usual his own self and somehow his personality translated perfectly to his character Overall it was a great all around effort by every actor in the movie even those who didn t receive much screen time to prove that the casting was flawless The story developed well providing the essential back story and taking the time to develop each character thoroughly Although it seemed as if the ending was slightly rushed even though this was a two and a half hour movie the climax with all its plot twists unfolded as smoothly as the director intended This is a must see movie for any fan of Crime Drama Thriller movies It is also captures some of the best performances by all the main actors whose fans can not go on without watching apologies for not putting the time to proof read this review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3382932/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2023,Scorsese's 'The Departed' a Masterful Crime Drama with Expertly Crafted Suspense and Superb Performances,The Departed 2006 is a masterful crime drama that skillfully weaves a complex web of deceit corruption and loyalty Director Martin Scorsese delivers a captivating and suspenseful story drawing exceptional performances from a star studded cast The film tells the story of two undercover agents played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon who infiltrate opposite sides of the law in an attempt to bring down the Irish American organized crime syndicate in Boston The tension and suspense are palpable with each character struggling to navigate the treacherous moral landscape of their respective roles The film is expertly paced with well crafted action sequences and dramatic twists that keep the audience on the edge of their seats The supporting cast including Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen are all excellent in their roles bringing depth and complexity to their characters The film s thematic exploration of loyalty betrayal and identity is thought provoking and emotionally resonant Overall The Departed is a thrilling intense and expertly crafted crime drama that ranks among the best in its genre,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8951731/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2006,"The Dee-PAH-tid, as we say here.",Well where to start Martin Sheen gets Most exaggerated Boston accent Award Jack Nicholson gets Most like here s johnny Award again Alec Baldwin gets the He really looked and acted like a local Irish American bully cop Award No awards for Marky W he was just playing himself back in Southie Great retelling of a notorious Boston story Can t wait to see the one about the Big Dig Mr Monahan I hope Whitey and his brother Billy Bulger got a chance to see this one I think Scorcese went a little Little Italy on the violence Too many bullet wounds and not enough baseball bats and beer bottles the more traditional weapons of Boston hoodlums A gripping suspense thriller most of the time A short 152 minutes It s a shame that Monahan s villains met a moralistic end Life here in Boston just hasn t worked out that way,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1501301/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2007,"Shame on Scorsese, watch Infernal Affairs instead.",Before I saw the Departed I knew it was a remake of Infernal Affairs so I expected the basic plot to be the same What I did not expect was for Scorsese to shamelessly copy Infernal Affairs practically scene for scene word for word in some places All Scorsese does is change the title the setting the characters names add 50 superfluous minutes two unnecessary characters and a cop out ending Scorsese is a great director and deserved an Oscar long ago but for him to accept an academy award for this outrageous piece of plagiarism is a disgrace The really sad thing is that so many people have watched and will watch this thinking its a good original thriller unaware that they are watching a cheap imitation of a truly great Hong Kong film So please do yourself a favour and watch Infernal Affairs first only then will you realise what a sham the Departed really is,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1714217/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2020,Absolutely brilliant - albeit a bit long,The story is great Good Cop goes undercover as a criminal and a criminal goes undercover as a Bad Cop And then they are tasked to finding each other out The suspense just gets thicker and thicker and in the end you can cut it with a knife The leading names are legio and totally excellent I might especially mention Jack Nicholson Wow Lots of head shots and lots of minutes Scorsese could have cut the whole shrink and love story bit out and replaced it with even more head shots if you ask me The last ten minutes or so are absolutely genius,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5816604/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,"Without Nicholson, Departed Would Have Been Better",The Departed is pretty good but not because its large cast is good or because of Martin Scorcese s direction Its good because the original Chinese film its copied from Infernal Affairs 2004 was probably a superior script I m rushing to get a copy from Netflix as we speak The story is about two impersonators who have infiltrated the Boston Police Department One is employed by the Police Department to find any moles who might have penetrated the force The other works for Boston Mobster Frank Costello not related at all to the Mafioso who rapped his knuckles on a congressional desk in the fifties during a televised hearing about organized crime Jack Nicholson plays Costello and wrecks the movie pretty much In interviews this weekend Nicholson said he wasn t inclined to be in the film because the Costello role was little more than a cameo But Scorcese had the part built up for Nicholson hurting the film in the process The film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department Leo De Caprio and Matt Damon play the spies De Caprio is better than Damon but not by much De Caprio knots up his forehead too often in order to be taken seriously as a slightly troubled cop There s a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to But this is a great script Jack Nicholson s Costello is over the top damaging a pretty good film substantially De Caprio is off his mark too But this is the best Scorcese film in years better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio Nicholson is so awful and such a gargoyle he reminds me of Burl Ives who was terrible as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958 Nicholson is almost always miscast and overacting these days I think the last decent film he did was the Postman Always Rings Twice in roughly 1980 He hasn t been good in anything since but they keep paying him as if he s a bankable star Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Alex Baldwin Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good But Baldwin Farmiga and Wahlberg don t get enough time to act with Nicholson chewing scenery all the time The film due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises is quite good despite everything,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493004/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,"For me, so far, this is my least favourite Martin Scorsese movie",I really tried to like this film but it didn t completely work for me Granted it is very well made with stylish shots and striking locations the music is good Scorsese s direction is excellent though he has directed much better than here and Jack Nicholson does do his best work in years here However I never did find the movie that compelling the film does move in a somewhat mannered manner and there are parts that are either rushed underdeveloped or even predictable the sex scene was laughable Also I think The Departed is overlong and the ending was very underwhelming Then there is the script while it has been lauded for its complexity maybe I am being harsh but I found it too complex and needlessly convoluted too In terms of acting it was okay but nothing exceptional Nicholson excepted Leonardo DaCaprio plays a different role but for me it is a role that does not suit him while I didn t see anything special in Mark Wahlberg either Out of the cameos Ray Winstone s comes off best while Matt Damon is the real weak link being very blank faced and monotone throughout Overall not terrible but a disappointment As far as Scorsese movies go I would put Goodfellas Taxi Driver and Raging Bull over this any day 5 10 Bethany Cox,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2366511/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2007,Give the man an Oscar already!,The Departed is another knock out blow from director Martin Scorsese A gritty fast paced and highly impressive cops versus robbers fable that is reminiscent of his old classics and makes for a riveting cinema experience With the awards ceremony season in full swing and the Oscars just around the corner it d be a real shame if he didn t walk away with at least one golden statue having been denied them so long as it is a very impressive movie At turns it is both tense violent funny dark and packed with so many terrific performances it is hard to pick a standout and should hopefully be remembered as one of the best films of 2006 Returning to gangland sees Scorsese tackling the underworld from a slightly different perspective Set in the world of the Irish mafia it differs from his Italian American gangster pictures by showing us contrasting elements on both sides of the law in the shape of Leonardo Di Caprio s police mole within the gang and Matt Damon s gang mole within the police As the police force led by Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin struggle to take down Jack Nicholson s kingpin the two moles become aware of each other s existence and are soon caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse All of which might sound familiar and to no surprise for as has been widely publicised The Departed is a Western riff on the classic Hong Kong series Infernal Affairs that told the same story It might be a little unoriginal but with a pro like Scorsese at the helm it avoids the inevitable disaster that awaits most Hollywood remakes stand up The Ring The Wickerman The Fog The Omen blah blah blah by the twin virtues of having its own identity and a terrific cast For where the Hong Kong original was a slick thriller this one is covered in dirt The Boston underworld here comes across as a bleak and unwelcoming landscape with little of the criminal romance of Goodfellas to be found The gangs do not lounge in jazz clubs or casinos here but dingy whiskey soaked bars and quayside warehouses filled with rats Urban decay is all too evident and when the violence comes it hits you like a jackhammer The gun shots sound incredibly loud and forceful and when they strike human flesh heads are blown apart with stark realism and zero fanfare Fist fights as well remain taut and ugly Di Caprio breaking his own wrist in a brawl through punching too hard as his foe is rammed through a glass window Violence here has pervaded even everyday life and when Jack Nicholson emerges from the back of a bar drenched in blood with no explanation it is treated as just one of those things that needs no questions As previously mentioned as well the cast is on fire Di Caprio has banished all memory of the floppy haired teenage heart throb and emerged as an unquestionable successor to De Niro s place as Scorsese s on screen muse Faced with a life or death situation he throbs with nervous aggressive energy and his eyes have never seemed more dangerous yet he is supposed to be the good guy Jack let go Rose Jack let go Matt Damon meanwhile proves himself once again his role as Detective Sullivan overflowing with moral dilemmas as the polar opposites of his situation come into conflict They are not the only ones to be celebrated though as Jack Nicholson puts in one of the finest appearances of his long and glittering career As mafia kingpin Frank Costello he moves from one dirty situation to another delivering racist barbs to Chinese gang members and having people murdered with a wicked grin etched on his face displacing his venom with a malicious sense of humour Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver fine performances as reliable old hands but perhaps it is Mark Wahlberg who comes out strongest His Captain Dignam is one of the most hard assed police officers you re ever likely to see and he encapsulates him perfectly as well as getting some of the film s best lines With this and Four Brothers it could be argued he is trying to cap the market for overly macho angry young men but it must be said he is one of the most memorable things in the movie However if one thing stands in the way of this film and the Oscars it is the undeniable remake syndrome For all its strong points it is still a retelling of an existing story and the lack of total originality might be to Scorsese s disadvantage Nonetheless it puts paid once and for all to the argument that remakes are a waste of time and is a very worthy version of the Hong Kong original,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1603533/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2007,Awful!,The original Hong Kong movie is much better than the departed there are just too many Fxxx words and too much unnecessary violence in this movie The Departed comes by its puzzle pieces honestly the movie with an outstanding script by Kingdom of Heaven screenwriter William Monahan is a relatively direct adaptation of Infernal Affairs a great 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller steeped in Chinese conundrum and Hong Kong aesthetics But where Infernal Affairs is less interested in psychological nuance than in Eastern style elegance of action Scorsese and Monahan showcase Western style actorly character building at its most enjoyable DiCaprio s adult intensity as a young man agonizing over the disappearance of his real identity under the weight of playing someone he isn t is matched by Damon s thoughtful restraint Wahlberg a charismatic always underrated natural digs into his own Mean Beantown Streets background and comes up with surprising fury Sheen freed from West Wing presidential responsibilities imbues his cop captain with a surprising pathos As the one woman in an all male saga Farmiga s Madolyn hints at female secrets and personal sadnesses probably not necessary to the film but welcome nonetheless The learned or in the case of Wahlberg resumed Boston accents sound ripe but right with Baldwin adding his own audience pleasing oomph to the exercise That said however as I said at the beginning just too much unnecessary violence and the cast is not really believable I wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1615351/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2007,Stellar!,I think is a reworked version of the Chinese movie Infernal Affairs I haven t seen it but after watching this it reminded me a little bit of Hard Boiled with Chow Yun Fat Most of the time foreign movies are reworked by American directors and it turns to crap While I cannot yet comment on the original if it s anything like this version it must be pretty good This is way above some of his best works including Goodfellas and I LOVE Goodfellas I couldn t believe he could top it but he did with this movie I was sucked into the plot and white knuckled all the way through the climactic end Brilliant stuff here folks don t wait another second,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1676622/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2007,"Arrrrggghhhhhhhh!!!,",Honestly I am surprised This is by far the worst movie from Scorsese ever It is Nothing more than an action Hollywood clich d movie But way gorier than the average ones although it is good entertainment Terrible Performances Why was Jack Nicholson cast when you have actors like Robert DeNiro or William Hurt who can play a gangster better DiCaprio playing once again himself and Alec Baldwin well Mark Whalberg was good so was the guy who plays Mr French and Matt Damon was not bad either Vera Farmiga was underused No wonder Scorsese wanted someone new a famous actress would have never taken the role The movie could have been pretty good if it weren t full of racial slurs and many carbon copied scenes There is no way to deny that this movie got a pity Oscar and pity awards courtesy of critics that felt sorry for Mr Scorsese long overlooked career But I m more enraged that it won screenplay unless that category has been changed to Best copied screenplay If you value cinema as an art form avoid this and watch the original but if you want to be entertained watch this instead and don t expect a lot,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1695530/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2007,Very good - but not very Goodfellas,The Departed is a slow burning simmering thriller a tale steeped in deception and gently expertly brought to the boil until a slightly overcooked finish leaving a slightly unsatisfying taste in the mouth Martin Scorsese s latest is a very well told story by one of the greatest directors of all time and while the Departed does show exactly why the great man is so highly thought of it also hints that perhaps he is not quite at the peak of his powers anymore The film is good indeed it is very good but the Oscars for best picture and director feel more like an apology from the Academy for overlooking Raging Bull and particularly Goodfellas rather than just recognition for this film Yes nobody does gangster films like Scorsese unless Coppola wants to continue his Godfather saga but while many directors would be proud to have The Departed in their filmography Goodfellas was far superior The dialogue was sharper the acting crisper and the story more flowing Yet the Departed remains an enjoyable film Largely the feeling of two parallel intertwining stories feels very effective with both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio providing a great deal of conflict in bringing their lead characters to life Both are all contradictions Damon is the cop who is a mole for the mob and is smooth charming but yet somehow slightly bland whilst DiCaprio as the man from the wrong side of the tracks handpicked for a special undercover assignment as a mole within the mob is a violent thug with a turbulent past but desperate to get his job done With so much deception you are never sure who knows what and rather appropriately you feel like rats in a maze And Scorsese does expertly time the reveals of information and keeps you guessing but yet something about it feels ever so slightly underwhelming However the action does heat up nicely towards the final third with an interesting homage to the original by the use of a scene in Chinatown in Boston creating some genuine edge of the seat moments until a rather unexpected conclusion that slightly jars against what has gone before The acting however is uniformly excellent One thing that can be said for Scorsese is that he sure can get the best out of DiCaprio who here produces work to rival that of his portrayal of Amsterdam in Gangs of New York another Scorsese picture Damon however seems to be slightly lacking in charisma although that does not provide a tremendous problem here But it is the supporting actors who really steal the show Jack Nicholson as the crime lord produces an atypically restrained performance never overacting and producing a quietly menacing performance relying on his natural gravitas to still fill the screen whenever he is on it Martin Sheen is as ever a class act but the show stealers are Mark Wahlberg as the intensely unlikeable but committed handler and Alec Baldwin who is given precious little screen time but certainly makes the most of his scenes without scenery chewing antics like those seen in Glengarry Glen Ross Overall while this is a worthy addition to the Scorsese canon the unsatisfactory conclusion and some of the slightly unsatisfying reveals make this feel a somewhat inferior cousin to Goodfellas rather than a true companion Yet any other director would be proud of this work and rightly so as there is a great deal to take pleasure from Maybe Scorsese just set his own standards too high for anyone including himself to live up to,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1630291/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2007,"The Departed is rubbish, go watch Infernal Affairs instead!",The director practically gutted the original story This is classic Hollywood doings I ve never seen a worse adaptation from an original movie They basically added more sex scenes and cut out all the meaningful parts of the original stories made the story choppy and hard to follow then stick a couple of big names to draw the audience The original Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs has a solid character development Infernal Affairs also used more intelligent ways of communication between the undercover and the source making you sit at the edge of your seat Aside from much stronger story lines it also portrayed mental health workers in a much more professional manner the psychiatrist in the Departed would ve had her license taken away in a snap as there are strict laws prohibiting dual relationships Just like all meaningless mainstream movies as if putting in a sex scene and showing some flesh would make up for the horrid chopped up story The original made the psychiatrist patient relationship more real and tapped into the inner workings of the psychiatrist working with an undercover If you are looking for a truly well written screenplay with deep emotional plots go watch the original Infernal Affairs instead,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1590575/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,The only one that can do what I do is me. Lot of people had to die for me to be me.

13 August 2020,Just Another Scorsese Masterpiece,This right here is some of Martin Scorsese s finest work The Departed accomplished something rare in being 2 hours 30 mins plus and absolutely non stop riveting Every scene was extremely relevant and I can t rave enough about the directing of this all time great motion picture I m not sure a film cast could be more electrifying and box office From Di Caprio and Jack Nicholson to Matt Damon Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin this was an absolute classic and one of my 10 favorite movies ever,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5987409/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2007,Scorsese's best... one of my favorites,The Departed is right up there I can t think of any other movie besides Pulp Fiction that had me glued to the screen like The Departed It has a great plot with fantastic acting If you can get over Leonardo Dicaprio playing his type of role then you will at least like the movie a little bit I know its hard to imagine him doing this type of role but he really has evolved as an actor over the years GO SEE THIS MOVIE I m not one of those guys that is going to get all technical But this movie is real with real conflicts especially Dicaprio Marky Mark Nicholson Damon Sheen even Alec Baldwin played their parts well Simply one of the best,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1664543/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2007,Under-written and under-whelming,This is one of those films out of the angst school Everyone runs around screaming obscenities at one another and there s lots of shooting and blood and it goes on much longer than it needs to There s the core of a very good story here with the double agent double agent scenario There could be a good tight exploration here with the character structure and the woman linking them But for me there was nothing to explain why the woman was so attracted to either man which the plot kind of hinged on And none of the characters were particularly well defined The acting s okay but Jack Nicholson can do roles like this in his sleep it just calls for him to look charismatic and dangerous It reminded me of the sort of plot you see on the BBC s Life on Mars Except that would have packed it with genuine intrigue and emotion into one hour And with class Class is ultimately what The Departed lacked Classy film making not denied but in terms of how the characters and story was portrayed And if American cops really go around screaming obscenities and being so racist sexist and homophobic all the time well that s not a very good advertisement for the Police Force is it,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1631073/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2006,Scorcese ceases to score,Do not be deceived by favorable reviews This is a bad movie from a director who has long ago lost his edge It is a naked king s clothes the Jonestown cool aid an Iraqi WMD Iranian uranium for peaceful purposes only all hype no substance A suicidal Scorsese confided in friends in 1980 that Raging Bull would be his last great film he was not far off King of Comedy was great In a vacuum Goodfellas was also exceptional but if you think Goodfellas was on par with Scorecese s 1970s triumphs then you should watch or re watch Mean Streets Who s that Knocking at my Door and Italianamerican Goodfellas is a big budgeted sleek production that rehashes these earlier classics Which leads us to The Departed What is wrong with Scorsese Has he developed dementia Does he have permanent writer s block Has his obsessive compulsive disorder gotten the best of him again Why has he lost the precious ability to be artistic and original In The Departed the best Scorsese can do is abscond core themes from other great movies faster than Winona Ryder can stuff away apparel at Saks The Departed itself a remake of a recognized foreign classic Marty didn t you learn anything from Cape Fear grabs from far better films like Reservoir Dogs e g the rat informer Donnie Brosco e g the undercover cop in too deep Mystic River e g the gritty violent underbelly of Boston See these excellent movies and identify others that Scorsese has rubbed his dirty hands all over Hey Marty my version of The Departed has the Tigers Kenny Rogers shaking your hand and leaving with enough smudge to pitch a few good ones at least until Tony LaRussa gets a look,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1513238/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,What's the Difference?,Greetings again from the darkness I will admit it upfront It is very rare that I don t enjoy appreciate respect Martin Scorcese films What I will say to his detractors is this is his best work since Goodfellas Yes it is based on the 2002 Hong Kong film entitled Infernal Affairs and Scorcese is so respectful that he actually notes this in the closing credits Prepare for a a no holds barred all out blazing explosion of film making And so much fun to watch If the f word bothers you stay home It may rival any Tarantino flick for harsh but real in this world language If violence bothers you stay home There are some moments of extremely brutal and realistic violence and bloodshed On the other hand if you are a fan of complex story lines amazing cinematography top level acting and crackling dialogue rush out now to see this film Oh my the acting is as good as it gets pun intended with Jack Nicholson as the personification of EVIL as Mob boss Frank Costello This is a very bad man and Jack is in his element Sure the guy is a great actor and can pull off fluff like insomnia with Diane Keaton but this is the Jack that we have loved for decades He literally spews venom with his lines and facial expressions Matt Damon back in his Boston comfort zone remember Good Will Hunting pulls off the role of informant with a truly believable lack of conscience that will hit you in the gut Now what to say about Leonardo DiCaprio I promise to never call him Little Leo again He is now a man and flashes the acting maturity that Scorcese has been pushing him towards for a few years Sure he steals some mannerisms from DeNiro watch him flick a cigarette but his simmering emotions are plastered on his face throughout and trust me when I say this dude has a LOT of emotion As is Scorcese s custom the supporting actors are also solid believable and disappear into their roles A bloated washed out Alec Baldwin is remarkable Martin Sheen is fine and Mark Wahlberg had to be laughing out loud when he first read his lines I know I was Few could pull off three or four of Wahlberg s hilarious lines without sounding like a stand up comedian instead of a wily veteran cop Also fun to watch is relative newcomer Vera Farmiga who falls for both Leonardo and Damon in what is one of the few story lines that could have been better developed Toss in Scorcese s legendary pacing and camera action an eclectic soundtrack that somehow combines the Rolling Stones Van Morrison singing Pink Floyd Comfortably Numb Badfinger and Dvorcak and the most complex use of cell phones yet and you have one amazing film that will keep you glued to the screen A bit of warning there is no good time for a potty break during this 2 1 2 hour film so don t buy the large drink,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491233/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2006,A film filled with unnecessary and nihilistic violence and profanity,Do you know the story about the king who left his palace naked and everyone in the crowd watching him were commenting on his splendid clothes This is how I feel after reading reviews from well known and respected critics on Scorcese s The departed Because that is what Scorcese s film is it is naked devoid of any rhyme or reason of any reason why things happen of any values To me it is just the ranting of an older man it is Scorcese fantasizing about violence sex corruption it is Scorsese thinking wow it is so clever to show all this blood and to have my actors swear all the time yeah this is art Well I am sorry but this isn t art This is about Scorsese repeating himself and indulging in his obsessions and us congratulating him I am not a conservative person I just feel like the little boy in the story who cried out that the king was naked like the little boy who wasn t a hypocrite and just showed things as they were,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1529833/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2008,Slick and entertaining but no masterpiece,Infernal Affairs was a fun to watch but totally implausible thriller It s no surprise that Martin Scorsese s remake is the same The running time passes smoothly and it never jars in the way that so many Scorsese films do After you ve watched it though the questions start to pile up The story is basically totally unbelievable and would work much better with a camper approach John Woo achieved this with Face Off a much more entertaining film mostly due to inspired casting of Travolta and Cage two actors who can make the best of ridiculousness Here instead we get DiCaprio seemingly taking it all very seriously and Matt Damon being as dull as he is as Jason Bourne On the plus side Scorsese remains a technical wizard a wizardry though seemingly divorced from any insight or guiding intelligence to the point that he seems to fail to notice the pulp nature of the material here,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1921558/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2006,Scorsese Needs His Oscar ... and This is Worthy,The Departed what an awesome expletive movie Yeah it s another of those cop vs bad guy vs cop movies but this is probably the best interpretation of that style of film making that has come out in years perhaps even decades It s gritty and vulgar and violent and yes a bit overacted But it s fraggin entertaining I tell you what This film has so many great elements First and most importantly it s a great movie to watch It s very rare for a movie to be entertaining through and through The Departed pulls it off Most movies make me look at my watch several times as if saying um are they getting near the end Not The Departed Most of the actors play their characters slightly over the top Matt Damon s vulgar turncoat cop is excruciatingly squeaky clean Alec Baldwin s vulgar police captain is excruciatingly by the book Martin Sheen s vulgar police lieutenant is excruciatingly trusting loyal and competent Mark Wahlberg s vulgar sergeant is excruciatingly tough combative and vulgar yeah I used vulgar twice and for good reason And Jack what can one say about Jack His portrayal as crime lord Frank Costello is both over the top and subtle for he really sells the idea of a powerful crime boss realizing his empire is falling apart Now normally one would see these exaggerated characters as a negative in films but in this case it works brilliantly The film s core is Leonardo DiCaprio s conflicted undercover cop Billy Costigan He plays this very straight and does a great job What we are seeing is the world through Costigan s eyes a regular guy s view of the ridiculousness of office politics in crime and law enforcement When you re an undercover cop the straight laced police hierarchy Baldwin and Sheen seems comic When you ve overcome a tough childhood phony toughness Wahlberg seems ridiculous When you ve struggled to make it in life those who ve had it easy but act otherwise Damon appear pathetic When you re an honest guy thrown into a world of crime the paranoia and wrath Nicholson seems otherworldly By having these supporting actors put that bit of top spin on their characters it gives us the viewpoint of the main character This movie as also suggested is quite vulgar Expletives tossed out at every turn the petty and not so petty bickering and demeaning that fills up this world This movie is highly quotable something not said about too many movies today Some of the lines are hysterical Of course this is Martin Scorsese so the film is quite violent But these comical interchanges between bitter rivals keeps it light you re not drowning in a sea of blood but are peppered with comedy amongst the carnage The writing of course is really top notch This is a clear case where the writing makes the movie The writers did a great job keeping the plot complex and surprising yet intimate The banter between characters is superb The plot itself is not wholly original so you may think I ve seen this before I suggest you pay attention to how the pieces are put together this is more of a character study than an action film although there s plenty of the latter And they did a beautiful job making an ending unlike most films of this genre You do want to watch it all the way through I don t know what the qualifications are for an Original Screenplay Oscar if this fits the rules then these guys should surely be nominated The soundtrack is also terrific I don t know who s doing that Irish ska punk sound heard at various points but I d love get one of their CDs I would love to see Martin Scorsese get his Oscar I m not entirely sure if the Academy will give it to him for The Departed Personally I think it s a great movie well crafted and Oscar worthy but I could see how the voters may be put off by the violence vulgarity and over the top acting by the various leads However if the rest of this season is like the season that has already passed full of uninteresting crapola The Departed should be a shoo in for at least a nomination 10 out of 10 a ranking I haven t used for many movies in 2006 Barky,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1502764/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2006,"Divided Loyalties, Compromised Choices.",Plot Outline A police plant tries to infiltrate a Boston gang lord s crime empire while the gang lord s police mole tries to expose him Talk about the proverbial film of two halves Martin Scorsese s latest film The Departed is his loose re working trans location of the acclaimed Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs which spawned two sequels one of which was effectively a prequel When I saw the earlier film on the festival circuit some three years ago I was bowled over even more than I had been by John Woo s kinetic thriller Hard Boiled from some 10 years earlier What made Infernal Affairs so special besides the technical excellence of the production and the fast paced high octane action was its emphasis on characterisations particularly in what I regarded as the key indeed the only players of any necessary substance Tony Leung as the police plant and Andy Lau as the crime lord s mole The problem with Martin Scorsese s re working and while I recognise that he is at liberty to expand the narrative to broaden the supporting characterisations is the way he allows himself to be compromised by the star turns and the alternate agendas So and in what I refer to as the first half we get too much of Jack Nicholson whose HK equivalent was at best a two dimensional peripheral character revelling in an excessive quota of Jack isms think The Shining Batman etc etc Alec Baldwin in his latest incarnation of his Glengarry Glenn Ross The Cooler hard man seemingly revelling in his ever expanding waistline Leonardo Di Caprio who had to be given plenty of opportunity to emote his Aviator Oscar play having fallen short while Ray Winstone gets to drop the Cockney hard man stunt in favour of its Bostonian equivalent Then just when I was about to doze off having realised too late just why Martin Scorsese needed 140 minutes to tell his story he cranked the gears up a few notches Matt Damon s gang lord s police mole realises he s got to move fast before Di Caprio s good guy undercover cop brings his Damon s employer s empire crashing down and in a daring move orders a police tail on the head of the police undercover unit thus hoping to flush out Di Caprio the resultant 10 minutes or so of breakneck white knuckle tension even if it does rely too much on the original and The French Connection for inspiration is almost worth the price of admission alone culminating as it does in a tragic death which ultimately precipitates a breakneck pace of cross and double cross This is where Scorsese really comes into his own with the kind of frenetic yet sure paced action sequences not seen since the heyday of Goodfellas Pausing briefly to swiftly despatch Nicholson s crime lord which couldn t have come too soon in my opinion he constantly keeps us guessing as to the next twist and turn of the tail and which of the double agents will eventually prevail and at what cost A film of two halves indeed and while the second half of perhaps 50 minutes or so probably contains more cinematic merit than most Hollywood productions of at least the past 5 years ultimately this has to be seen as a missed opportunity for Scorsese As with The Aviator Scorsese seems these days to be compromised too much in his artistic vision to such an extent that I don t believe that this is 100 the film he wanted to make The Aviator seemed to me partly an Oscar vehicle for Di Caprio s admittedly fine acting and part Scorsese Citizen Kane homage granted it was after all a Di Caprio vehicle Here once again it appears to me that far too much screen time is devoted to Jack isms and more unconvincing brooding Di Caprio emoting As if the Aviator pitch having failed they d make sure of it this time The trouble is while Di Caprio is certainly a fine actor who I believe has yet to achieve his peak more often than not he s trying too hard in this film in what is an underwritten role lumbered with often puerile dialogue And where acting is concerned don t get me started on Alec Baldwin whose acting capabilities seem to decline in inverse proportion to his waistline or to Mark Wahlberg s cardboard cutout undercover sergeant character Matt Damon who doesn t try too hard almost reaches what for me was his peak of The Talented Mr Ripley But it was good to see Ray Winstone doing a foreign accent for a change Once again Scorsese s choice of music was impeccable And I so loved his apt placement of Roy Buchanan s sublime bluesy guitar rendition of Patsy Cline s Sweet Dreams Would that all of Scorsese s moves had been as sure,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494425/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2007,I couldn't believe this film won best picture...,I am not a real film buff and neither is my wife I had heard that this film was supposed to be good and rented it Despite the excellent cast and good production values I couldn t believe how labored the script was and how much overacting was taking place much of it by Nicholson When we finished watching the movie I remarked to my wife that I must have gotten the film confused with some other I went to IMDb to see what rating it had gotten I figured maybe a 6 7 or something To my disbelief it lands in the top 100 and won the best picture Oscar I went back to tell my wife that it had won the best picture and she thought I was joking Then her reaction was that someone had hacked my computer As far as the comments here I would have had to think that there was a large astroturf component But with the film winning best picture I guess I am just seeing one of those occasional mass delusions that happens in the world But what I really can t believe is that it won best script Un Be Lievable This script was so bad and so unconvincing that after I told my wife that it had won best picture and director I remarked that for sure it couldn t have won best scriptwriting But it did I simply don t understand what people see in this film The plot is sophomoric The involvement of Costello in routine pickups and deliveries and the immediate trust and access to the boss given Costigan is so implausible that I find it difficult to believe anyone can take this film seriously Is it supposed to be camp or something,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1645685/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2007,Fails to provide genuine emotional satisfaction,Based on the popular Hong Kong action thriller Infernal Affairs Martin Scorsese s The Departed has kinetic energy an outstanding ensemble cast a world class director and tense non stop action but ultimately fails to provide genuine emotional satisfaction Scorsese whose Taxi Driver Raging Bull and Goodfellas are classics of the genre has come up with another gritty urban drama but unlike his earlier efforts it is filled with casual cartoonish killing and a point of view that the excesses of organized crime and law enforcement are virtually indistinguishable In an environment that does not distinguish between ends and means there is no one to root for and those that do find a character to cheer for are begging for disappointment Set in the mean streets of South Boston The Departed is the story of an undercover cop Leonardo DiCaprio planted in the Costello crime syndicate and a mole Matt Damon who infiltrates the police force pretending to be a cop The film comes out of the gate roaring with the Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter providing the background to a street fight The first Irish Mafioso we meet is Frank Costello played by Jack Nicholson In a flashback Costello recruits a youngster named Colin Sullivan by buying groceries for his family Later Sullivan goes to work for Costello when he becomes a detective sergeant in the police force Unfortunately Mr Nicholson performance is so over the top that we are all too conscious that we are watching Jack Nicholson the actor not Frank Costello the mob kingpin Sullivan is played by Matt Damon as a one dimensional Southie character just out of Good Will Hunting I was half expecting Ben Affleck to wander into the scene with the rest of his drinking buddies Sullivan s superiors are devout Catholic Captain Queenan Martin Sheen and Sergeant Dignam in an Oscar nominated performance by Mark Wahlberg Dignam has the most quotable lines in the film but his character is so foul mouthed and antagonistic that he soon becomes tiresome The most accomplished performance in the film is that of Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan a tough but sensitive undercover cop who comes from a family with a criminal background and fits into the Costello organization but has to swallow Valium just to stay on an even keel There is some love interest in the film as well Both Billy and Colin fall for the police mental health counselor Madolyn Vera Farmiga Ms Farmiga does a creditable job but her part is so underwritten that it feels extraneous Both Costello and the police soon discover that they have a rat in their midst and Sullivan and Costigan are assigned the job of finding the fink As the noose tightens both men desperately strive to avoid detection and there is lots of action as the dead bodies pile up The Departed is a finely crafted film excellently photographed by Michael Ballhaus and for the most part very well acted Unfortunately the plot is very thin and there is little character development or seriousness of purpose While Scorsese should be acknowledged for telling the truth about the thin line between criminals and the law the ending is so downbeat that it leaves us wondering what point other than futility the film is trying to make During two and one half hours of gratuitous violence betrayals double crosses and one note characters the departed may include members of the exhausted audience,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1607517/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,Best American movie in a long time,Martin Scorsese was already a great America artist but what he has done here transcends mere movie making and restores my faith in the ability of people today to make a masterpiece Every week I go to the theater hoping to see a film that will blow me away and it was getting to the point where I was really thinking that will never happen again Thank you Mr Scorsese for a truly great American film Everything is almost perfect great story telling great acting and great musical score It s very telling when a crime drama lased with violence and corruption still manages to have more humor then most of the comedies produced today The characters are so well developed and intense that every scene every piece of dialogue is mesmerizing All set to some of the best backdrops ever seen on film Oh and one last thing anyone who thinks that Jack s portrayal is over the top doesn t have a clue I have been around people like that and the one thing that comes to mind is that truth is stranger then fiction All of the characters were spot on and if they offend your sensibility maybe you should stick to TV,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493971/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2007,"Both fortunately and unfortunately, it's what we've come to expect from Scorsese",Martin Scorsese was once one of the world s great filmmakers but the truth is that he has been rehashing some combination of Raging Bull and Mean Streets for the last quarter century Even his latter day masterpiece Goodfellas repeats the revisionist gangster themes of Mean Streets with the visual language of Raging Bull almost exactly copied In this way it s unfortunate that The Departed is more of the same However even in his darkest hours of imagination Scorsese has always been a competent storyteller whose films are filled with excellent vibrant performances spot on editing and of course his much revered knack for choosing score material In this way it s fortunate that The Departed is more of the same The story is one that inherently involves all of Scorsese s favorite themes violence identity and loyalty It tells two essentially identical inverted story lines Slight spoiler but no more than the commercials told you A young man who has grown up learning from gang leader Frank Costello becomes Costello s mole inside the state police and a young man who has grown up surrounded by criminals becomes an undercover police officer who infiltrates Costello s organization spoiler over The intertwined stories are perhaps the most interesting part of the film since this take on narrative is something new to Scorsese s repertoire but it unfortunately is not handled perfectly Some of the editing is coarse for no obvious reason and yet Scorsese does not provide us with any visual cues that either show that we are supposed to be confused or help us orient ourselves Meanwhile the acting is perfect all the way Mark Wahlberg may be a one note actor but his character is his note Meanwhile Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent in deep layered roles though Damon does not have the opportunity DiCaprio does to chew up the screen now and again Martin Sheen is used perfectly in the type of role we re getting used to him playing Most importantly the borderline campy theatricality and evil of Jack Nicholson is used to absolutely perfect effect in devilishly comic portrayal of an underworld kingpin Oddly one place where the film goes awry is in its use of music While certainly the Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter is used wonderfully to great effect and absolutely appropriately almost as well as the instrumental section of Derek and the Dominoes Layla in Goodfellas some of the music was annoyingly distracting This problem also crept up on Scorsese s last film The Aviator at a few points which is a disturbing and disheartening trend in the director s career It almost sounds as if he is trying to insert more hip music with which he is less familiar and which he may even like less and thus is forcing it into place far more than when he uses some of the classic rock anthems and classical standards he has used to such great effect in the past and even in this film The presence of composer Howard Shore obviously doesn t help either as the master of the Very Standard Score delivers the same thing he nearly always does a bag of clich s Overall the film is worth sitting through once and probably worth more than that if you re unfamiliar with Scorsese s work However it s not much more than that Watching Raging Bull or Goodfellas or The Last Temptation of Christ for that matter again is definitely a better use of one s time It also certainly wasn t the best picture of the year United 93 was,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1625888/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2007,"Dreay, Dreaful, Deathy, Ratty",Martin Scorcese is back with his new film The Departed which brings cinematic dysfunction on to the big screen The Departed was one of my most anticipated films of the year Well I highly regret that now This film begins with the a self reflexive narrative provided by a Wonderful actor who essentially saves the film from complete darkness Jack Nicholson He explains When you Have a gun pointed in your face it does not matter if your a cop or a mobster Later the film incorporates Matt Damon who plays the usual role with that smirky face of his He plays an investigator who secretly works for Frank but at the same time is a mole in the special police unit force or something like that On the other side is Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the opposite He is an undercover cop who works for Frank Such a wonderful role he plays Honestly in previous films DiCaprio has managed only to distinguish himself as one bad actor In The Departed part of the 4 good points it got was DiCaprio He has finally found himself a role Very good DiCaprio The other points go to Mr Nicholson He is flawless Completely flawless DiCaprio and him tandem to make The Departed If The Departed Were to prove anything it would be that Nicholson has not lost his touch And that is magic So what s so bad about The Departed let s say it is only a failed attempt to bring Goodfellas back tom the big screen The viewers can probably imagine seeing Mr Scorsese sitting there thinking of a way to bring back the Goodfellas Pop into our junky Modern Cinema Mr Scorcese has failed his old but magical touch in bringing back Gangster classics this is one is even copied from Internal Affairs Oh boy I can t until next year,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1616676/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2022,Exciting and unpredictable,What I liked most about this movie was that after watching it there are still a lot of topics to think about even though the movie itself leaves no loose ends Everything is beautifully shot and the plot is in my opinion damn near perfect The characters in this movie are all so well rounded and the acting is amazing It s almost a cat and mouse thriller but also so much more DiCaprio as an undercover cop and Damon as a crooked cop both are entangled in their life choices Their actions bring up many questions about what separates good from bad and how ambition or pride can be your downfall Just about each of the main characters have their own journey and are interesting enough to keep you submersed in this movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8107834/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2007,"Scorsese's best film????? for the Oscars yes, for me no but....",Is difficult to say what is the best film of Marty in my opinion there are three films Taxi Driver Goodfellas and Raging Bull maybe Gangs of NY Casino and The Departed also but in my opinion the first three are the best Well about The Departed this film is one of my favorite films of the 2006 with a great performance by Dicaprio and by Jack Nicholson and of course a great history about mafia corruption and cops I have seen this film like three times and every time i found a lot of news things and i think that is why this film is a masterpiece but for me is not the best of Marty And of course we have to give some credit to Infernal Affairs in which this film was based and that is also a great film About that this film won the best picture Oscar for me the prizes are not important because the art of a movie can t be compared with others and for me the Oscar or the golden palm or all the other prizes are not important because when a movie is excellent it is excellent with or without prizes but is a shame that a lot of people don t think that because they only see The Departed or whatever film because The Departed won an Oscar That is a shame but is true that a lot of people only watch film because some others say that is a good film like the jury of the Oscars but well thats my opinion,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1609910/?ref_=tt_urv

""The Departed"" is Pretty Good but Far From Great",The Departed is a fairly entertaining movie although about 2 3 through it definitely drags There is simply too much reliance on cell phones as if Oh wow ain t it something the way we can call one another at any time and gee isn t Generation X really interesting to watch The answer is a resounding NO You get really tired of yet another ringing cell phone and another kid picking up and blabbing away as if it s so important and so heavy Leonardo DeCaprio gives an uneven performance as the undercover cop who has successfully infiltrated the Irish Mafia in Boston He starts out well especially when he is being taunted by his superiors who are hoping to recruit him for undercover work but it becomes increasingly evident that he has copied the characterization effectively utilized by Johnny Depp for Donnie Brasco a better movie about an undercover cop who has infiltrated the mafia Even his facial expressions start to resemble too much those used by Depp At times his character does hit a sort of stride but generally the ride strains credulity Were I the crime boss I d have greased this punk the first time I suspected he might be a rat because his denials are unconvincing However his IS a likable performance despite its limitations and I especially liked his budding romance with the sexy young psychiatrist Unfortunately the buildup doesn t really deliver save for an abbreviated sex scene mostly because the plot doesn t allow it DeCaprio s nemesis Matt Damon the gangster mole in the Boston PD never gains our sympathy This guy is a piece of sh t pure and simple and you might expect that he had some redeeming qualities which he does not That he gets away with all his inside machinations and is never seriously suspected by anyone in power once again asks us to suspend disbelief a tad too much Jack Nicholson as the ruthless crime boss the mole often refers to simply as Dad hands in a reasonable performance that has been referred to as absolutely amazing which it simply isn t There are one or two interesting moments such as his imitation of the dirty rat gnawing at cheese but he fails to convince us that he is evil personified or incredibly mean and scary This Nicholson is definitely not as good as the crazy caretaker of The Shining nor for that matter the inspired bum of Ironweed He s pretty good in this movie but not great and definitely not as good as De Niro or Pacino in similar roles In fact certain of the gang members especially his right hand man do a more effective job of exuding pure evil This is not to say that The Departed is a bad film only that it is clearly flawed And the ending jeez it definitely IS surprising I ll give it that lending further credence to the idea that Scorcese wasn t really serious when he made this thing It comes off as black comedy rather than the gruesome drama of his earlier efforts at portraying organized crime But something about the ending however startling doesn t quite add up if you think about if for a moment With all the violence one is almost tempted to push aside lingering doubts about several developments but you won t get a chance to consider it until after the credits roll The final scene sets things about as right as can be expected but it s almost too neat and there is something unsettled here that all the hype can t sweep under the rug If you can get in to see this flick for a discount price it s probably worth it because it is reasonably entertaining most of the time otherwise I d advise you wait until it comes out on DVD,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494729/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2009,would be OK if it were not a remake - just my personal opinion,When I started watching the movie I had no idea it was based on IA so it seemed like an okay flick Not great by any stretch of the imagination but a passable B movie with A list actors Mark Whalberg s character was annoying and just seemed too unstable and unfit for his position Still marginally entertaining as I was not expecting a serious cinema and paying more attention to the visuals and Jack Nicholson s familiar antics Once it became clear that this was a remake the whole impression just totally crumbles as you just notice only deficiencies and see no added value To be fair it s not a one star movie characters are two dimensional but there s some entertainment and shock value in it Finally movies are goods to be sold let s be honest how many people among the average US movie going public have heard or watched IA Like one performer said once people will gobble it up anyway so that s another McMovie,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2023122/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,Who's the real storywriter? Better look that up sometimes,Lots of details including the soundtrack make this movie great Too bad that the credit doesn t go to the rightful author of such a beautifully intricate plot and that s why it s just an 8 10 Nicholson s acting is superb Di Caprio and Damon do pretty well too Loved Wahlberg s character,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6001745/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2006,what is this mess?,I d have seen this film regardless of the reviews Scorcese has directed some of the most significant dramatic and best told stories of our time and with Nicholson Damon DeCaprio Baldwin Sheen Walberg and the rest it at least had a solid chance to be a tour de force It s a mess though dragged down to lousy by a screenplay written by the same misguided pen of that disaster bore embarrassment Kingdom Of Heaven Bad or no structure can t be saved by over cranking the ragefest volume It s hard to say why Marty needs to wallow in even deeper pools of perpetual manic violence and blood at this point in his career Maybe he still just likes it Maybe he s feeling like we need to take some people out Maybe the only way he could punctuate and hold together this cluster was with regular loud brain blasting because if it weren t for the continuous bang bang blast in your face insults and face punch scenes the story would ve resembled a garbage pile An interesting plot line was strung together by an amateur though fortunately you ve got watchable actors some wry funny lines and a few outrage scenes that pop The screenplay s choppy the edits and lighting choices are weird and the script s incongruent in a bad way It never builds a tempo That s Scorcese s fault It was a great shame to see great actors content with accepting performance mania in lieu of characters So in spite of all the odd crazy there re also huge bald spots Nobody in this film goes beyond one dimensionally anger crazed with the possible exception of DeCaprio Still I couldn t understand how Leo didn t explode during this film he goes from appearing over stressed and over drugged to rage psycho I felt possessed to snort Ajax watching his crazed eyes and jaw grinding for 2 hours I give it a 3 there s enough good violence to feel punched up after a numbing week at work,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491505/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2023,Vulgar and soulless,I don t understand how there can be near unanimous acclaim for this film Is it because Martin Scorsese and his renowned cast can do no wrong Who can question the work of three time Academy Award winning actor and legend Jack Nicholson He is one of the best actors of his generation and of course when his fellow actors were promoting the film they all spoken about how much of a privilege it was to work with him Is it difficult to notice that he can t actually act anymore that he merely caricatures himself Maybe he destroyed himself with playing The Joker in Batman 1989 for which he was given a percentage of the profits and made about 60 million dollars for one of the worst performances from a great actor in the history of cinema His performance in The Departed was barely more restrained than The Joker His performance is like a cartoon and utterly unconvincing as a real human being despite being surrounded by grounded effective performances This makes sense discovering that he was given free reign on set to improvise and ham it up his director trusting that he is still a great artist or simply too afraid to question him Despite Scorsese s definite competence Nicholson is unrestrained and detrimental The rest of the cast do an impressive job of being tough guys and talking dirty and were clearly working hard and taking the film seriously It cannot have been easy to get into the minds of such cardboard charaters In some ways this film is classic Scorsese portraying the intricate dealings of American organised crime He seems to have moved on to Irish crime syndicates perhaps responding to criticism that he was reinforcing stereotypes about Italian Americans being criminals In some ways it is a hollow simulacrum of his greatest films The film is competently directed Apart from the stain of Jack Nicholson its surface is immaculate But this is a film with no soul It is utterly lifeless devoid of heart or spirituality of morality or any thematic resonance that speaks to the experience of being human To me this soullessness is fundamental Is this supposed to be pure entertainment with no artistic intentions I do not find it entertaining to watch hollow violent vulgar men destroy each other and themselves within the context of a convoluted and banal narrative with zero character development For this film to be entertaining it would require emotional engagement with the characters and tension and suspense in the narrative But the only character who I could even begin to engage with was Leonardo DiCaprio s character who did display an emotionally complex response to the disgusting violence and deceit occurring around him but even within the 2 5 hour duration his character did not have time to develop or find any resolution There was not even a palpable sense of injustice in the film about how his character was being exploited by both the mob and the cops only incident and plot convolutions Despite Matt Damon s balanced efforts his character does not manage to be anything other than a monster The only female character in the film played by Vera Farmiga is anything but a woman She seems to have a heart though zero intelligence despite being a doctor of psychology and there is no reason why she could be attracted to Matt Damon s character except that she loves sex which would be interesting but is of course undeveloped Otherwise it is inconceivable that she is not aware that he is a psychopath with no redeeming qualities or human emotion The only explanation is that she is not a woman at all but a man s idea of a woman less even than Nicholson s cartoon character she is a cardboard cut out in the film only to add another needless convolution to the plot Of course it is possible that I am not the target audience for the film I like well made serious intense and involving dramas but I am not a heterosexual male This film is overflowing with machismo to the extent that I can t imagine it appealing to anyone who is not a heterosexual male also full of machismo The whole cast is male and super straight even the one female character is basically a man in that she is the creation of men who know nothing of women The characters are all extremely vulgar and violent and act as if they have no feelings The film is actually appallingly badly written That this film won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay is only evidence of how far removed from reality certain people are Even Scorsese doesn t seem aware that he s working with a screenplay that is hollow crude and juvenile The characters speak to each other like insecure teenage boys though the film offers no perspective or insight into their damaged masculinity There is no depth no substance no thematic interest no narrative shape or character development It is simply a convoluted plot with all the characters trying to figure out what is going on before everyone else figures it out However the audience already knows everything so there is nothing to learn so there is no suspense or tension and therefore no interest or excitement and therefore no entertainment and therefore no reason for the film to exist Surely Scorsese and his heroic cast could have found a better screenplay to put all that energy into Scorsese has been directing films for a long time now and it is evident in this film that he is strong confident and fluent in the process of filmmaking But it seems his heart is not in it Lawrence Toppman in the Charlotte Observer suggested that this picture feels like an exercise by a Scorsese clone It is the best film anyone could have made of this screenplay without awakening their creativity their imagination or their humanity It is devoid of meaning and morality And if I am wrong and there is morality intended in the ending it is even more unforgivable There is no redemption after the violence The violence is redemption And that is a repugnant conclusion and it is irresponsible and unforgivable in an impactful Hollywood product such as this Finally the last shot of the film offers a visual flourish so lame it contextualises the film perfectly,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8870229/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2007,Scorsese's Worst?,Yeah Scorsese should have an Oscar or two on his fireplace mantle but surely not for this The testosterone fueled screenplay is boringly predictable the hollow dialog is just a bunch of rants strung together and the plot is treated so superficially as to be an insult to our intelligence The sub plots are the inventions of a fool with no imagination In total the story is unadulterated drivel not even worthy of B movie status Without the fantastic cast assembled for this film and without Scorsese s masterful hand to erect a visually exciting film experience The Departed would have ended up going straight to video Maybe it should have anyway In terms of film history it s a dirty shame Scorsese got his statuette for this shallow piece of nonsense,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1641591/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2020,Scorsese's Gone Downhill After Goodfellas,Be careful giving a Scorsese movie a bad review a stalker took over my IMDb page he was so miffed But you CAN put down Taxi Driver Raging Bull or the other ones with Robert De Niro Just don t mess with Dicaprio Oh wait actually Casino IS off limits After Goodfellas Martin Scorsese the best director in the world who was still shining when his contemporaries were gathering moss started doing an imitation of himself directing films for new fans instead of old dedicated deacons Leonardo DiCarpio sorry he s too young looking and Jack Nicholson s dialogue in the first five minutes was SO begging the audience to boo and hiss he might as well had a drawn little mustache The movie looked pretty good until the forty five minute mark when the ingenue appears and then what tries for GoodCasino winds up a romantic triangle melodrama all dressed up and going nowhere slow Good music though albeit wasted on bland acting like Leo conning Jack unconvincingly with The Stone s soulful Let It Loose in the background But when the likes of Mean Streets and Marty s other flicks have music it meant something This was like Hal Ashby playing The Beatles Hey Jude while Jane Fonda cooked eggs in Coming Home Anyhow this movie lives up to its name as far as the pacing goes But Marty got his Oscar And that s what ruined him He should have won for Goodfellas instead of the forgotten Dances with Wolves as Best Director and was chasing that plastic rabbit ever since Tragic and without the old magic he still blows,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5922877/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2006,low,I don t want to vote for this movie but I find it very low from the Americans to remake an Asian movie and to get or will get a bigger success then the original movie I want to criticize the American movie industry because they are not original It is better to search for original ideas then to play the role of the copycat in our society I wanted to say my opinion to those who appreciate the American movie industry so much and surely this movie good examples of remaked movies are the ring the grudge the seven samurai Godzilla masked rider and more they planned also to make an American version of Battle royale Even if they remake it well they will never win my respect and i will consider it like fake thank you,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1519541/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2007,Departed,Not much to commend on this movie The original Hong Kong film was much much better This movie was rambling predictable and at times reminded me of a college student film with its forced irony Okay so Dicaprio did do an excellent job and Sheen and Damon were okay but the acting of Nicholson was atrocious and Marky Mark has been much better in other things His acting limitations were obvious in this film What was the corpulent Baldwin even doing in this film outside of the director giving a handout to a fellow down on his luck lib who shouldn t even have been living in the United States for the past six years This film shouldn t have gotten all the good press that it has and it absolutely shouldn t have been nominated or won anything And no I am not bitter for wasting any money seeing this film because I was given a free copy of it and I actually looked forward to seeing it Now that I have seen it I wish it hadn t departed from the original movie as much as it did The whole thing of trying to incorporate the Boston bi sexual crime lord Whitey Bulger into the storyline with the Nicholson character was stupid and hit a bad note too since this mass murdering former male street hustler is still on the loose,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1613797/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2006,The Departed is the best movie in recent memory,I was somewhat taken aback by the power of this movie While Godfather II is perhaps the best gangster movie of all time this flick is a VERY close second Moreover it may very well be one of the best movies ever and it ranks with Scorsese s best including Raging Bull The cast was simply superb and as I left the movie I recounted who will win what Oscars Scorsese is a lock for best director the film will win best picture but the acting awards will be more difficult to determine Surely Jack Nicholson will win his umpteenth best actor award and I would vote for DiCaprio for best supporting actor DiCaprio might get a best actor nomination himself I thought Mark Wahlberg was perfectly cast in his role as the liaison for the undercover cop I will see this movie again to ensure that I haven t missed any nuances,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1507755/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2006,The new born departed,This is a totally awesome movie from start to finish a great cast some undisputed performances everything is almost perfect From a Director that knows his best angles specially in a story like this comes a work of art that touches even with such gore and i might say that nobody expected the ending unless there s a book All the actors have done an outstanding job but Jack performed crazy He is an actor which you can t get enough of watching and although he was the bad guy in a way we still felt sorry for him in the end My only disappointment is to the Head Shots scene i think it was a little too fake specially because there was a key element missing spoiler All the Departed were the new born as their life were turning points Go watch it i s fabulous,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1533773/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2006,"Watch Scorsese's The Departed for Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson",Directed by Martin Scorsese Starring Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg The Departed is a compellingly dramatic story of moles in both the police and organized crime gangs in Boston Nicholson is at his most charismatic over the top as mob boss Frank Costello Damon is fine as Costello s informant at police headquarters DiCaprio is excellent as the undercover cop trying to bring Costello down Scorsese seems to show off his actors in the beginning but brings us full force by the time we find who Damon s father is on the phone Also compelling is newcomer Vera Farmiga as Damon s girlfriend and DiCaprio s shrink and lover Watch also for Anthony Anderson and from 24 James Badge Dale Well worth seeing for Scorsese enthusiasts,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491052/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2006,"damon caprio nicholson are a blast, Movie is fantastic",After walking out of the theatre after watching the departed I felt like going to the ticket counter and buy the ticket for it again The departed can best be described as the most powerful and the most entertaining movie of the year It s very hard to decide who was better than who in the movie because everyone gives a great performance Leaving Nicholson Dicaprio and Damon aside the supporting cast too gives a great performance Martin Sheen and Wahlberg gives some great support to the cast My favorite scenes includes the one involving Martin Sheen Wahlberg and Dicaprio These scenes are really well executed I have always been a big fan of Scorsese and even this time he doesn t disappoint He surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds Thank you Mr Scorsese for making the departed Dhruv Puri gives the movie Two Biggest thumbs up way up,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1499041/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2006,"Amazing Cinematography, Brutally honest marriage of audio and video, never felt long for a moment",Absolutely awesome I have had a hard time justifying going to spend the money on any of the garbage that has been coming out of Hollywood lately But I made a serious point to go see this something fresh from on old familiar face or wait two maybe three or four depends how old you are One thing I think makes a great director is the use of inanimate objects as characters If you haven t seen this film watch the Boston State Capitol building appearances It says more with no duologue than some entire scripts do Some songs are used with more visual themes than others but the audio counterpart to the eye popping candy is so intense I just couldn t wait for the next scene to unfold And as for Jack well very very good best I ve seen him in full tilt since the shining Many people are saying this is Tarantino Based I am almost thirty I remember pre Tarantino Well pop Tarantino that is pre Pulp Fiction who knew about his hits only a few in early years of high school had even watched reservoir dogs What happened to him is he s gone Hollywood who else would take such interest in splitting a feature like kill bill into 2 parts oh yeah ticket sales revenues I say CUT IT The departed said what it wanted to say THE RAT GETS THE CHEESE America today needs more films like this that don t have a happy ending and expose the dirtier side of God s Country Had me from the first scene,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1508144/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2009,It is just a bad terrible Hollywood copy of IA.,It is just a bad terrible Hollywood copy of IA I can t believe how Hollywood treat the audience Lots of scenes dialogues or even acting was the exact same as the original Even most of the locations was the exact same as the original The only different was the Hollywood ending I am very very very disappointed we can be more creative this is very sad I don t believe the screen play writer hadn t watched the original Infernal Affairs while writing the Departed screen play I am sure everybody in the cast and of course the writer and Director had watched the Original for at least 10 times if not 100 times The actors delivered the same exact emotions and writer and director just Americanized the story Add some sex scene Add few sub plots not related to the story and a happy resolution in the ending Come on guys you can be a little more creative with 90 Million dollars budget The other sad thing is how films are sold and marketed using actor names and not the story line Infernal Affairs and Departed are great example of this The Original Infernal Affairs when screened in US just made 89 6K because in US there are very few people that watch anything made outside Hollywood Departed made 289 Million by using the same story plot character and even dialogue they just changed the actors and put the known actors and it made close to 300 Million What can I say Viva Hollywood Brad Bahmanpour,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2061449/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2007,a poor rip off,I have to say that when i went to watch the American Version of Departed i was rather in two minds firstly since this film is a remake of a very successful Hong Kong film starring the very talented Andy Lau and Tony Leung Infernal Affairs OK Departed has had huge publicity since it stars many top rated well known actors so already this is used to deter the public from the original success of the Hong Kong version if you were to not know that Departed is not original then you would see this as a fantastic film but having compared to HK Version this lacks all you can think it is taken word from word act from act and the worse thing about the US Version is the ending If you see the HK version you shall see why A very poor rip off covered by well known actors and that is all,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1658808/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,Scorsese is Back!!!!!!!,The Departed out of Over the past 5 years it seemed as though Martin Scorsese was spending too much time trying to win himself an Oscar for best director that the films he was making though good were not typical Scorsese films Gangs of New York and the Aviator were both good films though it seemed as though I wasn t watching a Scorsese film After viewing The Departed all I can say is that Scorsese is back This film almost seems to be a screw you to the Academy He did his best to conform to Academy style to win his award and when all was done Scorsese was left standing statue less Now Scorsese returns to a genre that has made him one of the best directors in the business The Departed is a crime drama that is bloody and vulgar just the way Scorsese has made films in the past The Departed has an all star cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg Nicholson plays Frank Costello a villainous crime boss who under the eye of the Boston Police and FBI Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan a police cadet hired to go secretly undercover to be an informant Sheen and Wahlberg It is later learned that not only does the authorities have an informant in Costello s crew but Costello has an informant in the State Police All the cast members give an outstanding performance It is hard to say who had the best performance because they were all great Nicholson who has been doing a lot of comedies lately reminds us just how great of a villain he can be DiCaprio reminds us once again that he is a better actor then Titanic would suggest Damon once again shows us why he is one of the better actors today And though both Wahlberg and Baldwin both have small parts they come across as great performances The film runs in at about 2 1 2 hours but it certainly doesn t feel like it There are no slow moments which is good for a long film Scorsese has a brilliant talent for mixing a great soundtrack with a great film Look at Goodfellas and Casino Both of their soundtracks help push the films along The violence is in your face as it should be with a story like this In doing this film Scorsese may bring himself a best director award at the Oscars without trying as hard as he did in the past Many feel he was robbed back in 1990 for Goodfellas and it would only be fitting that he gets an award for this film being this film is his most violent since Goodfellas Lets just hope that Kevin Costner isn t working on Dances With Wolves II,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494598/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2009,What's going on in Hollywood?,Sad It s so sad This film The Departed has an 8 5 However Infernal Affairs the film that was the inspiration of this awful remake has just an 8 1 It s really sad finding one of the most amazing and relevant directors of all times Mr Scorsese father of masterpieces like Taxi Driver Goodfellas Raging Bull or Casino making the remake of an unknown Hong Kong trilogy What happened You see DiCaprio Damon Nicholson and all the other stars and you have a masterpiece That s not what I thought cinema was I ve seen both versions in fact I have it on DVD The Departed is a great movie that s true But it s nothing more I can t understand why Martin changed so many things and he still thought it would be the same story but told in a different words This is not about Italian Mafia This is about Chinese mafia and that s not the same Please everyone who enjoyed The Departed Take a look on Infernal Affairs Or ask Tarantino about what he thinks about this remake The film is OK but there s no color between The Departed and IA Salud,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2088252/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2011,My favourite film,I don t want to be a product of my environment I want my environment to be a product of me The film starts with this dialogue A question is also popped at the very beginning When you face a loaded gun what s the difference if you re a cop or a criminal At the very outset the mood which is started is kept till the end Billy Leonardo is from south Boston has a family with criminal background which makes him a suitable undercover in his criminal neighborhood He is a mole in Costello s Jack Nicholson outfit While Colin Sullivan Matt Damon is a Sergeant in Massachusetts is actually a mole working for Costello Throughout the movie Billy Collin try to figure out each others identity As referred to as Rock star of the gangsters Costello by Alan Baldwin truly in this movie Jack Nicholson outshines everyone His character is so insensitive in this film Everybody has done justice to their characters Again Leonardo proved why he is Martin scorsese s pick Mark whalberg s character of insulting everyone was very unique also with Mark s Massachusetts accent adorned the character Matt Damon was also very good One more thing I want to say about this film is about its dialogues I don t remember hearing so many crispy dialogue exchange after Pulp Fiction This movie is very intense throughout with some twists and turns that keeps you at the edge of the seat This movie touches everything like racial discrimination which was there once in Boston And bravely puts forth its opinions I have seen this movie more than 50 times But whenever I see it it never bores me This movie teaches you a lot of harsh realities of life Martin scorsese dished out so many good flicks But according to me this has to be his best film He gave it all Deservedly it won an Oscar This is one of the best crime thrillers of all time I would recommend everyone to watch this great flick Hats off and all my clothes off to Martin scorsese for giving this incredible film I d like to finish this review off with a quote in this film No one gives it to you you have to take it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2505697/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2019,Movie Review Profits,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5038035/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2023,One For The Ages,It s quite evident anyone who knows anything about filmmaking anything about cinema would logically put this in their top 10 or 15 of all time We have two fine actors in the primest of primes in DiCaprio and Damon and a lunatic Nicholson on the back nine of his career giving us one of the most likable bad guys of all time And a supporting cast that reads like Walhberg Baldwin Sheen Winstone etc Scorsese delivers what he does best a film about the mob and the fuzz where we are somehow simultaneously rooting for every single character and yet we don t know why Scorsese has the ability to make us fall in love with every character and every turn in the story for better or worse He has me afraid of the opening of an elevator or apartment door for the rest of my days but he also has me looking forward to his next project like none other,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9032197/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2023,Good but Overrated,I just revisited the movie for the first time in about six years I feel like when it came out I saw it in the theater there was so much anticipation for it that everyone seemed to love it It was probably the best movie of that year but it is not on the level of Scorcese s best works However it is good and watchable compared to most movies This is due to Scorcese s masterful directing He can turn a relatively simplistic story into a compelling drama with attention to gritty details I don t think this should be ranked where it is at about 42 on Top 250 I could see it in the 140 180 range maybe It s a fun movie but some of it feels bloated and some of the acting is mediocre Speaking of acting DiCaprio Nicholson and Sheen all do great Farmiga is good enough too as the psychiatrist But the others Damon and Wahlberg and some other supporting roles by the gangsters are a little off Fortunately Scorcese has enough script and story to work with here to hide and cover up these weaknesses especially when it first came out It s a fast moving script that equally distributes screen time for the most part for most of the actors so the weaker acting is overlooked on a first watch or two While I can totally agree with some of the 7 rating or less reviews I still can t rate this under an 8 but that s solely because of Scorcese s directing of a good script I also agree that elements of the climax scene at the end were a letdown It comes on so quickly and not only did I not like that Colin takes out Costello but I also didn t find it very believable in a way I would have had Colin arrest Costello by that time Colin had no idea that Costello was maybe going to give him and the other mole up to the bureau as I didn t buy that Colin could be that ruthless to basically his dad who made him everything he was It was a violent and disappointing turn of events But I get it it sets up the epilogue twists to take Costello out I guess Also Damon may very well be and arguably is the worst of the five main actors in the movie I feel like The Departed is the most pop culture movie that Scorcese has made and that s part of the reason he finally won his first Oscar for it as it appealed to everyone and didn t have much competition in 2006 It s a very flawed very good movie but not great It s not as great as Goodfellas and probably not as good as Casino But it was fun to see Scorcese make another good gangster movie with a flamboyant cast of actors,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9230922/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2008,Red Meat for Oscar,Martin Scorsese s blood splattering story of organized crime and cell phones in Boston Massachusetts Mainly it involves two infiltrators Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan Jr is a police officer sent undercover into the camp of Godfather type Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan is an active detective working undercover for Mr Nicholson It is an intriguing plot directed with a abundance of flair Mr Scorsese quite interestingly teams up Nicholson with Mr DiCaprio the two actors have often been compared Nicholson clearly revels in his character DiCaprio plays along stroking his face as Nicholson seems to improvise Mr Damon is less showy and more effective he uses is natural accent well and is the most consistent of the three leads The supporting cast is solid Mark Wahlberg as Dignam makes the best of the secondary roles Pay attention to what Mr Wahlberg says about haircuts he s dead on I have the comic book Nicholson buys Damon s character when he s a kid it s Wolverine 11 dated early EARLY SEP 1989 Note that Scorsese reprises the bag of groceries scene at the end of the movie without the comic Rats That and the over reliance of cell phones place the setting as roughly around the film s year of release I wonder were the Boston police amused The soundtrack seems inappropriately laced with oldies probably this is reflective of Nicholson s domineering character It s odd to hear John Lennon s relatively obscure Well Well Well played perversely Lennon is mentioned as a Costello favorite Scorsese should have considered using the Plastic Ono Band album s Working Class Hero the song s infamous use of what Lennon called the Fuh King word would have been appropriate Scorsese with a dose of Nicholson proved to be irresistible red meat for Oscar voters but this isn t the director s best work The Departed 2006 Martin Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1939183/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,"One of the best films this year, despite a couple of flaws.",Acting Top notch Everyone involved gives a top caliber performance and let me just say it s so good to see Nicholson being the crazy badass we all know and love again Even though Baldwin doesn t have much screen time he steals the show with almost all of his lines Dialogue I cracked up more than once and I felt myself barely breathing the rest of the time It went from darkly humorous to riveting in a flash and did so brilliantly Story I gasped more than once during the ending if that s any inclination This movie s long but it more than held my interest the entire time so I m not complaining So why didn t I give The Departed a ten It was held back from true greatness by shoddy editing I noticed at least ten inconsistencies and I m sure there were more that I missed since I was so entertained and a very serious flow problem It jumped from scene to scene so quickly that I found myself confused a decent part of the time especially in the beginning and a good portion of scenes were completely useless For example there s a one minute long scene of Nicholson s character throwing crack on a bed and telling a hooker to snort it till she s numb that comes out of nowhere and disappears just as quickly You could say it was to show how screwed up his character was but trust me there was plenty of whacked out crap to serve as proof of the villain s madness so the scene was useless Despite its flaws though it shouldn t be missed Scorsese does it again with this brutal dark caper that keeps you guessing up until the end You ll laugh you ll jump and you ll have to pick your jaw up off the floor There s one scene in particular centering around a cell phone conversation in which nothing is said and both characters stare at the phone simply thinking If the actors weren t as brilliant as they are it d be a waste but their talent lets you practically be able to read their minds Simply brilliant If you re a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Martin Scorsese Martin Sheen Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg or Alec Baldwin GO SEE THIS MOVIE,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492151/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2019,Terrific gangster thriller,Another Martin s masterpiece come alive Jack Nicolsen portrayed the role with extreme professionalism supported by Leo Matt This cat mouse run thriller keeps you at the edge of the seat Screenplay background was at it s best,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5109103/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2006,Why cast these two clowns as the leads?,This film is a duplicate of the Chinese film Infernal Affairs Infernal Affairs is one of the finest films i ve ever seen and by casting the clown DiCaprio its an insult The lead role of Sam cannot be replicated by Nicholson and the fact they changed the name from Infernal Affairs to The Departed is shocking The basic story is there is a rat working for the triads in a high ranking police position and there is police man undercover is the triads The two know each others moves but don t know who each other are which makes the film extremely tense and this makes it a superb movie Also the outfits and characteristics of the original have not been carried over Basically this is a Hollywood SHAM and although I respect Scorsese as a director the movie is not good thanks to him its good thanks to the original Watch the original Infernal Affairs It will be one of the best things you ever see,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1490323/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2007,Scorcese does it again,What can I say This is the best gangster flick I ve seen since Goodfellas This movie had me engrossed the entire time and I definitely was not expecting the ending at all I love movies like that An all star cast doesn t hurt either The acting was excellent though I think Mark Wahlberg s character was a bit over the top His character was unlikeable though at the end of this movie it works out because the ending wouldn t have worked if he wasn t such a high strung A hole The plot was simple yet intricate A special unit of the police is out to round up a bunch of gangsters by placing a rat in the gang only there s a slight problem The gangsters have a mole working in the police department I will say that I m going to have to rent this one again to catch a lot of stuff I missed the first time through I m sure I ll enjoy it as much as I did the first time Go out rent this one along with Goodfellas The Godfather and Casino and have a great night of gangster action,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1758579/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2006,Scorsese Does It Again,Scorsese taking a good movie and turning it into a cinematic masterpiece that will always stay with us Lots of people did not enjoy the movie because it felt as if it were dragging which i believe is completely wrong The movie didn t drag allot of people thought the movie should have ended after Frank Costello got shot The point of the movie was that there was a rat in the mob helping the cops and a rat in the cops So now we had to find out what was going to happen the story is pretty much based on the inner man giving info to the enemy rat I think this was portrayed in beautiful fashion with an all star lineup including Mark Wahlberg Jack Nicholson at his best and Matt Damon maybe one of his greatest career moves I thought this movie was excellent another great hit from a hall of fame director Martin Scorsese 10 out of 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1527766/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2020,MASTERPIECE,No words can describe how great is this movie I didn t get bored for even a second the entire 2 and a half hours and I didn t mind more The ending was not expected at all but it was perfect Everything was perfect the acting was spectacular and the directing was on spot Perfect moving i felt everything I totally recommend watching,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5919545/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2022,Please watch Infernal Affairs instead,The Departed is based on Infernal Affairs 2002 a far better film with top rate acting and a tense gripping and taut storyline Infernal Affairs is 1h 41 mins long vs The Departed s 2h 31min so save yourself 50 mins of bloated storytelling and check out the much better original instead The best scenes in The Departed eg The one in the cinema where they follow each other in a cat and mouse chase are lifted straight out of Infernal Affairs anyway Watching Infernal Affairs I was on the edge of my seat even though I was reading subtitles which usually takes away suspense for me watching The Departed I didn t need subtitles but struggled to get through the movie With the additional 50 mins screen time The Departed has added an unnecessary love triangle and a range of unfathomable complications that stretch believability Sometimes less really is more,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8654675/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2010,"The original was not that long, and way better and intense.",This movie is too long and it has too many twists which made it less intense than the original movie There was no reason to put in so many twists and killings which only made this movie a little confusing and illogical Even gangsters don t just kill random people everyday They could have focused on the two main characters made this movie shorter that would be a little more interesting to watch I wasn t sure that this was the copy of the Hong Kong movie until I saw cpt queenan got thrown from the roof top Overall this is a bad copy of the original movie due to its bad storyline Of course it had so many famous actors Otherwise it could never have got such a high rating even higher than the original movie,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2335967/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2006,Who ever heard of Westerners copying Asians,Shocking is the only word for the originality of this movie The movie is an almost exact replica of a Chinese film made 4 5 years ago called Infernal Affairs which won every nomination at the Chinese version of the Academy Awards Not only was Infernal Affairs better in every aspect it was original The director and writer of this movie should be sued on the same basis that Taiwanese counterfeit makers are arrested for making Pradda with two Ds Nikey with a Y and Soney with an E With all the money Hollywood makes you d think there would be some left for originality And to top that off instead of an improvement which most remakes are this movie did not do the original justice To those that are interested in watching this movie may I suggest paying less to buy the DVD of Infernal Affairs where popcorn would not be a requirement to enjoy the movie but rather a distraction from concentrating on a well made original film,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496683/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2020,A crime drama masterpiece,One of the best movies of all time The great Martin scorsese has made a perfect crime thriller drama which also has awesome cast Young decaprio The Legend Jack Nicholson And of course matt damon,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6185662/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2006,good but not goodfellas.,Right lets get a few things straight this is not the performance of Jack Nicholson s career although its good it is not the return to form we were hoping for from Scorsese and neither Matt Damon nor Leonardo Decaprio are that convincing as the two main cops All that aside this isn t that bad a film there are moments of Scorsese magic there is a stellar cast including Ray Winstone Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin to name a few of the excellent actors here it has a great soundtrack and a killer script Sadly it is a bit too long and not as good as Internal Affairs on which it is based Where it does shine it really is very bright but the flaws hold it back too much to be a career high for anyone involved it is a lazy Goodfellas at best and a Snatch Lock Stock hybrid at worst The casting of Matt and Leo neither of which I rate as actors as the rookie cops is an inspired take on the original story but the fact that in Internal Affairs the two cops trying to rat each other out had been on the force for so long gave the film a gravitas that just isn t here A rather flimsy tentative connection is hinted at by a love interest they both find themselves sharing but it never goes anywhere in fact her character just kind of disappears out of the plot leaving unanswered questions Essentially the script highlights apart from Nicholson come from the banter between Baldwin and Wahlberg as the two department heads set with the task of bringing down Costello Nicholson but neither having access to each others resources Being a rare 18 certificate means that Scorsese can still get graphic if needs be and he does There are laughs winces and tension and enough twists to keep your head spinning Scorsese has also embraced the technological revolution and made mobiles and texting a prevalent form of communication between the cops and the bad guys and especially for the moles to sneak out info Without spoiling the end or any of the really good bits I cant really say anymore just that this is an OK film not brilliant by Scorsese s earlier standards but worth seeing none the less certainly the best he s done for a while,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1495607/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,no goodfellas,I folk can remember the impact of Scorceses spellink Goodfellas and a fine if violent film it is The Departed will probably be hailed as a return to that fine form but I hope folk are paying carefull attention because apart from a few notable one liners it really is too much the remake and not an individual film The story is complelling enough but not enough twist potential is made of the rich characters created in this version which has always been the directors strength Jack Nicholson however seems a bit reigned in leaving acting credits to Leonardo for the main cast but the supporting cast pulls some surprising irons out of the fire Alec Baldwin as the furious sweaty police captain and Martin Sheen as the proverbial good cop show there is more to casting than who is popular at the time Good but not fab,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492190/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2007,"Great names, but a great film....?",The Departed starts of very promising but along the way the film loses momentum and credibility It s a great Hong Kong flick Why Because you know it s a comic book it s not real life Like the old film noirs from the 40 s and 50 s you know you are not looking at real life but at one dimensional cardboards And thats great fun But it s not a great Hollywood flick Because it tries to add realism to a not so realistic story The dialogue is very good but the actions taken by it s characters who are one dimensional are a mysteries If you present it real you have to explain If you present it as entertainment you don t have too That the main weakness of The Departed for me Also it s not a Scorcese picture It s a bland film that could have been made by almost any TV director The actors are great and work with some fantastic dialogue although Matt Damon and Mark Walhberg really can t act and should stay doing action films The crew delivers top notch work but for me it still doesn t work It feels to convulted and I have the feeling that even though the film runs at 2 1 2 hours most character motivation was left on the cutting room floor,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1602488/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2007,Deserving of every accolade it received. The rebirth of gangster film.,I m not going to pull any punches here The Departed is the definition of a crime thriller Any fan of Martin Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Wahlberg and gangster films will absolutely love The Departed which deserves to go down as one of the best films of the last 25 years if not of all time It is near perfect in every aspect of film making and is a non stop heart pounding gripping and brilliant thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more Gang lord Frank Costello 3 Time Oscar Winner Jack Nicholson is practically the most feared man in all of Boston For years he has controlled the streets with unparalleled authority But now that could change The police has assigned a young man from another gang family turned police officer Billy Costigan 3 Time Oscar Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio to infiltrate Costello s system with hopes of bringing him down once and for all Meanwhile Costello has assigned his most loyal and trusted friend Colin Sullivan Oscar Winner Matt Damon to be a mole within the Massachusetts State Police Department When both sides discover that they have a mole in their midsts it s war between the police and Costello The real standouts of the film are DiCaprio Mark Wahlberg Jack Nicholson director Martin Scorsese and writer William Monahan The cast is phenomenal probably the best ensemble acting this year DiCaprio gives the second best performance of his career only to Blood Diamond an Oscar nominated performance a role which really is an actor s role There are so many emotions involved with the character of Billy Costigan and DiCaprio expresses them naturally The feelings of fear hate depression and indecision are displayed naturally and perfectly It would have been very easy to nominate him for 2 Oscars in 2007 but they don t allow that Mark Wahlberg gives the best performance in the whole film as the menacing cop Dignam He steals the show in every scene he s in with his intensity and no holding back approach in this Oscar nominated performance He upstages just about every other actor in this film and looking at DiCaprio and Nicholson that s extremely impressive Jack Nicholson is the villain of the film and he is just plain scary There are moments when you will jump in fear of him and you won t laugh at his jokes not because they re not funny but because you re scared to laugh at him DiCaprio and Nicholson feed extremely well off of each other DiCaprio has a thing for working well with other great actors see Johnny Depp Daniel Day Lewis Cate Blanchett Djimon Hounsou and Tom Hanks The other stars while they are great are not at the level of Wahlberg DiCaprio and Nicholson It s not really his fault but Matt Damon just doesn t seem right with a Boston accent He does capture the essence of his character very well Colin Sullivan is a character you may not understand at first but as the film progresses you ll know his motives and understand his actions Well done by Mr Damon Vera Farmiga is proving to be one of the next generation up and comers with her second golden performance of the year Running Scared was the other Her ability to display powerful emotions such as anger and sadness pave the way for her to eventually become a leading lady in the caliber of Hilary Swank or Reese Witherspoon Her performance as the conflicted and truly good Madolyn is one of the best of the year and it s a shame she s been overlooked so much in the awards field It must be because her character has the least connection to the main story while she is strongly connected to Damon and DiCaprio s characters Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone give great performances both being in small supporting roles Winstone in particular stood out to me In the smallest supporting role is Anthony Anderson an actor generally known for comedy With Hustle Flow and now The Departed Anderson is proving that he is one of the more versatile performers in the business with a good and likable performance Writer William Monahan pens an excellent script adapted from the Asian thriller Infernal Affairs Monahan does not allow the story to slow down at all making it feel much shorter than the 2 and a half hours it runs Monahan develops every character extremely well and that is the strong point because there really aren t that many twists and no huge one either Monahan won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar because of the excellent characters he created Legendary director Martin Scorsese won his first Oscar for this film because his film making here and all the time is simply amazing From the cinematography to the sets and backgrounds he created to the direction of a trio of phenomenal leading performances and a couple great supporting performances Scorsese is at the top of his game in The Departed It s his best in a long time possibly his best film It s extremely hard to find fault with The Departed except that I wish Mark Wahlberg had more screen time but that was just because he was so damn good The Departed is one of the best films of the last 25 years and should not be missed by any true fan of the movie industry Remember it won Best Picture of 2006 which it rightfully deserved I absolutely loved this film and recommend it to everyone age 16 and up due to the brutal violence strong language and sexually explicit dialog The f word is spoken over 200 times if you need an idea of how severe it is 10 10 spy,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1594249/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2023,Bad casting,There are some great actors in this film and it could have been one of the greats but there are some dodgy actors who spoil the whole thing DeCaprio and Nicholson carry the film but others I found were not credible at all Was it supposed to be a bad remake of the Goodfellows if so it failed it is unfortunate that this film was marred by the bad presence of some poor actors that made the whole atmosphere except for these two top class actors not as good as it could have been by far Actors who play the same type of parts all the time are a pain in the arse I think you can gat my drift from this remark,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9202612/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2020,Sufficient,Really impressive entrance scene is welcoming to us Clearly introducing the character his effects to the other people and his personal characteristics The scene contains all of them Also the perfect acting of the Jack Nicholson highly augments this condition Absolutely marvellous The time range which is containing of these scenes about 10 minutes with the police academy scenes is pretty short but this is not causing any error Afterwards the mini plot twist is improving this beautiful effect One of the good event in this movie is the process is obvious even though contains the complicated stories Also the bad end is exraordinary and quite dramatic I like that Actings are magnificent it beggars all description But after the nice scenes the part which is when the Di Caprio at the interview is so confusing and just about these times we contiously hear music The music status progress with the movie this is really annoying to me If we watch an action movie this doesnt have to mean all of the scenes must contain action and tension music We watch a dialog scene and in the background constantly hearing a music together with it The music pull me out from the movie What am I doing now Am I listening to music or watching a film So my general suggestion is fairly good But I think this is a bit exaggerated 43 best movie at the imdb list There is no doubt this is a good movie but I didn t find it a cult movie,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6295444/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2007,"""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.""",The first lines of this movie are said in a monologue by Jack Nicholson s mob boss character Frank Costello He starts with I don t want to be a product of my environment I want my environment to be a product of me This line essentially sums up the movie even before it begins The Departed is an Americanized version of a Hong Kong filmed called Infernal Affairs and tells the story of two Boston state troopers one goes undercover and works against the Costello gang from within Leonardo DiCaprio s Billy Costigan and one works for the Special Investigation Unit while still on Costello s payroll Matt Damon s Colin Sullivan Each one lives in a world of deception each trying to keep their real motives a secret from their adoptive bosses each trying to out maneuver the other The Departed ends up being a 150 minute long cat and mouse game between two guys who are referred to as rats in the entire movie At first each takes to their responsibilities with vigor and enthusiasm with Costigan having the more difficult assignment trying to infiltrate a gang who all knew he was once a cop As the movie goes a long we feel the noose tightening around each as both characters go through moments of dread and loss until the bloody ending where all of the characters who deceived and schemed ended up getting a suitable punishment Each character in the movie imposes their outlook on the world on their situations as each one makes their own luck so to say as the first line uttered by Nicholson alluded to None of the characters are the result of a predetermined destiny as everyone made decisions on their own and had to live with their results As Costello said their environments were all products of their own actions As far as Scorsese s direction goes it is as usual top notch with quick cuts when quick cuts are needed a neat opening that gives about as much background information as we viewers could possibly need in a fast paced 15 minutes before the opening credits even finish a fine selection of music almost Tarantino like in how the music matched each scene and as much violence and obscenities as you could possibly get in two and a half hours Boston makes for a fascinating location for a movie such as this a rich subtext to each character the possibility for interesting supporting players and a gritty street life that makes it a poor man s version of New York City without having thousands of movies made about it already The one problem with the Boston setting is the accent thing some of the characters lose the accent then it magically comes back This is always a concern when it comes to Boston movies Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are terrific as high level police officers and Mark Wahlberg goes all in with his portrayal of the salty Sergent Dignam But the real stars are DiCaprio and Damon each young actors who have really developed into well rounded portrayers of emotion and gravitas Yes DiCaprio may never really leave the Titanic but here he shows he can act in a subtle yet strong roll in a Scorsese movie that is almost as good as Goodfellas,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1601871/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2006,best mob movie since scarface,and I love mob movies I loved this movie When I think of mob movies I think of the Godfather s Scarface and Goodfellas in that order It s not the Godfather but it is definitely a classic The story is better than Goodfellas yes I know that was based on a real story but this one seems more realistic The violence and dialog are so much more satisfying than Scarface You feel like the violence makes sense and isn t there just to decorate the movie And the characters are nearly as compelling as the Godfather The acting and writing is so good that I will be disappointed if there are not multiple Oscar wins for the cast and story I could easily see ones for Nicholson and DiCaprio and I normally don t like Leo I m not sure what the running time was but if anything I felt the film was too short It was paced well and tidied things up nicely but I felt like I wanted to spend yet more time with the characters to understand them Imagine if you only got one movie to know who Vito Corleone was And of course the directing was A Scorcese is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors W o giving things away some of the duality and contrasts are brilliant One guy has one phone which he switches the sim cards Another has two phones which he carries around openly I can t wait to see this movie again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1521258/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,"More of the same - good, but the same",Don t get me wrong I am a big Marty Scorcese fan but I want to point out a few things about his latest film that you may not have noticed because he has become so crafty over the years These are some of the tricks or Devices which were cool in Casino when first used but now that it is ten years later they seem a bit tired and overused 1 The use of Early Rolling Stones music under a scene Can t you afford to hire a real composer OK we get it Rolling Stones music is cool but do you have to use it in every movie and have it play under scenes 2 The steady cam shot into a place of business that the mob guy has dominion over Although the steady cam shot in this film was relatively short it still reeked of the same type of shot into the Copacabana club in Good Fellas 3 The Iris wipe This to me was never a good idea and in fact seems like a frustration of the limitations of film by Scorcese Basically the director can t find a way to focus our attention on a particular piece of business in the shot so he narrows our field of view to exclude everything else except what he wants us to see 4 Lots of graphic violence Again OK we get it Organized crime kills people and chops them up and puts their heads in vices and beats them with baseball bats Hey Scorcese has an excellent special effects team headed by Robert Legato that make those head splatter shots realistic but really there is more violence in a Scorcese picture than most Friday the 13th flicks Can you tell the story with less on screen violence It seems that Scorcese forgot that the audience has an imagination and that their imagination is more powerful than his special effects and stunt crew 5 The chop sound with picture edit Again a cool and effective device for switching scenes but again more of a crutch device Can t you just find a clever way to edit from one scene to the next without chopping the music from the previous scene 6 Stupid women Aren t you ladies a little angry at how women are portrayed in Scorcese s films Let s see Jodie Foster is an under age hooker in Taxi Sharon Stone is a drugged out gold digger in Casino and Vera Farmiga plays a Psychiatrist but is basically pushed around and lied to the whole picture I am guessing that this is reflecting Scorcese s Heritage s view of women as subservient second hand citizens Imagine how much richer his films could be if he had the ability to portray a strong female character In summary I really enjoy Scorcese s directing and his visual style I am just disappointed that the little Italian man gets stuck in his bag of cinematic tricks Imagine Hitchcock using a shower scene in several movies or Kubrick using a steady cam shot behind a big wheel more than once and you get the idea I am trying to get at,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493514/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2006,Black humour and Head shots! Scorsese at his best....,The Departed is the best movie I have seen in years It s gripping shocking and hilarious all in one movie Like the best roller coaster ride one second you re laughing the next you re Oh my God as something really shocking happens Yes this movie is a remake of the classic Hong Kong Infernal Affairs I loved the original but somehow the movie seems to sit even better among the Boston Irish The performances in this movie are all standout the leads DiCaprio Damon and Nicholson as well as the support Wahlberg Baldwin Sheen and Farmiga It is their work which makes the Departed special and absolutely gripping From the hilarious one liners thrown by Wahlberg s Dignam and Baldwin s Ellerby to the intense fear and vulnerability shown by DiCaprio s Costigan as he tries to survive in the world of Nicholson s colourful and terrifying Costello Surely this movies deserves some acting nods at the Oscars I would certainly recommend The Departed You do need to be prepared for Goodfellas type violence and language but if you can live with this then The Departed will be one of the best movies you have seen in a long time 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494001/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2007,separating the pretenders from the contenders...,I kind of love films like The Departed With its big name talent long running time and compelling if somewhat hard to swallow story it sends many wannabe film critics off to their pc to rave about using words like classic brilliant and even gulp masterpiece Let s start with the positive the story basically adapted from Infernal Affairs which I purposely have not seen yet is interesting and draws you into the film Matt Damon and Mark Wohlberg were very good Damon is so good he throws the film out of balance since he is supposed to be the mirror of DeCaprios character DeCaprio alas is not up to the task of holding up his end He seems to be growing up applause but he has really grown little as an actor Some of his scenes here were painful to watch the rat scene with Nicholson in which he was acting all over the place and one scene where he pistol whipped someone was only slightly better than Donald Trump vs WWF But don t blame Leo the blame must fall directly on Scorcese for letting him get away with such an amateurish performance that even the academy which is rarely too embarrassed for anything was too embarrassed to nominate And you can t say Scorcese doesn t know good acting from bad It s too bad that he seems to have lost some of his passion for film making he was one of our very best edgy directors This film looked like it could have been directed by just anyone On the plus side I did remain interested until the end unlike Gangs of New York and the Aviator but on the minus side the last fifteen minutes of this film are so bad it makes you leave thinking the film is worse than it really is It isn t a bad film it s an over hyped mediocre film done by big names Just the kind of film that trips up the pretenders,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1635304/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2006,The Departed - Professor Scorsese teaches us all a lesson,If you think this is the usual blood and guts gangster movie you will be wrong But I do not think you will be disappointed There is so much more to this movie as long as you can put up with fiendishly clever and excessive blood guts swearing and downright beautiful acting writing direction camera work in an incomparable style that will be hard to beat at the next Oscar awards It s easy to say that the people going to this movie want to see at least one of the numerous famous actors By far the best was Nicholson but for the rest everyone very nearly as great they were nose to nose at the finish line I want you to know that I have not been a big fan of the grown but still young brat pack Dicaprio Wahlberg and Damon but I am now a believer and no one twisted my arm Seriously everyone in this movie performed extremely well If you have something against blood and guts movies and decide not to go the choice you make will deprive you of the best group performance I have seen in a long time The acting is very stylistic and sometimes comically over the top The writing and camera work will almost make the normal mystery buff drool for more And now for the master himself Martin Scorsese Bravo The way you manipulated the characters drained the Red Cross of every last drop of their reserve and yet managed to make the story so easy to follow despite its surprises was sheer genius On top of that this was an extremely fun movie to try to figure out When I knew there was going to be a twist I was surprised each time how you tricked me I suspect Jack has taken you to the dark side Good move Great movie I do not give bloody movies a 10 so giving it an 8 of 10 you can see how nearly perfect this movie was,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491074/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2021,Blood-Lust,Given the extremely talented cast and being directed by Martin Scorsese it must be an awesome movie Yes if you are male and enjoy watching men act like rabid dogs you may be correct I hated this movie but that doesn t mean it s not well done Hitler had created a great military empire but that doesn t mean its purpose was also great Having said all that STORY The story is run of the mill gangster stuff nothing special at all Frankly while the story has some intriguing sub plots it s not very interesting Yes there is constant tension if that s what turns you on Similarly the movie The Godfather only the first was another straight forward gangster story but the depth of character development was outstanding Shallow character development is the greatest technical failure of this film But it s more likely that the grotesque violence ruined the story s nuances for me I understand that violence is part of this story type but it s excessive and immoral It seems that men love to see other men tear each other apart like foul little creatures who occasionally need their blood lust satisfied I refuse to watch any more ACTING The cast is nearly pure A list so the acting is generally exceptional CINEMATOGRAPHY As expected from Scorsese the shots are clean full and capture the context and people superbly The scenes are essentially dialogue and context switching And of course there s lots and lots of cruelty blood torture and dead bodies WTF is wrong with you Hmm DIRECTING Again Scorsese is a very gifted director but so many of his films are the same like he s living out his own past or wishes through film SUMMARY I hated this movie but only because I tire of the contemporary man s lust for watching others act out the most disgusting qualities of human nature Of course the women in the story yes all of them are just props for sexual gratification which I will not longer sit through Relax It s just a movie you say Really Then why do millions of people invest anything into this as entertainment It s perverse No thanks I refuse to put garbage into my mind anymore,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6904107/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2007,"""The Departed"" Won't be Leaving Anytime Fast",There were a couple complaints about this film s length during my screening as clocking in at just over two and a half hours it s a long movie But there s a big difference between good long movies and bad long movies which this is most certainly the former The time flew by and not once did I find myself checking my watch That being said it was also a fairly original idea despite actually being a foreign remake I think it s definitely safe to say that none of the important parts were lost in translation during the conversion The finished product easily did justice to the original especially considering how poorly the majority of Americanized releases have turned out lately As far as the acting as a whole was concerned it was way above par Jack Nicholson effortlessly played a great insane gangster whose level of psychosis steadily increased Alec Baldwin was hilarious as the dedicated but extremely sarcastic administrative officer In fact I think it was the combination of these two characters that led to the perfect blend of comic relief that made it much easier for the conservative audience members to digest some of the harsher subject matter The star turn was definitely put in by Leonardo DiCaprio who displayed such naturally conflicted emotions and added so much inside depth to his role that at times it was even scary Leo s both physical and various forms of mental anguish could be felt by all I could really feel what he was going through the whole time without ever having those exact same experiences This is one time where it ll be tough to ignore him at the Oscars again Matt Damon gave a pretty flawless performance but it also felt that he had the least interesting of all the characters despite having a lot of screen presence Mark Wahlberg was surprisingly good in a different role than he s accustomed to although he did drop his accent a couple times Somewhat newcomer Vera Farmiga was passable but not overly convincing and did seem to get clunky Overall the character development could ve been better as the viewers just received a surface glance at them but I wound up caring for most of the individuals regardless The cinematography was excellent and contained some beautiful scenes of Boston along with some not so desirable shots of its seedy underground The soundtrack was amazing and not just for the wonderful songs themselves They really heightened the emotions by being blasted at some intense scenes as well Needless to say this particularly grabbed my attention Finally the editing was tight which also helped with the quick pacing and the script was smoothly written into several layers but at the same time not being formulaic Even if the scenario mainly dealt with translating the Infernal Affairs story for audiences over here This was a highly enjoyable flick and I fully recommend it on just about every level In fact my only real problem with it was that the ending felt rather contrived and was a letdown It turned messy quickly and was going all over the place when the filmmakers were trying to tie everything together Not too mention also highly improbable Notwithstanding if you can overlook that then you ll be in for a real treat as usual from Martin Scorsese This is without a doubt his best film so far this decade and could quite possibly be right there under Goodfellas It s fairly ironic that the title is The Departed because I was so intrigued that I didn t want to leave,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1561776/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2019,Everything inveils like you would not imagine!,It starts slow because you need to build each character storyline but once you re on the train the storyline catch you easily filled with great actors and Jack Nicholson leading you really expect and awesome movie and in fact it is it s nice to see Leonardo Dicaprio again doing an excellent role here Matt Damon Mark Wallbergh all very good actors This is a very nice movie it s not the usual back and forth in time story so watch and enjoy the ride I did not give 10 because you need to watch the movie carefully otherwise it becomes messy and I would have loved to have a more detailed ending,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5070492/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2011,Boston PD Culture in an Unforgettable Crime Mystery,Although I m several years late watching The Departed I was impressed by how real the film holds up despite time travel Brutal language violence Boston accents and culture and the evil conflicts between the Boston and Providence RI mob gangs creates an unforgettable Scorsese film Particularly interesting is the birds eye view of the Massachusetts Police Academy with anecdotes of how people inside law enforcement live seemingly ordinary lives while dealing with the worst evil crime syndicates in the US DiCaprio is absolutely at his best playing the conflicted undercover PD agent Billy Costigan who tries to win the confidence of his mob boss Jack Nicholson while keeping his undercover identity secret At cross purposes is Matt Damon who is doing the complete opposite as PD officer Colin Sullivan who tries to keep the confidence of his precinct boss Captain Queenan played by Martin Sheehan In fact Sullivan is double crossing his public trust by keeping the mob led by Jack Nicholson s character Frank Costello in the business of murder and extortion The Departed is an adult film period Nonetheless performances by the main cast are extraordinary note Alec Baldwin who holds the viewers attention as a PD facilitator and instructor for the plot to uncover the undercover agents There isn t another actor I know of who could execute this minor but bridge building role other than Baldwin Nicholson s evil intentions carry this film s graphic plot because his performance as a crime boss is totally convincing Otherwise Vera Farmiga is a somewhat ambiguous character who is not exactly likable but she brings the cruel pieces together in the end so to speak I would give The Departed a rating of 10 except I did not like the counseling scenes with DiCaprio and Farmiga they were not realistic Yet I believe The Departed will stand the test of time as one of Scorsese s best films and a great cultural description of America s syndicated crime culture,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2365415/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2009,Jackie Brown is much better than this,SPOILERS The Departed is lame overrated mess Infernal Affairs is better both in title and script A movie about moles here and moles there 24 and Alias had better mole stories It was longer and more complicated than it needed to be The Hong Kong versions were three movies and this one tried to put them all in one No one acts and speaks realistically It seems like the movie was set in the 80s Take the cell phones and computers away and it might as well The ending was ridiculous BANG BANG BANG BANG with CG blood People want to believe they are so smart and intelligent for thinking this movie is so great Just because it has a lot of big names doesn t mean it s good The Academy is full of crap as always for putting this movie on top Jackie Brown is a better alternative It is another long normal talking movie but it s more realistic and even has comedy which The Departed lacks,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2163053/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2006,Scorsese hits the jackpot..... again !!!,The Departed is one of the best contemporary thrillers that I have seen True its a remake and critics will be be saying So what the Chinese did this before and even made sequel to it But Scorsese s Departed is a whole new thing Firstly Jack Nicholson Screw me but I m a big fan of him Even though Nicholson is the villain the movie doesn t give him much of a headway He starts off as a local absconder and rises up to a mafia boss but throughout the movie he rules about every other actor Be it DiCaprio or Damon Even in the scene where he dies he commands an aura of respect Second point making this a must see is undoubtedly its marvelous star cast True again that some of the actors were not used to their potential like Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg but still no one would be able to resist the temptation of such an unbelievable cast Thirdly Martin Scorsese The bloke has given Hollywood some amazing movies over the years He may go down in history as the greatest director not to get a Academy Award I cant see him bagging an award for this since its a remake but he truly is a genius And lastly Pink Floyd If you people are wondering if I have lost my nuts then no Indeed Floyd s most remarkable song Comfortably Numb does feature in the movie in the love making scene between DiCaprio s character and Vera Farmiga No point harping about the story cause many people saw the smash hit Infernal Affairs and its a clone of that Every odd scene leaving out the ending The technical bits was good Screenplay was solid acting out of the world there was some bits for comic relief Some real cool stuff shown with cell phones Matt Damon DiCaprio and Martin Sheen all were very good Vera Farmiga also looked good even being a new face Alec Baldwin was vastly underused so was Mark Wahlberg But end of the day Jack Nicholson owned the movie He set the tone and even at the age of 75 he commands such respect The scene at the porn theater I couldn t comprehend Nicholson enacting that masturbating drama but he pulled it off Its like a tug of war with all the heavy weights on one side and the 75 year old man on the other So bottom line Departed is one hell of a movie a rated must see 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1519287/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2020,Utter Garbage,Using abusive words in each sentence does not result in awesome dialogues This movie is a garbage This was sheer disaster and I couldn t handle it for more than half an hour Nuisance and extremely irritating dialogues When movie makers don t have anything good to show they just use the abusive language throughout the movie And it s a shame on the name of cinema And today I fugured out why it took Leonardo his whole life to win an Oscar because most of his movies are garbage dumped with abusive and irritating dialogues And over a million people giving this a rating of 8 5 clearly show that everything is wrong with this world These people really don t know what good or sensible cinema is like,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6099331/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2006,I thought it was boring...,I didn t know who directed the movie until the credits when the name Scorsese popped up so I saw the movie without any expectations I must say I wasn t very impressed First off the infiltration of Costigan into Costello s gang happened way too fast and wasn t very convincing just like the infiltration of Leo s character in Gangs of New York Mark Wahlberg s character Dignam felt really fake the kind of language he used was not very likely to be used by someone in his position same goes for Baldwin s character capt Ellerby The love triangle drama was just pathetic why would she date some ex con with drug problems when she s already moving in with Sullivan a career cop who climbs the latter in the department like a sky rocket i e very unlikely They tried to portrait Costello as this big time mobster but the way he handled business felt more like a small time gangster stealing pocket change from some corner shop I haven t seen the original Infernal Affairs so I can t say weather or not this was worse but I would really think so The only part that surprised me positively was in the end when the other mull showed up and blew Costigans brains out I didn t expect that one That kind of woke me up too bad it was just before the credits,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1549079/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2007,In-Credible!,The fact that IMDb gave this movie as high rating as Academy did sure does shake IMDb S OWN CREDIBILITY Some negative reviews i read above indicate to an awfully bad directing to which after watching the DVD i fully agree Mr Scorsese must be ashamed for accepting this Oscar He was robbed for his Oscar with Taxi Driver now he lets Academy do the same s t in turn to some other deserving director How shallow Puts shadow on his earlier works It is my impression that ever since 9 11 Oscars were mostly fake political interest profit driven Is this an indication of THE downfall The younger actors did well too bad they will be remembered in association with THIS Because when the balloon over marty s great masterpiece pops the critics Eberts etc will go down on this movie like flesh hungry condors However i don t think watching it was a waste of time It made me once again appreciate the great Gimme Shelter by Rolling stones The next movie on my watching list IS titled Gimme Shelter http www imdb com title tt0065780,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1642369/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2006,His departure lasted way too long....but he's back!,The man spawned legions of imitators and followers some good some bad and some terrible His style is unrivaled his violence over the top his language coloured but his expertise unparalleled The man has never been recognized by the Academy and for a crime like that there are no words But what the man does best is not win awards it s the gangster movies And oh how long it s been since we saw one Martin Scorcese is back in the vein that made him great the vein where he revealed a whole new style of film making a style imitated by many young talents in the industry today such as Quentin Tarantino He s respected like no other and he shows why in his latest gangster movie his first in 10 years 2006 s masterpiece The Departed Starring a cast that fires on all cylinders never slacking in any department it is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs transposed to a Bostonian setting in which gang business plagues the city and investigations on the reigning crime lord Frank Costello expertley portrayed by Jack Nicholson in a scene stealing role always seem to turn up empty Enter new State Police officer Billy Costigan an Award deserving Leonardo di Caprio a man with a troubled past His assignment to lose himself in the world of organized crime and become an undercover unit in Costello s gang However not is all as it seems with Costello having his own spy within the State Police a rat of a cop Colin Sullivan well played by Matt Damon who is sent to find the undercover within Costello s crew It s a deadly game of cat and mouse where one false move could mean certain death for either party involved The story is excellent and engrossing but the real star here is not only the actors but the style That s Scorcese s bread and butter the style Expertly cut and crafted every shot seems as though it s cool without even being overly remarkable Martin Scorcese has been dabbling in styles unfamiliar to him While well respected by the Academy though still never winning I believe John Stweart summed it up best it was a departure from his career making mold This isn t always a bad thing as Steven Spielberg has slowly undergone a metamorphosis into a very different director than he began as however for Scorcese his newer movies just didn t feel right All that changes with The Departed A crowning achievement for the dismal year of 2006 and definitely a contender at Oscar time Perhaps maybe justice will be served and Scorcese will finally get his due Either way the man remains the best at what he does and that is whatever he wants,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1521828/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2006,When the good and evil cannot be distinguished!,This film is the remake of the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs It is about the situation when evil and the good can no longer be distinguished This film does not feel like 2 5 hours along at all There is not a moment of slack Crucial things happen in every scene and they happen for a reason Apart from the suitable pacing the story is also great Though it is a remake I can see quite a lot of difference from the original I like the way that only the concept from the original is used and all the details are original Acting is great by all parties There is romance there is a lot of blood there is portrayal of trust and betrayal There is something for everybody One minor complaint though is that the ending outside the lift is a bit artificial I can t say more but if you watched the film you will know what I mean,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1503160/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2022,A note on why the Departed missed the point of Infernal Affairs,One question to ask yourself when watching Scorsese s The Departed compared to the Hong Kong original Infernal Affairs Scorsese didn t realise it was a remake until after he bought the rights to the script and didn t watch the original so as not to influence his vision The result is a mixed bag Do large budgets and A list celebrities make a film better The two films are separate enough not to be a straight up American retelling but the story is essentially the same The Boston accents and hilarious banter between the cops especially by Walberg who delivers some brilliant insults are a fantastic addition However the one thing it lacks is the subtext of the original Infernal Affairs was released shortly after the British handover a time when a lot of Hong Kongers were experiencing an identity crisis It was the perfect metaphor for the future of Hong Kong being a mole in Chinese society to protect Hong Kong or vice versa This was the real beauty of Infernal Affairs and something no budget or list of celebrities was able to replicate,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8050765/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2012,Oh My God What Has Leonardo DiCaprio Done,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2703393/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2021,A good movie...but c'mon.,Not sure why all the over the top glowing reviews Have people s bars been set that low Good film to watch and entertaining but certainly not a masterpiece as some are saying Good story and acting but the editing in the beginning was so bad I thought I was watching a preview And the ending is absolutely stupid Think about it for a second Does it make sense to you I won t spoil it here see it and be entertained But a masterpiece Not likely,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7385421/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2023,too many plot holes,The plot of this movie has too many plot holes In the beginning Leonardo s character Billy has just graduated from the police academy and only spent six months in prison yet he manages to convince the gang leader Frank Costello Jack Nicholson that he s not a cop and it is unbelievable that Frank easily believes him Then in every mission Billy becomes a key figure It is more reasonable in the original that Chan Wing yan corresponds to Billy had been taken away while still in the police academy and been undercover for ten years with Hon Sam corresponds to Frank been undercover for three years And It s unbelievable that despite Frank suspecting a mole several times he never doubts Billy who came from the police academy had the most apparent suspicion However every time he can shake off suspicions At the end of the movie there is a chaotic shootout and Dignam Mark Wahlberg emerges as the ultimate winner It s impossible to discern what Scorsese intended to convey here In the original version besides telling an undercover story it also conveyed the idea of giving bad people a chance to reform themselves However just when you are expecting the movie to convey its final message it abruptly ends with this inexplicable shootout and the main characters are dead,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9156360/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2015,Not Quite About Whitey Bulger!,Martin Scorsese s The Departed is a terrific entertaining film despite the violence profanity and some sexuality Jack Nicholson gave one of his best performances as Frank Costello a Boston mobster Instead of Italian mobsters in New York City it is Boston and Irish mafia Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover cop in Costello s mob Matt Damon plays cop and his mole The two men don t know who is playing who The film features great supporting performances by Ray Winstone Martin Sheen Mark Wahlburg Vera Farmiga The film storyline is gripping to watch and can t help to see how it ends Martin Scorsese did a fabulous job in recreating the Boston mob The film was shot on location in Boston Scorsese and his brilliant film editor did a terrific job Damon and DiCaprio gave terrific acting performances as two men driven to get and or help Costello In the end there are just too many departed after all the violence,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3336171/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2007,Of rats and men,This movie is a good one worth watching and all This being said I got kind of bored watching it I mean OK the tension was female repelling high and the idea was kind of funny But in the end you just ask yourself are you the wiser for watching the movie or did you just waste 150 minutes of your life The actors all play very well the directing is flawless and I even liked the soundtrack It was an inspirational insight into the lives of Italo Irish mobsters and the state police locked into a perpetual battle that no single side can win Yet it was all it was Bottom line you have to either enjoy the genre very much and see the references to other movies of the same type or have a lot of time on your hands to watch it and really like it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1621622/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,An explosive crime-thriller! Could be the best movie of the year.,Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio and Colin Sullivan Matt Damon are two new Police Academy graduates who are trying to make it into the police department However Colin has been raised by the notorious Irish mafia crime lord Frank Costello Jack Nicholson and is only there to infiltrate the police dept He makes it through the interview and becomes an employee of the unit whereas Billy is denied the same opportunity Instead Billy is offered to take an assignment as an undercover cop to infiltrate the mafia But this is a very special assignment and only two police officers Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen and Dignam Mark Wahlberg know that Billy is actually a cop So we have two men each working secretly for the other side and no one except their bosses knows their true identities Soon each side realizes that there is a mole in their unit and tries to uncover his identity That s when things start to get tricky As each party tries to inform their boss about the possible future actions of the other side it turns into a dangerous game Colin warns his boss Costello ahead of time because he knows about the operations of the police department and Billy tries to inform Oliver and Dignam about what Costello is up to This is truly an excellent film that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the very end The plot is very well written and despite the many twists and turns it feels completely natural I feel the need to say a few things about Leonardo DiCaprio I have always liked his acting but his performance in this movie is truly magical He has matured as an actor and he completely steals the show in this one He is explosive All the other actors are actually performing very well I am not a big fan of remakes and this is a remake of an originally a 2002 Hong Kong movie Mou gaan dou see the name Siu Fai Mak in the writing credits he is the screenplay writer for the original movie Having said that I must admit that this movie really blew me away and I am not a kind of guy who is easily blown away This could be the best movie of the year,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1509272/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2007,Tries too hard to be clever & fails miserably,I rented this because of all the rave reviews though I must say that after Goodfellas I don t expect much from Scorsese While it is watchable not awful there are at least 100 films in my queue that would have been more worthwhile Almost every scene in this movie plays out like a rehash from another movie so I was surprised to see that this was supposed to be a remake of Infernal Affairs which I thought was quite good Nothing in this movie rings true a psychologist that dispenses drugs to patients after they ve asked for them a chief of police who hires a rat to find out who the rat in the department is a graduate of the police academy who works his way up to the top in less than a year the implausibilities are endless The dialog plot are quite contrived the acting is always over the top everyone has to use expletives all the time The movie just spends too much time trying to be clever and not enough time developing any believable characters or plot It s a sad commentary on the poor taste of the masses that a film this bad can get such a high rating,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1610244/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2006,Definitely not as good as the original Hong Kong film,Now I hate to be the devil s advocate here but I honestly think that the HK version was definitely much nicer I guess the key difference lies in the fact that mafia and triads are very much a part of the Chinese social fabric which makes it appealing to movie viewers Also Jack Nicolson did not really pull off the big bad wolf role that well He appeared to be more psychotic than evil Also what s the deal with his woman companion She did not serve much purpose in building his character in the show And there was just too much bloodshed What s up with all the shooting people in the brain scenes However I must applaud the 3 leading actors Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg They did pull off their roles very well For those who did not watch the original HK version Infernal Affairs I highly recommend you to watch it It will be one of the best foreign films you will watch this year Trust me,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1497372/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2007,remake of Hong Action movie Infernal Affairs,I liked The Departed a lot more before I saw the original I m a long time Scorcese fan but I have to say I m pretty disappointed that he remade Infernal Affairs scene for scene without making it clear in the states that The Departed is a remake It definitely diminished my opinion of his version The Hong Kong original is less violent and there s no explicit sex can t say I missed either but it is literally scene for scene the same movie Nothing against remakes but I think it s only fair to make it absolutely clear when a project isn t original If you like the Departed watch the original and see for yourself,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1780506/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2007,Far from departed for America's modern movie master,For over two decades Martin Scorsese captured the essence of the modern mafia and street wise tough guys so distinctly and vividly that the very idea of anyone else trying to so seemed infeasible With Mean Streets Goodfellas and Casino Scorsese molded ugly violent and unrepentant criminals into captivating and even likable characters that are impossible to forget After going off the beaten path with past efforts Gangs of New York and The Aviator the man most people myseslf included to be our greatest living filmmaker has returned to his roots with The Departed Simply put it s the best film of 2006 if not the last several years From the first words there s no mistake that Marty has crafted another masterpiece like only he can Obscenely crackling dialogue in your face blood and brutality and a soundtrack that hits all the right notes are only a few of the familiar fingerprints left in the reels by Mr Scorsese It s funny it s startling and it s spectacular How good is it This could very well be the work that finally gets Marty the Oscar gold that he should ve gotten a few times by now We ll have to wait a few more weeks to see if that happens but it takes much less time to see that The Departed is a masterpiece of film making from a director who has made a living out of creating them,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1594146/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Another excellent addition to the ever-growing cannon of Scorsese films,By far I think Martin Scorsese is my favourite film director He has a solid film resume under his belt and despite losing all five of his Best Director Oscar nominations continues to pump out movies When his movies are good they are usually absolutely fantastic When his movies are bad even then they still have some form of redeeming quality saving it from full ostracizing And while I was a bit apprehensive about him doing a remake of the Asian film Infernal Affairs I have now realized that I was wrong The Departed brings Scorsese back to his roots on the mean streets and back to what he does best The Departed named after what people are commonly referred to after passing on chronicles the stories of two Boston police officers both involved in the continued case to apprehend infamous mobster Frank Costello Jack Nicholson One is Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio a kid with a not so great family history who goes undercover within Costello s group soon after graduation The other Colin Sullivan Matt Damon is a member of Costello s group undercover within the police department quickly moving up the ranks Costigan and Sullivan do not know each other but as the film heats up both began seeking out the other The film is just about phenomenal I went in with high expectations and came out totally and utterly impressed I refused to watch Affairs on principle of being so hyped for this film and to a point I think this helped I knew some basic outlines and ideas of what happened in the original version but as they played out on screen here they look just as astonishing as I could imagine The film is downright intense during many sequences The cinematography and editing is seamless and absolutely awestriking There were a few obvious nodes to his older works but for the most part is generally what we have come to expect from Scorsese and his films As well the writing is sharp and extremely strong You may find yourself laughing hysterically at a few of the things people say but you will also sit in fear of these people Everyone here is a bad yet highly realistic person So when one of these characters makes some great jokes you will be conflicted as to the proper reaction to give I had no problem with Gangs of New York or The Aviator but you could tell that Scorsese was having a bit of trouble with the ambitious projects Seeing him here back in the same style of film as the likes of Goodfellas and Mean Streets just brought a smile to my face after watching the entire film You can tell the precise touches of a Scorsese film from miles away and this film is no exception He brings a fine art out of these dark streets like no one else can And of course he has the most perfect music selection of any Hollywood director currently alive and employed He uses them to make his undeniably brilliant and memorable moments all that much better and as per always he succeeds DiCaprio and Damon are excellent in their roles albeit it took a little bit before I was very trusting of either of their accents Their slow deterioration and the fear slowly creeping in on them is an absolutely pleasure to watch While DiCaprio gets a lot more screen time and is fleshed out more Damon is definitely the better actor and had the better performance These two are believable and frightening all at once As the film keeps moving and you get more of a sense of who these guys really are these feelings only continue to progress Nicholson is in top form here He chews up scenery left and right and practically steals the carpet right out from the other two While I saw shades of The Joker in his performance this is still one of those essentially totally evil acting roles You cannot help but be scared by this guy and seeing such a masterful actor in such a great director s hands is just too memorable of an idea to miss The supporting cast which includes Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin Ray Winstone Anthony Anderson and Vera Farmiga are all superb in their small roles None of them can even hold a candle to the other three but their valiant try cannot go unrewarded Farmiga and Wahlberg are particular standouts which didn t not surprise me at all granted his newer material They are a strong ensemble and they bring out the great movie watching style even more If there were anything wrong with the film it would be the pace of it all Everyone is on the ball even through blood saturated death sequences but the editing is not completely At some points particularly the first hour and the last thirty minutes the film just whizzes right by But in others the film just slows right down It makes the film feel totally uneven Some exposition scenes just go a bit too long and others are just straight and right to the point I know that the film relies on all the exposition and the graphic violence which never lets up but some of it just felt forced and a bit awkward They make the film seem a whole lot longer than it really is It is only a small quibble in an otherwise fantastic film but still worthy of mention On the whole The Departed is one hell of a movie Packed with strong performances and a great story this is another excellent addition to the ever growing cannon of Scorsese films It obviously is not as good as some of those films but it makes an astonishing contribution to the library I can only hope it is recognized at Oscar time for how memorable a film it is 9 5 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492061/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2009,Reheated affairs,Martin Scorcese has directed some fine movies but his remake of Cape Fear was amongst his weakest a near identical and thus pointless remake of the original So news of The Departed his version of Infernal Affairs made me apprehensive For those who don t know them Infernal Affairs and its two sequels were brilliant films violent yet cool stylish but in no way shallow and for a westerner like myself interesting for their take on the Hong Kong underworld a refreshing contrast to the over familiar world of American gangsters To be fair in this case Scorcese has borrowed the plot elements but made his own film a long way from a straight copy Unfortuantly he has also lost most of what was great about the originals In the place of the cool interesting world of Hong Kong we have a very loud and direct movie full of wisecracking foul mouthed ultra macho American hard men Some of the writing made me squirm it s not that the lines themselves are especially bad but there s a depressing lack of originality in the way the script is constructed Secondly in the original movie I cared for both leads but in this film both Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio s characters it s a starry cast all round with a face you recognise in every role are equally unappealing And whereas the original movie dared start with the setup complete leaving questions about how the plot got to this situation unanswered at least until the sequel Scorcese lacks the courage to do the same walking us through the complete story in broadly chronological order then adding some random pointless minor time shifting the occasional scene shown out of sequence as if in homage to his predecessor while failing to understand the rationale of the device The sad thing is that some of Scorcese s early movies such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver were as fresh and unexpected as Infernal Affairs was but in The Departed he has reduced a classic to the Hollywood model of what a gangster film should be and somehow won as Oscar for the achievement,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2040818/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2013,Very good mob film,The crime epic to end all crime epics The Departed The Departed marks Scorsese s return to gangster cinema 15 years after his genre defining Goodfellas This time however the scene is moved to Boston the focus on the Irish mob Two young cadets graduating from the academy one a devoted law enforcement officer joining the state police undercover unit The other a mole from the mob who answers directly to Irish underworld kingpin Frank Costello his mentor and father figure It isn t long before both organizations start to suspect a rat in their midst The real tension and excitement of the film stems from the two men s circular game of cat and mouse as they each try to smoke the other out while simultaneously attempting to remain anonymous to their colleagues and each other It gives a the film an ever present immediate sense of dread particularly for Dicaprio s character which I see as kind of the answer to the typical undercover cop character it s not some glamorous slick job it s stressful as hell The film gives a more realistic view on what kind of toll that would take on a person with life on death on the line every minute of every day and no time to cope with it None of that to say the film is arty which it ain t It s a bloody coarse lurid mess of a picture in the most complimentary sense While the film has more atmospheric tension and is more plot driven than some of Scorsese s earlier work there s still buckets of gore plenty of shock value and some amusing soundtrack choices for some of the more grisly moments Still I wouldn t say I liked everything about The Departed and wouldn t consider it in masterpiece territory Some aspects of the film and some of the characters I found less believable than others And I thought Nicholson s character began verging on cartoonish towards the end However the film is an excellent showcase for Leonardo Dicaprio who is electrifying in his frenzied panicked state as well as in his dialogues with Costello While the film is clearly very much an ensemble piece I would call him the standout The Departed is a very good mob film There re elements of it that have been done before but the film s particular brand of rawness and high octane tension elevate it above just another study comparison of cops criminals Because after all when you re facing a loaded gun,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2792278/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2006,A triumph,Scorsese spend a lot of years lingering on different projects Gangs of new York was okay The aviator was quite good but every fan of Marty was secretly hoping for a new crime flick from the master And this is the one The Departed is brilliant Absolutely stunning Like Goodfellas it s one of those rare movies where everything just works The acting is amazing I was never a big fan of Leo DiCaprio but the performance he gives in this changed that His character is very well developed and you feel for him right away Matt Damon gives a surprising turn as a underhanded moll infiltrating the police And of course there is Jack Nicholson in a blistering performance Jack radiates menace madness and charisma as Irish mob boss Frank Costello A true legend at work And he hasn t lost his touch There is a reason for his 12 academy award nominations And for this he will undoubtedly get his thirteenth In the supporting roles Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver the goods Wahlberg is a scene stealer with some of the best lines and he has fabulous chemistry with both Sheen and Baldwin Ray Winstone also shines as Costello s right hand man Mr French His part in this movie is overlooked in many reviews But it is a golden one The crew knocked this out of the park once again The camera work looks effortlessly smooth and Thelma Schoonmaker s editing is impeccable To top it off there is a very strong soundtrack with the indestructible Scorsese favorite Gimme Shelter The Departed is Scorsese rising back to the up even though he was never really away,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1527279/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2007,Scorsese back in gangsters movies genre,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1595188/?ref_=tt_urv

Because this movie was foul.,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628948/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2006,Scorsese's Back!,As an avid fan of the original Infernal Affairs I can say this one just about equals it Borrowing a premise and a few memorable scenes it creates an original vision by substituting the Irish gangs of South Boston for the Chinese mob of the first film Jack Nicholson as mob boss Frank Costello creates an honestly larger than life character A monster who chews scenery as only Jack could The first scenes feature a younger Costello roaming his neighborhood in the mid 80s and help set the pace of the entire movie as he recruits and trains a young boy named Colin Sullivan later to join the State Police in the form of Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is probably the film s best performance as the other side of the coin Billy Costigan recruited by fatherly Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen and his controversial colleague Sgt Dignam an explosive Mark Wahlberg With few exceptions DiCaprio has never really fit his roles he was great in The Aviator but he looked too young Here he perfectly portrays the manic stressful situation he s been placed in as the cop infiltrating Costello s crew of thugs Both men end up falling for psychiatrist Madolyn the very talented Vera Farmiga in what feels like a Hollywood love triangle But given the rather low key way it is played out it doesn t feel too corny despite the improbability Alec Baldwin offers some hilarious scene stealing moments as Damon s superior And British actor Ray Winstone gives a cold menacing performance as Costello s bodyguard Arnold French Scorsese s direction feels fresh not necessarily from his style so much as the cross cutting style he uses feels so totally different from anything else out there recently And his use of music as always works to great benefit The cast is absolutely stellar William Monaghan really gives these characters depth Jack does too And Scorsese is at the top of his game once again All I will say about the ending is I thought I d never see a movie end this way But to be vague it s all tied up in the end Will this movie win Oscars Maybe It s got the acclaim but I still wouldn t be surprised if it gets overlooked for whatever reason,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494816/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2006,If you value your cinematic experience watch the original...,I feel compelled to write my first ever review Before we all get all excited about this movie The Departed which it has just been my misfortune to view I would like to suggest to you the viewer if you value your cinematic experience to watch the original film this movie is made from Infernal Affairs http www imdb com title tt0338564 The original film is excellent and possibly the best cop film ever made in my opinion A Hong Kong made film which is truly gripping with the characterisation just pulling you into the story line The outcome of the original film also leaves you with questions and a real sense of being someplace else a sense of journey A sense which unfortunately this hash re make does not Scorsese has failed me on this one Why re make a film that is perfect One word to describe this movie rubbish See the original and you won t get disappointed Check out more world cinema and these hash re makes in English won t get made For example Bout de Souffl 1960 aka Breathless remade as Breathless 1983 Abre Los Ojos 1997 remade as Vanilla Sky 2001 L Appartement 1996 remade as Wicker Park 2004 Boudu Sauv des Eaux 1932 remade as Down and Out in Beverly Hills 1986 Les Comp res 1983 remade as Fathers Day 1997 La Cage aux Folles 1978 remade as The Birdcage 1996 Les Diaboliques 1955 remade as Diabolique 1996 Et Dieu cr a la femme 1956 remade as And God Created Woman 1988 La Jet e 1962 remade as Twelve Monkeys 1995 Nikita 1990 aka La Femme Nikita remade as Black Cat 1991 Nikita 1990 aka La Femme Nikita remade as Point of No Return 1993 Profumo di Donna 1974 remade as Scent of a Woman 1992 Taxi 1998 remade as Taxi 2004 Trois Hommes et un Couffin 1985 aka Three Men and a Cradle remade as Three Men and a Baby 1987 Yojimbo 1961 remade as Last Man Standing 1996 Rashomon 1950 remade as The Outrage 1964 Jules et Jim 1961 remade as Willie and Phil 1980 Shichinin no Samurai 1954 remade as The Magnificent Seven 1960 and Mou gaan dou 2002 remade as The Departed 2006 The list goes on and on but I have just selected the originals which I personally have seen which are all far superior to the re makes They say the greatest form of flattery is imitation but just for once let s leave the original alone can we post script OK time has passed i have watched this film again alongside the original OK it has some merit and is quite good for a remake tip my hat humbly xxx,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1503394/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2019,A must watch for everyone!,The character of Frank Costello played by Nicholson is one to be remembered Combine this with Di Caprio s troubled character that is sympathized by the audience And a good acting by Matt Damon,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4911793/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,Stunning gangster film,I think that the gangster movie genre is something that just is the same good damn movie over and over again but The Departed shows that the good old stuff still has the fire going for it It has the same plot like other gangster movies but were it truly works is the amazing funny dialogue and great performances DiCaprio Damon and Jack Nicholson is at their best with insane amount off attention that just flows through the entire movie There is a lot off brutal violence that is not for people that like that kind of stuff if you don t like blood and gore I wouldn t recommend the film It s just a gangster flick I could watch over and over again is that good the best in its genre,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4778949/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2007,Scorsese's Best,This absorbing crime drama set in Boston focuses on the dynamics of a situation where a mob informant joins the police force and an undercover cop infiltrates the mob Perhaps the best film of Scorsese s distinguished career it ratchets up the tension from the beginning and doesn t let up for a moment despite its long running time Although violent Scorsese does not dwell on the violence as he does in some of his earlier films The all star cast is in top form DiCaprio is gritty as the earnest undercover cop Damon is appropriately slimy as the informant and Nicholson is in his element as the mob boss Sheen Wahlberg and Baldwin provide good support,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1780771/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2006,Yeah buddy.....,The answer is yes This is a very good movie Scorsese is back to his former form Not that the Aviator and gangs of new york were bad movies they re actually quit good movies but not Scorsese good The Departed is Scorsese good though The story takes place in Boston which is a new field for Marty It s actually quite refreshing But when it all comes down the city doesn t really matter In terms of acting there isn t much to say Everybody does their job and well EVEN Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon Dicaprio has really become a talented actor But Matt is probably the actor that surprised me the most in this movie I m not a big fan of his but he really does a good job here I expected nothing less from the legend Jack Nicholsen which is one of my favorite actors And Alec Baldwin probably shows his best performance so far All in all a GREAT cast A great movie Probably better than infernal affairs but it is Scorsese after all 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1504505/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2007,Leo and Matt finally give stellar performances,The acting was better than I thought it would This is the first good acting role Matt Damon has had in a while I think it is also Leo s best performance to date This movie has the same vibe as Scorsese s Goodfello s but I don t think it is as good Leo is the undercover cop trying to get the goods on mob boss Jack Nickolson While Matt is one of Nickolson s boys who has landed a cop position It is soon believed there is a rat in the police force and it s Matt s job to find the rat What better way for him to tip of Nickelson about upcoming raids and keep the heat off him Lots of police surveillance trying to find the mole as well as nutty behavior by Nickelson The last 20 minutes has some shocking deaths and many head shots The revelation of the whole story was just very entertaining It was well thought out There is even major drama once Leo discovers who the mole was in the police FINAL VERDICT Very good story,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1720424/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2007,Reverse proportioned performance to the Cast,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1760515/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,Nice plot...,The Departed is a Drama Thriller movie in which we watch an undercover police officer and a snitch in the police trying to identify each other Both of them trying very hard to find the identity of each other and they have also to be very fast because there is pressure from both sides I found this movie very interesting since its plot was very clever and it consisted of some plot twists that I did not expect The direction which was made by Martin Scorsese was for one more time simply amazing and he succeed on creating and put the feelings across the audience something that created a bond between the audience and the characters The interpretations of both Matt Damon who played as Colin and Leonardo DiCaprio who played as Billy were simply outstanding Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jack Nicholson s who played as Costello Mark Wahlberg s who played as Dignam and Martin Sheen s who played as Queenan Finally I have to say that The Departed is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that it will leave you speechless,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6697808/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2018,"Brutal but splendid; a plot to be admired, savored",In South Boston one man reigns Frank Costello Jack Nicholson As he himself explains he rose from poverty little by little to become the leader of the leading gang in SB Naturally he is a thorn in the side of the Boston Police and they live to bring this man down A secret task force is formed and Billy Costigan Leonardo Di Caprio a cleancut boy from South Boston who has graduated from the police academy is given the special task of infiltrating Frank s mob pretending to be a sworn follower This is dangerous work indeed However Frank has the same brilliant idea If the gang had a plant in the police department above reproach then he would know when the police are coming to mess up his plans A disciple from his teens Colin Sullivan Matt Damon is the perfect choice he is bright good looking and seemingly genial He fools most everyone including the brass Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and a psychologist Verma Farmiga In fact Colin and the shrink begin a relationship while at the same time Cop Sullivan is relaying crucial information to Frank As such eventually Billy and Colin cross paths and get suspicious of one another Billy even goes after Colin s lady So whose traitor in the midst will be the most successful How many lives will be sacrificed This brutal but splendid film is not really for the most faint of heart Nevertheless is ultra fascinating plot has to be seen to be appreciated The story even eclipses the GREAT work of Nicholson Di Caprio Damon Farmiga and the entire crew What a breathtaking twist and turn tale of betrayal and goodness As many critics have found this may be the ultimate Scorsese film as his hands are behind every scene Thrillers come and go but The Departed will stay around for the ages,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4104156/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2007,Best movie I've seen in 20 years,I caught this on DVD last night The rest of the family was asleep while I sat in living room slowly moving from chair to chair to get closer to the TV This movie grabbed me and pulled me in hard It had everything that I like in a movie It had suspense characters that I care about and ones I hate unpredictable twists and a great ending The movie basically is the story of two police officers coming out of the academy One was sent there to be a spy for the mob Damon the other is recruited right away to be a mole in the mob for the cops DiCaprio We watch as each reported to there boss s and tries to not get caught Meanwhile a lot of people die around them the departed The suspense in this movie was so high I couldn t stand it I sit here at work the next day and I m amazed at how much I m still thinking about it The reason the suspense is great is two fold One you feel like these characters all of them are in danger real danger Two you don t know what s going to happen next All this makes for a great ride I highly recommend this movie unless you don t like mob movies This is very much a mob movie 10 10 BTW DiCaprio got robbed for not getting an Oscar nomination I really don t care for the guy but he did a hell of a good job Walberg deserved his nomination Damon was good but played it a little too cold Nicholson Sheen and Baldwin were great stars willing to play their parts to the hilt as supporting actors If Martin Scorsese had not gotten the Best Director then the Oscars would have lost ALL credibility Good Day,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1677648/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2006,Wow!!!,This is hands down Scorcese s best film since Casino I was amazed Not only at the great storytelling but at the performances as well I am No fan of either Leonardo DiCaprio or Mark Wahlberg but they both gave excellent performances Again amazed The rest of the All Star cast gave performances on par with their best Alec Baldwin has sadly become a scarcity lately and he is without a doubt the funniest man on the screen Admittedly watching Ray Winstone with an American Accent is odd although he does it well Jack Nicholson what can you say really Jack s always great but this is the best I ve seen him do in years Just great all around I can honestly say that The Departed was the best movie I ve seen in the theater in a long while,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1497150/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2007,"Great opening, slow middle and a poor ending",After watching Infernal Affairs I thought to myself Why are the Americans making a remake of such a gem There was no need especially after many TERRIBLE US remakes of Eastern movies Then I heard that Martin Scorsese was at the helm I thought there is hope When it comes down to the crunch it s the weakest crime drama from Marty compared to GoodFellas Casino and even his breakthrough Mean Streets as well as being heavily inferior to the neatly written slick Hong Kong original When going to see this with a few of my buddies I was expecting a great film from all the reviews it had received It had started out great the use of home footage of Boston riots and great dialogue from legend Jack Nicholson I thought maybe this is different from the Hong Kong movie with excellent use of the song Gimme Shelter by The Rolling Stones Nicholson plays Frank Costello the ONLY real life character an Irish mob boss who takes a young Colin Sullivan Matt Damon under his wing Years on Sullivan has become a Sgt in the Boston Police and an inside man for Costello At the same time William Costigan Di Caprio enrolled in the State Police since he s the nephew of a well known gangster Jackie Costigan who s already dead at the beginning Senior Sgt Dignam Wahlberg and Captain Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen allow him to be a cop only if he were to be an undercover and infiltrate Costello s racket as a mole Over the year or 2 Sullivan has worked up the ranks of the police and remains the inside man for Costello But Costigan has endured a violent streak and mind games from Costello who questions his loyalty over numerous occasions After a botched deal with Chinese mobsters on both sides of the badge the moles are aware of each other s presence and must find out who is the rat before they are caught When it comes to acting and the cast it was terrific Damon Nicholson Wahlberg and Di Caprio work their magic really well under Scorsese s astute direction There is good support from Alec Baldwin as a foul mouthed Police Captain yet Martin Sheen and Ray Winstone are badly underused and their characters do not show the best of their abilities The film begins on a different gritty note from the original but halfway through becomes an over violent quickly chopped rehash of Lau and Mak s masterpiece like the writers just thought of something quick which makes the screenplay seemed hacked up The original trilogy did a great job of telling the story in 3 parts exploring philosophical aspects as well as providing a backdrop for characters with a prequel The Departed crams the Infernal Affairs Trilogy into one nearly 3 hours movie and becomes quite flabby and just tries too hard to be a cool crime thriller than the original Scorsese may have won the Oscar but it s only after being snubbed over many occasions makes me wonder WHY he never won for Raging Bull the Academy owed him an Award for his previous work which is a distinct piece of cinema history so they had no choice but to Award The Departed It is a reasonably fare crime thriller but not a classic Check out the original,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1721042/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2007,"For 3/4ths of the movie a Good Film, and then, the ending!?",When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1606219/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,What was he thinking?,The acting is good A great cast Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Leonardo DiCaprio Alec Baldwin Mark Wahlberg I especially liked Leonardo DiCaprio The story is a little hard to follow But what was Scorsese thinking In a world filled with violence terrorism fears how can another movie like this about gangsters help He already made Goodfellas This is another Goodfellas Why I absolutely do not recommend this film regardless of the high marks the critics are giving it Go rent the Pirates of Penzance and see something of quality that s fun to watch,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492748/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,"Agonisingly ordinary, routine little cops and criminals piece which is best described as minor Scorsese.",The Departed is a curious thing a Martin Scorsese concept movie Here s a piece by the renowned director running on a sentence long pitch which reads something like there are these two fellas one s an undercover cop pretending to work with the mob while the other s a mole employed by the mobsters mixing it with the cops there s your pitch now run with it I ve nothing greatly against The Departed it s a serviceable and workable enough little thriller which darts along at a merry old pace but it is an oddly cold oddly distant unmoving and strangely uninvolving piece punctuated by individual moments or bits that take what has been a flagging film up to the respective point before consequently dragging it through a hedge in the proverbial maze thus onto another path entirely Where Scorsese has dealt with the gangster genre in spits and spots before namely Goodfellas and Casino and done so in a manner that took us right to the brink in terms of either coming to side with the characters or despising them The Departed chugs along with both its post 24 and post Bourne mannerisms as well as droll causality as it runs on a very specific premise plus routine character arcs Where rather gloriously straddling that line between glamorisation and demonisation in the past Scorsese has effectively relegated himself to mainstream fluff feigning to be about something whilst running on star power In short it is highly underwhelming and staggeringly average The two primary players of the film are Leonardo DiCaprio s Billy Costigan a Boston police academy graduate hired by Martin Sheen s top police captain Oliver Queenan to go undercover for the department so as to spy on mobster Frank Costello Nicholson and Matt Damon s Colin Sullivan another police academy graduate this time groomed by said mob boss from a very early age to go through the system and work on the inside of the police force for the crooks Around this nifty little premise Scorsese effectively proves he can structure a few tense set pieces and create a tone of uncertainty and paranoia predominantly from Costigan s perspective which is further aided by DiCaprio s performance of a man suffering certain emotions thus rousing the material at specific points Little in the way of the duality they share is explored Each men play roles within roles both men are on the wrong side of a verbal battering from Mark Wahlberg s Staff Sergeant named Sean Dignam Dicaprio more so because we need the entire back story of his life up to this point spelled out to us so as to know whom we re dealing with and both men come to form relationships with Vera Farmiga s police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden For large chunks of the film we don t get it we don t understand People charge and dart all over the screen going through what the overly complicated under nourishing narrative demands of them a similar sense of going through the motions equally as apparent on the other side of the camera in Scorsese s directing The plight of Costigan this angry young man with parents whom are deceased and from a very limited background and his inauguration into Costello s gang so that he may effectively risk even more by branching out into more serious things is workmanlike competent and quite taut Costigan appears smart too smart and has nothing to loose As one individual recognises early on you can t trust a man with nothing to loose Costigan s faux boss in Costello with his womanising attributes casual cocaine use and analogies to bodily excretion embedded within his threats is rightfully piggish and carries all the necessary traits required for us to accordingly despise him although is played like a cartoon character and is difficult to take seriously Costello s aid is a gangster named Mr French played by he of a wavering accent Ray Winstone Winstone does his thing a mixture of what he s done before in things like Nil by Mouth and what have you and does it in his sleep The film uneasily cuts back and forth from DiCaprio and Damon Damon of whom runs on a strand that isn t interesting and dare I say doesn t seem particularly necessary Damon s cold robotic expression throughout the film echoes the physical detachment we have from the film itself when a time comes much later on for him to actually react to a quite incredible scenario given the context he has overseen the sequence feels more grandeur and more incredible than it actually is because he s being asked to react to something he s being asked to do something Most of the dialogue in the film exists to advance whatever proceedings are required to move us all along vacant are genuinely chilling moments of eerie realty the likes of which might echo Travis Bickle s scociopathic monologue practises or long pauses on Jake LaMotta as he inhabits a locale heaving and breathing bordering on a fit of rage The sheer simplicity of it all is highlighted during one scene in which some of Costello s lesser goons stand around the entrance to a place of business randomly accusing passers by of being undercover or rats one of whom in a jovial manner is Di Caprio s character The sequence is inter cut with Damon s Sullivan sitting competently at a desk and computer frantically trying to run through whom of Costello s men might be untrustworthy highlighting just how thoroughly more skilled one man is compared to many yes we gathered this ninety minutes ago The Departed is scatty and detached it s an alienating and frustrating film book ended by individual bits and pieces that resonate but if there s a reason they do it s because droll story telling is being momentarily interrupted by a moment which just happens not because the film itself is especially engaging Where many have lauded it and where The Academy itself buckled into rewarding Scorsese with the ultimate it was merely dry and limp,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2357326/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2023,Meticulously narrated!,We Deal In Deception Here What We Do Not Deal With Is Self Deception The most important thing to take away for me is how meticulously Scorcese justapoxed these two distinct yet somewhat similar personas Despite having contrasting ambitions desires both of them began their journey from a similar position and their career and life trajectories ultimately led them to cross each other s paths and subsequently made them face the exact same fate The suspense was quite prevalent throughout the totality of a compelling narrative that fomented an exciting enlivening viewing experience Now Regarding the ensemble and respective performances there is no cause for concern Just take a quick look at those names Jack Nicholson Leo Matt Demon Mark Wahlberg Vera Farmiga you cannot go wrong with this selection of people and trust me they didn t,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8811918/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2006,The Streets Just Got Meanier,This was a great crime drama it was amazingly well directed by Martin Scororsese it was well acted by the all star cast They play off each other so well with drama and a little humor The movie begins with Billy Leonardo DiCaprio is a cop who is in deep cover to infiltrate sadistic mobster Frank Costello Jack Nicholsen at his best as of Colin Sullivan Matt Damon a cop on the take is trying to find out the undercover guy on Costellos team It is only of matter of time on how both men are in over there heads and will it come crashing down on both of them A great way to spend 2 hours and 30 minutes but it is so amazingly well paced you ll forget how long it is,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1501244/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2013,Thrilling Ride,In The Departed Martin Scorsese makes his return to the mob underworld and he does it with a thrilling intensity that overshadows his previous films From the start to the closing credits The Departed is an incredibly exciting film and there is rarely a slow moment Unlike GoodFellas and Casino the characters were written in a way that makes the viewer relate to them in a very personal way Their trials and struggles make them very human and I found myself very emotionally involved hoping for the best for the major characters Speaking of characters give credit to the acting cast for filling the roles emotionally and intensely DiCaprio and Damon were excellent in the lead roles but Baldwin and Wahlberg were an absolute joy to watch as supporting characters While the writing was intense I sometimes felt that the plot had no central point and it seemed to go on and on without resolve It is sure to keep the audience guessing but at times this was frustrating and I wanted to know more that wasn t being given to me The finale while intense to say the least didn t fill all the holes created throughout the film and is sure to leave many questions with viewers I would go as far to say the acting is some of the best I ve seen though and if you re a classic Scorsese fan this is definitely a movie well worth your time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2772537/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2007,gripping story with a superb cast,Simply riveting crime saga set in a middle class Boston neighborhood run by a wily Irish American gangster who uses his reputation authority and invaluable connections to stay a step ahead of the police as he carries out his reprehensible schemes The story focuses on two cops who are closely acquainted with him one a mole on the inside torn between his lifelong allegiance to the man who put him there and his swiftly rising duty as an officer the other a young undercover who becomes the newest member of his fearsome crew and has his life thrown into disarray An absorbing cat and mouse tale of loyalty and betrayal duty and devotion crime and punishment with terrific performances crisp dialogue and sure handed direction though the finale feels padded out Nicholson in yet another patented role is as good as it gets but he s aided immeasurably by young co stars Damon Wahlberg and DiCaprio who are all extraordinary Profane and violent but convincing and funny as well,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1613250/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2022,Probably Martin Scorsese's masterpiece...,I have seen THE DEPARTED for the first time in October 2018 and I liked it Now in August 2022 4 years later I catched it on TV and I knew I had to see it again for seeing if it held up well Guess what It did and it confirmed my idea that it s a masterpiece deserving of its praise WIth 2531 reviews to date I ll be brief Francis Costello Jack Nicholson is an arrogant Irish mob boss that is some sort of tutor for Colin Sullivan Matt Damon who 20 years later becomes a policeman for the anti crime unit of the Massachusetts Police Department At the same time Billy Costigan Leonardo Di Caprio will be a mole that has to infiltrate Costello s mob for frame him and succedds in faking of being a gang member while Sullivan will arrive to the truth also after various meetings with his psychiatrist Vera Farmiga The performances are great by everyone Nicholson looks still in top form and his performance is on par with that in BATMAN for being such a villain Damon Di Caprio Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen as usual don t disappoint and the direction and cinematography are slick and fluid One of those mastepieces on the top 250 that has to be seen at least once if you are a real movie lover and overall great in every aspect,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8735832/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Huge disappointment,The Departed is being hailed in some circles as Martin Scorsese s return to a genre he knows like the back of his hand the gritty crime drama And to be fair there are moments of grit in the film The problem is they are just that moments Nothing ever builds to any tangible feeling of dread The film s effect if it has any at all dissipates the moment the credits roll The acting is serviceable at best but the much touted script by William Monahan barely gives the main stars anything to sink their teeth into with the exception of Mark Wahlberg He s the only actor who registers anything resembling a real live human being Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon try their best but when they re not spouting exposition they re floundering with dialogue that tries in vain to give their characters some color The session between Leo and shrink Vera Farmiga for example drags on to embarrassing length in a dismal effort to give Leo some shading And while most reviews praise Nicholson he s more of a distraction than any kind of menacing character For all his offbeat touches his character never come across as dangerous in fact the longer the film goes on the less interesting he is and the more goofy and unbelievable he becomes There were times I wondered if anyone could possibly follow him into a life of crime As for Scorsese whatever gritty touch one might think the master would bring to a supposed throwback project is sorely missing At 2 1 2 hours the film has a noticeably slack pace and many scenes are surprisingly flat considering Marty s way around a camera The only scene with any real tension is the rooftop scene between Costigan and Queenan The photography editing and acting all combine in a perfect example of film suspense Nothing else in the film is nearly as exciting And the less said about the ending the better It feels like Marty is trying to channel Quentin but it just gets more and more outrageous until all connection with reality is sapped away Too bad I wanted to love The Departed but I can barely say I liked it,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491856/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2007,Too much Nicholson is not a good thing,The Departed starts strong a taut thriller that leaves you on the edge of the sit for about half his length Midways things start to go wrong Actually they start to go nowhere Once we have firmly established who are the good guys and who the baddies and also the fact that allegedly there is only a thin line in between the movie gets stuck in a rut called the Jack Nicholson over the top performance It is regrettable to think that this could have been a truly great movie without Jack Nicholson He is given possibly the longest screen time and during all of it he just goes along doing his usual stuff the mad grin the lecherous wink the foul language etc Nicholson by the book Nicholson and more Nicholson We are not spared even a very choreographic final scene so fake that even an amateur actor could have played it better It is a relief that Nicholson did not get nominated for this part The movie is quite compelling when he is not on screen Di Caprio is surprisingly good playing vulnerable in a credible way and also Damon playing creepy even better than in Ripley One really sides with Di Caprio the lonely unappreciated unloved hero hoping for a happy ending Unfortunately we know that in this sort of movies copious bloodshed and tragedy rule Luckily Wahlberg in a key role is around to provide some sort of satisfactory closure Wahlberg almost disappeared from the screen after several good performances which is a pity because he is gifted It would have made the movie a lot more interesting if he and Martin Sheen had more time on screen rather than the lamentable Nicholson On the whole this is a good movie but not a great one For sure the script denotes some ignorance of police procedures The whole investigative side requires massive doses of suspended disbelief It seems rather bizarre that a police inspector is given the job of checking the background of all his fellow officers only because his boss likes his face but without anybody checking his background or working with him An undercover agent has license to kill and no duty to report criminal actions while actually taking part in them An FBI informer thanks to his status is free to continue his criminal career Does it mean that if I talk to the Feds I can go around killing whomever I want Finally half hour could have easily been chopped off perhaps by eliminating most Nicholson scenes and the end is definitely muddled up with Damon absurdly shown as being constantly free of suspicion In other movies police officers get suspended for a lot less of what Damon gets away with in The Departed,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1584565/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,I want my $10 back,Perfectly horrible Weak storyline choppy and powerless This might be Scorsese s worst work Shallow doesn t begin to describe this movie Unfortunately shooting people in the head and saying the F word don t make up for storyline The acting is actually decent for the most part minus Leo Decap and the lead female but they ve got nothing to work with The suspension of disbelief is lost about and hour in By the way for once can someone besides Matt Damon Mark Walberg both from Boston do a decent Boston accent I don t know WHAT accent Leo Decap was doing Also one of least inspiring leading ladies of any movie EVER If the lead actress can t act can t she at LEAST be good looking Short Version Save your money,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493489/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2006,Is Marty making fun of us? Utter disappointment...,A waste of talent all around Users have voted this 62 of all movies in the IMDb database Are you kidding me Wake up people Scorsese isn t even trying anymore The film was amateur at best insulting at worst The unnecessary homophobia and unresolved plot chunks I hesitate to call 20 minute digressions threads were pointless detracted from the plot I m comfortable with the scare quotes and left totally unresolved Character development consistency give us something to hang to here Marty Total disappointment,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1513801/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2007,"Pretty awful...I have to say, I hated it",I m giving The Departed 3 stars pretty much for getting the film in the camera and those cameras ultimate direction by one of the greats Martin Scorsese But I m being nice doing that because this movie is really quite an awful thing to deal with Awful to watch awful to hear awful to experience Just plain awful Where do I begin First the script it s DOA I ve not seen the original movie The Departed is based on but apparently the script is tighter than a flea s a If so The Departed does indeed vary from the original in that regard not Swiss cheese style holes but not exactly seamless and tight either Second the cell phones I wanted to laugh out loud in inappropriate places when a cell phone in the movie went off for the 1 000th time Laughable and utterly without grace and if you hated cell phones before you ll really despise them after The Departed Third I didn t care about any character enough to care about what happened to them whether maimed or killed or something in between That s not good you know That s just about the worst thing you can say about a given story in general film in particular but The Departed has not caring in bucketfuls when it comes to character Take your pick try to adhere to the character s base see if you give a crap whether they re blown to smithereens or not You won t Jack Nicholson was ludicrously over the top a Caligula for the ages who has possibly lost all respect for the acting form Am I saying he s lost his acting chops No hardly I m saying that respect for the craft of acting has gone into utter and complete hiding He treated his role in The Departed as a raft of pleasure built solely for his riding a king both on screen and off and I could care less normally except that Jack s character suffers due to Jack s excesses And who wins when that happens,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1603957/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,The Consequences of Misplaced Loyalty & Trust,Film god Martin Scorsese has directed his hardest film to date And that is saying a lot My own knuckles hurt after watching this film packed to the rafters with pistol whippings face crunching fists and round house kicks to the teeth The Departed is an emotionally paralyzing face off between the State Police the mob and their respective informants rats on the cold hearted back alleys of Boston Mass What makes this film so superbly successful is the way Martin Scorsese marshals this complex story into a brisk moving completely understandable entirely real piece of cinema that strikes a chord deep inside the viewer When the final credits start to roll you will let out a deep breath of relief One that will feel like it has been held since the first frame of the film After an initial introduction to the life and crimes Frank Costello Nicholson the legendary Boston mob boss we join the proceedings as William Costigan DiCaprio and Colin Sullivan Damon are graduating from the State Police Academy Each near top of their class they are forced in very different directions when they reach the detective unit Sullivan is assigned a lofty rank as the star rookie on the force However his loyalties do not lay with the boys in blue He has been quietly raised since his early teens by none other than Frank Costello Costigan is offered a vastly different assignment His records erased his graduation deleted He is required to go undercover a plant directly into the heart of the mob itself After a cosmetic 4 month stint in jail he is released with a bad reputation and worms his way toward Costello s clan The film shifts gears and stories faster than you can blink allowing us to spy on this cat and mouse thriller The camera acts as our informant And let me tell you something Every piece of information this films leaks is fascinating There are tales of female infidelity police futility mob brutality penile immobility cell phone connectivity OK I stretched for that one The story leads to its logical and somewhat inevitable conclusion taking no prisoners along the way Every character plays an important part at some point And not every character is what they first seem to be Marty Scorsese is masterful here He may just have earned himself another Oscar nod He is going to get one someday It probably should be for this film His camera flows like no other director s ever has It is kinetic and forceful a perfect match for the characters and the story The cast is just about as good as it gets If you were still on the hedge about Leo Forget about it This is a master craftsman at work His intensity and power is every bit a match for Jack Nicholson s efforts In fact there are scenes where Jack disappears behind Leo s force Matt Damon is fast becoming a great actor This is his most complex role to date He imbues Colin Sullivan with a conniving intelligence that has the police looking in all the wrong places Alec Baldwin has long deserved Oscar recognition He should get a Best Supporting actor nod here as the Police Captain He has one tremendous moment where he raves about the Patriot Act It is a superbly satirical jab that I presume may have been his own ad lib Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg Vera Farmiga Ray Winstone round out the first team cast with the utmost class I am sure this film will be considered by the Screen Actor s Guild for Best Ensemble I cannot imagine any sane human being watching this film and not placing it in their year end Top 10 List The Departed is so raw and so heavy hitting that it doesn t stop at your eyeballs it rips right to the core of you It is the most involving film of 2006 so far It is the most supremely crafted film of 2006 so far It is the best film of 2006 so far And I doubt whether I will see a handful of films the rest of the way that will challenge it for the top spot Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics com,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1490861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2020,Wow!,The departed is definitely one of the best work of Martin Scorsese The biggest postive point that makes the movie more interesting is the the way the director had provided proper backstory for almost all characters in the movie The lead characters have their conflict and they try to solve them which in turn results again some conflicts This shows the brilliance in the screenplay The movie has a run time of about 150 minutes but still the way we are glued to our seat till the climax portions is clearly depicting that the director had succeeded in his part of giving a edge of a seat crime thriller Especially the plot twist at the end makes the movie even more effective And the performances of the lead actors are totally praise worthy Do watch The departed for it s intelligent twist and turns and gripping screenplay,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6021499/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2006,Why a meaningless and unbelievable subplot?,I must have read a dozen reviews of The Departed by professional critics No one however has pointed out the utter meaninglessness of the 20 minute subplot quickly discarded involving the selling of mysterious microprocessors to agents of the government of China It s beyond belief to ask an audience to believe that a local mobster into loan sharking drug dealing and the usual local mobster fare would delve into far murkier international intrigue I guess Scorcese must have had second thoughts too since this whole sequence was dropped like a hot potato not to be mentioned again Further and oddly too the agents of the Chinese government are seen speaking Cantonese not Mandarin Was the subplot a big mistake or was it an expensive tip of the the cap to the movie s Cantonese origins In any case it merely further bloated an already too long film,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1500329/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2006,The Departed,Great film The film is very funny and you can hear the laughter in the theater with the numerous raunchy jokes made by Nicholson Baldwin Walberg and even Dicaprio This was an all star cast and the film was beautifully acted Martin Scorse shows why he is a great director because he kept me surprised throughout the film What you expect to happen does not happen This is a film that kept me entertained throughout and I don t regret going the best gangster movie I ve seen in years Leonardo Dicaprio deserves some type of nominations for best actor for this film because the emotions he brought to this role was better than great Seeing the transformation in his character due to the circumstances that he is forced to partake in makes him a hell of an actor that is deserving of a golden globe or Oscar nomination,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1499038/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,Dazzling character study from a master filmmaker,Without a doubt this is the best film of 2006 The deceptively simple premise involves the Massachussets State Police planting an undercover operative Leonardo DiCaprio in the South Boston underworld in order to take down Irish mob kingpin Frank Costello Jack Nicholson However Costello has a mole of his own What unfolds is an absolutely stunning examination of the nature of violence loyalty avarice and betrayal The ensemble cast are uniformly excellent though Martin Sheen and a caustic Mark Wahlberg absolutely steal the show in their supporting roles as DiCaprio s world weary handlers Big Bad Jack turns in a bone chilling high octane performance that simply lights up the screen As a side note his character is based in part on the exploits of a real life South Boston mobster Whitey Bulger The razor sharp dialogue is enthralling and Martin Scorsese s direction is flawless This film is a triumph,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493048/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2006,less is more,I am an admirer of Mr Scorsese s work as a filmmaker and cultural documentarian so it was perhaps with heightened expectations destined to fall short of the mark that I went to see The Departed Scorsese is an actor s director and with a cast that includes the abundance of great players assembled for this project it was hard to imagine how this film could be anything less than exceptional In my view which is evidently a minority view it was quite a bit less and I left the theater frustrated to have endured such a spectacular waste of talent and resources signifying nothing or at least nothing we haven t previously seen from the director in Mean Streets Taxi Driver Goodfellas and Gangs of New York echoing a Jenny Holzer truism from the 70 s killing is unavoidable but nothing to be proud of Against the emerging vogue for Indie films Scorsese has been one to embrace their antithesis and he has the clout to summon the financial resources to do whatever he pleases which has resulted in recent films that aspire to be large almost as an end in itself The Gangs of New York and The Aviatior epitomized this trend exploiting successfully the wonderment that historical films can bring to the imagined past with figures larger than life Viva Visconti However this inflated sensibility falls flat on the mean streets of South Boston in this interminable playing out of double subterfuge in which characters more like caricatures play out their appointed roles with a noticeable absence of subtlety or nuance Nicholson is a parody of himself though wonderful to watch even at his most absurd Matt Damon seems unintentionally oblivious to the darkness of Colin Sullivan s soul we have no idea of what makes him tick beyond the small favors offered in the opening scene while Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen wonderful actors all play out their stereotypes with little psychological resonance Leonardo DiCaprio shows yet again that he is one of the finest dramatic actors of his generation but there is no catharsis in the inevitable outcome which takes an impossibly long time to occur The big surprise is Vera Farmiga who displays exquisite emotional range and complexity and should emerge as a formidable female lead worthy of serious dramatic roles which are sure to come to her with some help from the NY Times Magazine which extolled her talents last month legitimately it appears in a cover story The film also includes a great supporting cast of colorful thugs But you sit through all the twists and turns of this interminably complex narrative feeling that you re looking at the work of a masterful technician whose infatuation with his cinematic virtuosity has become an end in itself trumping his capacity in spite of this film s pretentious title to tell a meaningful or compelling story which is easy enough to forget once you have exited the theater I remember when I saw Taxi Driver for the first time not having a clue what it was about in advance I left the theater rattled irate and a bit unhinged wondering how anybody make a move that was such an assault on my expectations and sensibilities It was unnerving politically disturbing and ultimately a profound expression of the Nixon years certainly one of the best films of its time I was fairly unnerved also when I waked out of the Departed feeling that it was much ado about nothing a waste of fissionable talent wishing that I could have departed sooner Perhaps like Bunuel s Exterminating Angel Scorsese wanted to see how much misery he could put the viewer through while keeping him squirming in his seat,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1505173/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2018,Informants number exaggerated.,The way of Billy s infiltration to gang group was so foolish What is more annoying more than this is the leader of gang group accepted Billy after a very short testing and took him in the main operational gangsters group for no reason Secondly Lazio mostly uses abusive language and the chief of Lazio expects the officers and most probably the audience to accept it The language in his role was unnaturally showy Number of informants and the battle of different departments of enforcement agencies each other on these informants are so exaggerated The gang leader even appeared as FBI informants at the end of the movie It is the most silly part of the movie In terms of players acts and cinematography the movie is outstanding and worth to watch,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4355193/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,This movie is simply not one of Scorsese's great ones.,I went to The Departed last night on the strength of some of the reviews I d read And while it was a fairly good movie it is not great In my opinion Scorsese has taken an interesting story and a very good cast and created a somewhat better than mediocre picture The photography is very good the shots well done for the most part but he has made some odd choices The most puzzling is the Chinese microchip issue This could have and in my opinion should have been omitted It doesn t move the plot it doesn t add depth or breadth to the story and it doesn t help to develop any of the characters Some of the acting was uneven as well I love some of Matt Damon s work but I never felt an emotional connection with this character I had the sense that I was watching him act Even his accent isn t consistent changing from the Boston Southie he displayed in Good Will Hunting to Midwestern Jack Nicholson is Jack Nicholson and that s the problem with his portrayal Unconvincing There are other issues I have with this movie but on the positive side Mark Wahlberg and Alce Baldwin are both quite enjoyable to watch And by far the best performance without question is given by Leonardo DiCaprio This young man can act He has a way of becoming the character and his performance here is worth the price of admission So my suggestion is to go and see this movie but don t set your expectations at the level suggested by some of the almost hysterically glowing reviews If you do you will be disappointed,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491387/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2006,"Good, but not as good as the original",Just got back from seeing this in Taiwan where it opened yesterday in time for Mid Autumn festival Good movie but decided to re watch the original Infernal Affairs back home and the original edges over it in terms of emotion pace and character development The departed is great once it gets going and the premise really starts to kick in and jack Nicholson is incredible but I can t help feeling that the director was going for too much humour from the 9at times0 overly witty dialogue to the closing scene And some of the set pieces the elevator scene near the end for example are not handled as well as in the original the audience laughed out loud during the elevator scene and I m not sure that was the intended effect All in all a good film but I feel it just misses out on being a great one especially when compared with its Asian counterpart,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1490682/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2006,Unrelenting!,I m aware of the fact that the concept and basic storyline for Martin Scorcese s Departed actually came from a Hong Kong Chinese crime drama epic from a few years back I cannot attest to what the original was but after seeing this film I d be curious to see it This movie is arguably one of if not THE strongest film out this fall I m always a little reluctant to go crazy lauding directors like Scorcese Coppola Spielberg and so forth because they are iconic and seem to have praise larded on them by the truckloads but suffice it to say that there s a reason Mr Scorcese gets the kind of laudation he gets and this movie is one example of why Set in working class Boston this film tracks the lives of two principal characters Colin Sully Sullivan Matt Damon who s chiseled straight expressionless face and easy demeanor is perfect here a model citizen from the neighborhoods who excels his way from academy into heading his own vice unit in record time and William Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio who seems to work well off Scorcese s calls as per The Aviator from a few years before another working class Irish Bostonian whose road to the Boston PD is much rougher and is recruited to do undercover work Early on you know who s who here Sullivan is in the deep pockets of simmering sleazy mob boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson whose only flaw in this film was his wavering Boston accent and is a link to the law enforcers who are trying to tag him while Costigan steadily builds his links and confidence into Mr Costello s outfit All the while both Sully and Billy build relationships with the police psychologist Vera Farmiga whom I also enjoyed in 2002 s Dummy and meanwhile work around each other As both sides start to sense that there is a rat in their ranks the two find themselves pushing harder to simultaneously do their jobs cover their tracks and root the other out The race is on so to speak With quality support from Mark Wahlberg as an incorruptible and temperamental bureau sub chief Martin Sheen as Wahlberg s boss a patient precinct veteran Anthony Anderson as the honest cop who works for Damon s corrupt chief Ray Winstone as Nicholson s brutal top henchman and Alec Baldwin as the charismatic paper pusher whose investigative unit backs Damon s squad this movie is a strong shock to the system with violence often and yet used as a sort of gut check to the viewer In a war between cops and gangland criminals the results are unrelenting and brutal and seldom romantic The pacing of this film takes on more of a thriller mode towards the end and there are a few twists thrown in to make the ending not as neat as some might suspect it s heading towards The screenplay by William Monahan and Siu Fui Mak adapting from the original is a seamless fit to Scocese s vision I don t like throwing phrases like must see or instant classic so instead I ll say this about it if you re serious about your movies catch this film any way you can,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1510396/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,Over rated,What a waste of time One small twist which isn t even worth it in the end otherwise a typical cop and mole story Doesn t deserve the level of appreciation it gets so many better movies at a lower rating Although the acting wasn t terrible I cannot fathom how anyone gave this an Oscar The story was fast moving but concluded in about five minutes in the end and not even in a satisfactory way Maybe it was interesting or novel back in the day If someone is making you watch this cause it s the best move ever think again Go through your wish list again and rethink how you wanna spend your time,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8732164/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2006,A heartfelt modern masterpiece,Throughout the ages a single question has been troubling film viewers worldwide How is it possible that such a visionary and immensely talented director as Martin Scorsese has yet to win an Oscar This question is provoked anew with new heat and fervor with the release of Scorsese s new love child The Departed Will The Departed finally be the film for the bushy eyebrowed maestro to take home his much deserved golden statuette It s hard to determine since the Academy has shown itself to be considerably impartial to his past masterpieces such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull But does Scorsese deserve to take home an Oscar along with the inevitable critical acclaim this time round The answer of course is nothing less than a resounding yes In his latest heartfelt masterpiece Scorsese lights up with storytelling flair and passion unseen for decades unleashing one of his most powerful and affecting films yet After a period of trying new things and exploring new vicinities Scorsese seems to have returned to what he knows best the streets this time incarnated in a contemporary Boston mob setting which makes for a slightly amusing update from Scorsese s usual mobster flicks with the addition of frequent cell phones and text messaging in the mix The trademark musing Catholic overtones and brutal violence are both on display as usual here in fact as well as his strongest this may well be Scorsese s bloodiest picture for years But rather than sinking to the lengths of most typical gorefests the violence serves only to amplify the edgy and intense mood of the film driving home its emotional points in a way which has seemed lost to Hollywood of late Expect to cringe frequently not just because of the pain inflicted but due to the emotional resonance which ensues The storyline may seem a bit convoluted at times detailing the lives of a policeman who infiltrates his way into the mob in order to act as a mole for the police force and a fellow officer who is bought out by the mob acting as a mole for them However the simply astonishing screenplay by William Monahan handles the tricky material with ease as well as working in humour emotional resonance and a slew of quotable lines the likes of which have not been seen for years Backing up this incredible script is a terrific score from the always reliable Howard Shore as well as Scorsese s usual excellent taste in classic rock numbers including the film s reoccurring theme a strangely catchy mix of Irish shanty style music with heavy metal While known for extracting extraordinary performances from his actors once again Scorsese has truly outdone his reputation here as the star studded ensemble cast delivers a combined effort which will truly knock any viewer flat with simply superb performances from Matt Damon a surprisingly feisty and memorable Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Ray Winstone Alec Baldwin and newcomer Vera Farminga Special acclaim should be given to the iconic Jack Nicholson giving his most engaging and charismatic performance in years as a ruthless mob head and surprise standout Leonardo DiCaprio blowing away any past work with a stunningly affecting and emotional performance Though awards could easily and justifiably be awarded to any cast member DiCaprio manages to stand out not from his star status but from his simmering performance in a cast of outstanding performers an impressive feat indeed All in all for those not deterred by brutal violence and frequent profanity The Departed should be considered something of a must see Don t skip out for fear of passing by one of the most remarkable screenplays in years a stunning cast of flooring performances and a veteran filmmaker re igniting his past fervor with a simply marvelous film The Departed is down dirty brutal intense heartfelt and hits home with an unforeseeable emotional impact don t miss it 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1521838/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2021,Disappointing remake of Hong Kong Internal Affairs,The original movie was just so much better than this The departed is messy and confusing where it loses the neatness and clarity of the original The execution is loose and somewhat overacted which is a waste of great casts as it looses the tension and delicate emotions the Hong Kong version had A lot of Scorsese movies are highly overrated this is no exception it never reached the same height as the original version internal affairs and I encourage you all to see the original instead of this disappointing remake,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7315965/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,The Best So Far For 2006,My first thoughts walking out of the theater were wow that was great but it wasn t as good as Goodfellas Few living directors have such built in levels of expectations as Martin Scorsese his past will always be difficult to live down but he mostly does an amazing job with his all star cast in The Departed Given access to Hollywood s greatest talent allows him to create a vividly interesting and intensely watchable crime film Everyone will have their favorites but for my money Alec Baldwin in the most consistently entertaining even with limited screen time The film is long but doesn t seem long If you are weighing the film from an investment standpoint I doubt that there are many places that you can go for two and a half hours and be this enthralled for only about eight bucks Back to The Goodfellas comparison One of the reasons that that film had such a visceral appeal was that Ray Liotta was pretty much an unknown at the time We got to know Liotta as Henry Hill we didn t have many previous roles to work through in our establishing empathy Sure he played in Field Of Dreams but it was a brief appearance In The Departed we never feel the same level of cathartic involvement because the actors are still just actors In the end this is but a minor quibble as the action is so riveting the performances so well presented and the story so engaging that it doesn t matter much that we don t have that same level of emotional involvement Oscar time for Marty Who knows Most thought that the breakthrough would come with The Aviator A great historical visual masterpiece but it was not the case If the opening weekend means anything this will be probably be the director s most successful box office creation Maybe that has been the real barrier to Scorsese getting over the top While the violence is certainly ever present it seems to be less violent of a film than Taxi Driver or Goodfellas because of the way the violence is presented on the screen It just sort of happens and it s happening just fits into the way that the plot unfolds,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493683/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2007,An utterly depraved production.,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1783885/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2006,Good Faahking Movie!,Phewy we got a movie here You have a star studded cast big named director more swears than Goodfellas kidding some great violence what a good flick This movie is about the involvement of rats in Boston police and Boston Irish mafia Like I said before almost everyone in the movie is a big name so they are all willing to display their best acting Unbelievably everyone brings it Fantastic acting Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg were my favorites in this one The story itself is great also Taking the story from a Chinese movie called Infernal Affairs but mixing in Boston Irish Mob history The movie is pretty long but what do you expect from Scorcese Gangs of New York went on forever thank God for Daniel Day Lewis But I only say this due to the fact my knees hurt and I need to stretch them every so often Forgetting that the movie moves at a pretty fast clip It s flat out one of the best crime movies ever made and definitely one of the best movies this year I would say this and Flags of Our Father are the top two If you like smart gritty well acted flicks you ll most likely love this baby,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1504101/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2019,The Departed Review,I don t want to be a product of my environment I want the environment to be a product of me Frank Costello A remake of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs The Departed is once again yet another crime masterpiece that deals with identity and deception and it s all done in such style that only Scorsese can pull off Set in contemporary Boston it follows Irish Mob boss Frank Costello who plants a mole within the Massachusetts State Police while at the same time the police sends an undercover cop to infiltrate Frank s organization Eventually both sides realizes what s going on and both moles race to identify each other before their covers are blown In an age when remakes are often inferior to the original there comes a remake where it takes the original concept and gives it its own unique style and this is no exception From its moving cameras to its cinematography Scorsese incorporates his own style into this film and gives it a gritty and tense feel to it The editing for the most part moves at a steady and flowing pace even if some moments where the editing moves frantically The two major themes the movie deals with are identity and deception Both moles are simultaneously trying to discover who each other are but at the same time trying to blend into an environment they aren t originally from without revealing their true motives It s also noted that both men despite being different from each other constantly competing in a similar manner is so clear and strong that it makes for some really intense moments These intense and emotional moments wouldn t be possible without its star studded cast and each one delivers Leonardo DiCaprio puts on a captivating performance as Billy Costigan Matt Damon is great as Colin Sullivan and of course Jack Nicholson who might be the best performance in the movie is outstanding as Frank Costello Overall The Departed is an excellent thriller Emotionally gripping thematic and elegantly cinematic it s one of Scorsese s best films and it s one of the best pieces of cinematic art Final Verdict 9 10 with an Epic Seal of Awesomeness,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4748498/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,Nobody But Me!,Martin Scorsese is more sentimental about the mob than Margaret Mitchell ever was about the Ku Klux Klan On the other hand where else can you see Leonardo DiCaprio looking sexy and beating up on a helpless storekeeper while dancing to the sounds of Nobody But Me by the Human Beinz Eat your heart out Malcolm McDowell,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4672177/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,"Scorsese goes back, once again to gangsterland.",The Departed tells the story of two men working for the Boston state police one is mole working inside the mob and the other is a mole working for the Irish mob boss Leonard DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan the cadet police officer sent undercover to infiltrate the Irish mob which is headed by Frank Costello played by the wickedly wonderful and outrageous Jack Nicholson Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan the mole inside the police force that tips off Costello on the police s activity while trying to put him away Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg also star as police officers that are heading the investigation into putting Costello and his whole crew behind bars or in a casket Costigan works his way into the mob and Sullivan works his way up into the internal affairs unit of the state police who is actually sent in to investigate who s been tipping off the mob You can see a bunch of Scorsese s touches throughout the film from his music selections great use of Dropkick Murphys but The Rolling Stones song is getting a bit old now to long tracking shots and plenty of disturbing outbursts of violence which hit you like a sledgehammer to face in the film s final moments Where The Departed really shines are the performances DiCaprio is great and this is probably his best performance to date Damon comes through but he won t exactly blow you away he usually delivers good work and he doesn t disappoint here Nicholson is a scene stealing weasel that will probably be compared to and loved much like Pesci s wild and crazy work in Goodfellas and Casino Nicholson is perfectly cast and has a lot of fun playing a character so wildly evil and nefarious you just love to hate the son of a bitch And what s up with Alec Baldwin Seriously when was the last time he was in a film this good and seemed to be having so much fun And Martin Sheen was also good but he really wasn t given enough to do in my opinion Whether or not Martin Scorsese will actually admit that his latest film The Departed is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs remains to be seen I probably would have gotten a little bit more enjoyment out of The Departed had it actually been an original Scorsese film like Goodfellas or Casino but this film pretty much follows the same exact plot as Infernal Affairs beat for beat up until the film s last minute twist ending which no that I think about it actually does kind of make sense Should you see The Departed in theaters Yes absolutely Especially when you look at all the other amazingly craptastic movies playing in theaters right now you should definitely go out and see it hell see it just for the great performances they alone are worth the price of admission Actually the more and more I think about it the more I love this movie I ll definitely need to see it again and if necessary again and again I actually could see myself rating this one as a ten after multiple viewings,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491022/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2021,I enjoyed this,Okay so after a long time of putting it off I finally got around to watching this film This movie is great but I actually can t tell the difference between Matt Damon Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo DiCaprio About a third of the way in I realised that they re actually not the same person so it made everything that happened up until that point very confusing I didn t want to go back and watch the first hour again Lighting is good,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6814102/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2016,Scorsese does it again,The Departed is an American crime thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese Taxi Driver Good Fellas The film gives us a poignant look at a fictional war on drugs fought by the Boston Police Department against an Irish rooted mob led by Frank Costello Jack Nicholson with his prot g Colin Sullivan Matt Damon helping him from the inside of the police force while Billy Costigan Leonardo Di Caprio helps the police department by infiltrating Costello s mob The story takes place in Boston following the lives of Billy Costigan an undercover cop of the Boston Police Department who is at a crossroads in his life having just lost all close relatives and with no clear direction in his life as he infiltrates Costello s mob and Colin Sullivan who from a very young age has been the prot g of Costello and who now works for the Boston Police Department providing Frank with information As the story unfolds we see the consequences the characters have to deal with by leading a double life We watch them as they blur the lines of what s right or wrong and we get to see just how far they are willing to go to protect what they ve built and to get what they want In typical Scorsese fashion the director dwells into the moral aspect of their characters exploring the kind side of the villain and the dark side of the heroes The cast is on point through out all the movie with the performances by Leonardo Di Caprio Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg being particularly fascinating One of the strongest points of the film it s is pace with the story developing in a fast pace leaving no dead time on screen for the viewer to lose attention One major critic of the film is that it doesn t follow the original Infernal Affairs too closely While this may be true to some extent it could very well be attributed to the fact that the original is a three part saga it s a given that some of the story it s bound to be lost in the process of condensing three movies into one While it released more than twenty years into the career of director Scorsese The Departed is a solid film with a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat that s going to keep you guessing as of what s going to happen next If you re in the mood for a film with a fast paced thrilling story fleshed out characters and superb acting then The Departed is a must see,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3393522/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2007,Excellent,Billy Costigan DiCaprio is a mole inside Costello s Nicholson crime gang Colin Sullivan Damon is a mole inside the Boston Police Dept When the cops and Costello find out each has a mole among them things get more than interesting It is more than nice to have an all star cast performing an excellent story This doesn t happen often and doesn t disappoint Plus the fact that it moved along at such a lively pace the 2 hours didn t seem like 2 hours One can easily see how this was nominated for Best Picture which it won and also how Martin Scorsese was nominated for Best Director which he won And one can also see how some of the stars could have been nominated for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor DiCaprio Damon or Nicholson but none were But there is one area that surely needs to be recognized and that is the film editing and by God it won for that too This was a cat mouse chess game and the shots went back and forth at a rapid pace at times and yet and you didn t lose the thread Great editing job This is a movie you have to stay with If you give yourself an intermission while the DVD is still running you may lose something you probably need to know later on So pay attention When we saw the Academy Awards we saw Jack Nicholson looking like Mr Clean Lex Luthor Kojack or Daddy Warbucks take your pick and we feel the reason for this is because Jack saw himself in this movie and realized he had a really bad hair day all the way through Also did anyone but me notice some facial similarities between DiCaprio and Nicholson Hmmmm Everything was excellent the cinematography the dialogue the editing the acting and yes the music was at times very good too Violence Yes Sex Yes Nudity Partial Language Yes,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1608749/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2006,"Brilliant, brilliant performances",OK now I ve never been a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan but I have always believed that he is a brilliant actor What s Eating Gilbert Grape Gangs of New York Catch Me If You Can The Aviator and now The Departed All fantastic performances This might be a bit premature for me to say but after four Golden Globe nominations with one win plus two Oscar nominations come on Academy people hand over an Oscar to this guy he deserves it Martin Scorcese s is a whole other request I ve given up on that one He really held his own against an acting powerhouse like Jack Nicholson who was of course great as well In fact there were times when he actually stole the scene from him If ever there was a character you sympathised with from the very beginning it was this guy And DiCaprio s performance really helped build that feeling Matt Damon has been steadily pacing himself as an actor of immense worth as well His career speaks for itself Solid performances every time It was nice to see him play a character like this though I agree with people here who say he should do this type of role more often He was believable it worked Martin Sheen was well Martin Sheen Great screen presence Alec Baldwin was hilarious I love the way he just disappears into his characters He just blends in with the atmosphere created by the scene Swift sharp dialogue execution I love it But Mark Wahlberg stole the show for me He didn t have as much screen time as the others but man oh man he just killed it Brilliant performance There are times when you wonder whether he s going to be in the next scene just so you can see him again He stood out in every scene he was in in the beginning with Sheen and DiCaprio and then later with Nicholson Baldwin and Damon I think he s always had this in him but he really needed a quality film like this Scorcese being the director has gotta help to show what he can really do I was blown away by his performance In fact there wasn t a hair out of line in all the performances We ve all been hearing it for weeks and I ll just say it again this is a superbly cast movie Now with the acting out of the way let s get to the rest of the movie It was thrilling it was suspenseful and it took me a few minutes to get used to the ending but the longer I thought about it the more I liked it I haven t seen Internal Affairs so I have no idea how similar this is to that But I don t like making too many comparisons anyway This movie stands out quite prominently on its own A bit of a slow start but things really heat up after the first hour Highly recommended 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1520894/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2007,Remake of his own work,I really didn t like this at all It s another Scorsese remake of his own recent work namely Gangs of New York Similar phenomena we had with Casino and Goodfellas Usually Scorsese s worst is still OK but The Departed was so predictable I was seriously bored Anyways in addition to the default point one point for decent photography and one for Nicholson who is always splendid even at his worst Matt Damon was again as good as he was in Team America and Leonardo tried hard to get rid of his boyish appeal again I recently heard he had threatened to quit acting after Titanic I wish he would have,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1591237/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2020,It Doesn't Get Better Than The Departed,Alan Mak and William Moynihan s screenplay won an Oscar Something more happens here above the writing DICAPRIO is stupendous He is better than DeNiro Then Damon is in top form The cast has chemistry with the director Scorsese When everything gels the result is more than its separate parts The shootings come off like a ballet Dahlberg is the cherry on the cake,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6156960/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,not so great,The Departed is an occasionally engaging film beautifully acted and photographed It has powerful narrative energy as it breathlessly races the viewer through a complex plot However the praise for this film has been far overblown The Departed is not as inventive as Taxi Driver and not startling and sublime like Raging Bull In fact Scorcese s new film is overly long and somewhat tedious The contrived plot seems banal and neither Di Caprio nor the bland Damon make their roles particularly interesting Sadly despite his technical virtuosity it becomes apparent here that Scorcese has little more to say about his themes of urban alienation and the brutality of modern life The film is grotesquely violent at times and the viewer begins to wonder as yet another bloody shooting goes down Unfortunately the shallowness of this film and its predictable brain spraying violence disappoint the Scorcese fan,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494514/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2007,over-hyped,I confess from the start that I did not want to see The Departed Gangster movies with their gratuitous violence profanity laced dialogue and sordid characters have little appeal for me I find them almost always tedious and unsettling the exception being movies like the Godfather series which were able to transcend the genre However I told my son I would see the movie if it won the Oscar for best picture which to my regret it did A promise is a promise so I sat through the entire movie even though I wanted to leave many times Setting aside my ingrained distaste for movies of this sort and trying to look at the film objectively I would argue that it fails on many critical levels The acting performances range from adequate to indifferent Jack Nicholson plays his usual Jack Nicholson role which is good or bad depending on whether or not you like Jack Nicholson Matt Damon s character is bland and motiveless Mark Walhberg s character is just bizarre Leonard DiCaprio s performance is probably the best but that s not saying much The script never calls for any real character development so the actors basically have one mood and that s it for the rest of the show All we have throughout the movie is people swearing at each other menacing other people or being menaced The whole set up and execution of the plot the obligatory love affair the violence and the twist at the end is so just so improbable as to be ludicrous At the other end of the spectrum in the Academy Awards Best Picture nominees was Little Miss Sunshine and though this movie had its flaws it had at least an original idea which of course never appeals to Academy voters It was intelligent and infinitely more entertaining than The Departed which does not even rise to the top when compared to great gangster movies like The Goodfellas Get Shorty Snatch Scarface etc If you like gangster movies you will probably enjoy The Departed even though I doubt you will find the hype justified If you don t like gangster shows there is certainly nothing here to make you change your mind,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1608297/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2009,watch original ;),It s a good remake of a better film to my eyes Scorsese shot the same movies with exact scenes adding lot of others which don t serve his movies Infernal affairs from Wai keung Lau Alan Mak is better shorter to me Lots of scenes and details looks to me really strange now i ve seen the original movie and i just understand that Scorsese just shot a copy this way these strange details and strange scenes have a sense to me now cause they are part of the original and still don t have no sense in Scorsese version This movie looks good but now i have seen the brilliant original it has no taste anymore http www imdb com title tt0338564,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2095456/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Disappointed,Jack Nicholson is a wonderful actor and is wasted in this over violent and bloody movie It was too long and sometimes boring The cast is uniformly good but the plot was mundane Why do I have to write ten lines to tell you that I briefly fell asleep a couple of times I came out of the theater thinking I will avoid Scorsese movies from now on What more can one say than an excellent cast cannot make a dull movie exciting and interesting It was a waste of 24 00 for the two of us I am tired of seeing blood spattered all over floors walls and people This gore is no substitute for a skillfully written and filmed scenario Surely Scorsese can do better,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492007/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2006,Another disappointment from a past master.,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1526528/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,"Great cinematography, good story and performances",The best thing about Scorsese are the scenes the frames the lighting The parallelism of the protagonists is excellent The performances of Di Caprio and Jack Nicholson were brilliant The story has a couple of conveniences at the end but that doesn t make it any less interesting Obviously recommended if you like Gansgters stories,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7404101/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2006,Not as good as people say,I must say I went into the cinema with high expectations always a bad idea and this film did not live up to them It was ploddingly slow at times Scorceze is one of those directors whom people loathe to criticise but I think he is also one of those directors who is beginning to believe his own hype This movie takes time to overemphasise things which add nothing to the plot such as the religious attachment of Matt Damon s corrupt character Too much of the movie is reliant upon the charisma of the core actors especially Nicholson It almost feels lazy in it s direction There are some very good performances Leonardo Di Caprio is excellent Jack Nicholson is charismatic Matt Damon is OK Other than being glaringly slow there were not many problems with the movie Some careful scene culling and it would probably have engaged me a lot more Do not believe the hype nor all the this is the best ever comments from people here Don t get me wrong It is good But it s nothing special I prefer the Chinese original over this remake even though I have to read the subtitles The Departed lacks the flair of Gangs of New York and lacks the cohesion of the original Internal Affairs,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1498598/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,So so so genius....,I so like it this is scorcece the movie is perfect the actors the text and sure the directing But there is a some thing is I think a problem which is the movie is not easy to understand at all Woooooooooo,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5849230/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2017,OMG it's awful!,This might be the worst movie I ever saw The acting is bad from all parties likely the director s fault but Jack Nicholson s performance stands out as THE WORST I guess he thought he was still filming The Shining because his voice and all his mannerisms are identical to those he used for Jack Torrance in the Overlook Hotel Matt Damon was OK but even he couldn t save it If I could give this film a rating of negative 20 stars I would,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3793681/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2007,Martin looking back to himself,Scorcese went back to his past as a filmmaker In his latest projects he had been exploring the possibilities of moving his camera around in my view fundamentally in two directions exploring space architecture the surroundings provoking sensations in this case attached to a character or several and transmitting those sensations to us audience In this case i m naturally speaking of Gangs of New York and The Aviator The first one was more bold in this concerns the second was more thought up maybe more refined and multi layered it introduced colors the evolution of time and revived the character centered camera moments I valued those projects because Scorcese took some risks and tried to make an evolution as a director He didn t arrive at safe land or real conclusions But that is the meaning of experimenting trying solutions With this one he put some of those experiments aside That apparently i mean In this picture Scorecese turns back to his character exploitation It s all about characters The actions moves along based on the character s mental state fears I talk of course about Damon and DiCaprio Nicholson is no long the fear provoker of The shining nor the sharp detective of Chinatown and specially Two Jakes He brought here some of the comedic kind of performance he developed in his last years lesser projects this is a side note So the over layering of main characters allows Scorcese to make more complex his previously quite simple and many times uninteresting game of Goodfellas or Casino It s a refreshing of his formula based i believe on trying to extend to the way he ordinarily developed his characters the experimental attitude of his latest projects I suppose this was to be a side project on his newest tendencies but i hope the high success this one had doesn t make Martin give up the experiments he had been conducting Anyway to this point The Departed follows the kind construction Scorcese masters the best the character driven one For every technical aspect this is obviously nearly flawless and i wanted to watch this without having watched the one which this remakes I didn t want to base my comment on that other film My evaluation 4 5 nevertheless i hope Scorcese continues his last 5 years tendency he may get somewhere new to his standards http www 7eyes wordpress com,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1689352/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2006,Extremely entertaining- nothing more,One of the America s sharpest action films of the year Yes A masterpiece No A return to form for one of America s most celebrated directors Yes An evolution of style and substance No Martin Scorsese certainly gives the finger to critics citing his recent geriatric tendencies with his most visceral work in at least a decade but in turn somehow manages to imitate not emulate some of his finer styling s at peak form during the Goodfellas era While stepping away from his traditional mobster and New York flavorings to tell this story about Boston police corruption some of the more violent scenes and even some of the environment panning clearly parallels if not directly imitates classic moments from that prototypical masterpiece What s worse is Scorsese s inability to change his musical palette when scoring these types of films as half of the soundtrack also feels like a retread of the scenes he was trying to direct years before Despite all of the noticeable unoriginality The Departed still evolves into one of the most engaging guessing games in recent action memory tightening the rungs around the paranoid plot line until we are all feeling the pressure While some of the acting might not be academy worthy even the likes of Stiff Damon rose to the occasion to contribute to this classy thriller Dicaprio provides a much needed boost to his sagging relevance as one of our finest young leads with his tense performance while Nicholson once again shows that he has been done trying for some time now and just gives the camera whatever it is he feels like giving it which sadly is still way more engaging then most actors despite his characters becoming way to silly Ignoring desperate idealistic preconceptions and bitter Scorsese fanboys who vow to get a genius his directing Oscar The Departed is a very enjoyable engaging and fluid action thriller that will leave anyone with the slightest bit of testosterone feeling very satisfied,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1500830/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2006,Excellence in contrast and delivery,As ever Scorese has brought together an array of outstanding actors Jack Nicholson s performance is as usual competent and a well thought out character study But the gem of the film is Di Caprio he is awesome it is as though he is growing in stature and becoming a much more grounded actor with immense passion He really does enlighten the scenes as his character continues to struggle with the conflicts and demons that he faces He is in the same form as he was in The Aviator in which he deserved an Oscar nomination maybe a little early to tip him for an Oscar but certainly worth another Oscar nod for Best Actor Scorese is such a clever director this is probably the only mixed form film he has made The film ventures to the two extremes of comedy and drama within this film Scorese carefully delivers the most appropriate balance of comedy to lift the gloomy content within this film for example the very last shot on the window as the film ends He continually shows his early influences in many scenes particularly the scene when Di Caprio is following Damon after the cinema visit enough said don t want to spoil the story this reminded me of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets Another great partnership is the combination Scorsese with Schoonmaker s editing She has won several Oscars when working with Scorese and this is certainly her best work The editing is snappy and executed superbly creating immense tension especially towards the climax of the film Thelma Schoonmaker is an outstanding editor and deserves another Oscar well done The complex clever and intertwining narrative enables the script to follow an excellent structure which never detracts itself away from the core action Overall an excellent film well done Scorese,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491057/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2007,Never Trust Anyone,I had been dying to see the Departed ever since I had first seen the trailer After seeing what I high rating it got on here I wanted to see it even more And when I finally saw it well let s just say I wasn t disappointed Leonardo Dicaprio gave an absolute brilliant performance and though I wasn t a big fan I now have a new found respect for his acting skills The entire movie keeps you waiting and wondering nervously biting your fingernails It s very nerve racking wondering which one is going to be caught A single slip is the end Any character could betray another one at any moment You have no clue who works for who until the very end And let s just say it doesn t end pretty 10 10 a must see,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1637128/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2010,"""The Remake"" is what is it. A great movie, however",Other then the addition of an extra character to the movies script that played by Mark Walberg this movie is in essence the very same plot and story as the movie it was taken from Infernal Affairs That movie too won best picture of the year in it s respected country of China and starred local Chinese stars as well Now don t let me sway you from this great movie If you don t like foreign movies then you ll never watch the original and this is all you need to watch for a great thriller But if you don t mind subtitles the better of the two comes from China Check it out at http www imdb com title tt0338564 A story between a mole in the police department and an undercover cop Their objectives are the same to find out who is the mole and who is the cop,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2346415/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2006,Absolutely brilliant!,The Departed based on the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs is a great return for Scorcese Everything about this is just outstanding The acting was good from all DiCaprio giving a career best in my opinion Matt Damon gave a surprisingly good performance Mark Whalberg although having a minor role was very good and some great comic relief Jack Nicholson was superb he truly was the best actor giving a startling performance as the vicious mafia boss Martin Sheen was also superb The Departed is well written with the twists smart and the action intense Martin Scorcese directs with a passion he really knows what he s doing with this and makes this as good as can be This really is his movie It has the brutal violence which is prominent in his films the smart humour the language the dialogue and the brilliant ending This is my second favourite film of the year and is a must see from Scorcese fans This is a sure to get a few nominations and hopefully a Best Picture for Scorcese 5 5,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1519064/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2006,One of Scorsese's bests,The Departed is about two men from the opposite sides of the law that are undercover within the Boston State Police department and the Irish mafia but violence and bloodshed boil when discoveries are made and the moles are dispatched to find out their enemy s identities This is an excellent film by one of my favorite directors Martin Scorsese The all star cast represented by Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are all brilliant and they act out their performances with much realism The screenplay is written out very well by William Monahan and the direction by Scorsese is sensational with his trademark camera work The soundtrack was also very well done Overall this is the best film of the year so far and even though it s no Goodfellas it is truly one of his greatest films I highly recommend it Hedeen s Outlook 10 10 A,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1501255/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2007,Absolutely disgusting,Cops and criminals What s the difference I m not sure Martin Scorcese knows the difference I can t believe this trash won anything It is racist anti gay disgustingly violent and ridiculously vulgar But the worst offense It wasn t even a good movie I hated just about every single character Apparently if your movie has enough blood and gore plenty of bigotry and has a few hundred different uses of the word fuck and still manages to avoid an NC17 you too can win best director and screenplay Since Scorcese and Monahan can t tell the difference between cops and criminals when they need one I hope they get the other And since they think firefighters are just a bunch of homos I hope they re victims of the next terror attack That dear reader is justice,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1622301/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2007,"Great movie, great adaptation but hardly original",All in all this was a very well executed movie and well adapted from the original 2002 HK movie Infernal Affairs but it s still not an original movie With such a brilliant director working on an originally excellent HK movie to bring it to silver screens in America it is hard to see how it would not be a movie that would capture audiences That said it is much better done that other US adaptations clones of Asian movies such as The Lake House Korea s Il Mare in 2000 The Ring The Grudge Dark Water etc I still hope that there will be an adaptation of Infernal Affairs II and III done,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1596792/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2010,senility contest between Nicholson and Scorcese,What a boring piece of This is the movie Scorcese shouldn t have made He is just ranting around doing what he has already done thousands of times before but this time without and style or talent You might like this one if you re not familiar with his previous work or if you hadn t watched Infernal Affairs before but if you did i m afraid you cannot find anything to save this unnecessary remake The worst thing is that Scorcese completely misses the point of the original movie It even looks like he didn t understand it Important parts are strangely removed while unnecessary long boring and ridiculous scenes are added And the scenes you can find in the original are just soullessly duplicated here None of the actors are on par with their HK counterparts but it may not be only their fault Where IA displays subtle characters The Departed has only gross caricatures to offer I think the only good thing in this movie is that people unaccustomed to HK cinema may want to know what the original looks like and thus discover great actors especially Leung Chiuwai and Wong Chausang and a brisk neat and efficient movie One last thing Nicholson is definitely a buffoon,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2188073/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2016,"One of Scorsese's worst films, but still good",The Departed a crime thriller about a mole in the police and undercover cop trying to identify each other while the police try to infiltrate a gang in Boston finally won Martin Scorsese the Oscar A brilliant filmmaker like Martin Scorsese doesn t need an Oscar to prove his genius but at least he finally got the credit from the Academy he deserves It wasn t for the right film but TD is a noble thoroughly competent effort that is probably the weakest of the Scorsese films I ve seen but certainly not bad As a thriller TD works well Although the film feels somewhat restless at times and can t seem to keep still it is undeniably entertaining The set pieces are tense the visuals are as excellent as you d expect from Scorsese the plot is tense and twisty and it remains exciting much of the time The film also benefits from a good soundtrack Although they play the weaker version of Pink Floyd s Comfortably Numb and a terrific lead performance from Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Wahlberg is a scene stealer as a foul mouthed police sergeant while Martin Sheen also does a good job Unfortunately the criminally overrated Matt Damon is as boring as ever and Jack Nicholson overacts This leads into the main problem with the movie on a dramatic level it isn t particularly compelling It doesn t meditate on morals or any deeper themes except for a brief line spoken by Jack Nicholson during the opening and ultimately the movie is quite superficial Various things don t make a lot of sense and it s also too long Despite the excessive length as previously mentioned the film does feel rather hyperkinetic and restless meaning much of it is told through montage Still as a thriller and a showcase of strong filmmaking TD delivers 7 10,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3443610/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2019,Such an accomplishment for even a man like Scorsese,After watching this film I can t ignore how this film compares with the rest of Scorsese s films In my opinion from what I ve seen this is Scorsese s best effort The only films of his I ve seen are this one Goodfellas Taxi Driver and The Wolf of Wall Street and in my opinion this one tops all of those Amazing acting by one of the greatest casts of all time and all of the supporting characters such as Martin Sheen who plays an amazing role Many beautiful shots and great camera work by the god Scorsese Great script with almost no flaws at all One of the most perfect scripts I ve ever witnessed Many meanings and ideologies throughout this film using only camera movement and actors body language This movie is a mental rollercoaster that will make you feel many things all at once Amazing film 100 recommended to anyone who loves gore and crime films,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4930978/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2007,Hype hinders what could be a good film,Martin Scorcese is the front runner to win a Best Director Oscar for The Departed It s not that it s difficult to see why but you feel this film is getting undue credit based on the hype surrounding it Firstly do not pay attention to the films place in the top 250 list It is most definitely undeserved What lies beneath the hype of the film is a good story well told but still lacking This isn t a crime film or an action film it doesn t know what it is and ends up moving around needlessly The story is a good one and with a slightly better script this could have been one of the films of the year,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1605724/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2006,Like comparing a brick with a samurai sword,Would I have rated this film higher if I had not seen the HK original Infernal Affairs Probably but when you have it s like comparing a brick with a samurai sword Set in the gritty underbelly of Boston The Departed is a story of two men working undercover on opposites sides of the law DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan a graduate State Trooper handpicked by Cpt Queenan Martin Sheen to infiltrate crime boss Frank Costello s the manic Jack Nicholson milk bar raidin computer chip and drug dealin organisation of what appears to be about 5 or 6 thugs The sixth or maybe seventh guy in the gang is Colin Sullivan Matt Damon whom Costello has groomed in his own image since childhood stricly in a criminal sense two Jack Nicholsons running your neighbourhood would be too scary Unless the other Jack was only 1 8th the size MiniJack in which case it would be quite sad funny Together they would turn away from their life of crime to star in their own music video about building castles in the sky well in either case there goes the neighbourhood to be his mole on the force The ingredients are there for a tense and thrilling cops n robbers drama Instead The Departed ends up as a blunt violent film with comedy where s it s not intended Its main problem is an utter lack of finesse Mak Siu Fai s screenplay led you to see for yourself the increasing sense of frustration isolation and fear of the good cop played superbly by the excellent Tony Leung much like Nicholas Cage s tormented good guy trapped in a bad guy s body in Face Off Scorsese meanwhile needed DiCaprio to literally yell and whinge about how frustrated isolated and fearful he felt because if he didn t I would ve missed it I mean what loneliness What isolation If ever he felt the onset of undercover angst he had the comfort of jumping in the sack with Damon s girlfreud or going to Cpt Queenan s house for supper and a chat try working in a cubicle 8 hours a day Sure the prospect being found out as a spy is pretty rough but if your boss is Jack Nicholson he s just as likely to grind you into mincemeat for spilling coffee on his tie Subtlety is a dying art Case in point is a scene where the bad cop shows off his policing chops by conning a crook into giving up his associates When confronted with the impasse in IA Andy Lau walks into the the room without missing a beat Calmly coolly smoothly he feeds the guy a line or two and then hook and sinker as well In TD when confronted with the same uncooperative thug Damon looks a little confounded but lo and behold He spies with his little eye a mysterious briefcase belonging to no one that just so happens to be lying around He then furrows his brow to indicate thinking Finally he says to his chums I know I ll take that mysterious briefcase belonging to no one but that just happens to be lying around go in there and pretend I m the guy s lawyer and trick him in to giving us the information we need The other big problem is some of the casting which means some of the acting Leo rings in an emotional but always believable performance and I think a little gold man is probably well due him at some stage Nicholson is Nicholson The choice of Martin Sheen as Cpt Queenan however is a little odd This character played with heroism and wit by Anthony Wong in IA should be to Nicholson s Costello what Professor X is to Magneto Instead Sheen appears blatantly impotent in contrast with his arch nemesis The inclusion of Marky Mark as the tough talking nutjob Sgt Dignam was as much a mystery as the briefcase in the interrogation room though as comic relief you can t help but laugh at his foul mouthed antics in spite of yourself Then there is Alec Baldwin Unfortunately I ve not been able to take him seriously since Team America unfortunate because that wasn t his fault Fortunately I can now not take him seriously on his own merit According to Mr Baldwin s Book of Acting senior police officers always except when playing golf default to an arms akimbo chest or gut stuck out position the more senior you are the lower the body part to be stuck out and crack one liners To make matters worse he lent a copy of his book to Marky Mark who compounded the error by reading it There is a scene in which they are standing together in a room BOTH with arms akimbo cracking one liners and giving the brief to the junior officers Maybe it s just me but one guy with his hands on his hips is fine he commands respect either because he is the boss or Hercules But more than one just looks ridiculous I suppose that s why The Three Amigos were so funny There are other moments of unintentional comedy you should discover for yourself Be sure to invite along a friend who actually speaks Cantonese to watch that scene with the tough Chinese gangsters Many critics have hailed this as Scorcese s comeback blockbuster and the box office might even give you the numbers to proof it As a movie in its own right it certainly is not without merits But compared with the original The Departed is dumbed down heavy handed and completely unnecessary I realise Hollywood is starting to run out of ideas but why remake an excellent movie when the ones that need redoing are the bad ones,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1498673/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2022,Still Stands Up Among Today's Modern Films,This was an absolute masterpiece It forgoes today s flashy action predictable deus ex machina plots modern CGI and picture perfect good guy gets all endings for genuine suspense gritty crime and the great human elements of playing dirty and playing double LeoD and Matt Damon are incredible in this film bringing intention and rawness to an incredible script Definitely more than a simple story of cops and robbers This story digs deeper into the mind of man and arguably juxtaposes two definitions of what it means to belong what it means to make something of oneself and challenges the typical image of loyalty to tribe As much as we might despise our antagonist in this film an insightful viewer will respect his commitment to his definition of family and loyalty throughout most of the story This isn t a before bedtime film Come at it with an engaged mind ready to catch the details Try to keep up with this twisted plot and enjoy some great writing and screenplay,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8498579/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2009,Shows Guy Ritchie to be the amateur that he is - 93%,Wow Not since Michael s Mann Heat has a movie surprised me with its brutal visceral and completely enthralling vision of the eternal battle between good and evil and how it affects all of us whether we want it to or not I confess this was my first Martin Scorsese film but I completely understand why this was the one that famously got him that long awaited Best Director gong from Oscar Suffice to say this ain t gonna be my last Scorsese film either Things are going pretty good for Boston crime lord Frank Costello Jack Nicholson His gang of Irish hoodlums pretty much own the streets his empire is secure and neither the police or the FBI can seemingly touch him The reason for this is he has a mole working within the Boston police department Colin Sullivan Matt Damon So senior detectives Queenan Martin Sheen and Dignam Mark Wahlberg decide to plant a mole inside Costello s gang local officer Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio But when both sides discover that they are being infiltrated the race is on to not only bring Costello down but also just to survive Normally there are some things I can criticise about a movie Even Pulp Fiction my personal favourite has its flaws but the only one I can think of is the development of Vera Farmiga s character Madolyn which felt a touch too contrite to be believable Everything else is fantastic The performances from the jaw dropping cast surely one that only Scorsese could assemble are faultless Nicholson looks to be having a ball as the vile Costello and quite frankly it s great to see him back The script never lets you go from the first scene through to the explosive finale and this sprawling epic tale is told over an unexpectedly brilliantly soundtrack just needed a few more Rolling Stones tracks for my tastes And because this is Scorsese and you know through reputation that this is his yard the whole thing feels horrifyingly authentic not just the violence which is brutal enough to satisfy any action film fan but the feel of the thing If it wasn t so entertaining and didn t have big name stars all over the place you d think you were watching a documentary and not a remake of Hong Kong classic Infernal Affairs This is probably the best gangster film to emerge since Scorsese s heyday in the Eighties and early Nineties and yet nobody seems to be raving about The Departed in the same way they were about Goodfellas I can only assume that this is for two reasons The first is that they haven t bothered to see this because he hasn t made a good movie since Goodfellas apparently and reasoned that this wouldn t be any good either Fuggitabutit this is the real deal a welcome homecoming for a director who stuck to what he knew and came up trumps The other reason why this film isn t getting the praise it should is due to age but given time this will become a classic if it isn t one already It is a movie of real grade A class and any doubts or questions you may have about it will be dispelled pretty quickly Be a wise guy and go and see it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2026004/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2022,SAFE FOR ALL!,Pretty much a masterpiece Scorsese did a great job with The Departed It s a drama that will get you to laugh sometimes fast paced too and far from just an amusing movie but one that you will have to keep pace with to fully comprehend the plot Di Caprio s part was really important to me because it was the one I tried to identify with espesially after he gets released and he s roaming the town Almost every character is interesting though with Colin Costello and Dignam on top of the list Acting was great too Wahlberg is aware that he is not one of the best but I like him and in this film he proves his self However in this one I think it s more about the plot Top tier crime movie must see for everyone,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8552577/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2006,"Overrated, overacted and over done",This film was a waste of some tremendous talent remember Mars Attacks with what seems to be a great cast yet such a poor storyline As for being in the top 250 The bottom 250 would be more appropriate I reckon the reason Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar is simply that he s never deserved one As the master of overrated films he should be avoided The Departed continues this trend Gratuitous and often unexplained violence is liberally scattered around the hour too long the film lasts Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson Ray Winstone plays Ray Winstone Leonardo DiCaprio starts OK and then over acts his way into making me laugh almost as much as he appears to be ready to burst into tears I cannot understand how this film has been rated so highly by so many I can only assume that the recent reduction in numbers of bloody and vicious films has brought some sadists out of the woodwork Films need a steady storyline either flowing or twisting with a little consistency the Departed doesn t possess this instead my feeling after seeing the film added to one of great disappointment was that the story was made up as the film was being made and that much of it had been left on the cutting room floor,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1522026/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2016,"Brilliant: intense, clever and action-filled",A tale of two cops though on different sides of the law Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon is a Massachusetts State police detective He has risen through the ranks to head up a special department Public Enemy Number 1 is Frank Costello Jack Nicholson a crime network kingpin and the Sullivan s main target However Sullivan is a paid informant for Costello giving him tip offs on police raids and other useful information Meanwhile Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio works for Costello However he is actually an undercover policeman spying on Costello In due course both know that there is a rat in their organisation but don t know their identity A deadly cat and mouse game ensues with both trying to uncover the other without being discovered themselves Brilliant crime drama from master director Martin Scorsese Slick clever watertight plot The symmetry and interdependence of the two adversaries makes for a very intriguing story and nail biting situations Often they have a piece of the puzzle but to get the complete picture and identify the mole they have to break their own cover creating some very tense situations Some great character based drama too especially involving Costigan The love triangle involving Madolyn Vera Farmiga was a nice touch The Departed is an adaptation of the Hong Kong crime drama Infernal Affairs Similar plots but The Departed has deeper characters more interesting sub plots and wittier dialogue For these reasons I rate The Departed higher than Infernal Affairs Historic movie too in that it gave Scorsese his first Oscar at last After six nominations previously with no award he won Best Director for The Departed When you look at what he was previously nominated for Raging Bull Goodfellas Gangs of New York The Aviator among others and consider those he should have been nominated for Taxi Driver The King of Comedy then you have to consider him incredibly unlucky That or the Academy doesn t like him On the subject of people the Academy doesn t like Leanardo DiCaprio puts in a great performance as Costigan His was the more difficult of the two lead roles as Costigan was a much more complex character than Sullivan Matt Damon hardly had to stretch himself for his role Sadly though not unsurprisingly considering DiCaprio s history with the Oscars DiCaprio didn t even get an Oscar nomination for his efforts Mark Wahlberg did get a nomination as Best Supporting Actor He puts in a good performance as the over the top obnoxious no nonsense Staff Sergeant Dignam It s debatable whether the nomination was deserved The performance does stand out however due to the colourfulness of the character Remaining cast is pretty much an all star one and includes Jack Nicholson Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin Vera Farmiga and Ray Winstone All of them deliver in spades as do the minor players A 21st century classic,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3497884/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,Brilliant,Loved it Great film shocked i haven t watched this before We was focused on tge film from start to end It is a must watch most definitely,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8189369/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2020,Scorsese at his true best,The cast in this film speaks for itself DiCaprio and Matt Damon give such a compelling performance and showcase the corruption of the police force The film manages to also include 3 or 4 twists in places you do not expect and this shows the courage and confidence that Scorsese has as a director The film is bold and gruesome but is told in such an intriguing way Jack Nicholson and Ray Winstone are both great and entertain their roles superbly However i believe that the best actor in this movie is Mark Wahlberg and his role in the film becomes the most important,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5639736/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2007,Talent and tape wasted,Talent and tape wasted All the actors almost are top notch yet how can it fail to deliver on so many levels so frighteningly Is it that perhaps Scorsese is now seriously getting old and losing it Is it because the script gets nowhere Or is it that even Nicholson cannot salvage this unfortunate movie from the baptism of criticism that it will get Or is it Di Caprio who cannot shake off the novice look whatever character he portrays Just another sad awful chapter in the saga of the withering directors work For reference please see The Black Dahlia by Brian De Palma Cannot in any way be compared to the classics such as Scarface Donnie Brasco The Goodfellas and the like As for the Irish Mafia portrayed I believe somehow something is amiss Somehow it lacks credibility perhaps yearning too hard to be credited as tough as its Italian counterpart And this movie being nominated for Oscars that would be another thing coming,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1659095/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,The departed,Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater Very intense action and violence twisting plot lot s of misdirection The story line is a bit overly whelming at times this isn t a good movie to watch if you re tired and follow the action the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who s who of the movie but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won t be too confusing While it s certainly not a love story there is that element with a bit of a morality play going the whole time I can t make some of the statements I d like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews but I ll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently All that said if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I d recommend to you,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5848532/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2006,I Wish All Remakes Were This Good...,In the war between the police and the local underworld the cops have their mole with the crooks and the crooks their insider within the police So far so Hong Kong hit Infernal Affairs The Departed broadens its focus by giving a lot of attention to the chief of police and underworld crime boss but remains very close similarities to its model If you really had to remake this you might as well throw some serious star power and skill at it so enter director Martin Scorsese finally winning the Oscar for one of his lesser films but one that shows considerable confidence ease and skill Where this really shines though is in the characters In th central roles Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio pretty much play the parts as Lau and Lueng did in the original Damon is all confident surface with a fragile foundation while DiCaprio is an incredibly tortured soul DiCaprio has more to work with but Damon creeps under your skin with surprising efficiency Martin Sheen as chief of police offers a sensitive character far removed from the usual cop drama s loud supervisor a template relegated instead to the crazed double act of Baldwin s obnoxious fed and Wallberg s foul mouthed cop For all this classy work though the turn that what will have crowds reeling with horror and laughter will be Jack Nicholson s mob boss Frank Costello He oozes perversion and violence and his improvisational riff on screenwriter Monahan s already repulsive character makes for the most spellbinding individual you will see on screen this year That touch alone warrants this whole remake exercise Credit a director who knows when to tweak things and when to get out of the way It s always a huge comfort to see Scorsese work his magic even on second hand material Ina year where old pros have tried to reinvent themselves with varying degrees of success such as Ridley Scott with rom com A Good Year and Oliver Stone with the dismal World Trade Center Scorsese s star shines brighter than ever What will he do next,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1540189/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2023,Entertaining For Sure,Damon is a lot like Leo in that they always do good but they re never great It s just Leo tries to be better whereas Damon just embraces the fact Leo s problem isn t his ability he s just cursed with child like looks I really appreciate Damon s attempts to be a different person in True Grit I want more of that In this movie they prove the rule Jack Nicholson is always phenomenal Unlike the rest of his age of actors who get established and then coast through older life Nicholson has always truly given everything to every performance regardless of his age You would think he is still starving Extremely rare for an artist I m giving it an 8 because let s face it it s filled with people who get paid for their faces not their abilities Leo Damon Baldwin Wahlberg etc I really didn t like the chick they picked to play the psychiatrist she had no chemistry with Leo or Damon and all of the rival gangsters are caricatures instead of being interesting Italians and the Chinese It s good it s just not a 9 or 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9183880/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Who Can You Trust In This World?,Possibly the greatest remake of all time ripe multi layered and entirely its own beast The Departed is a swarthy vigorous and masculine film about two men trying to live social lives that are the fundamental antitheses of their internal sensibilities Their efforts loom to undo them either by breakdown or lethal revelation The unfolding of their stories concerns an ethical maze in which good and evil don each other s camouflage It s not what it s about but how it s about it which is invariably concordant with a Martin Scorsese film A densely cached morbidly hilarious and powerfully dramatic magnum opus of its genre The Departed is set in Boston instead of well New York L A Las Vegas It starts with a soda fountain scene that would fit perfectly in GoodFellas What is nonetheless purposefully missing is the basic luxury of that film Rather than a kid who lusts after growing up to be a mobster we have two kids who ripen as frauds One becomes a cop who goes undercover as a gangster and the other vice versa Both men excel their phony personas Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan create sympathy and levels of histrionics in the film s early scenes by showing the bad guy mingle with top officials while the good guy is abused by top officials the former procuring a high class condo with a view from the top while the latter s family disintegrates The plot s white knuckled impact relies on frail humanity After several years both men come to relate to and crave the respect of the men they are misleading There are implicit father son relationships all over this film every single male character being both father and son to another to some degree And the scenario ties the extra knot of each man being validated by just one or two of the men on the side he s benefitting If DiCaprio s boss dies who can corroborate that he is actually a cop Cunningly descriptive tiers of this safe deposit are fleshed out by the customary apparatus of cell phones and computers When the directions of the two undercover men intersect will they ultimately arrive on either side of the same phone call When the police suppose they have a rat amongst them what if they appoint the rat to hunt himself Brief subtleties are fleeting but constant in the film s very tight very layered editing for instance the consecutive Catholic imagery surrounding a certain plot revelation One of the informants following another and the subsequent foot chase is an extremely well crafted sequence nearly on par with Henry Hill s frantic cocaine fueled day racing the helicopter in GoodFellas Both show Scorsese s virtuosity in employing a panicky hurried camera sound and music placement and lots of quick cuts The music clever thematic connotations in the use of Lucia di Lammermoor among its rampant highlights is so constant it overlaps Only as the end nears is there any extensive pin drop silence which is that much more intense on account of our conditioning to the music One of the film s rare silences is that long anticipated interaction by phone one of the final scenes before one of the arguable climaxes It is so intense not only because of who s speaking with one another but because at this point The Departed has never been this quiet It is fitting to gather that Boston blue collar Irish American men such as the predominant cast of characters were raised Irish Catholics and that if they have drifted away from the church s laws they have regardless not liberated themselves of an air of guilt Now imagine the guilt when you are concurrently committing crimes and betraying the men who rely on you Indeed the motivators in The Departed are the oldest in the book the notion of one s deepest selfhood and how it affects each character s deeds feelings and certainty The roots of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon s performances is that the familiar structure of movies implies that we trust most characters are behaving or communicating for themselves Yet in nearly every scene in this movie save for certain pivotal parts they are not Both actors channel this racking internal torment so that we can suppose and suspect it though not see it They re not sounding alarms to remind us of their betrayals In that regard the most truthful and candid characters in the movie are the good and evil men being deceived There is another character who is entrenched in an ethical clamp and may suspect it although she cannot for a long time realize it That is Vera Farmiga s psychologist who works for the police and who circumstantially comes to know both imposters She is at first caught off guard by the good guy s brutal eyewitness street honesty in a scene intercut with his unnerving experiences leading up to his seeing her She is afraid of getting her feet wet outside her ivory tower status quo but gradually her allegiance is not to her administrator but to her patient and what a snarled thicket that turns into Really the entire cast serves a plentiful tonic of equally ornate and nuanced performances from the leads to Ray Winstone s deeply felt right hand man Mark Wahlberg s becoming rendition of an abusive staff sergeant and Alec Baldwin s cheeky restless veteran and to fleeting bit roles And in an utterly self assured spontaneous and Oscar worthy performance Jack Nicholson makes Frank Costello not just a godfather turncoat or show off but a crafty and infectiously charismatic man whose betrayal runs so deep with his prot g it s horribly sad And it s representative of his real life inspiration Whitey Bulger s betrayal of his loyal and desperately dependent Southie community,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491409/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2015,Drawn out mob movie with a few twists,The Departed is loaded with talented actors and I went into it with high expectations That said during the last 30 minutes of the movie I just wanted it to end It has strong acting but that s a given considering all the on screen talent It is too long the pacing is too slow and just felt like it was missing something A lot about the movie felt contrived to me and I left the theater feeling deflated The love story was predictable a little weird and definitely inappropriate considering the characters positions The film didn t really have a climax instead there were a series of climactic moments that kept sort of just puttering out and letting me down The cinematography was boring as well most of the shots seemed pretty simple and uninteresting Similarly the score felt contrived and pedantic Like some bean counters calculated the songs most likely to impress a 2006 American audience and threw all of them into this film Overall I just can t recommend this film to people and I think it is possibly the most overrated film of the decade,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3161710/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2007,Sudden Excess Syndrome,This movie is about cell phones and how some of them the reely reely cute little ones keep working when they have blood splashed on them It is getting near the end of career where Scorsese may only have a very few remaining chances to direct or write a film that tells a meaningful and believable story This was a religious story a Hole ee plot with plenty of Miracles If I was to take this film seriously I would consider it a travelogue a fair advisement to avoid getting near the core of iniquity and the canker of decay Boston BTW Boston cops wear silly hats Stop it It s embarrassing Will Indiana,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1618553/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,Betrayal at its zenith.,The Departed is excellent entertainment from some of America s best actors and one of its best directors Not a totally believable story line but who cares It was believable enough to entertain and not lose the audience It allowed good actors to do excellent work The basic story is the head of the Boston Mob Nicholson plants an informant in the Massachusetts State Police Damon and the State Police plant an informant in the mob DiCaprio Both sides figure out there is an inside informant and go looking The chase and final chapter are great action and great drama The final 5 minutes are not what you expect which adds to the fun and entertainment If you have trouble with blood and bad language this is not your movie The language and blood are not inappropriate to the story these are mobsters not school kids Jack Nicholson is still Jack Nicholson With the right part he is still one of the best Matt Damon is wonderful as the mole and does some of his best acting His character has no conscience and that fits the part DiCaprio is a more difficult and troubled character but he carries it well Wahlberg a state trooper supervisor is an unlikable jerk but does redeem himself in the end If you go to movies to be entertained and enjoy a mobster movie don t miss this one,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494231/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2006,"One of the year's best films, and Scorsese's best work in over a decade.",Not just one of the year s best films but also Martin Scorsese s best work in over a decade The Departed is a vintage slice of the director s style infused with a modern edge A loose remake of the Hong Kong three part thriller Internal Affairs The Departed is hardly an inferior Hollywood copy Scorsese takes the material and makes it entirely his own Opening with a classy flashback and then leaping forward with a ferocious act of violence on screen this is as well paced and energetic as anything Scorsese has done in well over a decade not since Casino has he made something so fresh and riveting The movie which takes place in Boston features an interweaving story headlined by a stellar cast Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio is a troubled cop who goes deep undercover to bring down notorious mobster Frank Costello Jack Nicholson who has control of the police force through several moles one of whom played by Matt Damon begins to suspect someone in Frank s operation is a rat As he races to expose Billy he loses the affection of his girlfriend who begins to oddly enough embark on an affair with Billy she s a police psychiatrist Supporting castmembers include Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in his best performance since Boogie Nights The plot twists and turns so many times yet never becomes pretentious or overly deliberate it all seems to connect very naturally and perhaps the only portion of the film that I didn t quite buy was the romantic subplot which would have worked if it had focused solely on Damon s tensions with his girlfriend but became fairly unbelievable once she begins cheating on him with DiCaprio s character The performances are extraordinary Jack Nicholson has a lot of fun with his role and comes across as a psychopathic comedian trapped in a mob boss body DiCaprio is riveting and delivers the most convincing performance of them all evoking a young De Niro towards the end of the picture in both mannerisms and physicality Directorially this is Scorsese s strongest effort in years and it shows in every frame of the picture It may not be groundbreaking and it may not be as socially relevant as some of the director s best works but as pure entertainment this ranks as some of his finest to date,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1534693/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2007,Amazing,In simple words this movie is just what it takes one man to see beyond entertainment Though my favorite actor has always been Tom Hanks recently when I watched Leonardo s The Departed Blood Diamond I can say one thing he Leonardo Di Caprio has really evolved as a great actor His performance has evolved beyond doubt if one has already seen his other movies like Gangs of New York Titanic Romeo Juliet The Departed has a good storyline and gives an everlasting impact on the viewers It really has been successful to portray the risk involved for men working as under cover police This movie has everything that viewers can ask for action and tons of thrills I will not go into details on the main plot as it will ruin the excitement for those who have not yet seen,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1633743/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2019,A foul language version of Internal Affair,My first impression is not particularly good with the word fxxxx exists in every line of the script My disappointment further develops as I compare it with the original Internal Affair The present one is basically a pure action film Internal Affair is an artistic form of action film in term of cinematograhy and music used The famous rooftop scene the scene when the handler falling down of Internal Affair all inscript in my memory Departed is not in par with its original Jack s share virtually ruin the story He should be just a supporting role Andy Lau and Tony Leung perhaps do not make request to appear more even though they are great names in Hong Kong Perhaps you will find odd but as a foreign watcher I will mix Leo with Matt sometimes And I think in the first the round rooftop is a Muslim temple And compare to Kelly Chen the psychologist here is simply not attractive enough A waste of the brilliant casting Overrated movie Following the logic of Oscar Internal Affair should at least be the Best foreign film but not just a Japanese original,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4796801/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2007,Academy Award Winner of Best Picture for a reason,When I went to see The Departed I was left with a feeling I very rarely have after watching a movie I usually either feel satisfaction or disappointment but The Departed left me craving I wanted more I did not want the film to be over There is never a dull moment in this film I really do not care if some people feel it is a copy cat film of the Chinease movie Internal Affairs I absolutely love this movie and I am glad so many people enjoy it as much as I do Martin Scorsese is able to somehow grab a certain story from real life and just turn it into an unbelievably good movie He does that here He is able to take the terms and lifestyles used in an original historical Boston setting and incorporate them into this film The story itself is terrific It focuses on the part of two undercover agents working against each other One is a police officer inside a Boston mob organization and one is a member of that organization inside the police force The entire story sets up nicely and builds up to a huge climatic point where to put it simply the hit hits the fan The filming of this movie is fantastic Every scene looks perfect There is plenty of action in this film and a lot of humor There is never a point of boredom or uneasiness The movie flows so perfectly that you can follow it easily If I were to put this film into a genre it would be a mixture of a comedy action drama suspense thriller The casting in this movie is self explanatory Just look at the names DiCaprio Damon Nicholson Wahlberg Winstone M Sheen and Baldwin Everyone plays their hearts out DiCaprio and Damon are good in their two lead roles Nicholson was up for an Oscar Nomination for his role which is fantastic He plays the stylish and dangerous mob boss Frank Costello Alec Baldwin is pretty darn funny he plays the head of a special investigation unit of the police department But the best actor in this film is without a doubt Mark Wahlberg He got an academy award nomination for best supporting actor for his character Dignam He stole every scene he was in He was extremely funny and serious at the same time A terrific performance on his part All the actors in this film feed off of one another brilliantly You can pick out the intensity they have when they are shooting this film It is phenomenal And although the actors do a great job in their roles the characters created for them are perfect Every character created for this film has an important part and they all do something memorable for this film Everything about the actors and the characters in this film rocked I love Martin Scorsese and I truly believe in my own opinion this is his best film I know it is my favorite but I think it may also be his best This film has everything a good movie needs Yes you can expect violence and a lot of vulgar language but it is worth it The vulgarity in my opinion only adds to the intensity of the film I truly believe everyone should see this movie It may seem long at 2 and half hours but it is worth it If you the previewer does watch this film I hope you gain the same respect for it I have Because 30 years from now people will still remember this movie and those people will remember how fantastic it was,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1678363/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2014,"""Honesty is not synonymous with truth""",THE DEPARTED makes fine use of its high heavens stellar cast The way that Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio and Sullivan Matt Damon resemble each other can be confusing but still invokes a sort of alter ego effect Jack Nicholson also gives a commendable performance as aging Boston Irish Mafia boss Costello as does Martin Sheen as SIU Chief Detective Queenan One of the most memorable characters of all is Mark Wahlberg as abrasive meanie SIU detective Dignam A super violent film without true heroes THE DEPARTED views like a sort of mini epic video novel Although there s no shortage of surprises and turnabouts it doesn t have the sharp thrills and twists that many cop films do and doesn t need them Everything develops at a natural but very compelling pace The loud profane wise cracking Boston dialogue is also something else Though I wouldn t want to use many of them against my worst enemy there are some outstanding insults here As intense as it is THE DEPARTED goes way beyond the level of a standard good guy cops versus bad guy criminals shoot em up fest This film tackles some big themes and is very revealing of what a maddening head muck detective work can be and how easily destructible everyone is in the end,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3018223/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,"Scorsese's best? Second, after Goodfellas.",The Departed 2006 You ve accused me of being a rat twice now and if you do it again I swear I ll put a god damn f cking bullet in your head no matter who you are Martin Scorsese is quite possibly the greatest director of the crime drama or gangster films that Hollywood has ever produced Gangs of New York Casino and Goodfellas just to name a few of the excellent films he has directed and The Departed is no different Superbly written brilliantly acted and a flowing story that is mesmerising Typical Scorsese some will say Leonardo Di Caprio Billy Costigan and Matt Damon Colin Sullivan find themselves on the other side of the fence as one infiltrates the Boston State Police and the other the Irish Mafia but as the discovery of rats within both organisations arises everybody becomes a suspect especially those that are guilty While Frank Costello Jack Nicholson and Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen play the men at war from the different sides of the law First off the bat William Monahan s writing is next to nothing but brilliance The slick dialogue combined with Scorsese s stylistic direction makes this film what it is From the aggressive nature of Detective Dignam Wahlberg to the father like old school Police Commissioner Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen Monahan has the dialogue down to a tee while Scorsese s introduction of simple cinematography allows the other techniques to take centre stage Scorsese uses lightning particularly well in Departed just like in Casino as the darkness represents the unknown danger the aggression the light shows reality in its bleakest form Every piece of music in the film also compliments the film very well such as Pink Floyd Comfortably Numb being played lightly over a scene that contains both sex and adultery However the real brilliance is in the cast Nicholson Sheen Di Caprio Wahlberg Damon Baldwin Winstone and Dalton and nobody let s the film down Leonardo Di Caprio William Costigan is particularly stunning playing a tough guy gangster that must hide his past or face the darkest of punishments death Matt Damon Colin Sullivan on the other hand is less convincing than Leonardo Di Caprio but his performance still doesn t let up as his role switches quite instantly from the collaring result delivering protagonist to the bad guy mob man on the inside While Martin Sheen Queenan and Mark Wahlberg Detective Dignam play there supporting roles countering acting good cop bad cop exceptionally well Nicholson Frank Costello played the role of the tough guy gangster quite well but his character was missing substance and felt a bit two dimensional but apart from that the acting just like the cast was superb Scorsese is quite simply the master of the Gangster genre and while some may say it s been done before it feels so fresh and new to a period of cinema full of horror thriller and romantic comedies If this film does not get nominated for an Oscar Leonardo Di Caprio should be instead for his best role since The Aviator which was directed by Martin Scorsese as well If you re a Scorsese fan you will love all two hours and thirty six minutes of this If your not you will still very much enjoy it 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491079/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2008,Fim of 2006,I loved every moment of this film from start to finish I mean its superbly written and lets face it with a cast like that and a great director it was bound for greatness Since mob films are generally one of my favorite genres i have seen a lot of them Obviously the greats like Goodfella s Pulp Fiction and Donnie Brasco but i have to say that this film was refreshing to watch I think this is partially because of Leonardo Dicaprio What an amazing performance for me it was worthy of an Oscar I ve always regarded him as a great actor but this just solidified it for me The way that both him and Damon played each other out throughout the film was brilliant Always trying to out do each other but they had no idea what so ever excellent and i suppose thats down to the writer for the intertwined twists involved in the plot but i don t think that any other actors would have played these roles anywhere near as convincing as they did For me this was the movie of 2006 i throughly enjoyed every bit of it and was greatly pleased with the end credits thinking WOW,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1849693/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2006,worst scorsese film ever,i don t know where to start everything is wrong about this movie the screenplay is terrible even more so if compared with other great gangster movies from scorsese like casino or goodfellas it is just a series of bad clich s the acting is not any better matt damon if simply terrible you don t believe his character for one minute leonardo is much better but they did not give him much to go on its sad to say that but maybe it is time for scorsese to retire you can only be at the top of your game for so long if he did not recognized the poor quality of the script i mean there is actually a shot of a rat at the end to illustrate i don t know what maybe that the guy was a rat i choose to believe everybody had understood that already what awful use of imagery anyway to sum it up it is not even worth wasting your time watching this movie even if you are a huge scorsese fan because if you know anything about movies and you are not a blind follower of the guy you will realize that it is 2hrs of your time you will never get back god this is just a terrible mainstream film,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1530330/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,A Departure From the Original,First of all The Departed is not as good as the film it was based on Infernal Affairs which is one of the best Asian films of all time Still The Departed is good entertainment in it s own rite The first 2 3 of The Departed does not follow the original very much It is mostly background information about the characters and while at times it is amusing it is also sometimes boring This film is about an hour too long But once you get to the last hour it is one of the most entertaining films of the year The last part of the film follows the original pretty faithfully and turns a mediocre film into a very good one Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career Matt Damon is the weakest link in the film He is okay but does not convey the complexity of the same character in the original film Jack Nicholson gives a grizzled version of the character that he played in Witches of Eastwick The supporting cast is full of actors that are used to being the stars and they are great The acting is alone is worth the price of admission The biggest difference between The Departed and Infernal Affairs is that the remake is much more violent and has many obvious attempts at humor while the original was fully serious and much more subtle While it doesn t fully live up to the original The Departed is first rate entertainment if you can stomach the extreme violence and obscenity If you are looking for a first rate adult popcorn flick The Departed can be a good diversion,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491854/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2007,Solid Film - Rare Best Picture,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1650277/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2006,worst movie,This is the most hideous movie I have ever sat through I almost left but because it had such a high rating on this page I stayed thinking that the blood and unnecessary gore would settle down and a good story would emerge No such luck Movies such as the Godfather 1 and 2 Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels while having considerable violence managed to produce an enthralling story and in the case of Lock Stock a humorous plot as well This movie s only focus seemed to be how else can we include another gruesome death or act of violence The actors all played their parts well but I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this and advise others to not do the same,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1508022/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2007,Fantastic Thriller/Crime movie,Wow Martin Scorsese is a genius What an accomplishment completely deserved of the various awards it was given and easily a future classic The movie tells the story of Frank Costello Played by the magnificent award worthy Jack Nicholson a leader of the Irish Mafia to which he places various people into the Masachusetts Police Academy in order to gain high roles in authority However when Billy Costigan Played by a surprisingly on fire Dicaprio goes undercover for the MPA in order to infiltrate the Irish Mafia both begin to smell a rat in each others organizations and things get tense and let it be said violent Superbly done intelligent cleverly crafted dialog and a genuinely simple story with underlying complexities makes The Departed an intense intriguing thriller coupled with a fantastic cast makes this a personal favorite and no doubt the feeling is mutual amongst many others Simply a must see,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1610091/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2007,Let's start with the bad points:,I think that one or two of the performances from the lead actors were overrated Matt Damon for me seems to fluctuate between good and bad performances He was great in The Talented Mr Ripley and The Bourne Identity Supremacy But I thought this was one of his worse films His acting seemed quite wooden and forced and I don t think he was comfortable in his role of a boyfriend I also think that early on Jack Nicholson showed his age although he did improve greatly as the film went on On a positive note Leonardo Di Caprio was outstanding He s one of the most underrated and best actors around at the moment he s come a long way since his teenage heart throb status and could quite easily have added this to his best actor nomination in the Oscars this year This film would have struggled if it were not for Di Caprio As far as the film in itself goes I hadn t seen or heard much about the original Hong Kong version and was glad of it as I could judge this solely on its own merit It s thrilling with so much suspense Who s going to make a breakthrough first Costello s men or the Police I hadn t seen this before the Oscars and at first I couldn t quite work out how on earth best Motion Picture didn t go to Little Miss Sunshine But now I can understand why All in all simply brilliant,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1629022/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2007,Truly a master piece. Pwns the original Hongkong one.,It is no secret that The Departed is a remake of the successful Hongkong movie Infernal Affairs I watched the original one in 2002 right after it was out I wasn t so impressed then plus it has been quite some time so I barely remember any details But I still can recall the general idea I got It has a script with intertwining clues which generates considerable intensity even if several leading actors performances are mediocre at the best I mistakenly extended my old opinion to the Departed and delayed watching this masterpiece because I thought it could be overrated As soon as I finished watching it I realized that I want watch it again right then It is a completely new movie spiritually The affiliation in the screenplay to the original one is unavoidable but Martin Scorsese did a great job in substantiating the cop and criminal story with his own interpretation If the original Hongkong movie delivers the sense of cool and cool sorry I couldn t find another proper adjective since all what they tried to do is to be or pretend to be cool anybody anytime anywhere The Departed is on the other hand all about crime homicide and deep unrest Infernal Affairs attempted to get into various profound philosophical topics such as causality karma the nature of human being In my opinion it overextended itself to gain ground for none The Departed starts less ambitiously and puts more effort on setting up the backgrounds The psyches of the main characters become subtler and more authentic DiCaprio s role rooted in the Irish Section with a family heritage being either bankrupt or criminal This setting credibly fits into DiCaprio s expertise and explains why he is picked to play the mole Another bold but effective modification of the original script is to combine the role of the 2 lead actress into one a change proved smart in that it not only reduces redundancy but also creates an convincing love triangle Even better is the award worthy performance of its shiny all star cast Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan persuasively presented us a deceitful rouge cop especially considering those dutiful roles Private Ryan he used to act Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello skillfully portraits the aged corrupt boss with a strange paternal charm Vera Farmiga s Madolyn is gorgeous Intellect and sensual she is just the right person for this character And Leonardo DiCaprio eventually get enough matured to break the Jack of Titanic prince of charm stereotype really outperformed himself in his rendition of Billy Costigan BTW Leo also did a great job in Blood Diamond another highly enjoyable Oscar nominee In my opinion Dicaprio is the biggest surprise I got from this movie Some people have been concerned about the excessive curse and violence in this movie To me these are necessary materials to faithfully depict the restlessness of those who plays with darkness so intimately The Departed is a timely reminder to the industry that good movies are made of solid storyline and engrossing acting not of superficial CGIs or eye candies Cheers Martin Scorses Cheers all men behind this great movie If The Academy won t give you the deserving awards surely the audience will hold a place for it in their memories,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1594753/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,Here I go again,Can you say piss poor in a review Here we have an infiltrator into a gang organisation on one side and the plant in the police department on the other Not a bad premise but so ineptly put together that neither side could discover the villain without the help of audience Phony Boston accents ham acting very poor plot line and too much reliance on expletives I usually like swearing in a movie but in this one it was just used to cover script deficiencies To say that it is a mediocre film is being too free with compliments Put up a few big names and you ve got a hit right Wrong This was a bummer right from the getgo Nicholson mailed in his performance Winstone completely miscast DeCaprio OK and what sisface Damon only marginally better The trouble with Mr Wahlberg is that you can t tell whether or not it s actually him a cardboard cutout or a CGI It doesn t really matter because none of the three do anything to improve the project Sheen was pathetic and his Boston accent was like a cinder caught under a door the other attempts at Boston accents weren t much better only Matt Damon s was real and even though he grew up there it was exaggerated to match the other speech coached Siri effect As for the plot gimme a freakin break will ya If either side couldn t find the rat in the first five minutes then neither the police nor the gangsters deserved to hold down their jobs A waste of time and money you could make a better movie with your iphone At least it s a new genre crime mush,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5061245/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2009,Oscar winner? Absolute rubbish!,I understand why you may think this film is good Just the fact you didn t know about the original movie made in Hong Kong The Departed cannot even compare to the original Infernal Affairs It is like watching a TV movie with seriously bad acting bad direction crap music I can t find anything good about this movie apart from the stolen story line Are you people blind or something The story has been changed in parts for the worst There is no style whatsoever to this film All I can say is that its the most disappointing remake of a foreign film I have ever seen Watch the original trilogy to enjoy story telling at its best Scorsese Please U have no idea,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2136189/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2006,The Departed,Yeah so everyone who knows anything about movies has heard the fuss being made over the new Martin Scorsese movie The Departed starring Jack Nicholson Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon Many critics are saying it is Scorsese s best directed movie since the 1990 s classic Goodfellas and it deserves to sweep the Oscars this year I have had the pleasure of seeing it twice during its opening weekend and I strongly agree with the above praise The Departed is an American re telling of a Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs and it has a very complex plot but here is a general summary from IMDb In South Boston the state police force is waging war on Irish American organized crime Young undercover cop Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio giving some of his best work to date is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello the legendary Jack Nicholson While Billy quickly gains Costello s confidence Colin Sullivan Matt Damon also at his finest a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the syndicate is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit Each man becomes deeply consumed by his double life gathering information about the plans and counter plans of the operations he has penetrated But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there s a mole in their midst Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save himself But is either willing to turn on the friends and comrades they ve made during their long stints undercover Like I said above it is a very complex story which is fitting because the two moles in each organization lead very complex lives It is a thematically rich yet wildly entertaining movie about honor duty loyalty and identity It is not just an action crime flick The movie breezes by at a pace that feels like much less then its 2 hour and 30 minute running time Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best acting performance in the film and once again proves he is one of the finest actors of his generation The terrific acting from the entire cast also including Martin Sheen Mark Whalberg and Alec Baldwin sharp screenplay written by William Monahan and Martin Scorsese s brilliant direction make The Departed a masterpiece Scorsese is one of the very best American directors of all time With this film he is exploring the gritty mobster territory that got him recognized over 30 years ago with his breakout hit Mean Streets 1973 yet at the same time telling a fresh and interesting story to make The Departed unique from his other work unlike 1995 s Casino which is basically just a Goodfellas rip off I really think he will finally get a long overdue Oscar for best directing an award he should have received multiple times in the past The Departed will continue to be discussed in film circles for the next few months until Oscar night comes around here is hoping it will dominate the ceremonies It is one of the best films of the current decade as well as one of Scorsese s best films,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1507775/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2006,This movie should finally get them both their ever elusive Oscars,Finally a movie with a great cast great director and great script that lives up to all the hype This remake of the Hong Kong gangster flick series Infernal Affairs was beautifully executed by Martin Scorsese along with his muse of the moment Leonardo Di Caprio This movie should finally get them both their ever elusive Oscars Di Caprio and Scorsese have been nominated several times but neither ever won Mark Wahlberg who plays Martin Sheen s partner adds comic relief with his bulldog character Dignam Jack Nicholson chillingly plays the villainous Frank Costello perfectly and yet he manages to get the audience to laugh with him and be enamored by his evil Nicholson was the only one who didn t take a chance on a character change having played a similar role in Witches of Eastwick and other flicks Matt Damon successfully pulls off his first turn as a villain and Di Caprio develops the physical features to truthfully play a mature role Di Caprio has consistently been a good actor but even in The Aviator his baby faced features just couldn t dissolve well into the character no matter how intensely he emotes In The Departed he finally looks gritty enough and as clinical psychiatrist Madolyn played by newcomer Vera Farmiga very correctly puts it irresistibly vulnerable The movie is almost three hours long but you don t feel it it is tightly edited and composed which isn t very Scorsese Definitely one of the best movies of the year,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1518614/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2006,What's all the fuss about?,Scorsese wanted to give us cops criminals mayhem and suspense But he didn t seem to care enough to craft an ending with any subtleties twists or psychological resolution For this we sat through 2 1 2 hours of complication Some other major failings the opening is too long with lots of unneeded exposition and that female lead what a bore Did she actually have lines I didn t notice DiCaprio was great Damon wooden Wahlberg surprisingly good Sheen likable but the Boston accent unconvincing And then there was Jack As one critic says he plays himself Note the little Shining grin at one point There was no stretching here for the old Lakers fan Can I get my money back,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1511461/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2006,It doesn't get any better than this,Martin Scorsese has been a renowned film maker for quite some time but he has just now reached his peak I was in sheer amazement after seeing his newest The Departed remake of the Japanese version Infernal Affairs Scorsese mixes his classic style of films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver with a new age swing that makes for the ideal film The film is about an undercover cop Dicaprio a high ranking police official Damon and an underground city crime runner Nicholson Also starring is Mark Whalberg Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin The movie is action packed from start to finish as a plot continually unfolds about a mole within the police station during the pursuit of Nicholsons arrest All of these premier actors live up to their name as DiCaprio and Nicholson lead the way Don t be surprised if Leo s name comes up during Oscar season He really put on a performance not to be forgot Nicholson also succeeded admirably He creates a sense of intimidation up to DeNiro status This film is by far the best picture I ve seen this year and I don t see it being topped I simply cannot think of a more entertaining riveting and well acted film I ve seen in many years I can t recommend it any higher 10 10 Bravo Scorsese,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494631/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2006,Four Stars,Jack Nicholson is widely known for playing characters like himself The question for the audience of his latest film The Departed is will you be watching his character or the grinning Nicholson we know and love Veteran Director Martin Scorsese opens the film in a way that any speculation of whether Nicholson can pull off his nastiest role to date his turn as The Joker in Batman comes close vanishes on the spot Scorsese shows Nicholson in shadows during the opening sequence aided by The Rolling Stone s Gimme Shelter Not until the audience has been truly sold that this is the brutal malevolent and immoral Frank Costello does Nicholson s face reveal itself from under the shadows The Departed based on the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs carries some large star power The director Scorsese is arguably one of the best working directors to date The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan the aforementioned Nicholson as Frank Costello with supporting roles by Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Vera Farmiga Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone Catch any wind of that list of names and any expectations of this film go sky high Yet despite gargantuan expectations for a film that was rumored to have so much tension on its set the movie succeeds on almost every level First off the screenplay by William Monohan is brilliant The fast often surprisingly hilarious dialogue is coupled with the gripping story of two informers one infiltrating the Boston State Police Damon and the other the Irish Mafia DiCaprio Scorsese s stylistic direction and old film school techniques assisted by Michael Ballhaus s slick cinematography make the story flow smoothly yet surprisingly fast paced for a two and a half hour movie The acting is phenomenal all around DiCaprio proves his skill to everyone who denied his talent even after his award worthy role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator his second pairing with Scorsese the first being Gangs of New York He truly gives a layered emotional performance and arguably his best Matt Damon reminds us that he is still an extremely capable actor yet his role feels overshadowed by DiCaprio s Nicholson gives one of his best performances with his wild turn as Frank Costello However the very underrated Mark Wahlberg gives a scene stealing performance as Dignam giving his best work to date Just about every single word that comes out of his mouth is absolutely hilarious Sheen also gives a surprisingly great supporting performance as do Farmiga and Baldwin The film is nearly perfect until a scene during its climax where the action might appear over the top to some But not to worry the film s ultimate ending provides all the satisfaction one could hope for The Departed is a remarkable film proving that Martin Scorsese still has it after all these years churning out what is possibly the best movie of the year,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1523712/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Excellent - but not as good as Infernal Affairs - SPOILERS,Contains Spoilers The Departed takes the Hong Kong classic Infernal Affairs and moves it to Boston Skipping yet another plot summary I ll concentrate on strengths and weaknesses The writing directing and acting is absolutely first rate Scorscase has assembled a great cast Unfortunately Jack Nicholson ONCE AGAIN feels the need to do slapstick and face muggings in many places where simple acting would have been better Leo DiCaprio gives what may be his best performance to date he s riveting as a man so deeply uncover that he s losing his way and losing his mind thanks to the immense pressure he s under Having said that I must also say that Tony Leung s performance in the original was even better Mr Leung is probably the best actor in Asia and maybe anywhere Matt Damon Mark Wahlberg and others also do exceptional work My nit pick is this The thing that elevated Infernal Affairs to classic status was not only the intricate story that is preserved in Departed but the emotional connection that the audience had with the main characters even with subtitles When Tony Leung s good cop went down it was devastating When Leo DiCaprio s good cop went down it too elicited gasps from the audience I was with But it was immediately followed by several other shootings and by the end many audience members were engaging in nervous laughter at the over the top violence There was so much violence in Departed that the each occurrence held very little meaning and very little emotion In Infernal Affairs most of the violence evoked true feelings in the audience I highly recommend Departed its an excellent film but rent the Infernal Affairs DVD and watch it with subtitles the dubbed version is crap,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491620/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2006,The Departed - hard to like.,It was with no little trepidation that I arrived to see this latest offering from Scorsese There are few directors in his class in modern cinema and he is certainly one you would watch directing traffic but I can only report that this film is massively disappointing A strong ensemble cast promised much and almost to a man they delivered massively and here I think lies the clue to this Curate s egg It occurred to me that Jack Nicholson delivers a performance that was at best ill conceived and at worst massively self indulgent to the detriment of the film As a result the Nicholson character is a shocking turn off maybe only rivalled by Ray Winstone s leaden Mr French The remainder of the cast deliver strong performances actually exquisite in the case of Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin perhaps this is an attempt to distance themselves from a flaccid core For me Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon are serviceable as the central characters which for Di Caprio is as good as it gets but that is possibly a matter of personal taste but this doesn t detract from what is ultimately an underwhelming film Its worth mentioning that the level of disappointment I felt at this film was such that I had to go and watch it again to confirm that I hadn t grossly mis read the film sadly the second viewing simply confirmed my lack of satisfaction,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1510938/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2010,Extravaganza of betrayal & loyalty.......,Scorsese brings to us a perfect adaptation of Infernal Affairs a great Hong Kong crime thriller Even i saw Infernal Affairs before seeing the departed The movie is an achievement in itself but what hampers the presence are the subtitles to go along But then Scorsese brings to us a movie based on loyalty betrayal which will be a perfect departure for all movie lovers Leonardo Matt Demon were superb Usually crime movie follows like one is a cop other is a mobster Not this time Be prepared to get your imaginations your expectations banged hard The twists the ending everything just fits too well on screen Then you have the maestro himself Jack Nicholson who again proves he is the best The tempo of the movie is fast so audience get glued to the movie as well as the dialog delivery are perfect I can t forget this movie with such a unique cast with Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg too in it Scorsese should have won the Oscar before many people say Nor i have seen Goodfellas neither Raging Bull but now i have to as i know Scorsese sure has the element to surprise me He did exactly that with The Departed Shutter Island This is a great adaptation with some pretty cool dialogs My personal best is Today what I m saying to you is this when you re facing a loaded gun what s the difference Scorsese direction is exceptional the rat concept gets to the audience But is everything fair in loyalty betrayal This is a must watch for all crime movie lovers I gave Infernal Affairs 9 because its pretty cool film even better then The Departed But Departed deserves 10 due to just the brilliance of Jack Nicholson This is an extravaganza of betrayal loyalty,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2258545/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2008,''give me that Oscar'',As Martin Scorsese collected the Best Director Oscar for The Departed he jokingly began his speech by asking Could you check the envelope again This came after an extended show of respect from the crowd for a man who should have walked those steps many years ago It is a fact of life that you aren t going to win every time But to not win at all with movies like Taxi Driver Casino and especially Goodfellas well thats just an injustice As his name was called out it seemed a collective sigh of relief swept over the film industry as finally the man who has battled long and hard collected his award Scorsese stepped outside his gangster film making home last time out to tackle the biopic with The Aviator with mixed reviews Although not a bad film it wasn t the Scorsese we ve come to know and it was time to get back to basics in the search for that elusive Oscar The Departed tells the story of two men from opposite sides of the law undercover within the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mafia The State Police s aim led by Detectives Dignam Mark Wahlberg and Queenan Martin Sheen is to take down Frank Costello Jack Nicholson who has been terrorising the City for years Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio is assigned the unattractive role of going undercover in attempt to do so Costello s hand is made up of Colin Sullivan Matt Damon who is his mole in the Police Department To add to the tension both Sullivan and Costigan fall for the same girl shrink Madolyn Vera Farmiga The story is as intriguing as it gets and the acting is superb on all corners including the terrific Alec Baldwin Jack Nicholson is immense DiCaprios improvement away from the bay faced actor continues and Damon is one of the best actors around full stop My only annoyance is that Robert De Niro a man who has forged a great partnership with Scorsese over the years didn t feature in the film that finally got the great man an Oscar,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1924739/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2020,The Purest Scorsese,The new classic crime thriller by the great Martin Scorsese who delights us with his impeccable gangster cinema and with his masterful direction which surprises us again with this great masterpiece headed by a very luxurious cast that are totally important with a Leonardo DiCaprio who is great a young Mark Wahlberg who is literally perfect and one of the best villains in history Jack Nicholson who is absolutely outstanding all this makes The Departed my favorite movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6273322/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2007,Phenomenal.,Even through about ten viewings The Departed manages to be a highly engaging suspenseful and thrilling film that s easily one of the most entertaining films I ve ever seen Scorsese creates an entire ensemble of interesting some more so than others characters that make every second just as fun and enthralling as the rest When we switch from Costigan to Sullivan it never loses or gains entertainment value and its steady level is higher than practically any other film around There s a wonderful mix of humor involved as well coming primarily from Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin and Jack Nicholson more in the character s reactions to Nicholson than the man himself Everyone in the cast is brilliant from DiCaprio and Damon all the way down to Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone though I ve never been too big on Vera Farmiga and thought she was a thousand times better in that year s Running Scared In my first viewings of The Departed I knew it was wildly entertaining but I always thought it was a little shallow and the characters lacked depth But this viewing helped me see that what I originally thought was a thrilling story of undercover deception is really an intricate study of the loneliness and mental breakdown that occurs when you decide to live a lie As William Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio and Colin Sullivan Matt Damon delve further into their life of being an undercover criminal and an undercover cop respectively they become so much more lonely and their psyche continually falls apart While these two character s lives are polar opposites they are quite similar at their center They are both morally decent men who live a life of crime for unfortunate reasons Costigan obviously because he is an undercover cop but Sullivan seems to be a good man at his heart but lives his life of deception out of loyalty to Frank Costello Jack Nicholson who was always a surrogate father to him after he lost his own Of course they do have their contrasts which I thought came primarily in their way of making decisions Costigan is indecisive paranoid and is never confident in his decisions but Sullivan has snap reflexes and can make an insanely tough decision in a second with no hesitation But in the end they are more similar than they are different they even have romantic interest in the same woman Ultimately it s their loneliness that links these two men which Scorsese beautifully shows in the shots of Sullivan sitting in his office alone in the dark having to live with the horrific decisions he s made in his life further proof that he s a morally decent man unlike the purely evil Frank who shoots a woman dead and his only remark is that she fell funny So while the film is still probably the most entertaining I ve ever seen and is stylish fun and completely enthralling my original belief that it was hollow was quite incorrect It s a remarkable study of the toll that a life of lies can take on a person and is highlighted by two phenomenal performances that perfectly immerse into these characters In fact every actor fits perfectly into his character It never feels like you re watching Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin but you re watching the characters unfold this story Even in ten viewings it still manages to be completely suspenseful Damon and DiCaprio sitting silently on the phone with each other both knowing that the person on the other side is the rat still had me holding my breath and wildly entertaining There s never a dull moment in this magnificent picture that I love more and more every time I see it and that love was significantly increased in this viewing I don t think any words can do the story justice but there is so much depth and intricacy in there that I never saw before And of course William Monahan does a perfect job of adapting the originally Asian story into the streets and people of Boston Amazing in every way,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1780636/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2007,Scorsese's Oscar and this film's ending: as inevitable as a Greek Tragedy.,Java Man Reviews The Departed 2006 R Directed by Martin Scorsese Written by William Monahan Starring Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga Running Time 151 minutes This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz com OVERVIEW Martin Scorsese perhaps today s greatest living director guides his grip truck through the mean streets again this time steering into the Irish American neighborhoods of South Boston The first stop is the Massachusetts State Police induction ceremony where two young recruits have earned their badges and are beginning their careers as cops Ambitious Colin Sullivan Damon gets assigned to an elite investigative unit whose purpose is to bring down local crime boss Frank Costello Nicholson Street smart but hot headed Billy Costigan DiCaprio soon gets booted off the force and ends up as a confidant to the corrupt Costello Screenwriter Monaghan quickly reveals that each man is actually a mole working for the other side thus freeing Scorsese to dispense with suspense and get right to the exploration of these two complex characters Along the way they are joined by other macho lawmen played by the likes of Sheen Baldwin and Wahlberg Adding a welcome female presence is Madolyn Farmiga a fascinatingly inept therapist who manages to develop a too close to the couch relationship with both Costigan and Sullivan Scorsese and his crew build up the tension to its inevitable conclusion which is reminiscent of Greek tragedy REVIEW 4 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS Early in the film Colin Sullivan is being tempted from his youthful paradise by Frank Costello king of the Boston underworld Young Colin is played by a young actor but there is no attempt to portray Costello as a younger man This is one Scorsese s genius strokes We immediately realize that Nicholson s Costello is ageless just as Satan and his evil intentions are ageless This is Nicholson s best scene and as the film progresses he slips in and out of character and Southy dialect as he wanders between previous personas from The Shining and Batman But that s no problem because this film has so much acting talent that it doesn t even need Jack in top form DiCaprio and Damon give career best performances while such pros as Sheen and Baldwin do superlative supporting work The most pleasant surprise comes from Wahlberg who is a revelation and should have Mr Scorsese direct all of his films It has been noted that the former bad boy based his character on a real life Boston police officer who arrested him several times during his wayward youth Farmiga in the only prominent female role capably keeps her head above water in this tidal wave of testosterone The devil is in the details so to speak and Scorsese doesn t miss a trick For example Damon has a scene at a funeral where we see him with on the job facial injuries Though the other characters don t notice Scorsese s camera captures his twisted face in such a way that we see into his twisted soul The screenplay takes the characters on a wild ride through the streets of Boston but somehow we sense how most of them will end up as victims of fate and inevitability Scorsese has finally won his Oscar as has the film itself That too was inevitable,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1733500/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2016,The Best Fiction always has a bit of Real Life mixed in.,This excellent Scorcese combination of Black Mass and Infernal Affairs combines the semi true story of Gangster Frank Costello Jack Nicholson based partly on James Whitey Bulger and the story of two moles planted in the Boston Police Department each looking for the other and their identities hidden from each other until the very end of the story The Context is basically recapped in the 2015 film Black Mass with Johnny Depp minus the elements from Infernal Affairs but still retaining the idea of an FBI agent protecting his informant In whatever underhanded ways he could Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan seems to be the clean cut Boston Detective and Leo DiCaprio as Billy as an undercover cop who ironically becomes the most trusted member of Frank Costello s gang and seems to be the worse off of the two They both connect to a Police Psychiatrist Madolyn Vera Farmiga in a more sexy role than she had in the remake of Manchurian Candidate who becomes a pivot piece for the plot There is some great Age Regression for Jack Nicholson s Frank Costello who takes Sullivan in as a young man and grooms him to become his mole Meanwhile Billy as part of his cover is trained by spending time in the Hoosegow It is known to Costello that there are police informants peppered through his organization and most of the story is Costello trying to find out who these are while Billy at the same time tries to protect who he is Costello charges Sullivan to discover the informants so basically the who things balance each other out But the ways these two plot points interact make this an interesting watch And of course there are many examples of Scorsese humor dotted throughout in bright red grisliness Some of these hold up to the burying alive of Billy Batts from Goodfellas The question is who s the rat And who s the real rat When is a rat not a rat Sometimes a rat can be two different things,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3414549/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2006,Top 10 Worst movie of the year,Scorsese has very little faith in the viewers intelligence with his constant use of symbolism and visual clich s Half way through the movie the repeated killings became camp and the audience I was with started laughing out loud By the end of the movie it had clearly become a comedy for this audience The final scene which I assume was meant to be serious had most of us leaving the theater while still laughing Perhaps Scorsese meant it to be camp If so it was a successful movie If not I would have to say rather than this being one of the ten best movies of the year it was one of the ten worst Matt Damon was lackluster at best Nicholson while acceptable still seems to have to do is Here s Jack face at least once in every movie and the director doesn t seem able to control him DiCaprio whom I have found generally to be a weak actor did his best job to date with a poor script Sheen phoned it in Wahlberg at least was interesting If you like lots of Jesus symbols lots of Devil innuendos get it nudge nudge an actual rat crawling along the balcony railing in the final scene in case you ve missed all the references to all the rats in the movie and finally what the constant cell phone has done to society message you ll love this movie If not save your money This is not the movie for you trust me,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494152/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2008,Rip off!,I thought I kind of liked Departed despite its obvious continuity problems surprising from such a supposedly amazing director before I saw infernal affairs and realized what a blatant word for word scene for scene rip off this movie is I m giving Departed 1 star Scorsese shows off his lack of creativity once again I ll be giving Infernal Affairs 10 stars to compensate for other reviewers If you haven t seen Infernal Affairs I highly recommend it You will not be able to help comparing it to Departed because it s all there every scene But it will be worth it to see what true originality and creativity look like Tony Leung is one of the best actors in the world and though this is not his best film it is still well acted considering the Hollywood style of the movie Yes I m hating on Hollywood now Scorsese obviously tried to fill his film rip off with as many big name Hollywood stars as possible to compensate for the fact that he added nothing original to his movie If imitation is the highest form of flattery then that s all the more reason to see Infernal Affairs For those of you looking for an unbiased review of the Departed sorry you re not getting it here I just finished watching Infernal Affairs and all the tension and coolness I thought was in Departed was displayed so much better there in it s original form Oh and did I mention that Infernal Affairs is an original not that originality counts for much I guess I don t mean to bash Scorsese completely He does get props for recognizing that Infernal Affairs is a good original movie But like the character in the movie no spoiler here Scorsese mimics something but does not become that thing This has been his trade mark from the beginning,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1836558/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2006,great movie,I saw this movie yesterday and think this movie is the best movie of the year in my opinion Scorsese s will go to win the Oscar of better director and Leonardo DiCaprio will go win Best Actor in a Leading Role MAT makes one great Role and Alec Baldwin Jack Nicholson too this movie is better the Japanese movie he acting of all the leads were legendary and they all looked very comfortable in their roles Anyone out there who previously disregarded Leo DiCaprio as an actor will be totally converted as he delivered an astounding performance and showed a gritty side to his character In fact he was so good that Mr Nicholson didn t act him off the screen when they shared screen time together Accolade also has to be heaped on Damon also as he came into his own as the sneaky but smooth rouge cop Add Sheen Whalberg Baldwin and Winstone to the mix and you have the best cast assembled for a motion picture this year the directed are great the casting was great the writing are great the sound track are great too i wait this movie win many Oscars and golden globes I love this movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1527224/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2007,Long ago and far away...,It is sad that some filmmakers are forgotten in their prime when it comes the time to give out awards If they are lucky as Robert Altman they receive a lifetime achievement award but it is embarrassing when they get one prize as a kind of consolation reward after being ignored for their best works This is the case with Martin Scorsese who finally won the Best Director Academy Award for this boring and sanitized re telling of Infernal Affairs a 2002 Chinese violence film One person though is outstanding and was ignored at prize time Leonardo DiCaprio as the young man trapped inside the bad guys playground I give it five stars because Scorsese has not lost his know how but the great stories of yesteryear the innovative techniques of the past are not here This is unfortunately mainstream cinema by a once unconventional director Editor Thelma Schoonmaker tries hard but even she cannot equal her work in Raging Bull What we have is a re cycling of Scorsese s aptitudes in function of a tiresome and mean story for the macho man who ask his macho woman for a beer while he watches a football game or this movie I at least do not need this kind of stories today unless they have a sense of humor as the Chinese do or the characters are treated as children as in Hawks Scarface Do yourself a favor and plan a retrospective of Scorsese s best at home renting Mean Streets Alice Doesn t Live Here Anymore Taxi Driver Raging Bull After Hours The King of Comedy Goodfellas The Age of Innocence and Bringing Out the Dead,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1683560/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,7.2/10 - Bit Underdeveloped But Fun and Interesting Nontheless,You know who I am The Departed follows Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio and Collin Sullivan Matt Damon as they get sucked into the dirty affairs of the Irish mafia and the Boston police department chasing each other s tail as both of them are double agents for opposite sides The film is a Martin Scorsese adaptation to a Hong Kong movie named Infernal Affairs Let s start with some stuff that bothered me this time This is quite a long film about two and a half hours so its relatively fast pacing works quite well However I would argue that the progress in this film is rather weird Things are supposed to get more tense as the film goes on both emotionally and plot wise but I feel like the movie hasn t quite managed to succeed in that Also for such a lengthy film I d expect some deeper meaning which I m yet to fully comprehend Yeah sure it s about toxic masculinity futile struggles the importance of having an identity violence breeds violence all of that But it doesn t feel WHOLE you get me It s there but it doesn t click all the way and not all throughout the film So it kinda works but not as much as I d like it to be I do like the casting choices of course DiCaprio Damon and Jack Nicholson as Costello are all great Vera Farmiga is definitely solid as Madolyn as well Mark Wahlberg doesn t get a whole lot of screen time but he s fun yeah The themes that I mentioned earlier though work well together with the overall narrative so though I d like them to be more developed they re there and some of them especially the toxic masculinity and the identity things are communicated quite well in the movie I d also argue that this film s memorability is for a lack of a better word peculiar Strange The movie doesn t feel special at all in so many ways it isn t directed in a mind blowing well just a decent one the soundtrack is pretty good great cast all of that But though the premise of the movie sounds good and by most means it s a good movie it is and I do enjoy it overall the plot is engaging enough and I do care for Billy s character I still wonder how much of it all is worth the praise it gets How much is truly special here I don t think that there s much to it but I do deem it worth watching To sum it up though The Departed is definitely not the film to make me fall in love with Scorsese s art it s a solid film overall Great cast interesting themes and cool motifs are all there It s a bit too lengthy maybe for the payoff to certain people but I definitely enjoy the mind games the questions about identity and the plot itself I m feeling a 7 2 10 on this one,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8691215/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,Great Acting,The acting was great and the production aswell The thing that i most disliked about the movie is how dumb and naive Costello was I mean he even asked Billy if he was a cop and ever since Billy joined his gang the problems with police started If he was smart he would have killed him since the first problem they had with the police,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6680552/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2011,"Great Directing, Great Editing, Great Acting",Leonardo s performance is edgy and convincing He does a perfect job of creating stress that is palpable I ve probably seen this 6 times and I still cling to the edge of my seat each time I put in on Wahlberg does a really good job as well Nicholson well he s playing his typical bad guy role but with extra gusto Damon was pretty good as well The selection of music was perfect for each scene They put it all together with tight seamless editing and came up with one of the best films of the past 10 years Since there are so many fans of the inspiration for this Infernal Affairs I m going to try to rent it I can t imagine it being any more suspenseful than The Departed but I want to see why there are so many critics insisting it was better I don t know how Scorsese does it He keeps making great movies He is one of the greatest directors of all time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449051/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,Perfect,The perfect ensemble delivering believable dialogue in a marvellously photographed movie What more can you ask for 6 I was a little nervous going to this film I still haven t got over Gangs of New York which IMHO was a shadow of the film it should have been Could Marty serve up a spectacle that matched the hype Would he be able to corral the all star cast while still allowing enough artistic freedom Would Jack chew every single scene to shreds The answers to these questions is an unequivocal YES YES YES I loved every minute of it and was wrong footed more than once by the surprise plot twists What could have been a very predictable good cop bad cop movie was lifted to Oscar favourite status by sublime direction and a rich screenplay that will I m sure become every bit as quotable as Goodfellas in the years to come DiCaprio and Damon are fantastic as the hunters hunted DeCaprio has one brilliant scene in particular where the stress of living the undercover life is obvious in his nervous twitches but the Oscar will surely go to Jack Nicholson He overplays his role to perfection and effortlessly dominates every scene He plays a perverted psychotic killer who clearly enjoys his job but it s still our Jack and I couldn t help smiling as he revelled in his g l ory Mark Wahlberg also deserves a special mention haven t seen him do anything half as good as this before Go and see this film and expect to be entertained,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493478/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,The Lines Are Certainly Blurred,Wracked with an intense atmosphere of paranoia and unapologetically gritty realism Scorsese s brilliantly adapted remake is a cunning game of cat and mouse while the mouse also plots to destroy the cat and the audience is left unsure of who to root for This urbanly stylistic piece is a salute to the classic gangster movies of old brutally entertaining as it is frustratingly perplexing a true Scorsesean crime drama classic,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4663338/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2007,The best film of 2006,He s back He was never exactly gone but he s back The musical mix of Italian opera with the Rolling Stones the quick cut edits and off kilter camera angles the hyper violent stories about unstable people in the underworld Only one guy can put all these elements together into something that transcends the sum of its parts and that s Martin Scorsese His new movie The Departed is his finest work since Raging Bull It is not an insult to this movie to say that it has much the same plot as Mean Streets and GoodFellas Impressionable kid Matt Damon grows up loyal to a mob boss Jack Nicholson who gives him the fatherly affection lacking in his own home but then comes to realize that the man he idolizes may not have his best interests at heart This is not to say that Scorsese is slavishly following his old formula the way he did in Casino The movie is about South Boston Irish instead of Brooklyn Italians Robert DeNiro Harvey Keitel and Joe Pesci are nowhere to be found Scorsese does not make a cameo But the biggest difference is the one that I feel puts this movie a cut above GoodFellas There is just as much if not more attention paid to the police trying to take down the crime boss as there is to the criminals themselves The basic conceit taken from the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs is that Massachussetts state policeman Colin Sullivan Damon is feeding information to mobster Frank Costello Nicholson Meanwile Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio while technically not on any law enforcement payroll is asked by the cops to become a member of Costello s gang and secretly feed information to his police handlers Neither man knows who the other is until it is too late I liked that the movie focuses on the parallels between the two leads Sullivan looks up to Costello as a father figure just as Costigan loves Police Captain Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen And both father figures have fierce lieutenants who don t particularly like their young charges Costello has Mr French Ray Winstone and Capt Queenan has Lt Dignam Mark Wahlberg Both are in love with police psychiatrist Madolyn Vera Farmiga I also liked that for all the plot twists and double crosses there is no sense of the surprises being forced by a filmmaker who is a little too proud of his own cleverness i e Millers Crossing The Usual Suspects As much as I loved this movie I found myself asking some questions once it was over Like how is it possible that two artists of the stature of Scorsese and Nicholson never worked together before When are they going to work together again Please let it be soon How could the Academy nominate Peter O Toole for a dull role and ignore Matt Damon who was the soul of this film How could the Academy nominate Alan Arkin and Eddie Murphy for supporting roles in their cheesy films but not Jack Nicholson or Alec Baldwin in a masterpiece In 2004 after 14 years of big budget misfires Scorsese finally proved with The Aviator that he could make a great film that didn t have the look or feel of his work in his 1973 1990 low budget heyday And with The Departed he proves that for all the wannabes who have sprouted up since 1990 Michael Mann Ted Demme David Chase etc the best person to go to when you want the look and feel of Scorsese s early work is Scorsese himself Not quite as great as Mean Streets or Raging Bull but slightly better than Taxi Driver and GoodFellas 10 out of 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1590117/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2007,Good movie but a Rip-off,Good movie but a rip off by all means I can t say that wasn t a good movie I would be lying Never the less though it was a rip off of the best police movie that was ever conceived and filmed Infernal Affairs I mean the original had much lower budget and still it was visually stunning while The Departed felt like a movie that was made in a hurry The plot where in the original Infernal Affairs was just the most gripping film ever here felt somehow shallow if you had seen the original before Honestly even the huge stars which are really good actors with talent and real acting abilities that played in The Departed weren t as half as good as the Chinese counterparts in the specific rolls What really gets me mad though is that Scorsese and his crew will take the credits and the recognition that don t belong to them All the Oscars should go to the original by far If you think that I got it wrong I really urge you to watch the original and you will understand the difference simply by the impact that the characters will have on you and by the fact that visually is so much more detailed and in a much higher level My opinion Give the credits to those who deserve it 2002 s Wai Keung Lau s Infernal Affairs,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1591059/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2006,Scorsese proves himself once again,Contains spoilers The departed is a great cop thriller that works on every level Scorsese s direction is amazing proving once again he is one of the greatest directors The editing is also great The movie paces very well and there are some very nice cuts that editor Thelma Schoonmaker uses The story is great and has a lot of twist and turns that you don t expect even though I still can t understand why Costello doesn t try to find the rat the old fashioned way and has to gather everyone s records in an envelope The dialog is also great and fun especially from Mark Wahlberg who has a lot of nice one liners He also gives a good performance even though I didn t really like him as an actor The performances are amazing from everyone Jack Nicholson may be a bit over the top but Scorsese knows how to control him DiCaprio is amazing and proves again his acting talents He is on the verge of mental collapse and has violent outbursts and DiCaprio seems like he s living his situation not acting it Matt Damon is also great as the corrupt and sleazy cop and is the perfect actor to play DiCaprio s mirror character the rat in the police DiCaprio is the rat in Costello s gang Vera Farminga does an excellent job as the only female character and Scorsese did well not to choose a famous movie star and Martin Sheen is great as the head of the head for the investigation against Costello and I was really shocked when he was thrown out of the building Which brings me to the ending Though I was a bit annoyed about the way everybody got shot in the head after I thought about it a little I realized that there wasn t any other way to end the movie By killing all the rats Costello is the rat of his own gang to the FBI DiCaprio is the rat in Costello s gang Matt Damon is the rat in the police Scorsese gives a message that betrayers will get what they deserve and makes the film theme of trust and betrayal even stronger Now to see Infernal Affairs and compare the two,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1543995/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2007,It is not as good as it is,I gave this movie 3 score because of the performance and it was the only reason that the Departed got its applauds I watched the original Hong Kong movie before so I am able to know how bad this adaptation as The music is bad taste The plot is not well organized After all I became to hate the Director who didn t give a damn to other country s people in that he took no responsibility to convey to the ordinary Americans that we Chinese were war lovers who always wanted to throw bombs on Taiwan s land It s bullshit I can t believe that it s the same director who shot so many masterpieces such as Taxi driver and Goodfellas In the end I really recommend you Americans to take a try at the original Hong Kong edition,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1600145/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2006,"THE DEPARTED (Martin Scorsese, 2006) ***1/2",I haven t watched the Asian original though the 3 pack of the entire series has been available for rental forever at my local DVD outlet and frankly now that I ve seen Scorsese s version of them I don t really need to either For one thing he manages to make the subject matter all his own it s a veritable companion piece to MEAN STREETS 1973 GOODFELLAS 1990 and CASINO 1995 Still I don t see this as an Oscar picture much as I loved GANGS OF NEW YORK 2002 and THE AVIATOR 2004 I m glad Scorsese has returned to more typical and familiar territory and his stamp is all over this film from the dynamic editing to the terrific soundtrack to the multi layered violent yet likable characters this has to be one of the most foul mouthed mainstream films ever The cast is top notch and while I ve never been enthralled before with the baby faced trio of Leonardo Di Caprio Matt Damon and Mark Walhberg they re all extremely convincing here with DiCaprio delivering his most De Niroesque performance yet as for the veterans they add authenticity to the material which could never happen by watching the originals because the actors would be unfamiliar to us Jack Nicholson his best role in years and Ray Winstone though he seems to be stuck with this type of character are effortlessly menacing while Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are the image of integrity itself lovely Vera Farmiga makes the most of her difficult role the only female character of any consequence There are flaws however the plot is quite convoluted and the film rather too long for its purpose hell it goes on for another half hour after the Nicholson character is bumped off culminating in an over the top body strewn climax though the unexpected death of one of the leads is as shocking and powerful as Kevin Spacey s demise in L A CONFIDENTIAL 1997 I haven t watched that many films this year but this is easily the best so far,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1503134/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2006,Just another cop movie,If you re looking for a good enough but too long cop movie THE DEPARTED is a good bet If you re looking for a masterpiece move on because you won t find one If it weren t for Scorsese s name on the credits no one would be looking for one either so you could say it starts off at a disadvantage This is solid studio formula film making trying to give the illusion of substance by overloading the cast In story terms it s a good premise with some good scenes that don t really compensate for the weak spots It s at its best when De Caprio or Wahlberg are on screen and at it s very worst when Sheen and Nicholson are centre stage Both elder statesmen turn in over the top cartoons that just stop the film dead for a bit of grandstanding The rest of the cast vary but Ray Winstone really should find a new ac because his tough guy act is almost as much self parody as Nicholson s scary monster mobster Don t expect too much and you ll probably feel satisfied Just don t go looking for something this film isn t It s just another studio picture that wants to be a blockbuster more than it wants to be a really good film,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1489543/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2021,Easily one of my favourite films,Somehow I d never watched this movie until now but it definitely didn t disappoint The whole gangster mafia genre isn t usually my sort of thing I was already aware of what the last scene in this movie was but fortunately it didn t take away from the experience and I was still left shocked by how it all played out The Departed easily features on my list of favourite films and has left me wanting to explore this genre a bit more,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6735706/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2009,Deserved the Best Picture Win!,The Departed is an excellent movie Martin Scorsesse is a great director and he has brought us great films such as Taxi Driver and Goodfellas This movie is just as good as those ones The movie is just great It s 2 5 hours long and never gets boring the acting is great and has a cast of Leonardo Di Caprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson and Anthony Anderson among others The film is based on the 2002 Asian film Internal Affairs which I have not seen The film is about two people One is a police officer Di Caprio who goes undercover as a henchmen for Costello s Jack Nicholson crime family while a friend of Costello s Matt Damon joins the police force The film shows how their lives are affected and you definitely will not expect the ending Overall an excellent film which I recommend,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2033567/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2007,Original.,The Departed has some good actors and even better acting In my opinion that was the movies soul strength considering it was at least 20 minutes too long and some scenes could have definitely been edited Otherwise it s not your average blow everything up movie but still very intense And it doesn t go overboard with the dialogue With the exception of some parts it was evened out nicely I won t give it away but the ending in particular stood out most for me because it wasn t happy or sad It was just an ending A very original movie by Scorsese Intriguing and unpredictable just when i thought Hollywood lost its mojo along came The Departed 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1735968/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,This won Oscars????,Scorsese s made some great films in his time but this is absolute crap Quite apart from anything else it s boring as hell Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson Matt Damon plays Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio plays Leonardo DiCaprio Fine if you like that sort of thing I suppose On the plus side Ray Winstone plays a quieter than usual version of Ray Winstone which is a pleasant change The story is pedestrian and predictable like one of those instantly forgettable mid nineties made for TV thrillers The dialogue is abysmal totally unbelievable It s supposedly set in the present day but all the cops talk like they re gangsters in a 1970s Scorsese flick How this screenplay could possibly have won an Oscar is beyond me,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7674856/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,Martin's best ever...,I haven t voted 10 for a movie before I ve always felt that giving a 10 rating is that s like saying there s no room for improvement and there are always elements that could have been done better And no matter what you re doing there s always room for improvement But this was a definite 10 The pacing the plot the characters the performances This was a terrific movie There s no doubt that in the future The Departed will be the new benchmark for this genre The cast is brilliant I have always been a fan of Nicholson and here he is even better than usual Some say he is too over the top but I disagree The character he plays is himself over the top and I think it is a perfect performance Damon s Colin Sullivan is a stunning picture of evil A man with terrific abilities and the way he looks to that golden dome a man with dreams of other better things but he is so hooked into his patron that he can t get out and in the end embraces the entanglements as what his life is Leonardo is such a classic tragic figure in this Unbelievable To be willing to sacrifice himself in this way I think it shows a more realistic picture of what this kind of double life must be than anything I have seen Every supporting character is just as flawlessly portrayed I may never vote 10 again but this one deserves it Scorcese s best ever,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493479/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2007,"OK... I am biased, but it doesn't worth an Oscar",The Departed was adapted from the original police vs triad thriller Infernal Affairs produced in Hong Kong in 2002 IA had always been my favorite movie due to the intriguing plot the convincing role plays by actors the subtle meaning behind the movie and the artistically molded scenes It had been a miracle in Hong Kong s filming industry I was thoroughly disappointed when it didn t claim an Oscar for the best foreign language picture But at that time I knew that it would be remade into a Hollywood movie and was convinced that it would be as enjoyable But then I was disappointed Maybe because the plot was tailor made for Hong Kong s social background and culture I just found the movie not convincing at all The time frame was a mess The characters were not as 3 dimensional as the original The ending was a disaster It s just not fair to compare the movie with the original one but the Departed doesn t stand as an excellent movie individually OK I know I am biased because I live in Hong Kong and I saw IA before The Departed but come on you are not giving an Oscar to a movie that s appealing to everyone because of its plot when the plot wasn t even original I was utterly shocked when they announced the Departed as a movie inspired by J A P A N E S E movie Infernal Affairs I mean Oh my God how could THIS happen in an Oscar I urge you all to see the Infernal Affairs after the Departed which you will surely find the difference,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1608243/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2007,Rat on the Railing at the end nice touch!,I consider myself a very discerning movie watcher and am completely opposed to cheesy Hollywood ridiculousness UNLESS it comes from Martin Scorsese The guy could make an infomercial for spray on pubic hair and I would love it Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed the Departed and actually thought that the last shot of the rat on the railing with the government building in the background to be a perfect way to end things Is this as a result of my devotion to Scorsese I have read some posts that point out this scene as ridiculous and I am just wondering what the consensus is on that particular issue Alec Baldwin gave yet another incredible performance almost on par with his movie stealing acting from Glengarry Glen Ross The other thing I could see someone not hopelessly devoted to Scorsese taking issue with was the scene in which Costello s guy died on the couch before revealing Costigan as a bad guy That seemed a little bit ridiculous The violence in this film was done beautifully I thought and yet I read some conments stating that the part where Martin Sheens character hits the ground and his blood sprays up on Costigan as looking fake I could not disagree more I though it looked quite realistic Am i completetly blindfolded by my respect for Scorsese,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1594100/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2007,"Not a Bad Film, But Overrated",Over the years Scorsese has delivered more American classics than any other director From Taxi Driver to The Aviator he has always turned in fantastic work The question is is the Departed fantastic or is it simply good I would go with the latter If there s one thing that has put a serious dent on the quality of thrillers it s the cell phone Instead of a heated chase in which the two men have nowhere to turn the chased man can now simply call for support on his phone Suspenseful and intense Not so much As far as thrillers go The Departed is a good one The characters are interesting the plot moves quickly and the acting is fantastic Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon both turn in exceptional performances as a sheep in a land filled with wolves and a wolf in sheep s clothing DiCaprio should have been nominated for an Oscar for his role as the constantly bad luck ridden Billy Damon also sets the tone right for the most part as Colin though I feel that he should have made the role a bit more likable The best performance in the film belongs to Jack Nicholson who plays an intense crime boss with a dirty mouth eyes like a hawk and power like that of no other man It surprises me that he received no nominations when his work in the film was potent and frighteningly brutal He deserved the nomination much more than Mark Wahlberg who does little more than strut around and talk in a thick accent These great performers along with Alec Baldwin and Martin sheen make the film very entertaining The script suits the actors well and is often quite funny Still this film is never elevated to the level that Scorsese s past films have been It is a good movie and I understand that the Oscar was more of a tribute to Scorsese s career but the film does not quite measure up as a classic in my book Better luck next time Marty,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1647442/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2006,Looks good but weak plot,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1527235/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2006,Daft,Y know I don t think I ve actually watched much Scorcese before I watched this last night with the missus but I can understand why people rate him so highly in terms of putting together a tight piece of entertainment and getting convincing albeit not necessarily realistic performances out of his actors he s indisputably one of the best but I couldn t escape the impression that this film was utterly ridiculous The good points are many Jack is 200 fun to watch it rattles along at a rate of knots and I was always intrigued to see what happened next despite it dragging in a couple of scenes near the end amongst others but equally there were places where I thought Oh come on I wouldn t know a Boston accent if I heard it but despite that even I could tell that a fair whack of them were mangled especially Ray Winstone s you re great to watch Ray but please god stick to Cockney And I didn t really buy Vera Farmiga s character but then I ve lived a very sheltered life I guess I was expecting something more hard hitting rather than this silly but as I say it was a lot of fun I wanted to give it a 7 5 but I can t so it gets a seven Hayfax Jo,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1508303/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2016,1 Dimensional Characters in a Slick Script,I wanted to love it I wanted to be captivated I wanted to be taken for a ride of action mystery and suspense And well It was like ordering your favorite meal only to bite into it and find it sorta tasted like it was supposed to You keep chewing trying to love it but it s just a bit off That s this film It plays out like a slick mystery novel everything revolves around the narrative and everything happens to conveniently fit perfectly in place While this isn t bad necessarily it comes at the expense of the characters being more interesting Even with the all star cast line up it doesn t do much to give anything more than a cardboard cut out for the characters How this won an academy award is certainly a wonder Either the competition that year was terrible or the judges simply looked at the names in the credit roll and felt like in order to keep their jobs they had to vote for it The movie opens up laboriously slow trying to give you a background and history of the main characters but what it fails to do is make you feel connected to the characters it comes off slow and trite It s just too forced and almost feels like a soap opera for the first 15 2 minutes The major low in the film is when Billy somehow is supposed to fall in love with Madolyn and vice versa The movie makes about as much effort to sell you on it as a bad porno IE Therapist girl gives one session with Billy kicks him out And then somehow a few scenes later they re knocking boots It was just so terribly unrealistic or believable but then again most other things in this film are Now film works by the viewers suspending but this film just fails to really engage the viewer with the characters which would then allow you to suspend belief So many things in this film come off as trite Overall a watchable film but despite it s all star line up it s a very forgettable film,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3555061/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2006,pretty good adaptation,quite good a little more violent than the hk original though Scorsese shock value which actually works plus a bit more humor to spice it up though i liked both movies the original turned out to be more suspenseful while this one was the grittier drama Mark Wahlberg steals the show whenever he s on screen And his character wasn t even in the original movie All the major actors did a splendid job From Alec to Wahlberg everybody turned in one of their most memorable performances However the role of the shrink is just pushing it Just way too incredible that she s been sleeping with the two guys who are after each other They could have done away with this subplot just like in the original can t say it s Scorsese s best work though If we are talking crime drama Goodfellas and Casino are the still the jewels,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1489418/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2010,Great direction and great performances make this one of the best crime dramas.,It has been years since I first saw The Departed and since then I have rewatched it many times I am finally able to write a review of it The Departed is everything a film aspires to be It is a crowd pleaser a film that will be able to cross over to the mainstream crowd but the good thing is that it is a great film a critical darling as well It has a great screenplay with mesmerizing performances from the entire cast the highlight being Leonardo Dicaprio who has never been better It is fast paced wonderfully shot and edited and the finale is amazing and will have you waiting and hoping for more It is a worthy Best Picture Oscar winner and if you have not seen it yet then you really have done an injustice to your film collection,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2347544/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2007,Very disappointing,I hesitate to even add a comment at this late date especially after so many people have echoed my own disappointment with this movie but clearly Scorsese won the Oscar because of his fine work on Mean Streets Taxi Driver The Last Waltz Goodfellas etc I know a lot of people consider Raging Bull his masterpiece and although I do not care much for it I would even understand an Oscar given to Scorsese for it But this bloated mess I can t believe how LONG the damn thing is especially considering that the original is so much more powerful at only 100 minutes And don t tell me the length was to provide greater character development the characters were much more expressive in the original and their relationships to each other were much better developed And as others have mentioned the profanity is nonstop and the ending is laughable And for once I can really say I had WAY too much of Jack Nicholson,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1709377/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2013,A remarkable remake; Scorsese's return to the mafioso genre,The Departed focuses on two characters Billy Costigan Leo DiCaprio an undercover cop in the Boston Irish American organized crime and Colin Sullivan Matt Damon an undercover criminal in the Boston police department As their actions intensify and they rise in position in their hidden roles a hunt begins on both the police and the mafia to find the moles The remake of the already excellent Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs makes use of director Martin Scorsese s legendary aptitude for gangster films relocating the story in order to reference the Boston organized crime scene While still not as good as his masterpieces of the genre like Goodfellas and Casino The Departed is far from a stain on his filmography As usual the dialogue is good and flows in a very natural and aggressive way The characters likewise are very interesting and well represented Both Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon feel a lot more mature here I still can t shake off the image they constructed by playing cheesy lame pretty boys and in Damon s case troubled lame pretty boys in films such as Titanic Romeo Juliet Good Will Hunting or Rounders It takes a director of Scorsese s caliber to put them in line and it shows Both of them give excellent performances and for the first time ever I sympathized with a DiCaprio character The supporting cast is also top notch in special Martin Sheen Ray Winstone and Jack Nicholson possibly his best casting choice since he last cast Robert De Niro Possibly the weakest link of the movie Mark Wahlberg had a bad tendency to overact at times On the other hand the love triangle subplot involving Vera Farmiga s character was totally unnecessary and just a waste of time likewise the Costello twist also served little to no purpose other than confuse the slower viewer The cinematography while not bad feels too artificial a common occurrence in his recent films and does not convey the level of realism Scorsese s gangster films usually have While not on the same level as his masterpieces most likely thanks to his recent venture into larger scale works Gangs of New York The Aviator The Departed is Scorsese s best film in over a decade of mediocrities and a great entry in the gangster genre Now if he only kept doing mafia and casting high level actors such as Nicholson and De Niro,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2848778/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2007,"Nice film, with some inconsistencies",The departed a Martin Scorsese movie that has been awarded with 4 Oscars among others is a highly entertaining movie with excellent acting especially by Leonardo Di Caprio in my opinion Now if it hadn t been Scorsese would this movie have gotten all the praise and awards that it has I doubt it Let s go to the plot outline first It focuses on two characters Colin Sullivan Matt Damon and Billy Costigan Leonardo Di Caprio Both are new police officers Sullivan has been patronized since his childhood by big mobster Frank Costello Jack Nicholson and now that he s a cop he still works for him undercover Costigan is recruited by Capt Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen to become his undercover man in Costello s gang What ensues is the narration of how each of them gets around under their circumstances and how both Costello and Queenan begin to suspect there s a spy on their side but they don t know who it is I found the central part of the movie the most enjoyable and coherent The introduction was exhaustive maybe too exhaustive The ending was very good too But like I said it s the story details and episodes that make the best part of the movie I especially appreciated how Costigan s side of the story is told and I found his character much better developed than that of Sullivan I found nothing very wrong about The departed but I was bothered by some inconsistencies along the way especially one which kind of downgraded the movie a little for me Again probably if this hadn t been such a generally applauded film it wouldn t have mattered or maybe it would Overall a good thriller but I didn t find any particularly deep content to it nor anything that hasn t been said a million times before in this kind of movie Enjoyable but vastly overrated,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1721510/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2008,Deserves the Oscars!,The Deaparted is a very good crime drama movie This would ve gotten a 10 if it was not for one thing it is hard to follow the plot I was able to catch a grasp on what the story is about It s about an undercover cop spying on the evil guy Costello and feeding information back to his detective bosses Meanwhile there is a rat from Costello in the police unit This movie is very good There are brand name actors and they live up to all the hype Leonardo Jack Mark and Matt were amazing performing their parts This is a great move to add on Jack Nicholson s resume The music by Howard Shore is not what you would expect It is not Lord of the Rings music but I still liked the music This film is full of violence and cursing That is what I liked about this If don t like that kind of stuff don t see this movie I rate this movie 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1985529/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2007,"An old school style, but surprising and engaging crime thriller!",The Departed 2006 Directed by Martin Scorsese Written by William Monahan Starring Leonardo DeCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen The Departed is a welcome change for director Scorsese from his last few films Here he returns to an old school style crime thriller With a first rate cast an excellent adapted screenplay strong lead and supporting acting this film delivers in major aspects Longtime veteran of Scorsese film s Thelma Schoonmaker delivers some impressive film editing The pace and rhythm of the film are near perfect suiting and serving the story very well The film begins with Nicholson s character narrating We quickly learn his character and what he is about We receive some background information on the story and main characters at this time The film convincingly shows corruption on both sides of the law Monahan s adapted screenplay from Infernal Affairs changes the story setting to present day Boston Damon s character quickly rises in the Boston State Police Department DeCaprio gives one of his best acting performances ever as a misguided violent tough guy with heart I felt the film deserved two more Academy Award nominations Jack Nicholson for Best Supporting Actor and Thelma Schoonmaker for Best Film Editing I was surprised by the humor at the beginning of the film Though all lead and supporting acting is impressive in this film Wahlberg s character is my personal favorite here I liked his tough tell it like it is no holes barred style The film does has a few weaknesses such as the love interest story with the psychiatrist The acting performance by Vera Farmiga as the psychiatrist is solid and convincing Her character does serve well to show the personal weaknesses of DeCaprio s and Damon s characters But it does not serve to move the plot forward My only other minor complaint is the ending with the rat walking on the balcony railing not really necessary but perhaps a last minute choice for a humorous exclamation point to who the villain really was,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1595884/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2006,Nice build-up and terrible let-down,The post Casino Scorsese is a director who has nothing more to prove and seems to be content with shooting big budgets that fall into line with big concessions The Departed feels much like an impersonal movie and the most Scorsese like feature in it are the sudden bursts of violence Violence clearly has an important status in Scorsese s filmography were it only because it is not gratuitous violence but the cathartic display of the animal part in male characters But at some point in the storytelling violence hurls the rest of The Departed to hit the rail Too much no longer meaning anything For me the big flaw in The Departed that makes it yet another over bloated Scorsese flick is the fact he was compelled to deal with two intertwined story lines Yet obviously the Scorsese hero is not the clean bland Sullivan Matt Damon but the grim edgy Costigan DiCaprio The Sullivan part has nothing to do in a Scorsese movie it s a stereotypical part which only hijacks half the runtime from the real guy Star egos Matt Damon s agent negotiating to have equal time with DiCaprio Anyway it s a sorry result What makes the great Scorsese s movies so great is the flow the fact we have a voice over that rushes us into the action into the heart and soul of the characters Here Sullivan is so uninteresting they had to put a prologue to set his character and the screen time he gets only distracts the story telling from gaining momentum with Costigan s inner struggle On the whole The Departed would be a good thriller and a minor Scorsese stint but the ending makes it a very disappointing one with its deus ex machina conclusion Never thought Scorsese could be able to deliver such a pitiful executive like busted mess of an ending I felt it coming as the storyline was screeching with four reels not to take the path of fatality not making it to convert a nice ensemble piece to stay more with Costigan our genuine tragic hero the only one we truly care for UPDATE I have now seen Infernal Affairs the original Chinese movie and the only points where the Americans have improved on the original material are 1 a better characterization for DiCaprio and Nicholson s parts 2 a slower rhythm more suitable to this story yet 50 min in excess 150 vs 100 are twice too much Infernal Affairs looks a bit rushed to fit in the 90 100 format and I have to admit the error of not insisting enough to flesh up the undercover cop was already the main problem in the original we have very little time to feel the cop spent 10 years under cover so The Departed has very little to be praised for Even more so pumping up the Godfather part with the Nicholson impersonation proves detrimental in the end to the whole movie,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1540510/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2016,One of the Best Films of the 00's.,The Departed is directed by the one and only Martin Scorsese and stars Leonardo Dicaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Ray Winstone and Alec Baldwin Huge star cast It s plot is very interesting as it s about an undercover cop and a rat in the police office that try to figure out who each other is The rat is fathered by a drug lord Jack Nicholson and the undercover cop is somewhat mentored by the police chief Martin Sheen As you already should know Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors of all time He s directed Goodfellas Casino The Wolf of Wall Street also with Dicaprio and Taxi Driver Another thing you should know is that this film won best picture in 2006 To start the acting is truly amazing Some of my favorite actors are in this film but even the actors that aren t mentioned above do really well Dicaprio does so well as Billy Costigan I forgot I was watching a movie at a couple points Matt Damon also does truly amazing in his role along with everyone else The directing is also great Martin Scorsese continues to amaze me even with the great films he had done before this movie was released Some of the camera angles he decided to provide are interestingly risky but work really well There was also a scene in this movie that surprised more than I ve been surprised in a movie in a long time It is a spoiler so I won t tell what happens but prepare yourself That s all I ll say Another good thing about the film is the cinematography Some of the shots of Boston are amazing especially from a recurring rooftop that we see a few times in the film The sound quality is spot on the Blu Ray looks great even the no name actors in this film do well Everything about this movie is truly great However like all films this movie does have a problem More like a plot hole but I ll call it a problem to be fair to other movies It s problem begins with the smarts of Jack Nicholson s character Castello Castello is a smart guy He s a drug lord that always gets what he wants However he can t figure out who the undercover cop is even though all signs point to Dicaprio s character Billy Costigan Castello is portrayed as very smart which he is yet he struggles to read signs leading to Billy That was my only problem with the film Overall this film is great I recommend it to anyone who can handle cursing and extreme violence I think this movie deserves an A or 10 out of 10 stars,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3412820/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2007,Not a bad performance in the bunch.,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1598963/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2008,The Godfather for this generation,This movie was hazy to me at first I had questions like which side was Matt Damon on Was Jack Nicholson going to find the rat Was Mark Whalberg going to do anything important in this movie But all those questions were answered This film leaves nothing out And just to see Jack Nicholson doing what he does best it reminded me of Marlon Brando in The Godfather This was definitely Scorsese s best film since Goodfellas I truly think that it was the right choice for Best Picture This movie made me have a whole lot more respect for Leonardo Di Caprio and Alec Baldwin who I think did the best in this movie It was a truly spectacular film with a great cast to go along with it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1876501/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2007,Very poor quality,Sorry to disagree with those who liked the movie but I have to say that I found it totally unmemorable This work is definitely not of Oscar quality I have seen many other Scorsese movies and frankly his later work Gangs of New York The Aviator is just terrible In the Departed the story line is not well presented there are severe problems with continuity many dialogs are poorly executed and I could go on and on In my opinion these defects reflect a severe deterioration of Scorsese s craft I hope he can recover his touch and go back to the excellent craft that he exhibited in his early days This year there were several movies by far better than the Departed One has to wonder why the academy gave an Oscar for a work of such a low quality,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1626066/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2008,Fan-frickin-tastic,Raiders of the Lost Ark is the only movie I ll ever give a 10 to but this movie is as close as you can get to that I love this movie This is one of the most engrossing films I have ever seen The writing cinematography direction and acting are all awesome It is an intense movie that kept me on the edge of my seat And the ending is of this movie is beyond words Blew me away Damon is in my favorite role of his next to Jason Bourne Jack is great And even Dicaprio who I am not a fan of is pretty good Marky Mark of course is funny and great in his part Martin Scorsese is a fenominal director and made this movie amazing I love this flick Kudos to Scorsese He can make mob stories like no one else,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1879811/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2007,A disappointment,An absolute disappointment of the remake of the Hong Kong version It totally lost the spirit of the original version and poor acting from both Damon and Dicaprio No surprise from Nicholson either It was a real surprise that this movie could have won so many Oscars especially Best Director for Martin Scorsess It just shows how pathetic the Oscar Committee is I would strongly recommend anyone who really like this move to watch the Trilogy Version from Hong Kong Much better acting from Andy Lau and Tony Leung with tension throughout the whole movie and full of surprises Perhaps Martin Scorsess should never have adapted this movie from Hong Kong a huge cultural difference,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1654256/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2006,And the audience laughed ...,Well I went to the cinema yesterday evening to give Marin SCORSESEs new so called masterpeiece a viewing and there are indeed a couple of positive things one can say about this movie 1 It could have been a really nice little mean dirty B movie the storyline is indeed great and would have made fantastic B movie material but it was not to be 2 DiCAPRIO does indeed give an outstanding performance much better than I had expected 3 It s a nice time killer and certainly watchable 4 There s one really terrific scene very much at the beginning when DiCAPRIO beats up two molesters in a small deli This scene has a raw quality and utterly believable eruption of violence which is unmatched in the later scenes of the movie That said there are unfortunately so many needless implausibilities logical impossibilities and story holes that the movie as a whole is unfortunately a far cry from the masterpiece it has been called by some critics In fact Scorsese seems to be out of sync with his material fro a few years already and has not achieved any major artistic achievement since the days he has made such great movies as RAGING BULL GOODFELLAS and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE Personally I consider this a pity and can actually not imagine Scorsese has not himself realized the above mentioned and down below discussed shortcoming which are 1 The major implausibility or even logical impossibility is Mark DAMON walking in some high fancy apartment as a young policeman and either renting or buying this I think more renting He simply could not afford this with the average or below average income he is supposed to have Looked at critically by the guy who would rent it to him he utters some line that somebody would guarantee for his payments but at that time of the movie the only rich person he s connected with is the molester played over played unfortunately by Nicholson As the story progresses and the police has realized that they have a traitor in their own lines all people are checked in detail but obviously nobody takes any notice of the question how DAMON can afford this style of living even now equipped with an average wage earner girlfriend Come one that s not a minor implausibility given the fact that everybody s lives are checked so much in detail And it s completely useless There s no need for the story to have DAMON live in such an expensive apartment he could have easily rented a small affordable one and the following story would have developed the same 2 Now I am certainly no moralist when it comes to foul language but with foul language you have the same problem as with exceeding violence With more and more of the same it does not only get redundant but it also wears thin get s implausible and even ridiculous Already at one of the very first scenes with DAMON he calls other footballs players some here unprintable words He does not call them that once but he calls them that some 4 or 5 times speaking as fats as a machine gun and already after that scene you ask yourself if the guy is really in control of himself which he d certainly need to be with that story to follow The whole picture goes on like that every 10th to 15th word is in in sucker and whatever else Everybody seems to talk that way the low mobsters the high mobsters the low and the high policeman only the few women are an exception Now is that believable that really EVERYBODY shouts obscene words in every fitting and unfitting scene I very much doubt this and less would certainly have been more and more impressive A needless waste of credibility again I do have an explanation for that nevertheless SCORSESE wants to show us the audience how similar the good and the bad guys are well an old story and not the right way to tell us that I d say 3 NICHOLOSON is usually good when playing a mobster And that s how he starts He does look sinister does some SHINING faces does a lot of wise cracking and the movie strolls on As time progresses Nicoloson seems to get out of sync with his role He does some wisecracking he makes faces utters lines here utters lines there and that how it goes on until a real low point when NICHOLSON does some wise cracking and makes the face of a rat For the first time people laughed in the audience but it wasn t the laugh of apprehension it was that of disbelieve and I d say SCORSESE would not have cherished theses laughs As the movie progresses NIOCHOLSON becomes more and more unbelievable in his role as a hard boiled mobster Wise cracking once in a while is fine but also in this case much less would have been more In fact as the movie progresses one starts to wonder if the mobster NICHOLSON plays is really intelligent enough to get a top position in organized crime to become the king as he himself seems it and to hold such an organization alive with wise cracking and his mimic antics I VERY MUCH doubt it I also see the difficulty of even a seasoned director like SCORSESE to say a no to NICHOLSONs antics in shooting but that doesn t change the impression of implausibility that rests with the viewer A middle management guy in organized crime yeah but the top leader in Boston no Since I am only allowed 1000 words this is continued at the discussion board,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1556023/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2019,One of the best,One of the best movies I have watched Storyline acting direction everything was world class,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4926602/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,Nicholson ruins the film........,No fan of Di Caprio but his is a solid performance same with Damon Wahlberg Baldwinand a surprising solid effort by Sheen A far better far grittier and far more frightening film in the same locale is Gone Baby Gone in particular the bar scene of Affleck and Michelle Monaghan That scene way more credible than the one of DiCaprio This is all on Scorsese using Nicholson and then not controlling him The result is his performance laughing goofy grins eyes rolling lecherous comments etc is the same he did in that other piece of garbage Goin South Nicholson ruined this film and Scorsese watched it happen,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5904176/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,Exceptionally well made misery,I absolutely unequivocally loved this movie when I was a teenager And how could you not It s incredibly well made well crafted and so well written you have to wonder if William Monahan didn t make a deal with the screenwriting devil that he s been paying for ever since But after watching it recently for the first time in more than a decade my biggest takeaway was how depressed it made me This is a miserable movie about miserable people making miserable decisions that ultimately serve to make them even more miserable even more so than other Scorsese classics And don t get me wrong I don t believe the job of every movie is to make you feel nice safe and happy all the time I was just surprised at how a movie I d been thrilled by in the past was now leaving me completely deflated So I guess in a sense this is less of a review and more of a reflection on how our perception of movies changes as we do When I was younger I was entranced by the style craft suspense and unpredictability but now after having been through the wringer a few times myself I empathize so much more with the characters and everything they go through All the elements I loved about the movie before are still there and I still appreciate them but the content itself hit me differently than it ever had before All this to say if I sit down to watch The Departed again in another decade I m gonna have a stiff drink or two ready to go Special shout out to Thelma Schoonmaker s editing in this and all of Scorsese s films now and forever amen,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8247747/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,The Departed,6 10 a good movie but it simply had far too much violence and egregious language for my personal taste,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5088217/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2019,Overrated,Not horrible but certainly overrated The acting was over the top Like caricatures They didn t need the love story Totally unnecessary and slowed down the movie and they could have cut 45 minutes and made it better Not every movie needs a love story Their behavior was dead giveaway I mean seriously when Leonardo was supposed to pretend he wasn t bother but his face said the total opposite I hate when actors are supposed to make other characters believe them but they play the opposite with guilty faces And maybe it s just me but the editing was way too jarring and sometimes I don t mind too much in Scorsese s movies but this one was just too obvious You don t have to be a genius to figure out some of these people are playing both sides Unless the cops and crooks are so dumb here which they wouldn t be in real life How did they not figure out it was Leonardo sooner The fact they wanted to bring him in at first was not believable It was like everyone knew each other but they were all so dumb they couldn t figure out what each other did They KNEW Leonardo was a cop before they took him in They knew there was an informant but they were too dumb to suspect him but rather others who have been with them for decades Really This was like dumb and dumber cops Cops see all the gangsters go in the building but they don t follow It was ridiculous They are looking for rats and everyone seem to act so suspiciously Matt Damon is just a bad actor Leonardo acted suspiciously the whole time It was one blunder after the other Irish guy who got shot KNEW it was Leonardo and yet he didn t tell anyone except Leonardo It was painful to watch Nothing made any sense,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4675974/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,"Self-Parody, Empty Bluster",It is frankly bizarre that after so many better films from Scorsese that the Oscars decided to reward this misfire The film is entertaining enough but then again so are train wrecks There are too many twists too many spies When everything is fused with duplicity there isn t anything to grasp onto Meaninglessness follows The film plot renders any meaning pointless to try to discern Why bother It is nonsense Maybe I would be kinder on this film if all the characters weren t such overblown Massholes all the time through weirdly none of them seem to like the Red Sox Filled with cheap machismo insecurity and bloodletting this is the sort of film that is mistaken as serious when it fact it is just silly men not realizing they are wearing funny hats And dear god the accents all seem put on The characters are almost as overcooked as the writing Probably the saddest aspect of this is how Scorsese who should know better used forced mise en scene throughout this film To name two quick examples A woman is holding a banana when she is implying male impotence The last image you see is a rat It feels much more like someone trying to copy Scorsese than himself I guess the Oscars were afraid Scorsese was about to die given how much this film got away from him That explains this career achievement this film got,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4663001/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2006,Disturbing POS,The most disturbing piece of crap I ve had the unfortunately pleasure of viewing in a long time I d rather watch StarShip Troopers How many f bombs and head shots can you stuff in a movie I watched people walk out of the theatre and wonder why that couldn t be me If you want to hear about 3 to 4 hundred f bombs or graphic violence then this is your movie What kind of graphic violence you may ask Well if you like watching blood gush out of someone s head or see it splash all over the place not once or twice or even six times then don t pass up this opportunity Geez what else can I describe to meet the 10 line requirement,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1513343/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,Excellent fantasy,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491248/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2006,"Great performances, choppy editing.",I thought the entire cast was excellent The performances made the movie for me It didn t seem very Scorsese ish though Its a cops and robbers kind of movie and it seemed to me like it could have been directed by anyone competent and didn t require a master filmmaker It didn t explore the psyche of these people in the way that Goodfellas did but as a popcorn thriller it worked I didn t really like how the sound and picture were cut though It felt a little choppy but it was clearly the style Scorsese was going for Like the music would cut out suddenly or it was competing with the dialogue Sometimes picture edits would bump together like a jump cut Did anyone else notice this,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1497274/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2007,Not as good as internal affairs,I saw The Departed after everyone raved about how good it was Frankly I was disappointed It s too Hollywood over the top and being from Boston the accents were HORRIBLE Completely overacted I felt compelled to write this review after I rented Internal Affairs I d like to start off first by saying that I had no idea what Internal Affairs was about After about 30 minutes and seeing all the similarities it was easy to see that The Departed is a poorly done remake of Internal Affairs Sure it s not as sexy as the Hollywood version but the acting is so much better to the point that I was rooting for the undercover cop whereas when I watched the Departed I was rooting for the mole The Departed isn t a BAD movie however watch Internal Affairs and once you get over the Hong Kong camera shooting style and cheesy romantic music you ll see what real acting and a plot that makes sense is all about The Departed was a little unclear at the end Lastly the ending of Internal Affairs is so much better,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1651964/?ref_=tt_urv

Scorsese scores with undercover drama which doesn't seem to be yesterdays leftovers,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1651292/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2007,whack,for reasons that many others have pointed out before me this movie was horrible i could only apologize to my girlfriend for making her watch it with me because i was so exited about it after watching infernal affairs firstly on the film on its own its horrible gratuitous unclassy and just plain bad i was bored throughout the first 1 3 of the movie though DiCaprio did a decent job i do not think any other character was played very well Nicholson does a poor job portraying a mob boss and comes off more of a schizophrenic crack junkie than the leader of an organized crime syndicate Alec Baldwin s character was neither funny nor appropriate for the movie and i believe mark walbergs character is completely unnecessary except to come back and kill Matt Damon in the end which i think is a poor change to the story line the ending was also excessive and except the the change in storyline that was looking at the movie without comparing it to IA IA is just executed much better with more class and more intelligently watch it instead of this Hollywood trash this movie definitely has scorsese s mark but it does not fit the theme and tone of the movie and the story watch IA ditch the departed,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1643411/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2007,Scorsese Oscar Just Cumulative?,When you combine A List Hollywood draw a proved storyline and an Academy Award winning director Normally the answer would be an instant classic Unfortunately Martin Scorsese s latest venture The Departed seems to only be departing with his reputation The premise was impressive put Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson Matt Damon Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen and other top stars together with a dramatic and thrilling plot Somewhere though the film departed with it s dignity Based on the Hong Kong movie WuJianDao the story follows two men from opposite sides of the law who are undercover within both the Massachusetts State Police and the Irish mafia but violence and bloodshed boil when discoveries are made and the moles are dispatched to find out their enemy s identities Scorsese fans will adore the cinematography Nicholson and DiCaprio give stellar performances The actors perform exceptionally well despite the often stereotypical race and locality jokes and Scorsese s strange insistence on emphasizing the distinct dialect of the Boston area Viewers in the northeast will feel appeased by the dialect however it is more likely that the typical viewer will simply find the trait comedic The film begins with a crawl intertwining the stories of Frances Costello Nicholson the Irish mafia kingpin Billy Costigan an undercover mole for the State Police and Collin Sullivan Damon also a State trooper but with a decidedly more checkered lifestyle As the three cross paths at first unknowingly then finding themselves more and more deeply involved with each other s lives the suspense and drama builds to explosive levels The films promise seeks to force its way out despite its drawbacks Scorsese delivers to his fans the expected cinematic artistry but somewhere between production and presentation things went horribly wrong The films soundtrack is choppy though utilizing his trademark rock score the songs lack the appropriate fade in and out of the scenes that they are supposed to solidify The drastic changes break the bond between the film and the audience a decidedly non Scorsese trait Thelma Shoomaker Scorsese s film editor for most of his career seems to be losing her touch Not only were the score cuts distracting but shoddy editing also encumbered what should have been incredible action scenes Explosions were improperly cut once freezing mid shot and completely ruining the effect What do you get when you combine a proved storyline Academy Award winning Directing and a stellar cast You get the potential for a mega hit along the lines of Aviator but like the Spruce Goose The Departed just couldn t take flight See you in 2008 Mr Scorsese,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1702579/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,great if you haven't seen Infernal Affairs,I was a skeptic I saw Infernal Affairs for the first time a few months ago and thought it was an excellent movie One of the best Asian flicks i ve seen and i ve seen a lot of them I thought great another American remake There was a small glimmer of hope It s Scorsese after all I waited great rotten tomatoes rating Great IMDb rating Was this the comeback of American cinema I was excited It was what a wanted A great story great actors well more on that later and a great great director who understood the genre Well apparently my guess is everyone that raved about this movie hasn t seen Infernal Affairs This film in no way lives up to the original I think if you haven t seen the original you would probably think this is the greatest film ever The story is that clever and Scorsese is that good Unfortunately it ALMOST all ways not all almost all the Chinese movie betters this one You would have thought Scorsese learned after Gangs of New York that Leo does not make a good tough guy Guess not I hope Leo plays to his strengths and take roles more similar to Catch Me if You Can or the Aviator Martin Sheen s character is no where near as prominent as the Chinese flick and in the end as great as Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio are they do not have the coolness factor that Andy Lau and Tony Leung brought There were some correction of plot holes that were re written to make more sense but in general the plot changes were no good Some scenes were done different to the original but some scenes were done shot by shot Unfortunately even these copies scenes didn t deliver as powerfully as Infernal Affairs Infernal Affairs had such a great coolness factor to it And the chase action scenes were executed in a way that built up WAY more suspense than The Departed All that said still a decent movie But seriously if you ve seen Infernal Affairs don t expect this to live up to the hype it s been getting If you haven t seen Infernal Affairs I ll leave you with two options 1 You are OK with watching non Hollywood films and don t mind reading subtitles By all means grab the Infernal Affairs DVD and watch this 2 You hate reading subtitles and dislike non Hollywood films Watch The Departed and enjoy it It is good but i fear only because the original story was good,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492960/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2008,I retract my previous statement,I had previously said this movie was a modernized version of Goodfellas but upon viewing it again I realize I was mistaken This movie is completely original from Goodfellas except for the fact that its a street film like Goodfellas This movie was very well written and every little detail comes into play one way or another Leonardo DiCaprio is actually pretty low on my Actors list but he actually pulled this movie off quite well Matt Damon showed us a different character than the Jason Bourne we are all used to seeing him as They make a very good pair of characters very similar but different as well Jack Nicholson proves to us he is still a great actor after all these years He was very good as Costello and was able to be convincing insane and memorable all at the same time much like he was as McMurphy in One Flew Over The Cuckoo s Nest 31 years before Mark Wahlberg was great as the sarcastic aggressive angry smart mouthed Sgt Dignam the part seems to fit his acting skills perfectly Martin Sheen also proves he can still play great parts as the smart peace keeper Capt Queenan With a great cast they need a great story to work with which is just what they get here A great story Add a great sound mix and camera work and you have the best movie of 2006 I recommend this movie to action and gang movie fans you will not be disappointed in any way 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1834965/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2006,All this and treachery too...gangsterism on a grand scale...,Just as THE GANGS OF NEW YORK created a stir of Oscar talk this time it looks like a sure bet that LEONARDO DiCAPRIO JACK NICHOLSON and MARK WAHLBERG will at least be nominated for Oscars in whatever category lead or support the Academy decides I didn t think MATT DAMON s performance was on the same level as the others but there were also some fine supporting jobs by MARTIN SHEEN ALEC BALDWIN and others in the large cast A story of the Irish Mafia vs the Boston police force it teems with violent episodes and each scene has a tense undercurrent where you know some kind of volatile payoff is about to happen You can almost choke on the intensity in some of the vivid scenes between Nicholson and DiCaprio as they eyeball each other exploring what s going on in the other s mind as they play out their dangerous cat and mouse assignments DiCaprio is a mole assigned by Sheen and Wahlberg to do undercover work for the cops Damon is Nicholson s top man assigned to find out who the mole is All of the intensity is fully charged from the opening scenes with Nicholson visiting the local deli and lending his menacing presence to even the simplest scene Every bit of suspense possible is wrung from a very effective screenplay that includes treachery and murder on a grand scale By the time we arrive at the point where Damon finds out who the mole is the suspense is tripled and there s a final orgy of a shootout that brings the film to a bloody climax Definitely not a film for the queasy or faint of heart A huskier looking LEONARDO DiCAPRIO proves he has much more than boyish charm and good looks He s matured as an actor and delivers a tremendously moving performance holding his own against such heavyweights as JACK NICHOLSON and MARTIN SHEEN Summing up A masterpiece of its kind thoroughly absorbing all the way through destined to reap plenty of Oscar nominations and who knows maybe even a win or two Absolutely ranks among the top American gangster films,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1523152/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Homophobic,The movie was pretty good except for the excessive use of fag and faggot I am sure the Irish in Boston say it all the time but really Martin do you think it was a little overkill I guess what was more disturbing was when the audience laughed not once but every time The accents were very inconsistent more of a distraction than anything else Jack Nicholson did an amazing job as always is expected but the only truly convincing accent came from Martin Sheen Beware that there is some rather realistic gun violence The blood spattering is very graphic and sometimes jolting Mr Scorsese sorry but this definitely wasn t one of your better films Maybe you have already done your best work Too bad because I used to be a big fan Hopefully you next film will work up to something memorable,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491947/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2006,Unfixable ?,The editing is off right from the start in my opinion We don t know who anybody is or how they got there only that they re all supposed to be Irish and have a Boston accent Thelma Schoonmaker can t fix that error in the script There is no tempo to the film DiCaprio is good very good but you keep wishing the film he were in was equal to his role The music is literally unoriginal and pointless Anyone who says this is Marty Scorsese s best film and adds that welcome back crap doesn t know what they re saying He isn t back he s in deep hibernation I heard better dialog in M Squad thirty years ago Nothing gets personal Pirates of the Caribbean is a better film So be prepared This is a disappointment except for DiCaprio,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1525288/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2006,Sets new standers in the crime drama history.,This movie put new standers in motion picture crime drama I would be surprised if this movie won three golden globe awards You haven t seen a crime flick nothing yet until you see the departed Martin Scorsese does it once again for his filming career All of theses actors in this film are at there best including DiCaprio Damon and Walberg Jack Nicolson is once again doing hes best at Playing the creepy crime lord that will do anything to get what he wants I m not going to give anything away about this film but the ending is great This film is intended only for people who are definitely eighteen years or older This film I highly recommend,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1545384/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2008,"A brilliant, engrossing crime drama",I don t want to be a product of my environment I want my environment to be a product of me So starts The Departed one of this decade s finest movies The above quote is spoken by Frank Costello Jack Nicholson the ruthless unpredictable leader of the Irish mob that terrorizes South Boston He is the most wanted criminal by the Massachusetts State Police a k a the Staties A young cop with a shady background named Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio has been recruited by Captain Queenan Martin Sheen and Staff Sergeant Dignam Mark Wahlberg to infiltrate Costello s ranks Little do the police know that Costello has already inserted his own informant Colin Sullivan Matt Damon into the police department Even from the first two lines the film manages to capture the audience s attention and hold it for over two and a half hours Armed with one of the wittiest most unique scripts in years and an amazingly talented A list cast director Martin Scorsese finally returns to what he does best gritty noir like films about the merciless uncompromising world of organized crime Filled with almost painfully realistic violence and more profanity than I ever thought possible The Departed portrays the stresses and dangers of undercover life with pitch perfect realism while managing to retain elements of touching and heartfelt drama The characters are all well developed and three dimensional even though they have their flaws viewers come to really care about their triumphs and failures Especially upon multiple viewings it is possible to detect a sophistication and intricacy in The Departed that is absent in the majority of crime dramas This is not a film for the sensitive or casual viewer and the intense plot of loyalty betrayal and deceit has the complexity of a Shakespearean tragedy In short The Departed is a must see film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1976192/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2006,This movies is worse than awful,I love movies all kinds of movies but I have to say this would have to be the very worst movie I have seen for quite some time Apart from the abusive language the amount people being shot with supposed brains being sprayed on the walls was totally unwarranted No wonder we have violence in the streets of cities and suburbs Martin Scorcese should be ashamed to be making films such as these and the stars in this movie should hold themselves accountable I am telling everyone I know not to see this movie and my friend I went with is doing the same I work in the advertising industry and have friends who also work in the media industry and I am spreading the word not to patronize this movie I hope for everyones sake it doesn t make money so to encourage directors not to continue to make these types of films,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1508262/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2007,Amazing Film--Stays With You Long After It's Over!,OK so I m one of those people who likes indie films and usually roots for them at the Oscars and so on I watched Babel a few weeks ago and that movie is REALLY GOOD and I laughed so hard at Little Miss Sunshine I think I peed myself a little don t get me wrong but there is something about The Departed that makes it basically a perfect movie Obviously the acting is perfect so I won t waste your time on that Why should you see this movie Because of the incredible directing by Scorcese who is not usually a favourite of mine I ll get back to this in a moment and the characters that form from both the actors and the writing So the movie is about NOT REALLY A SPOILER but if you know nothing about the plot and don t want to stop here a cop who spies for the local gang lord and a cop who is undercover in the gang lord s ring But here s the thing and if someone has already pointed this out I apologize for the repeat and it s totally brilliant they are basically the same character They re from the same background same age roughly same characteristics They are two sides of the same coin And what makes it better is one leads a life of seemingly happiness while the other just can t seem to win To me that s what makes this movie so incredibly GREAT And Scorcese directs this aspect of the film so perfectly I just can t explain it It s just perfect Props to Monaghan and the original Hong Kong writers for doing this so well And the thing I love about this is that as far as I can tell it s really meant to be more of a gangster or action film or that seems as though it was the original intent but instead this jewel emerges and it s not about gunshots and running through dark alleys drugs strippers and whores but about these two men and their lives in this brief intersection INCREDIBLE MOVIE SHOULD BE SEEN BY EVERYONE,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1600606/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2006,Frustratingly enjoyable,A frustratingly enjoyable movie it ALMOST gets there It s got more emotional guts nakedness than Scorsese usually allows these days but those guts are isolated in DiCaprio and Vera Farmiga s performances Nicholson isn t out of control exactly he s just a symptom of Scorsese s tonal problems he s playing vaudeville while DiCaprio plays psychodrama and Farmiga and Matt Damon are playing repression Except unlike Farmiga Damon can t or doesn t suggest the complexity of what s going on under that repression I liked how the excitement techniques were embedded in a relatively intimate character based approach where Goodfellas say is ALL direction But as a result when things blow up at the end it feels pretty cheap and I say fooey on the jokey final shot One more thing the street language is almost as automatic a mannerism as the Rolling Stones over tracking shot business The homophobic stuff is put to use in terms of the themes of masculinity and role playing but the racist s is really getting old,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1555573/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2009,Outstanding,The Departed is a 2006 Martin Scorcese film based on a film out of Hong Kong Infernal Affairs I haven t seen the latter and from reading I can see that some people liked that film more some less I only know that I loved this movie the script the performances and the directing style were all excellent The Departed is about two men who are leading parallel lives One Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio is a graduate of the police academy and connected from the old neighborhood is sent undercover to infiltrate the organization of Costello Jack Nicholson Another graduate Colin Matt Damon working with the special investigations unit is a mob informant Their lives connect via the police psychiatrist Vera Farmiga who becomes involved with DiCaprio though she s living with Damon Nicholson is desperate to know who his mole is and puts pressure on Damon Special Investigations knows they have an informant and want to catch him The situation becomes more and more tense The cast is superb besides di Caprio Damon and Nicholson Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin play the top men in the special investigations unit Scorcese does a masterful job with this film cutting back and forth between the two men in the hands of a less expert director this might be confusing but in his hands it s not He also builds the suspense and tension very well Di Caprio is sensational as a hot tempered stressed out cop who more and more is in danger of being found out Damon is excellent as the charming collected Colin who as he continues to move up in his department comes closer to finding out the identity of Costello s mole Martin Scorcese is no stranger to violence and there s plenty of it to be had in The Departed It s not everyone s cup of tea but it s very strong While I might argue with a few plot flaws they didn t detract from me being totally absorbed in this film,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2096639/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,Best Picture of 2006,Matin Scorsese does it again in The Departed Like his previous hits Goodfellas and Casino he takes movie making to the next level and when you don t think it could go any higher he takes you there The Departed is an intriguing story that revolves around Jack Nicholson s Frank Costello an Irish mafia boss He befriends Matt Damon s character Colin Sullivan who eventually becomes a Massachusets State Police officer Frank uses Colin to make sure his deals run smooth On the other side of the law Leo DiCaprio s character Billy Costigan goes undercover for the State Police and takes orders from Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg 2 hours of great film making ensues I previously had thought that V For Vendetta would be a front runner for Best Picture but after seeing this film there s no way I can see it win Scorsese deserves a Best Director and Best Picture award while everyone else in the film especially Leo DiCaprio deserve huge amounts of attention for their acting The story is fresh intriguing and it keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing Finally when you think you have it all figured out you realize just how wrong you are This film should and will go down in history,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493738/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2006,Nothing new for those who loved the original,I went into this with very high expectations 50 on the IMDb top 250 92 fresh on rottentomatoes I was disappointed but I set myself up for it It s a good movie but after seeing this I m starting to believe that a lot of the 10s from IDMb voters did in fact come from those that hadn t seen Infernal Affairs I m not going to come out and say Infernal Affairs is a better movie When you add up all the elements of both films The Departed is the superior piece of film making What disappointed me though was that Scorcese really didn t take it to the dizzying heights I would ve expected after such a positive reaction from almost everyone that had seen it Probably every aspect is improved upon in terms of the production process with the exception of editing I thought some of the earlier scenes about their childhoods were unnecessary and failed to add anything really substantial to the structure of the original and that s perhaps my complaint for the whole movie By the end I felt like I d just watched Infernal Affairs all over again What was good didn t really change What was bad was changed but not in such a way that it made any dramatic impact The romance subplot for instance was equally as dull as it had been in the original There wasn t much chemistry between the psychiatrist and the two leads it was done well enough to make a point about the two of them but not well enough to really move me The acting was fine believable occasionally there d be something that d make me draw breath from Jack Nicholas and Leonardo DiCaprio But most of the time nothing more I guess what I m trying to say is this had I never seen Infernal Affairs The Departed would have been nothing short of spectacular But I had And what I got was a very competent remake from the master that didn t take the story or characters to any dramatic new depths What ultimately kept my attention wasn t anything different that Scorcese did but the same tense game of cat and mouse that was lifted straight of the original Honestly I wanted to sing this movie praises but all I can really do is clap and say well done,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1499225/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2006,Finally!,Finally Martin Scorsese returns to the gritty underworld of crime in the United States After Casino he left it for whatever reason and made a few bombs followed by Gangs of New York and The Aviator One could say that after so many years away from the crime underworld over 10 Scorsese could have lost his touch This is just not so The camera flies around just like in Goodfellas and keeps us on the edge of our seat for the two and a half hour run time The violence Scorsese s trademark for so many years is kept in check by the director up until the bloody end and that s not a British ism it s quite gruesome at the end Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are superb as the rat of Frank Costello Jack Nicholson and the rat of the Boston PD inside Costello s crew respectively The plot is simple but through his mastery of the camera Scorsese keeps us interested and engaged William Monahan s script is simple but relatively well done this is only his second produced screenplay his first was Kingdom of Heaven The supporting cast is excellent Martin Sheen plays a high ranking official in the Boston PD Mark Whalberg plays his slight subordinate Whalberg s Dingam is a real prick but ultimately a hero kind of Alec Baldwin plays the head of the Special Investigations Unit who s tracking Costello Costello s mole is within the Unit Scorsese has brought us back to the American crime underworld and it is a journey that makes us realize films like these are why we go to the movies in the first place,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1519566/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2006,Awful,If you have seen the original this film is awful in comparison Read any of the reviews by people that have seen it The average rating among them is probably 4 5 not 8 6 Its a shame more people haven t seen the original To quickly sum up 1 The characters are weak compared to the original apart from Sam 2 Infernal Affairs the Original is like Heat but shorter This is a poor remake just like all the Hollywood remakes have been Infernal Affairs is miles better and this is from someone that hardly ever watches foreign movies because I can t be bothered reading subtitles,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1500801/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2006,10 SERIOUS PLOT HOLES - #52 of all time? Not quite ----> spoilers,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1508200/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2007,Martin screwed up,The Departed a movie by one of the best directors in the world the one of great milestones of film history such as Taxi Driver Good Fellas Cape Fear Casino etc So must be something worth you think Sorry to tell you not at all The movie is interesting about movie language meaning an editing very intense which wants you not to elaborate what you see but tries to make you absorb it without thinking which is definitely an important choice something not easy to realize something only a great director can do if he has the best professional people around him As it often happens when you try to build the pathos in such a way you may loose the reality That s what happens to the movie to say the lesser problem of it So we have here a team of policemen who for doing their daily job of fighting the crime keep on treating each other very badly to use an euphemism keep on insulting each other and on punching each other every time there s a decision to be taken Imagine if you should work in such a way in your office if you should punch your colleague every time he has a different opinion from yours And this is just for the beginning Later in the most dramatic moments of the movie you will hear the audience laughing That s the best critic to a movie you can have When you can t trust trailers and advertising of course when you can t trust interviews reviews box office result Academy nominations and eventually awards best signatures of the world Than you have the only review everyone HAS to believe the reaction of the audience If they laugh when they should be shaking on their armchair that means something is wrong something doesn t work We saw something like that in The war of worlds by another promising director named Steven Spielberg An explanation for that may be that Hollywood has to make movies If the script is good or not if it s a serious operation or not there s a budget to be spent soon and they have to make the movie In such cases the hope is that maybe during the shooting the right idea will come out to solve that problem of the script Well this time the right idea didn t come out And you ll find it out with surprise The movie has some qualities as I said We have some good acting performances especially from Matt Damon able even to show when he is lying and in this I recognize the acting directions from Scorsese Than we have Leonardo Di Caprio who in order to get rid of his good boy face has to tense all single muscles of his face in every scene Mr Scorsese may be running for 10 Oscars he may have sold for 200 millions but together with the audience we can say Martin this time you screwed up,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1596260/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2007,Never again,From time to time I watch a movie because I trust the good reviews and also because I think I should watch not always the same kind of movies Usually I avoid violent movies What shall I say That I was wrong to trust the good reviews That I have no idea what is going on in the world If anything what was portrayed in this movie is going on in the real world we are really doomed I thought the Iraq disaster was bad enough But obviously the members of police departments are a bunch of corrupt constantly swearing murdering thugs every citizen should avoid to have any contact with Commenter before me have pointed out the many improbably scenarios But if any of this should be based on real events I will look as quickly as possible to emigrate to another country,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1600396/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2006,Another great from Scorcese,A great movie I thought that picked up pace more towards the end of the film The acting particularly from Dicaprio was great in particular the scene where he meets the shrink and the moments he tries convincing Costello that he is not a mole Jack Nicholson played his character fairly convincingly Despite not having the same menacing demeanour that Pauli s character portrayed in Goodfellas Costello did look very much like the should be retired rough and mean looking gangster in his own laid back way I should have guessed Mark Wahlberg s character was still out there at large He had a big mouth in the film and played the annoying and to some extent a crooked cop well I totally did not see the ending coming the twists in the end did not match my guesses but were a welcome shock in the end Another great film from Scorcese although Goodfellas still keeps this one in the shadows,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1517564/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2007,"Cool,Marty Back To Gangs Style Again",This is the movie that is a remake of an hong Kong movie named Internall affairs but hey guys hold on about it something s really going on Stoyline after making worthless pictures like bringing out the dead aviator gangs of New York Martin Scorsese return s to gangs all over again as good as it gets story of Colin Sullivan Matt Damon A Student of police academy Who s being the top est chosen as on of the special operation officer despite his other classmate Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio which didn t become a top cop and now his going to be in a very sensitive position because he s about to enter in Frank Costello s Jack Nicholson gang organization as a cop despite that department doesn t know that Colin is Frank s inside man in the force Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen is the head chief of force whit his right hand assistant Dignam Mark Wahlberg trying to catch Costello s gang organization but before the sent billy in the stage they did nt have the clear evidence among all there s the sweet Madolyn Vera Farmiga that falls in love with Colin But as a doctor once she faces Billy as her patient and after a weird fight they get familiar with each other fall in love though it s hard for her to chose between the honest man tricky one billy s stock in a lot of problems he should pass frank s ARE YOU STILL A COP test facing Mr French Ray Winstone who s Frank s trusted tough guy will billy succeed in his job Superb performances by whole cast great direction by Scorsese in every sequence great screenplay by William Monahan great original music by Howard Shore which has done a good job in Lord of the Ring series before Leonardo DiCaprio proves that he s not the heart burner doll face punk again he is coming to show his act ability as a man in 10000 problems he is in his most powerful acting time now by today after i saw blood diamond i should confess i am starting to hope for Leonardo he can do many roles better and greater than he did during 90s the stunning Jack Nicholson is all over back again he acts as powerful scary funny Frank Costello after performing in several comedies like Anger Management Something s Gotta Give Jacky s back in a right role of head mafia man who treated Colin as an inside man in police fore department in Boston city and he uses his cooperating in order to his own benefit although he s around 70 he is still dating girls and enjoys the gang life of his own i think Nicholson s role deserved an Oscar nomination but they didn t give any Matt Damon shoe brilliant performance as well as tricky Collin who shows his real face at the end has an un real affair with Madolyn he is the best after his role in famous film Good Will Haunting Martin Scorsese is directing Departed after making historical dramas like Aviator Gangs of New York thats the genre he s the master of it considering Casino Goodfellas Taxi Driver Cape Fear Dparted is on his master full pictures that contains bib names all in Scorsese s validity Jack Nicholson Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin i personally think that after making of The Depatred Scorsese should win the Oscar for best directing after 7 times of nomination this is a work of art isn t it then i suppose that Mark Wahlberg is truly great actor he is one of the best actors in present Hollywood he acts as Dignam in a very superb way talking in speedy way mostly insults and the best dialogs of the films is for him great picture 9 out of 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1606526/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2007,The ugly side of competition: one stab in the back produces another,Some people just want to relate to others as human beings Others want their place in the hierarchy of power DiCaprio plays the former while Nicholson plays the latter There are no winners in these bleak lives but there are plenty of rats in the race With his fine sense of music Scorsese continues to place the right songs in the most appropriate places in The Departed With the Stones Gimme Shelter in the background he introduces his king rat Costello and as Jack gives his audience his best seductive smile the lyrical aftermath of Sympathy for the Devil can almost be heard to begin its refrain in your brain It s those kinds of touches which make The Departed an excellent film a film where every cop s a criminal and all the sinners saints As heads is tails just call Jack Lucifer as I believe this film explains But what would Lucifer be without his collaborators Nothing He needs them for his power and they need him in order to taste and smell same They kneel and he arbitrarily and capriciously dispenses death This is not a nice movie about nice people It is a kind of immoralty play where love is always taking a back seat to death In this sense The Departed continues Scorsese s fine tradition of exposing the criminal mind and milieu which began with Mean Streets,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1690868/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2006,Best movie of the year,The very beginning of The Departed struck me as very similar to GoodFellas It begins with a boy telling of his first experiences with the mob The locale even seemed the same There are other instances in the movie where Scorsese seems to allude back to GoodFellas a movie many consider to be one of his masterpieces but in my opinion I think The Departed is all its own and even exceeds GoodFellas in quality and profundity And besides that it s also incredibly entertaining The movie has been advertised as a thriller and it succeeds at that very well Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan a cop assigned to not be a cop ever again instead he will be a plant in Frank Costello s Jack Nicholson outfit Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan a cop who works on the side for Costello who entrusts him with the job of finding the mole in his gang Scorsese weaves an intricate tapestry of deceit and mistrust with bloody and jarring violence mixed with intense scenes where the various disguises are on the verge of being uncovered It s a very entertaining tapestry nothing is for sure and while that could have been frustrating Scorsese involves you so much in the characters that you understand that when you re wondering if Billy or Colin is lying they re wondering the same thing Exploring themes like family and identity and loyalty is not new hat for Scorsese He contemplated the same ideas in GoodFellas with his depiction of the life of a mafia man But in The Departed he takes it a step farther and asks the question of what happens when you lose that identity and pretend to be someone you re not This opens up opportunities to discover what happens to the characters relationships in these circumstances Scorsese was blessed with an amazing cast to help him in this task Leonardo Dicaprio gave an amazing performance two years ago in The Aviator and while I think that may be his better performance there s no denying the power and truth in his desperately soul searching undercover cop He deserves another Oscar nomination for this but he probably won t get it because Jack Nicholson is getting most of the notice not all of it good for his performance Some critics are complaining that Nicholson went over the top I don t think so at all Everything he did was appropriate as the ultimate kingpin of the Boston mob because his character can get away with anything and knows it Matt Damon has the least to do of the three of them but Damon is a good actor and is no less than that here Vera Farmiga has a good stint as Damon s love interest and Dicaprio s shrink the lack of identity for both Damon s and Dicaprio s characters has a tasking effect on her and she holds her own against the two men There s no doubt in my mind that this is the best movie of the year It has by far the best ending to a Scorsese movie out of the three I ve seen The profundity and inevitability of the last few scenes is perfect If only the Academy would agree The only true contenders against it so far for the Oscar are Babel not as complete as this one and The Queen which isn t as big or brawny as The Departed Besides Scorsese has been ignored for far too long This would be a very appropriate time for him to win and with this movie he would deserve it But Oscars aside I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates thrilling stories with meaning behind them Those kinds of movies are few and far between so grab onto this one and keep hold of it while it lasts,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1538045/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2018,A Modern Film Noir: Scorsese's Best Film with the Most Intricate Plot,Martin Scorsese has been on the cutting edge of filmmaking since the late 1960 s Prior to The Departed the legendary director s films had been recognized with 59 Oscar nominations and about 11 wins He had been nominated five times for Best Director with an equal number nominated for Best Picture without winning prior to The Departed notable Raging Bull and Goodfellas His actors have faired better with wins for Robert De Niro Best Actor Raging Bull Joe Pesci Best Supporting Actor Goodfellas and Paul Newman Best Actor The Color of Money He needed a film to hit it out of the ballpark and The Departed was it It is unquestionably Scorsese s best film and will go down as a masterpiece of crime cinema The plot probably the most intricate in a crime drama film since Pulp Fiction is based on a Hong Kong film called Infernal Affairs which references Hell in Buddhist theology William Monahan adapted the original Chinese screenplay by Alan Mak and Felix Chong The story concerns two young Bostonians who have infiltrated the opposing sides of the wars between the Massachusetts state police and a crime syndicate run by a godfather type Frank Costello Jack Nicholson in an academy award caliber performance The two infiltrators are in fact double agents Matt Damon plays the clean cut Colin Sullivan who elevates from lower eastside broken home to being an high ranking detective in the state police Unbeknownst to his colleagues his real loyalty is with Costello his dad the name he often uses when he s in contact with Costello On the other side also from humble beginnings is Billy Leonardo DiCaprio son of an airport luggage handler who also had ties to the mob He has tried with mixed reviews also to become a Boston cop His superiors played by Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg don t believe he s police material but instead decide he s perfect as a mole to infiltrate Costello s mob Interestingly Sullivan easily works up the ranks with his steady demeanor while Billy is distrusted on all sides and must prove himself The authorities want information about a computer chip heist not the kind of computer chips you purchase at Fry s but one s which are not exactly publically available These chips are mounted into computers aboard ICBM s Another mob a Chinese terrorist syndicate desire to purchase the chips so they can blow up cities in the far east The question becomes will diCaprio as a double agent be able to tip off the authorities before the transaction can be completed Or will Matt Damon tip off the mob in time to get away with the heist and sale A brilliant and compelling film from start to finish Superb performances by all involved Only Wahlberg was nominated for best supporting actor although all the leads could have been easily been nominated for their performances Alan Arkin won best supporting actor for a far less interesting film Little Miss Sunshine In my opinion DiCaprio s performance is one of the best of his career Scorsese finally won Best Director and the film won Best Picture These were not sympathy awards for Scorsese giving them to him for his career He and his film won because it s one helluva a great film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4207432/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2006,Scorsese's Best Directing Oscar... Finally...,This was an intense off the edge of your seat runaway train of pure excitement about two police officers one molded by the Irish mob Damon to be an inside probe in the police department and the other was molded by the police department DiCaprio to be an undercover in the same Irish mob The Irish mob was led by the extraordinary Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances since As Good As It Gets Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon both give great performances as the stressed out under appreciated police officers playing opposite sides of the law and trying to do their jobs to satisfy the powers that be However it was Scorcese s directing that brought this complex piece about the philosophies behind modern crime the law and police corruption that takes this piece to the next level This has to be his best work since Goodfellas and I m hoping that he receives a long overdue Academy Award for Best Director The only reason why the film doesn t get a ten from me is because I had issues with the ending I won t give it away However in my humble opinion it was too easy for the characters played by Damon DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg and it s contrivance eerily reflects the assumed angst by the writers to end a screenplay to a magnificently crafted complex story I m sure the original film was the same way so I m critiquing the filmmakers behind Infernal Affairs for this as well Nevertheless it s still the best film I had seen all year thus far,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492800/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2007,Entertaining and well-acted... but definitely over-rated.,First of all best Scorsese film Please forget Taxi Driver Raging Bull or Goodfellas even Gangs of New York had more passion class and originality Scorsese just used all of his old violence shots and visual tricks once again and somehow the Academy suddenly rubbed their eyes and said Oh we ve overlooked the guy for so long Come child here s candy I m not actually dissing the movie though It s got a smart plot although that s influenced by the classic Hong Kong film It s got thrilling action sequences moments of sheer suspense and a very entertaining ending with well crafted plot twists The original score is just plain awesome The allover acting is top notch Leo DiCaprio does a very convincing job while Matt Damon s performance is somehow a bit flat Jack Nicholson is damn charismatic as usual Among the supporting roles by Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg it s Mark who steals the show with his impulsive and ever sarcastic persona Then why is the film so far from being perfect The storycrafting and the screenplay of course The characters are well pretty one dimensional shown in black or white especially Colin Sullivan Even Dicaprio s character just whines about his job but that s all The supporting characters except Dignam in the end fail to add enough substantiality to the story The story itself moves unrealistically fast thereby leaving the audience completely fooled by its occasional flashes of action sequences The dialogues oh god what can I say Using the word fuck in every line more than once neither makes the screenplay a classic nor makes it realistic To summarise The Departed is violent smart well acted and also a well directed thriller But it s definitely not more Oscar worthy than Scorsese s other classic works for one simple reason it s not quite original It offers nothing new And that s that,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1662486/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2021,The Second Best Scorsese Film of all Time!,Considering the overwhelmingly positive critical as well as laymen reviews this movie has garnered over the years it would certainly be an understatement to content that this movie solidified the quality of Scorsese as a promising and exceptionally talented director to such an extent that it earned him his long awaited Academy Award for Best Direction This movie also turned out to be the only Scorsese film to ever earn an Academy Award for Best Picture This movie is certainly my second favorite Scorsese film of all time behind Goodfellas at 1 This is undeniably one of the best movies of the century so far This movie has it all From top notch acting to a complicated and tricky plot involving dilemmas of the protagonist as well as the antagonist and spectacular action sequences to notoriously brutal violence This movie perfectly encompasses everything that is expected of a Scorsese film Certainly deserves a 10 10 rating from me,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6831491/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2006,Best film this year,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1504296/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2020,Worse than the source material.,I have seen the departed once before and two days ago I watcher infernal affairs I wanted to compare this to it s source material I would watch infernal affairs again before I watch the departed There are lots of scenes in this movie that are only in it because they are in infernal affairs these scenes feel out of place I think since infernal affairs is such a choppy fast paced movie and Scorsese s movie is a more slower paced so the choppy editing doesn t work as well The editing is only trying to imitate infernal affairs when scenes from Andrew Lau and Alan Mak s film are re created the rest of the filming and editing is very Scorsese and the two styles do not mix well Another technical issue is the sound mixing the music and gunshots were way too loud compared to the at times almost inaudible dialogue I had to keep turning the volume up and down The acting is great this is my favourite Matt Damon performance and Leo was also good all of the supporting cast is good as well and Jack Nicholson is cast perfectly Even though Vera Farmiga s performance was good enough he character Madolyn was bad she is a very unprofessional therapist and talk about her other clients with Billy a client she is also rattled by his insults and assumptions about her which a therapist would never do having people comment about them like that isn t uncommon She also has some of the worst lines Martin Scorsese has ever written and honestly so does this film The writing in the departed is genuinely awful at times the insults get old pretty quickly and the dialogue between Madolyn and everyone is very bad Some scenes I couldn t help but laugh at what was coming out of her mouth My favourite thing about infernal affairs was the score and use of leitmotifs A film score doesn t need to be complicated to be good but using leitmotif is only surface level stuff for a decent composer Howard shore one of the greatest composers ever scored this film I can t even wrap my head around that to be honest he went from only a few years before this came out creating one of the best scores ever composed the lord of the rings which has one of the most innovative and impressive use of leitmotifs in film history I liked the departed but I won t be watching it again anytime soon Infernal affairs is a better movie you should definitely check out,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6112297/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2009,The Departed A New American Crime Classic,Martin Scorsese s The Departed is a new American crime classic brought to life by an all star cast including Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Ray Winstone Vera Farminga and Alec Baldwin The movie is about Billy Costigan played perfectly with intensity and vulnerability by DiCaprio a rookie cop who goes undercover to help his detective handlers played by Sheen and Wahlberg in great supporting roles bring down mob boss Frank Costello played to a tee with menace by Nicholson His character provides some of the comic relief which balances well between the drama suspense and action Meanwhile SIU officer Colin Sullivan played effectively by Damon in a rare villain role has everyone trusts who is actually Costello s mole Vera Farminga also does a good job with the supporting role of Sullivan s girlfriend and Costigan s secret lover Madolyn and Ray Winstone is fantastic as Mr French who is Costello s right hand man From the great actors who all brought their A game to the story to the Boston setting and Scorsese s direction of where he wanted to take this film is masterfully done The film did feel a bit long at the end with a running time of 151 minutes but it s a minor flaw in what is a great crime film brought to the big screen The film does have some strong brutal violence strong language and sexual content so adults may want to think about watching this movie with their children Other then that The Departed is a terrific film with some twists turns and surprises that make for an enjoyable film to watch So if you re a fan of crime films Scorsese or any of the actors in it then chances are you ll really like this film Go see it You won t be disappointed,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2067165/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2007,"If this movie is better than Goodfellas, barely",Man after seeing this three months ago i thought to myself that the man is finishing what he came up to do in this world and this is getting pretty pathetic because the crap is hitting the fan pretty hard First off this could be the most shallow film he has ever done The only thing that could come up with a certain sense of depth is the notion of identity But the movie itself is a train wreck it is horribly clich d of every crime movie on the face of this earth since Scarface by H Hawks and it only seems that Scorsese cannot reinvent himself in the noir or the neo noir genre Goodfellas was one thousand times as better than this film in content and aesthetic But in the mob genre Casino is the ultimate leading contender When you think about Scorsese you normally think of three indisputable masterpieces Taxi Driver Raging Bull and Gangs of New York Man The Color of Money was way way better than The Departed When I watched that movie it only made me think of the other Clint Eastwood film that borders the same cinematographic style Mystic River And for another turn of events this Eastwood movie also involves the Boston Irish mob In the other case Mystic River in Eastwood s direction and by the great acting of actors such as S Penn and T Robbins it makes it all worth while It always seem that there is a hint a plagiarism or Scorsese was just uninspired The only thing that I can really suggest is to watch all the movies he did in the past because the man like Coppola is just losing his touch And like Coppola Scorsese doesn t write his scripts anymore for the shooting script And the worst part is that I love Martin Scorsese I simply love everything that he does he is an American Luchino Visconti,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1620955/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2007,"Fantastic tense, complicated, well-acted, dark mob movie",Great movie Scorsese back on familiar footing We are definitely seeing him from his good side here He even uses Gimme Shelter in the soundtrack as he did in Goodfellas If it ain t broke right And he elicits Leo DiCaprio s best performance since well from what I ve heard though I haven t seen it The Basketball Diaries 95 Anyway the movie is a re make of a Hong Kong flick named Wu jian dao 2002 English title Infernal Affairs and one of the screenwriters in the original Siu Fai Mak gets a writing credit in this one too The story is about two moles both undercover one in the mob DiCaprio and one in the police force Damon They come to learn about one another not their specific identities but at least of the existence of one another and they become gradually more intent on exposing the identity of the other knowing that their identity might soon be revealed It is a fantastic movie nicely nuanced and appropriately complex without losing the thrill of the chase Scorsese paces the movie energetically and with enough regard for fleshing out his characters as well Jack Nicholson is fantastic revealing all of the characteristics that have made him so vulnerable to parody in recent years but simultaneously offering those very features which have made him a legend This is a fine performance and he deserves an Oscar nomination as does DiCaprio who playing the young man from the wrong side of the tracks ultimately shows himself to be more upright than Damon excellent as usual s widely respected but ultimately treacherous cop Fantastic supporting turns from Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Ray Winstone and Vera Farmiga as the woman caught between the two moles This film was deservedly placed on many Top Ten lists of the best of the year pictures It is a fantastic movie and stands up to repeated viewings which you will most likely desire in order possibly to trace the machinations of the movie The movie is not that complicated though so you may just want to go to recognize some of the best movie making around,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1569989/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2007,Hollywoods screws up another really good foreign film,The original Infernal affairs is so much better Scorsese took a great movie and turned it into a cuss match and 2 5 hr long sex joke If I hadn t seen Infernal Affairs I m sure I would have thought the movie was great given some of the character developments But since Scorsese started from Infernal Affairs I have to measure his work from there and it is pathetic The scene where Leo and Gwen meet towards the end where he s sitting down outside and she holds him to her stomach is horribly shot At the side angle it looks like his head is at her crotch level at the behind Leo s head angle it looks like his head is at her breast level The two bright spots of the movie for me were Matt Damon playing a prick as it just came natural to boo his character and Mark Wahlberg showing he can take on an asshole role and not some guy in touch with his feminine side as all his other characters seem to be that I ve seen If you re a someone who will never watch a subtitled movie and loves being spoon fed Hollywood crap as well as dick and fart jokes I mean killing and sex jokes this movie is great for you seriously But if you like watching a fresh film rather than its not as great rehash and care more about the story and movie and less about the actors names and don t mind subtitles snag a copy of Infernal Affairs,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1624730/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2020,Good Scorsese Film,The Departed won the big awards and is a very good movie It s action packed and dramatic with an amazing cast that delivers incredible performances Now it s not really the runtime that bothered me but how the runtime was used I felt like the third act and very end of the movie was a little rushed and muddled there were so many plot points to fit in the last 30 minutes that it ended up being chaotic I can t really point out many flaws in this movie Jack Nicholson is just unbelievable and so are the rest of the actors Scorsese deserved the Oscar for this it s just maybe it didn t live up to the hype It s memorable for sure but at the end of the movie I didn t go wow that was an amazing movie,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6390967/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,Brilliant,Everything was perfect about this film except for the girl I can t decide if it was poor casting horrible acting or she just wasn t ready for this caliber film Although her presence wasn t irritating enough for me not to enjoy this movie it really made me question the professional opinion of who looked at her and thought yes she s perfect DiCaprio Wahlberg Damon Nicholson Baldwin gave masterful performances even the supporting cast with the exception of the girl gave applause worthy performance Visually stunning I expected nothing less from Scorscese This film is the epitome of what film making should be and it was long overdue from Hollywood A film that makes you recall that film making is an art form Although there were parts that made me cringe I could respect their necessity and move on because I was thoroughly engaged in the rest of the film I recommend that every true fan of films film student and respecter of fine art go see this movie and if you know Scorscese you know its not for the faint of heart think more Casino Goodfellas Raging Bull Gangs of New York rather than Aviator or anything else he s done,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492185/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2006,An excellent work,The Departed may have roots elsewhere but it translates very well to American cinema The acting is top rate The action well paced and well edited The characters realistically drawn well cast and artfully placed in the sets The suspense is non stop A more gripping movie I cannot remember What s not to like This is a powerful piece of cinema by a director who has created some of America s most memorable films I agree with some others that this addition to his portfolio ought finally win Scorcese the Oscar for Best Film unless between now and Jan 1 there is a blockbuster I don t know about If nothing else it assures him a placesetting at the table for Best American Movie Directors I loved the intensity of the character studies The individual actors live their roles and the entire cast is experienced enough to submerge their egos Nicholson s maniacal sociopathic Costello straddles the line between normalcy fatherhood and family and serial killer as if the only difference is the viewing angle The boss lord the heavy he never allows you to relax when he is on screen and creates tension with every look every gesture He menaces like a pit viper I thought his best performance ever was in the movie Ironweed but comparing his role there and this one is apples and oranges Great acting DiCaprio is absolutely marvelous I hope he is nominated and wins the Academy award for Best Actor for this His previous collaboration with Scorcese in The Aviator didn t receive the acclaim for his portrayal of Howard Hughes I thought it merited He has become a polished and versatile actor and his role as Costigan allows him to show what it must feel like to be caught up in a maze of unknown but constant danger At the same time he is trying to navigate with whatever garbled clues he can find Matt Damon is very good Mark Wahlberg is excellent another actor who has grown significantly in his ability to credibly convey a character His in the face detective could be a caricature in the wrong hands but in his there s a realism It s the realism that underpins the effectiveness of The Departed nothing seems that staged and we re aware that the movie could possibly be cinema verite had the cameras been positioned just so Scorcese s directoral strength may be his ability to bring that realism alive In Casino it sometimes seemed we were behind the closed doors of the action seeing what 99 9 of the public can t The Departed looks feels real Scarily so The rest of the cast is good not quite as effective as the principles perhaps I thought the henchmen for Costella were excellent One of my favorite actors Alex Baldwin was not up to his usual excellence more the role and what it asked of him maybe than his acting in the role He might ve been written a little heavier less good natured more serious and angry less somewhere in the middle Overall the movie rates a 9 5 from me There are a few weaknesses such as the relationship between Costigan and Madolyn which could ve been fleshed out a little more given a little more time together on screen to deepen our sense of what they share this is a case where a few more minutes might ve helped and the movies is such a fun ride no one would notice the time anyway I was literally glued to the screen in a way few movies ever have captured me Do not make the mistake of drinking a lot of water before going to this movie you don t want to miss a minute Definitely a classic,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1510672/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2007,The Departed Should be win,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1590067/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2008,Scorsese is in his prime with The Departed,If there was any doubt about Martin Scorsese s craft as a film director The Departed silences any critic of his However if there was any doubt in the first place I highly suggest quitting movies Scorsese delivers an epic in a time where movies are being churned out with no emotion no connection to the viewer and reliance on gimmicks so the studios can earn a little dough and taking the prized honor of being the number 1 listed movie on a 12 year old kid s myspace page The Departed delivers in every facet The cinematography is well crafted the camera positions to grasp the scene in its fullest while avoiding being generic and also straying away from overly artsy camera angles that make the film unwatchable In fact The Departed is probably Scorsese s most rewatchable film There are more twists than a Chubby Checker concert which will make you both gasp and let out sighs of relief The characters are believable and engaging Jack Nicholson plays one the most accessible of all the mob villains of Scorsese s past He is complete slime but his demeanor is that of an uncle who permits you to watch the TV shows that your parents told you not to Matt Damon as Colin is like one of those pompous pricks who cheat repeatedly and get away with it and Leo as Billy Costigan grows on the viewer and as a character through his dangerous line of work as a police informant The Departed is an American masterpiece,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1889202/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2008,"Another Gory, Raw Scorcese Picture",I m not a fan of Martin Scorcese and I m not really a fan of Gangster movies but my husband really wanted to watch it The acting was great the story was good I ve seen the Chinese movie this was derived from which I also enjoyed The plot is like molasses you get sucked in by the situation Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio and Jack Nicholson have great chemistry and I would like to see them do another movie on a lighter subject There was so many twists and turns that you can t help but get interested All in all a good film the end leaves you shocked and a little confused but all in all a very good film and the nominations were absolutely deserved If your not into gangster movies but enjoy any of the main actors you might want to check it out because the cast is first rate,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1794009/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2006,An instant classic.....,Martin Scorsese creates a masterpiece his skills as a director continue to grow and mature Amazing I enjoyed all of it with the exception of the very last ten seconds before the credits roll I won t kill it for you but I think you ll know what I mean Unless you can t take this particular violent crime story genre this should not be missed on the big screen It s the best film that s been around in a long long time The high power cast is in top form and I think that you ll be hard pressed to remember any film where Matt Damon Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin have been better Leo DiCaprio who is already one of America s great actors hit s a new level of excellence I ve been a huge fan since This Boy s Life Jack Nicholson I m at a loss for words he s so good in this film In thinking of his entire body of work from Easy Rider through to The Departed he s like a fine wine getting better and better as he ages his range of successful roles is just astounding heeeer s Johnny I was hugely surprised by Mark Whalberg who in my opinion turns in the best performance of his career I look forward to seeing more of him in the future Anthony Anderson was a surprise addition and he really contributes a lot in his supporting role Super directing stellar cast well utilized decent storyline excellent sound track great editing and continuity this is the one to spend 8 on,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1505578/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2006,Scorsese Is Back To His Old Form & Gives Us The Best Film Of 2006.,Billy Costigan is an undercover cop who gets thrown into the hands of a notorious gangster Frank Costello Colin Sullivan is a member of Costello s gang who is a mole in the Boston police department Once word gets out that there is a mole in the police department and a rat in Costello s gang things begin to heat up as they try and smoke out the other Infernal Affairs blew me away a couple years ago then I heard that one of my favourite directors was doing a remake I was a little hesitant at first I didn t know if I was going to see old Scorsese Goodfellas Casino or the recent Scorsese Gangs Of New York The Aviator Granted the films under his belt as of late are not horrible in fact they re great they just don t have that old school touch that made Scorsese such a great director With The Departed Scorsese is back to his old form and gives us the best film of 2006 The Departed is full of old school tricks from Scorsese From an Iris Out and that classic Goodfellas feel it makes for an intense thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat With the crop of films this year not being all that great save for a select few The Departed blows them all out of the water It s brutal with it s violence and doesn t hold back on anything DiCaprio and Damon both shine in their roles with DiCaprio having the more intense part and more screen time I only favour DiCaprio a tad more because the scenes with Damon and Farmiga are a tad boring to watch It was a joy to watch both of these characters slowly lose their minds being on both sides of the fence Although they both shine in this film they can t touch the great Nicholson He is absolutely astonishing He owns every scene he is in even when he starts acting like a rat He has this evil presence about him in this film but he plays it with such a comedic tone you can t hate the guy but you can fear him After seeing how great he is in this film I m left wondering why Scorsese and Nicholson haven t worked together before now Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin Vera Farmiga and even Anthony Anderson all blend well together to bring the cast of The Departed full circle Wahlberg stands out in this list he is just as mean and foul mouthed as Nicholson and can actually hold his own with such a prominent actor as Sheen sitting right beside him Alec Baldwin is a joy to watch as he spits out his comedic lines left right and centre and Martin Sheen brings the missing piece that fits the thrilling puzzle that is The Departed There are numerous violent scenes that scream Goodfellas or Casino and it s nice to get that old feeling back The film is gritty brutal and violent and doesn t let you sit there and feel comfortable with any of it People are getting shot left right and centre beaten to death hit numerous times with coat racks beaten with shoes stabbed thrown out of buildings The blood splashes all over the screen and with people getting shot in the face everywhere you feel the uneasiness that Scorsese wanted It s not as brutal as the one infamous baseball bat scene in Casino but it ranks up there The film does tend to drag on in certain areas but that s expected With it s fast story telling pace Scorsese slows it down a bit so we can get to know more about who these two characters are He keeps us on the edge of our seats wondering if their cover is going to be blown cause it can be blown at any point in time Even after watching Infernal Affairs I was still tense wondering what was going to happen next That is the work of a great director The Departed will get recognized by the Academy but I doubt it will win anything Scorsese is after 0 5 in that race One can only hope though cause he deserves it so much This film although definitely not his best I don t think anything he does will surpass Goodfellas packs one hell of a bloody punch It has strong performances and a dark comedic tone that will have you laughing along with it In the hands of any other director it could have been a mess Thank you Mr Scorsese for letting me have fun at the movies again,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492498/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2006,Worth seeing twice,I really liked this movie A lot Frequently when a movie with this much talent is put together it seems like a lot of it gets drowned out by some other element of cinematography but here the film making process actually did what it was supposed to do it acted as a supporting mechanism for the brilliant actors I have to admit that the casting was superb Leonardo did a great job he really came through in the clutch with one of the most difficult acting jobs he could have been assigned Likewise Nicholson was AMAZING He was the absolute perfect man for the role and he will leave you wanting to like him but the whole time knowing he is the bad guy Damon again does what he can with his rather bland personality which happens to be perfect for this role he was the right casting choice and fits into the movie perfectly The two big surprise actors in this movie are Wahlberg and Baldwin Both have minor roles but are hilarious Wahlberg especially He provides the necessary comedic relief to make this movie feel like a dark comedy at some points rather than a drama Also the Boston element really comes forth within this movie there is a heavy emphasis on the Irishness of the town not seen since Boondock Saints The character development that we see is really a major plus to this movie Watching the characters change and suspicions arise does just as much for this movie as the action does The reason that I didn t give it a ten is because the ending leaves a few questions that give the viewer a solid amount of confusion and in a movie like this I feel like it would be best to answer those questions However the ending is great its shocking and brilliant and leaves the viewer with a deep satisfaction that most movies these days do not This is the epitome of a good film don t let this one pass you by,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1525093/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2006,Saw it and absolutely loved it,Will buy it as soon as it hits the shelves at my local video retailer Now for the movie It became obvious very quickly why they chose Jack Nicholson good choice by the way it was not only because he is a huge name first rate actor and he is but because he gave the film the humor and antics that it so desperately needed to break up the drama tension and non stop killings Wise move Mr Scorsese I am the first to admit I am not a DiCaprio fan But it s the best performance a director has ever gotten out of him thus far Matt Damon is terrific Ray Winstone was solid as a rock Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen both good picks but I have to say I was a little disappointed in Mark Walberg as he struck me as being way too crass and obtuse even for a cop His character was the only guy I was hoping was gonna get wasted and shoved down a drainpipe far more than Damon s or even Nicholson s character That having been said I look for The Departed to rake several nominations and saints willing some wins as well come Oscar time Crime fans and drama lovers flock to this film I will most likely see it again before it leaves the big screen,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1497867/?ref_=tt_urv

Scorsese's best film of this sort since GoodFellas,STAR RATING Saturday Night Friday Night Friday Morning Sunday Night Monday Morning Two hot young new recruits join the FBI in the shape of Billy Costigan Leonardo Di Caprio and Colin Sullivan Matt Damon After a tough unrelenting grilling they both get the posts and end up doing different jobs on the same assignment A major operation has been set up to bring down revered local crime boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson who s just masterminded a heist on a military base where loads of tiny micro chip processors have been stolen to be sold to the Chinese to launch a deadly missile into the air Costigan is sent undercover to infiltrate Costello s gang whilst Sullivan helps lead the operation to bring him down But along the way it becomes a deadly and uncertain game where no one is who they seem no one s motives are as clear as they appear and increasingly no one can be trusted With his latest movie Scorsese has returned to his staple favourite the gangster movie and defiantly issued a message that if you thought Good Fellas was brutal and hard hitting you ain t seen nothing till you ve seen The Departed And that would be a pretty accurate assessment But aside from matching GoodFellas in the brutality stakes TD also matches it in terms of all round well general quality This is one of the most thoroughly satisfying and totally excellent films I ve seen this year an absorbing and mesmerizing tale that never lets up from beginning to end As the main bad guy Nicholson is at his absolute best and that ain t no bad thing doing his coolly edgy and unnerving act to brilliant effect and to be fair the supporting cast don t fu k up either Damon Di Caprio Wahlberg Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and even cockney heavy Ray Winstone in his breakthrough to Hollywood role as Costello s thoroughly brutal right hand man are all thoroughly immersed in their roles and make each respective part shine to their best effect It s actually nastier with the vulgarity of the language used by Nicholson s mobster especially some of the explicit jibes he comes out with regarding women but yes this is also one mega violent film that those with faint hearts might want to avoid Yes it s all rather frequent and excessive but it s a blessing and a curse because it also succeeds in giving the film a much needed loud raw intense feel that fits the mood of the picture brilliantly And it should also be commended for managing to skillfully combine this seedier side of the film with a genuinely intelligent plot with many skillful twists and turns that you never see coming Indeed as the end draws near it s veered away from it s mobster movie staple a bit and become more of an L A Confidential type film of police corruption and double crossing It s become a little depressing by the end too with all but two of the most obnoxious main characters meeting nasty blood splattered deaths at the hands of a gun But hey this is a gangster film and at least the worst villains got their just desserts fittingly And what a gangster film it is too one of the finest and most memorable we ve seen in a while everything coming together perfectly to make a fantastic cinematic experience,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1506349/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2007,Vile and Vicious,If you like listening to a dialog that sounds like this F k those guineas and nig s and F k your mother for over two hours and seeing non stop meaningless gratuitous violence crude behavior and basically a world where the police are corrupt and everybody curses like a sailor basically a hellish existence then maybe you might like this Good luck to you then This movie was unwatchable and I had to turn it off after 45 minutes I value my mind integrity and soul too much to soil it with this celluloid gutter trash 2006 was the worst year in Hollywood history for movies and having this refuse win awards only further illustrates One can only wonder just how degenerate America has become to see this movie even receive so many accolades,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1628196/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2007,Very weak effort. **SPOILERS**,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1608873/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2013,HeadShoot,Well I m not big fan of Scorsese but this movie is great I really love Leonardo DiCaprio I m not homo he s one of my best actors and I get really mad when he get killed but I was very happy when Colin Sullivan Matt Damon get what he deserve he was like sneaky freaky cocky bastard ready to stab you in the back Jack Nicholson I don t like him to much but he was hilarious especially with scene in cinema full of perverts Vera Farmiga from Running scared to this well Scorsese should take her more and I should watch more movies with her Daddy Sheen well no comment for him his the old school so I give respect for that Anthony Anderson I don t see point of his role Scorsese probably put him because of rumors about that Scorsese was racist Mark Wahlberg well what should I said I don t know he never be specific like actor you can watch him in comedy romance actions but honestly I got no opinion about him Plot is great script was very strong and scenes are pretty tense Anybody who said that movie is boring and stupid he should need watch movie again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2742942/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2007,Brutal inside view of mob/cop culture,Speaking of insiders Departed is the ultimate story of parallel universes of cop culture and crime culture with spies on each side The setting is Massachusetts the local Mob leader is Frank Costello Jack Nicholson and the state police leader of the organized crime task force OTF my acronym is Oliver Queenan Martin Sheen They re playing a chess match with young recruits particularly Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio and Colin Sullivan Matt Damon These two become the cream of the crop of a graduating class of Massachusetts State Police staties each has a past that makes him susceptible to the entreaties of the crime cop leadership Colin was once an altar boy who Costello psychologically dominated then turned toward the criminal way Colin becomes Costello s plant on the inside of the OTF Billy comes from a family of small time crooks and decides to become a cop to satisfy an unfocused anger lacking any motivation otherwise Billy accepts the dangerous offer to go undercover in the Costello organization for the OTF The plot is thus a complicated mosaic complete with a love interest in the form of a beautiful and engaging police psychologist Madolyn Vera Farmiga She s a ray of sunshine in this brutal unfeeling world who truly believes she can help Both the emotionally crippled Colin and the idealistic yet impossibly burdened Billy find solace there if not love For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster com Brian Wright Copyright 2007,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1674463/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2008,Fan-bleeping-tastic,Best film of 06 hands down feet up This is not a point on which I am willing to argue because while Babel was well acted Little Miss Sunshine was hysterical and Letters From Iwo Jima was fascinating no movie that year came close to being the cinematic masterpiece that The Departed is The leads and supporting actors were not good they were fantastic gritty and raw The moral fiber is shredded the line separating good and bad faded and drugs money and crime reign dominant There was no one shining star in this film Wahlberg DiCaprio Sheen Damon and lets not forget Nicholson were superb The camera angles were innovative and the writing was amazing if there is one bone to pick its the semi weak performance of the only central female character and even that is only in comparison to the extremely talented cast surrounding her,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1804227/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2007,Be warned - this is a scorsese movie,Given the sheer mass of acting talent in this movie I think Scorsese has completely out done himself to create something thats for the most part boring Yet again the sheer scale and charisma of the actors have carried his bad directing and shocking dialogue I cannot emphasise enough how patchy this movie is any scene thats enjoyable is followed by some amateurish gibberish that just makes you want to run up to Scorsese and hit him with a bread stick Given my rant the plot is OK for the most part and makes me really want to read the book The actors cant really be blamed for the bad dialogue aside from matt damon who just drains your energy with his shocking facial expressions and poor performance If you must see this movie make sure you re not the one paying for the DVD caus you re guaranteed to feel like you wont get that money back,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1684226/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2007,A Classic,I really don t have words to explain this film It is definitely one of my favorites The story is compelling the acting is superb Hell even Marky Mark gives you a performance that you will not forget It s amazing With a fantastic cast to put extra icing on this already delicious cake The Departed really does give you all you want and then some I really want to give more details about the movie in this review but it would totally ruin the experience All I can really say is go see it Martin Scorsese was awarded a well deserved Oscar for his directing and the movie taking best picture is a classic to be reckoned with for future years to come,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1660407/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2007,"Brilliant, Gripping Crime Drama",The Godfather Goodfellas LA Confidential Pulp Fiction Scarface These movies stand tall among the greatest gangster dramas ever made Each of them features a gripping story complex characters and a memorable tale of intricate passion and power The Departed will take its place among these greats and stands tall as Martin Scorcese s greatest achievement yet There is a rather large cast in The Departed but if it were to be boiled down to three main protagonists they would be Billy Costigan played by Leonardo DiCaprio Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon and Frank Costello played by Jack Nicholson Costello is a rich powerful Irish mob boss Costigan is an undercover cop who wheedles his way into Costello s inner circle which includes an undercover gangster working in the police department Sullivan The Departed follows the investigation into Costello s mob work Sullivan s interplay with Costello and Costigan s growing guilt and inner torture over the things he must do and see as an undercover cop One the The Departed finest aspects is the stellar acting from virtually every member of the all star cast Leonardo DiCaprio turns in one of the most impressive performances of his already impressive career He portrays the tortured Billy Costigan to perfection Matt Damon continues his unbroken string of masterful performances as Costello s mole in the police Unfortunately Jack Nicholson turns in one of the most disgustingly over the top performances I had seen in awhile It looks like he s begging for an Oscar with the way he tries to come across but all that I kept on seeing was Jack Nicholson playing himself What could have been a deep and complex character turns into nothing more than showboating at its worst The character he plays is complex enough but Nicholson does not give it nearly enough justice Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen all turn in their own noteworthy performances most of all Wahlberg and though he doesn t get much screen time still manages to portray his character to its full depth and potential Alec Baldwin s role is almost funny in how close it comes to self parody and Martin Sheen plays the head investigator Queenan with a serious fun Character is another impressive aspect of The Departed Every last character is fleshed out full complex and detailed The closest thing that any character comes to one dimensional is the cop psychologist Matt Damon s love interest She is supposed to be this amazingly brilliant woman but she just comes across as irrational and careless as she eagerly dives into dangerous relationships and situations right and left Aside from her though the other characters are sketched out perfectly Ellerby Dignam and Queenan Baldwin Wahlberg and Sheen though secondary characters still feel like completely real people Damon s character of Sullivan is wonderfully drawn Costello as I already mentioned is almost ruined by Jack Nicholson but he still manages to shine a bit of his complexity through the ruinous vehicle of Nicholson Most interesting is Dicaprio s multi dimensional Costigan who is the most interesting and multi faceted character I have seen in a film in a long time He s not the typical cop who s feeling guilty over coming dangerously close to becoming a criminal He is this and so much more and the huge complexity of his character could easily have been fumbled by a lesser actor than DiCaprio It s beautifully pulled off though The intricate interplay of characters and the complex twists and turns in the film are another hallmark of its greatness This is not some straightforward crime drama There will be surprises There will be twists But more than this everything all these aspects all work together to grab us in at the outset and to never let go The storyline is positively riveting in its intensity and uncompromising vision of the dark underworld of crime We have seen this before in films portrayed especially wonderfully in the films mentioned above and The Departed is no less great or capable than those others At two hours and twenty minutes it doesn t even stretch its waistline or overstay its welcome It s just the right length Usually any movie that goes over two hours overstays its welcome plenty but The Departed is a notable exception It is a very clean streamlined movie This being said though it is not a perfect one Jack Nicholson s performance drags the whole show down more than any one aspect If it hadn t been for him the film could have been so much better The character of Madolyn comes across as two clear and one dimensional in comparison to the rest of the cast Besides this though Scorcese seems preoccupied with all the horror and evil that goes on in this world while never really focusing in on the good He touches on it in brief tender moments between Costigan and Madolyn and Sullivan and Madolyn but he never focuses there Scorcese obviously prefers to show us the brutality and debauchery of this world which is fine if that is his vision for the film A more clean and hopeful view though could have helped the bleakness a little Fine performances have always been the hallmark of greatness in films The cast of the Departed is one of the best to come along in a long while If it weren t for that darn Jack Its storyline is not simplistic or overly violent for the sake of violence Everything every line every action every moment serves a purpose and serves to drive the vehicle of the film forward The gripping dark score does its part well in this as well The complex and multi faceted characters interacting and clashing on screen have been some of the most real and fleshed out characters that I have ever seen on celluloid True it has its flaws but as a gangster crime drama thriller these days it really has no equal,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1608551/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2007,Up there with Martin Scorsese's best movies. Legendary.,Martin Scorsese has directed many legendary movies from Taxi Driver Raging Bull Goodfellas Casino and many more The Departed is up there as one of Martin Scorsese s best movies The cast and acting is top notch It s a remake of a Hong Kong flick Infernal Affairs but I feel that The Departed is way superior It s four academy awards were well earned Leonardo Di Caprio is an police officer who has been sent undercover to infiltrate Frank Costello s Mafia Jack Nicholson and inform the police of his actions Little does anyone know Frank Costello has sent a young criminal Matt Damon to become a police officer in the Massachusetts State Police Department as a mole and inform the mafia of when the police are going to strike When discoveries are made of a mole in both sides of the law both men have to survive to avoid being caught There are many twists and turns in this 2 and a 1 2 hour long movie but you will be hooked The screenplay and soundtrack is top notch Leonardo Di Caprio buries his pretty boy image to turn in one of his best performances as conflicted undercover police officer Billy Costigan who is deep undercover in the mafia he may not make it out let alone lose his identity forever Matt Damon is known to play likable characters but he is brilliantly cast against type as the highly ambitious and intelligent yet deceptive and arrogant Colin Sullivan who has not forgotten what his main role is as an informant to the mafia while rising up the ranks of the Massachusetts State Police and into the elite Special Investigation Unit Jack Nicholson was legendary as the ultimately evil mafia boss Frank Costello who has ruled Boston for many years Costello is up there with Nicholson s best characters such as Jack Torrence Randall Mc Murphy Col Nathan Jessup and The Joker Frank Costello is unrestrained and is like a walking time bomb waiting to explode It was an absolute shame that Jack Nicholson missed out on a Best Supporting Actor nomination Jack nailed the role No other actor could have done so Mark Wahlberg was excellent as Sergeant Dignam an honest but very belligerent and foul mouthed policeman What you see is what you get and this man speaks his mind without a damn in the world At first I was surprised that he was up for Best Supporting Actor but it was well deserved and he chews up every scene he is in The all star supporting cast is dynamite Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin Ray Winstone Anthony Anderson and the lovely Vera Farmiga are an integral part of the movie Final comment The Departed is legendary and one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and is way up there as Martin Scorsese s best movies 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1630106/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2006,One of the greatest films of the new millennium,In general I m not Scorsese s biggest fan but this Americanization of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs is a great film and one of the popular director s best efforts period The film takes in themes of deception and identity fraud and carries off its story of undercover agents with style and panache It is customary with modern day crime thrillers to add a layer of cool to the proceedings and Scorsese certainly does that here although it is not a forced Tarantino style slew of one liners but rather a relaxed assurance in the plot and characters which really pays off once the plot begins to develop The story itself follows the intriguing idea of two undercover agents infiltrating each other s organisation Colin Sullivan joined the police force after mob boss Frank Costello decided that it would be a good idea to have some undercover agents on the other side Meanwhile William Costigan another new recruit of the police force is sent to work undercover in the same organisation being run by Frank Costello Naturally both men end up looking for each other and much violence ensues As you would expect from an A list production such as this one the acting is superb Both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio step into their respective roles well with DiCaprio in particular delivering the sort of gritty performance that you wouldn t expect from him given the sort of films he was making before hooking up with Scorsese Of course it is Jack Nicholson who steals the show as the eccentric mob boss This represents an absolutely great piece of casting as Nicholson was born to play roles like this and seeing him completely owning every scene he s in is a delight for the viewer The rest of the support is more than adequate and Scorsese manages to put the likes of Mark Wahlberg Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen Ray Winstone and the subtly sexy Vera Farminga to good use in a range of roles There s plenty of violence in the film to satisfy crime fans with a particular focus on people getting punched in the face The music used generally works well with the likes of the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd blending well with sequences in the movie The ending is potently bleak and perfectly fits the film up until that point I don t often find myself saying this of Scorsese s films but The Departed truly is a modern day masterpiece and everyone who calls themselves a film fan owes it to themselves to see it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1499510/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,Scorsese proves why he's America's best living filmmaker,Today I went to see a movie I really didn t start hearing about until the past few weeks While the internet has been the cause for much time away from my family I never really seek out movie info part of me still likes the surprise of seeing trailers at the theater but I also have adopted a I ll see it when I believe it attitude when it comes to movies in the works I have other things to do than bad mouth movies that have not even come out yet with that being said I went to see the latest Martin Scorsese film The Departed First of all Goodfellas is easily the top 2 of my favorite films of ALL TIME right up there with Empire Strikes Back I have seen Goodfellas easily over 20 times in it s entirety I am in the camp that believes that Martin was robbed of the Oscar in 1990 by Kevin Costner and his Dances with Wolves Don t get me wrong Dances was a good film but I really think that for me it lacked the emotional journey and overall power that Goodfellas had GF is film making at it s best and honestly The Departed is like a breath of fresh air that s missing from so many big Hollywood films Like many I believe that Scorsese is arguably the best American director still alive today Admitingly I was not a huge fan of the Avaitor and while Gangs of New York had it s flaws it was still an enjoyable film Of course films like Raging Bull Taxi Driver and Mean Streets stand on their own through the test of time The film centers around Billy Costigan DiCaprio who is an undercover cop working inside Frank Costello s Nicholson gang and Colin Sullivan Damon who plays a cop working as a spy for Costello and his crew keeping the Boston police off his tail What follows for the next 2 and a half hours is an intricate crime drama with richly developed characters and an often vulgar blood soaked story that will have you fully enthralled for the duration of the film I don t want to spend all this time discussing the plot I don t want to be put in the position of spoilers and giving away the best parts of the film I am here to say that this is easily the front runner for the best film of 2006 Scorsese returns to his mobster roots and does not miss a beat For a Scorsese fan all his signatures are there from a soundtrack that could not relate better to the images on screen to the brutality of the violence This is no cheesy WWE John Cena film this is a raw bloody R rated movie for all the right reasons This combined with the Boston setting make this a choice film for this boring time of yawn inducing October releases The cast is suburb Damon DiCaprio Nicholson are all equally amazing Nicholson especially pitch perfect as Frank Costello the aging crime lord that gets the sense there is a cop in his crew Matt Damon is also amazing as the prick dirty cop working for Costello keeping him out of harms way DiCaprio of course proves why he is worth every penny and this role really solidifies that he is the real deal On a side note I find it funny that Ben Affleck gets tons of press but has been in only one good movie Chasing Amy but friend Damon has not only been getting quality roles but roles that make money as well While these are the key players they take nothing away from an amazing supporting cast including Alec Baldwin Mark Walberg and Martin Sheen all do an amazing job in bringing very complex unforgettable characters to blistering life Worth a second and third viewing just to watch the acting alone but also to really immerse yourself in the complex world of cops and criminals Highly recommended and worth every penny This holds up as a very good reason than great movies can still be made It s just sad that there are not more movies that are of this quality,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492715/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2007,Easily in my top 5 movies,I ve seen a lot of great movies And this is just another great movie that is in my collection of movies The acting is amazing I was very surprised at Mark Whalberg s performance it was very good as was everyone else s the direction is superb the movie looks amazing and the greatest thing is that Martin Scorsese considers this his B Movie I have seen the original film from which The Departed is adapted from Infernal Affairs and both the movies stand apart from each other They are both amazing but they appear to come across as different Like many people who have commented on this movie before me nothing i say can do this movie justice,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1653652/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,Over-rated,This is a good film but not brilliant I was really looking forward to seeing it as I m a fan of all of the actors in this film However I found the story to be at times a little corny and it lacked soul and depth It felt as if so much was happening but we have seen this before in cinema I didn t take anything new away from this film There were some lovely moments but all being said I left the cinema a little disappointed The critics were raving look at the full page ads in the New York Post and New York Times The style of the film felt like a non stop video clip I wasn t keen on the editing in this respect It was a very different style to Scorcese s other works brightly lit it in some ways reminded me of Pulp Fiction kind of surreal but not a drama reality Worth seeing but doesn t come close to Goodfellas or Casino,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492459/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,Scorsese at the Top of His Game,Martin Scorsese has returned to the top of his game with The Departed which is his best work since Goodfellas I wondered going in whether the 149 minute running time of the film might be excessive but it is not It is a sophisticated complex tale which because it takes its time is clearly understandable Nevertheless it moves without a lag The cast are uniformly wonderful Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan an emotionally crippled undercover cop gives the finest performance of his career Matt Damon who just seems to get better and better is also outstanding as Colin Sullivan a state police sergeant who is also a mole for a big time mobster Frank Costello played by the always terrific Jack Nicholson Nicholson is alternately funny and creepy in a way I can t imagine any other actor being able to pull off I had not seem Vera Farmiga who plays Madolyn a state health professional who treats both police officers and paroled convicts Hers is a very important role because she treats and develops a personal relationship with both Costigan and Sullivan with fascinating consequences Madolyn is both vulnerable and a risk taker Farmiga made me care about her The Departed is the best movie I have seen this year and maybe in the last two years I hope that Scorsese ends his Oscar shutout with this one If he does it will have been a well deserved victory,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493631/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2007,OverRated Piece of Bad Fiction,Ironically this was the only Best Picture nomination that I not viewed so I rented the day of the Acedamy Awards and played it after it had received the Best Picture Award I was quite disappointed If this was the best movie of 2006 then 2006 was really a down year for the movies which it was This movie is a piece of very distorted fiction like all of Scorsese movies Perhaps I lost my respect for the movie because the story began so badly It was unreal as was much of the movie and hence it had no credibility which is often a characteristic of Martin Scorsese directed movies It begins when Colin Sullivan who is fresh out of the police academy is immediately assigned as a detective That doesn t happen in real life no matter how good a cadet is Police officers routinely spend at least one year and in most cases two years on probation as patrol officers so that they can learn the ropes They are rookies Making it worse Sullivan is promoted to sergeant shortly after becoming a detective Again never happens The same is true of Billy Costigan who graduates from the Police Academy at the same time as Sullivan He is immediately assigned as an undercover cop Never happen Until he learns the ropes as a patrol officer he is not going to find himself undercover And while undercover he shows an exceptional amount of sophistication that only an experienced police officer would show Next dumb thing is the Police Captain in charge of Costigan goes to meet him alone without any backup If he was that stupid he never would have made captain And Mob Chief Frank Costello executes two people on the edge of major airport runway in broad daylight where everyone on airplanes landing or taking off can see him Yeah Since when do Mob Chiefs do the executions But it is a typical Scorsese scene and there are several such unreal scenes in the film I think that if anyone but Scorsese had directed this film it would have been a better film My thought is that for sentimental reasons the Academy wanted to give Scorsese an Oscar as director and that the voters had to give the movie an Oscar to justify the director s Oscar,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1609216/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2023,Not even close to one of Scorsese's best,I hate to use the word overrated but that is a pretty good word for this movie This is Scorsese on autopilot working with potboiler material but for some reason filmgoers and the film establishment decided to heap this movie with tons of accolades that Scorsese s other lesser known work is much more worthy of It feels like a slightly elevated version of dozens of other crime and cop action movies There are great actors and great performances in this movie but the plot did not keep me engaged enough to follow its many twists and turns The ending is so over the top and ridiculous that it borders on parody,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9037233/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2006,Hollywood Rubbish,I went to see this hoping Scorsese would do Infernal Affairs the original enough justice for me to class the film as mediocure But I was horribly wrong Scorsese instead filled the film with as much cheese as possible The original was not a gangster film that The Departed turned out to be Instead it was an emotional film about the lives that undercover officers must go through If we d wanted to see a gangster film there s plenty out there all of which are better than The Departed anyway I was amazed that so many good actors such as Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen signed up for this Anyone who has seen Infernal Affairs would probably feel the same way as I do If you have seen the original it would be a complete waste of money and time to watch this If you haven t seen any of the originals I would strongly recommend that you at least see one of them All in all this is probably the most heavily Hollywoodised remake ever,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1501911/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2016,Fantastic Story with Great Acting,This might be the best story that is brought to screen I know The Departed was originally based on Infernal Affairs but Scorsese really adds an extra wow factor The Departed contains my favorite cast ever with Nicholson DiCaprio Damon Sheen Baldwin and Wahlberg They all have the east coast feel and play the gangster and cop roles perfectly I don t think a better cast could have been found Nicholson seemed to be passing the acting torch onto Leo here as it is a treat for the viewer to see these two bring out the best in each other Wahlberg surprised me in his limited role He plays the loose cannon cop perfectly and really adds a presence to his scenes Scorsese really set The Departed apart for me though All of his little touches that make his movies great were involved You cold tell with his unique use of cinematography realism and music Everything was emphasized Each moment was big and built to a powerful ending He finds a way to connect the story together in a way to keep everyone on the edge of their seat the entire time Scorsese has made some great gangster movies but this is by far his best It definitely stands alone This movie in general deserved every award it received and probably more I thought from top to bottom this was as close to a perfect movie as I have seen in my life The story was already intriguing from Infernal Affairs and the best cast imaginable was brought together Scorsese took these elements and created his masterpiece Go see this movie immediately 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3413882/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2013,"An Excellent,Unforgettable Epic Gangster Film/Crime Drama/Thriller Remake. Another Martin Scorsese Classic.",The Departed is an excellent and unforgettable Epic Gangster Film and Crime Drama Thriller remake that combines amazing direction great performances from the cast a terrific script and a memorable score and soundtrack All of those elements make The Departed not only a great Gangster film and remake but another Martin Scorsese Classic Set in the Soutn Boston neighborhood of Boston Massachusetts The Departed tells the story of police officer Billy Costigan Leonardo Dicapro who s been asked by his superiors to undercover and work for a vicious local Gangster and crime boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson and his organization While undercover Billy is unaware that there is another cop working for Costello Colin Sullivan Matt Damon a State police detective who is selling information to Costello from the police department With Billy and Colin both working for Frank will one of them discover each other identities or will one of them become a member of The Departed The Departed is a brilliant and thrilling Crime Drama Thriller that saw Martin Scorsese return to the genre Scorsese is best known for the Gangster film after two great period dramas Gangs Of New York 2002 and The Aviator 2004 The Departed won Oscars for Best Picture and most importantly Best Director for Martin Scorsese although many agree that Scorsese should ve won for his earlier masterworks such as Raging Bull GoodFellas and Taxi Driver but that doesn t stop The Departed from being the great film that it is Right from the opening The Departed is an amazing film and an instant Scorsese classic that has you mesmerized and glued to the screen giving viewers a film that intense and powerful and will have viewers on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next and there is constant intrigue going on throughout the but done in a no holds barred style that Scorsese does so well The Departed is a Gangster film that is rooted in the spirit of Film Noir where the attitudes of the main characters is tough and cynical and the tone and atmosphere is dark and where streets in this film is brutal and cops and criminals only follow the law of the gun Where as Scorsese s other Gangster film took place in Scorsese s hometown New York City GoodFellas Mean Streets or in Las Vegas Casino The Departed takes place on the mean streets of South Boston where the crime world in South Boston isn t as flashy as New York in terms of clothes and how they live or other big cities in terms of style but still has the same violent viciousness as it s other big city counterparts and where the Irish Mob and Frank Costello s crew is working class gritty and people you don t want to mess with The Crime world in South Boston has a style on it s own The Departed not only succeeds as a great Gangster film but a great remake of the incredible Asian Crime Drama Infernal Affairs 2002 and while The Departed adapts the plot Infernal Affairs Scorsese s film works as it s own film The two main characters Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan are great characters because with Costigan being undercover and Sullivan being an informant you see these two dealing with guilt fear and a sense of dread of someone discovering who the two really are and working for Frank Costello adding to the suspense of the film because while you may not always like the them as people or the things that they do but you will be in their shoes The violence in The Departed is classic Scorsese because the violence is vicious and brutal and when the film gets bloody the red plasma comes off the screen in dark fashion If you ve seen Scorsese s Goodfellas and Casino you know kind of violence is going to be in this film The screenplay by William Monahan is terrific with Monahan giving the film gritty and memorable dialog that feels realistic and reflects the style and tone of South Boston and has characters that are unforgettable The ending of The Departed is fantastic and memorable because it s shocking and darkly humorous A great ending to this wonderful film The whole cast is amazing Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as Billy Costigan with DiCaprio bringing intensity depth and energy to the role Matt Damon is brilliant as Colin Sullivan bringing power and believability to the role Jack Nicholson is amazing and at his maniacal best as Frank Costello with Nicholson being intimidating and funny at the same time Mark Wahlberg is terrific as Sgt Dignam with Wahlberg saying great one liners and stealing scenes Martin Sheen is great as Capt Queenan Costgan s boss Ray Winstone is fantastic as Mr French Francis right hand man Vera Farminga is wonderful as Madolyn Colin s girlfriend and Billy s psychiatrist Alec Baldwin is outstanding and funny as Capt Ellerby a hyperactive cop Anthony Anderson Trooper Brown Kevin Corrigan Cousin Sean James Badge Dale Trooper Barrigan David Patrick O Hara Fitzy Mark Rolston Delhunt Robert Wahlberg Lazio FBI and Kristen Dalton Gwen give good performances as well The direction by Martin Scorsese is excellent and stylish with Scorsese always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and visual style with terrific shots and camera angles Great direction Scorsese The score by Howard Shore is fantastic and intense matching the mood and tone of the film The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones Gimmie Shelter Let It Loose Roger Waters Van Morrison The Band Comfortably Numb The Dropkick Murphys I m Shipping Off To Boston Patsy Cline Sweet Dreams Of You Roy Buchanan Sweet Dreams John Lennon Well Well Well Nas Thief s Theme The Beach Boys Sail On Sailor The Allman Brothers Band One Way Out Badfinger Baby Blue The Human Beinz Nobody But Me Lavern Baker Tweedle Dee and Joe Cuba Bang Bang Wonderful soundtrack In final word if you love Martin Scorsese Gangster Films Crime Dramas Crime Thrillers or films in general I highly suggest you see The

11 January 2017,"I wanted to like it, but just couldn't bring myself to do so",When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620679/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2007,Martin Scorecese is finally liberated...,There is not too much to say that hasn t been already said Let me just add that with this movie Scorcese has been liberated from the cultural obligation to make an EPIC movie With this he has been freed to just make a great MOVIE There are no grand passion plays here Just a damn good story The ending was a little bit ruined for me because IMDb or Yahoo entertainment news or some other piece of fluff article spoiled it when they speculated on the possibility of making a sequel Shame on them Also why does Scorcese have to include Gimme Shelter in all of his trailers and movies I can just imagine him trying to include it in Kundun for crying out loud Although with that one exception the soundtrack was superb This is Leo s best performance to date clearly the most understated yet It amazing to watch him get exponentially better and better with each and every role All of Leo s past sins have been completely 100 absolved at this point as far as I m concerned All in all a superb and riveting movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1643163/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2006,"Better than ""Goodfellas"" Scorsese's best film.",I realize saying Martin Scorsese s best film is a very bold statement considering his film history but i still believe it to be true Although movies like Raging Bull and Goodfellas are classics and very very well made films The Departed was incredible From the amazing cast to the perfect soundtrack awesome editing this movie had it all I feel as if people value movies sometimes only upon there value to the industry thats why people say It s no Goodfellas i believe it is It could be i grew up about an hour away from Boston haha but it s tremendous none the less I suggest this film to any Scorsese fan or any one looking to see one of the greatest films this year great action great suspense great drama sprinkled with comedy the whole way through Spend the 9 bucks get popcorn haha enjoy this to the fullest you won t regret it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1523128/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2008,Excellent....with holes.,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1837053/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2006,"The Departed is a remake, original much better",As many of you well know The Departed is a remake of a 2002 film from Hong Kong called Mou gaan dou Internal Affairs I have to say that I enjoyed the original movie much better than this remake Many of the original classic lines from the film did make it to this Hollywood knock off such as cutting up Leonardo DiCaprio and feeding him to the poor The method of passing messages involving the use of Morse code in the original far surpasses the method of using a cell phone text message as well If you really did enjoy The Departed then I highly suggest renting or purchasing the original If you enjoyed the original then I would not disappointed yourself by watching this remake,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1503303/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2006,Pales next to the Hong Kong original,THE DEPARTED is Scorsese s eagerly anticipated remake of the smash Hong Kong thriller INFERNAL AFFAIRS which captivated much of Asia and spawned two sequels across the Pacific The casting of Nicholson De Caprio et al looked promising While there are some entertaining moments in DEPARTED and the film is enjoyable it falls far short of INFERNAL AFFAIRS Ironcally IA feels more like a Scorsese film than DEPARTED fast cutting a rock soundtrack sharp camera moves and action jacked up to 11 DEPARTED is inconsistent At two and a half hours it moves slows down rocks stops goes forward pauses There s also a little too much posturing among all these cops and villains and not enough suspense which accelerated INFERNAL AFFAIRS like a rocket ship hurling into space The central cat and mouse premise between the two moles is strangely muted in DEPARTED and that s what hurts the film the most Performances are fine starting with a salty Nicholson I love Scorsese but his hallmarks of slick camera moves swift editing and the perfect soundtrack don t hit the mark Not bad but certainly not vintage Marty,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1490590/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2020,A unique film,The film is good and incredibly interesting no one expects the end of this film to be so complete But the ending of the film was also great but there were some incomprehensible parts But the film is great,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6302475/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2018,A Good Adaptation of the HK original,As this has been adapted from the Cantonese version naturally I had some idea about the plot I must say Martin Scorsese is a real master in owning a story which may not be his originally but he owns it by turning the story as relatable as possible to the layman on the street Leo s performance is alright but to me Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen have done a far effective job Jack Nicholson for some reason always shines in here as a psychotic mob boss Matt Damon is commendable as a two faced state police For the untwisting of the twisted it is recommendable to watch this again on Netfix or Amazon if like me you had the unfortunate noise of the cinema crowd who are most likely Leo cheerleaders,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4178107/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2006,Scorsese gets back on track,As good as I expected I think its Scorsese s best since Goodfellas Scorsese returns to his unfiltered best to make this entertaining crime film The film revolves around an undercover cop played by DiCaprio who is sent to infiltrate Nicholson s mob organization On the flip side Nicholson sends his son played by Damon into the police force as his spy The tension grows as both men reveal the inner workings on the organizations they have infiltrated The plot reveals plenty of twists and turns Scorsese always seems to bring together a talented cast and he does it again here I always find DiCaprio to be very hit or miss in his roles He does well here very well in fact He s never overmatched in the scenes with Nicholson and it proves to be what makes him very effective in this role While Nicholson gets to show his creepy nefarious side he tends to go a little overboard with the character Damon has gotten to a point where he can take any role and play it well He s great at playing the two faced cop here One thing that is very apparent is that he gets to bring on his native Boston accent ala Good Will Hunting Nice supporting roles from Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen as high rankers in the department However an actor that I cannot as hard as I try take seriously is Mark Wahlberg He s so over the top in every role and he is here in my opinion Scorsese s use of music weaving in and out of scenes at different volumes something he did well in Goodfellas comes back in this film What shines through though is his knack for shooting chaos or violence All of Scorsese s trademark storytelling techniques come into this one with a vengeance and make very a smooth and entertaining film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1518577/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Better see it before you hear about it,Warning Don t watch any interviews on TV or listen to them on the radio about this movie or from the cast In fact watch it now on it s opening weekend to stay ahead of the buzz The ending to this movie is so surprising it s bound to be the talk of the town It was an amazing movie but if you hear the ending before you see it the shock ll be significantly less although no matter what you can t ruin this movie All those phrases you hear when you watch a movie trailer Gripping Breath taking totally apply to this movie See it Love it Enjoy it And don t go talking through the whole thing this is a movie your gonna want to remember I m ready to see it again honestly,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491918/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2007,This Movie Is COMPLETELY Overrated!!!!!!!!!!!,Picture of the year my ass It was completely mediocre and played like a made for TV movie from the 70 s The Boston actors can t even remember how to speak Southie and the Whitey character is not at all scary This film does not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as The Godfather Even Godfather 3 was better than this Leonardo DiCaprio believable as a mobster Or as a tough guy cop Come on Same goes for Matt Damon This did not deserve to win at all The Pursuit of Happiness Letters From Iwo Jima and Pan s Labyrinth were all much better So was The Last King of Scotland So was every episode of the TV show Prison Break for that matter It s time to stop the hype on this before we start getting remakes shoved down our throat,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1664907/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,Not as good as Infernal Affairs,Let me say right off the bat that I liked Scorsese s movie but it lacked something that the original had Heart Infernal Affairs had heart The movie made you really care about the Moles and the supporting cast In Scorsese s film Matt Damon s character is just despicable In Infernal Affairs the same character is a conflicted man torn between loyalties and gains the audience s sympathy In the new film you hated Matt Damon and felt nothing about supporting characters It s really too bad Scorsese s movie would have been better if the characters gained our sympathy like the original that was the purpose of the film And what s up with Dicaprio banging the same woman as Damon That s just flat out unrealistic and a stupid and unnecessary sub plot,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493994/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,Gritty and Goofy,The departed is a film with a premise that was a surefire hit from the start Adapted from an Asian film of the same premise the story is sharp and the world is funny in that silly and corrupt Scorsese way It is very well paced and the story arc is exceedingly well thought out I can t say enough good things about the set pieces and the tension is right where Scorsese wants it at any given time Where this film missteps is in the cartoonish nature of some of the characters Without spoiling the film itself Jack Nicholson gives his best performance to a character that really isn t that compelling It is not a spoiler to note that Nicholson s character often contradicts his own context He is supposed to be highly rational yet sometimes acts very irrationally Odd Very goofy at times In fact Nicholson s character reminds me of a poorly written Joker from Nolan s The Dark Knight it didn t quite hit the mark At other times the rest characters seem to succumb to the cheesiness of the dialogue and plots Scorsese puts together In summary this is a good film with some one dimensional main characters Some subplots save the depth of the film but what you see is what you get most of the time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6909344/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2020,Looking for something...,Coming into this film I had high hopes The cast the director and the imdb score made me think this was going to be amazing Sadly the film just under performs drastically The plot while a good concept didn t have as much impact as it could have when it came to giving that sense of drama and danger As we get later in the film things start to turn predictable and soon we are left with situations that just seem tedious In the end I say sure it was an okay film but thats about it 7 10 Lackluster,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5940684/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2009,To state The Departed as one of the greatest films ever made is to state the obvious,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2019033/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2007,"Pretty bad film, I'm sorry to say.",Way too long and boring Should have cut 60 minutes out and it would have been a lot better I rented the DVD and almost shut it off a couple times cause it just kept dragging on and on Nicholson is mostly great and Damon De Caprio are good too for the most part but this movie really lacks cohesion and just kind of sits there doing nothing for much too long It starts out OK and the character development is pretty good but I d say half way through it starts to tread water and doesn t really move forward until it picks up a bit going into the ending Over all it s a nodder though I almost fell a sleep a couple times,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1604153/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2006,THE DEPARTED - Scorsese's Gangs of Boston,No one has depicted the modern underworld better than film maestro Martin Scorsese who has melded cinematic acumen with his Italian Catholic upbringing to form a trilogy of unparalleled morality plays Mean Streets Goodfellas and Casino The trilogy has become a quartet by default as the director tackles the Asian cult classic Infernal Affairs and has fashioned The Departed a film so good up until its stunning conclusion it almost can t possibly live up to its steadily built character driven narrative Set in Boston mobster Frank Costello Jack Nicholson rises from small time hood to major crime boss He befriends and mentors a boy Colin Sullivan who as a grown man Matt Damon has studied his way to the State Police academy Simultaneously another young man Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio is about to graduate as a policeman A task force is formed to build a case against Costello Led by Captain Queenan Martin Sheen and Sergeant Dignam Mark Wahlberg Sullivan and Costigan are recruited for the team separately and unbeknownst to each other Sullivan takes advantage of his status by tipping off Costello and keeping the kingpin one step ahead of the law Costigan infiltrates Costello s crew while Sullivan ironically leads an internal investigation into probable traitors informants in the police department Soon Costello and Sullivan realize that there is a mole in their own ranks too but who can it be It becomes a perverse game of cat and mouse as the policemen try to expose each other Furthermore Sullivan begins dating Madolyn Vera Farmiga a police shrink who also counsels and then forms a bond with Costigan Realizing that he is about to be discovered Costigan wants to be extracted by Queenan who senses that the situation is desperate As the task force closes on Costello Sullivan zeros in on Costigan s identity by tailing Queenan and thus good and evil are set on a collision course with startling tragic finality Here we have a dichotomy or duality of two men Sullivan and Costigan both intelligent well read and streetwise who happen to be on opposing sides and for a majority of the story unaware of each other s identity Costigan is the noble undercover cop whose life is in ever increasing peril and Sullivan is the hotshot policeman who will do anything to protect Costello Then there are the surrogate fathers as Nicholson s Costello mentors Sullivan while Sheen s Captain Queenan shepherds Costigan It is amusing to see how Costello sort of adopts Costigan and Queenan is the elder to Sullivan at the police station It is a parallel family nucleus turned inside out The acting is simply put great Jack Nicholson convincingly portrays a powerful mob boss with utter arrogance and ruthlessness His dialogue is chilling and at times outrageously funny Damon in his old stomping grounds sports a New England accent and does a very credible job as the heavy DiCaprio demonstrates an ever growing maturity in his roles his recent partnership with Scorsese is proving fruitful Gangs of New York The Aviator You have to hand it to Scorsese as one of the few directors who can attract the best actors who are dying to work with him How else could such lead actors as Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin who is a riot as a profanity laced FBI boss and Mark Wahlberg accept what are essentially supporting roles The film does miss on a couple points It would have meant more if the relationship of Madolyn and Sullivan had been explored with more depth and the emergence of Costigan in this unlikely triangle would have had more poignancy Likewise at the end those relationships are left unclear and never fully explored as much as we want after we get so involved in these characters good or bad as they might be The film is a little long but never uninteresting and when it reaches its astonishing ending it is sudden and jarring in unexpected ways that reach Shakespearean proportions Scorsese is still very much in command of his medium as he will throw in a cinematic device like an iris in shot or freeze a frame here or there Editor Thelma Schoonmaker his long time collaborator is in fine form juggling a dozen characters and maintaining the tension at a very high level for a long time no easy feat Though Scorsese s early Mean Streets 1973 was a fictional tale of low level hoods it was also semi autobiographical in its depiction of the people he knew Goodfellas 1990 and Casino 1995 took a semi documentary approach that held a fascination of real life events amid a dramatic storyline In terms of structure The Departed while similar in spirit and energy to his previous crime dramas shows Scorsese fabricating essentially a purely fictitious story and as always he has a knack for depicting the inner workings of organized crime with realistic bravado There are echoes of the films The Corrupter featuring Wahlberg Donnie Brasco and Reservoir Dogs also a Hong Kong inspired plot with their questions of loyalty and betrayal While earlier police corruption stories were told primarily from the police protagonist s point of view like Serpico or the great Prince of the City The Departed takes an equal time approach with its protagonists and antagonists The movie contains raw violence including a brief but action packed climax The profanity is excessive but realistic and at times there are amusing cussing matches between the various factions It s hard to wrap your arms around The Departed because there s just so much to savor and admire while also wishing that the radical change in tone at the end weren t so jarring to the rhythm of the plot It s basically a film about rats and you know what happens to rats,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491516/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2008,The Departed- Mr Scorcese I am now your fan,Before I watched this movie I had read mixed reviews about it instead of putting me off it made me even more curious I am glad that I took a chance on it To be honest I can t understand why people didn t like it It is a superb drama about undercover cops Scorcese has managed to assemble a superb class of actors including Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson and Martin Sheen amongst others DiCaprio has finally got rid of his pretty boy looks by having a more rugged look in this movie Add to that a twist in the tale and you have a absolutely compelling drama To be honest I have not watched any other Scorcese film apart from the Departed after this movie I want to watch all his other classics This was easily the best movie of 2006 Mr Scorcese you should be proud,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1814563/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2020,Scorsese in his element.,Screenwriter William Monahan and filmmaker Martin Scorsese do very well here adapting the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs for a North American audience The nifty premise is that gangland boss Frank Costello Jack Nicholson in one of his last great roles and performances has spent his time nurturing Colin Sullivan played as an adult by Matt Damon who s now his mole inside the State Department At the same time a newcomer to Franks gang Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio is actually a detective so deep undercover that only his handlers Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg know that he s a cop So we have both the cops and the crooks shaken by these obvious plants in their units This truly was ideal material for Scorsese who understandably won an Academy Award for his fine direction Although it seems awfully unwieldy at just over two and a half hours long this viewer never lost interest in it This is due to genuinely excellent storytelling a great Boston Mass flavour many colourful characters and performances and Scorsese s typically potent visceral style Granted some viewers may not care for seeing some of this violence rendered digitally but the script does take some interesting turns and may even have a surprise or two in store for some viewers The often profane dialogue is highly amusing with Wahlberg having some of the choicest quips Scorsese works with a first rate cast here other luminaries include Alec Baldwin Vera Farmiga and Ray Winstone and top character players like David O Hara Mark Rolston and James Badge Dale Nicholson electrifies in his charismatic latter day performance And DiCaprio is solid in the role of a man determined to overcome his sordid family history Overall this is well worth a viewing to see a master filmmaker at work It drops you right into the action with a bit of back story the title doesn t show up until almost 20 minutes in and the vast majority of the credits are saved for the end Eight out of 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5448465/?ref_=tt_urv

You must be the other guy.,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5361034/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,Scorsese Does It Again!!!,Certainly Martin Scorsese is in the Top 5 film Director s of all time His ability to put out movie after movie with astonishing screenplays and unforgettable characters is unlike any other The Departed is an amazing film from its acting to its script to its portrayal of the Boston police and the Irish mafia and to its shocking finale ACTING The acting in the film is superb At first it s awkward with everyone having Irish accents and such but you learn to love it Like all of Scorsese s pictures The Departed is extremely well cast Leonardo DiCaprio is a fine actor indeed and may very well merit another Oscar nomination for his roll as an undercover in the Irish Mob but nothing is certain with the Oscars Mel Gibson wasn t even nominated for playing William Wallace in Braveheart even though Nicolas Cage was more than deserving of his well earned Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas Anyways back to The Departed Matt Damon also delivers a strong role and possibly the best performance of his career Is it just me or does Scorsese bring out the best in people Everyone is already quite aware of Jack Nicholson s quality as an actor so I ll only say one thing The personality he gives in his role as a criminal is surreal There are still 3 actors who must be noted for making The Departed all that it is Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin Each of them giving unforgettable performances They really stand out in the film and provide some humorous comments as well STORY From writer William Monahan Kingdom of Heaven and soon to be Jurassic Park IV comes an engaging thrilling and powerful story about corruption within the Boston Police and its ties with the Irish Mafia Two moles one within the police force tipping off the mafia and one with the mafia tipping off the police force play a frustrating game of cat and mouse to discover each other s identities That s the basic story line Throw in a little drama some very entertaining dialogue a couple gun fights and a few well placed twists and turns and you ve just seen The Departed Do all of Scorsese s movies have great screenplays or is it just me OVERALL The Departed is a must see and will hopefully win at least a few Oscars this upcoming year With a runtime of about 2 and 1 2 hours it keeps you engaged the entire time It s basically rated R for language a little sexuality and some traditional Scorsese violence Great acting cinematography screenplay musical score pieced together nicely and direction make The Departed an astonishing film,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1509847/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2006,"Yes, Its Really THAT Good",I walked into The Departed with pretty high expectations from Scorsese and his cast of all stars and walked out with all those expectations fulfilled and more Scorsese makes his first film in a while that is truly up to par with his classics Everything about it clicks together perfectly The acting is top notch on all fronts Everyone in the film gives a career defining performance Jack Nicholson steals every scene he s in with his best portrayal of a villain since The Shining If he does not receive at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars this year I ll be shocked Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio also turn in spectacular performances Leo especially made the character of William Costigan his own although the both of them tend to overdo the Boston accent a bit I m from Mass and the accent just isn t that prominent You can really feel a sense of stress and urgency in their voices that does not come off as forced Whalberg s performance is probably the weakest of the four leads but that doesn t really mean anything His job was still rock solid but just pales next to how well the others took their roles Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen Ray Winstone and Vera Farming all have well acted supporting roles as well The plot without telling you anything about it that isn t already out there revolves around the Massachusetts State Police trying to pin down reputed mobster Frank Costello Nicholson Costello s character appears to be loosely based real life Boston mobster Whitey Bulger Each organization has a mole in their ranks and the bulk of the action comes as they hunt each other down It really blurs the line between good guy and bad guy Honestly I don t think the film had a single legitimate good guy in it This is a film that you ll want to see repeatedly you ll pick up new plot details every time It s a very realistic portrayal of the struggle between the law and organized crime and a very poignant portrayal of the struggle for identity motivation and meaning for the soldiers on both sides of that war Scorsese could have ended the movie at about the 115 minute mark but chose to go on and wrap up the unresolved conflicts of all of the characters and that is what separates this from a run of the mill crime drama The violence in the film is some of the most realistic I ve ever seen Plenty of gray matter paints the walls during the course of the film The soundtrack also works very well centrally using Boston natives the Dropkick Murphy s cover of I m Shipping up to Boston to craft a great city atmosphere at the beginning of the film The Departed is the best film I ve seen this year It knocks both V for Vendetta and Little Miss Sunshine out of the tie for the top spot on the list The The 150 minute runtime just flies by It ll grab you by the neck and pull you in to it and hang on for dear live,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1490856/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2015,Talent was well used,My immediate reaction is Wow There is a lot to process I d heard about this movie and actually saw a bit of a spoiler from WatchMojo I never bothered to watch it before because I understood it to be a drama and I usually need to be in the mood for dramas With a movie so star studded it got me thinking about other star studded movies that actually delivered First let me qualify star studded I mean a movie having four or more actors actresses that are legitimate A listers e g Ocean s Eleven Rat Race Casino Pulp Fiction Independence Day Blues Brothers and Roots I m sure there are at least a couple names I m missing but these were the ones that immediately came to mind I d now like to add The Departed to that list Some of my least favorite star studded movies are Armageddon Be Cool Grown Ups and Soul Plane to name a few With star studded movies there are usually high expectations With high expectations there is either a meets outperform or underperform It s so easy to underperform because the bar is set so high This movie did not disappoint It was very cleverly written and of course well acted I would say that they all performed well but DiCapprio delivered an even better performance than the rest Scorcese did not waste the talent he had to work with,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3176013/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2006,"Ladies and Gentlemen I give you Mr. Scorsese's first BEST DIRECTOR WIN, excellent on every caliber, the best movie of the year",Wow I have always been a big Scorsese fan with Raging Bull to Goodfellas and even The Aviator And he still holds his place as one of the best directors just hearing his name will get me to see a movie And this is without a doubt one of the five best movies he s ever made Goodfellas Bull Taxi Driver and Casino being the others I M O Again teaming with DiCaprio for the third time along with screen legends Nicholson and Sheen who are both great especially Jack I ll spare you the whole complicated story line because it is just too long to explain but it is a brilliant well crafted and stunning piece of americana Scorsese is in top notch form and deserves the damn Oscar already the best movie I have seen all year long I loved The Departed,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491193/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2017,Another Great One From Martin Scorsese.,This is an all around great film It has the perfect cast the perfect plot the right amount of twists and action and it s perfectly written An under cover cop and a mole in the police department working for the Irish Mob ends up searching for one another in this craftily written film This film was directed by none other than Martin Scorsese who brought us great films like Goodfellas Casino The Wolf of Wall Street and Shutter Island As I said before this film has a great cast with Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio Alec Baldwin Anthony Anderson and Martin Sheen but to me the star of this film is obviously Jack Nicholson He brought his characteristic touch to this film which made it even more better You can t go wrong with this one,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3656463/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2006,more gore than Texas Chainsaw Massacre,What a disappointment Fun level of zero Realisism near zero Cops that do nothing but constantly scream the f word and get in fistfights with one another at the office all day every day Apparently assaulting an officer is OK if you are an officer A couple of Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies worth of pointless gore Uselessly jarringly filmed like a bad CSI episode And if I want to see that many people realistically killed I ll rent the entire Faces of Death series This movie is junk It should have been classified as horror so I could have avoided it But of course none of that was in the previews because once again the people making the previews have more talent than the director and writers of the actual movie,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1495950/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2011,He's still got it,Billy and Colin graduate from the police academy at the same time and are both hired by the SIU a group assembled to take on organized crime The former goes undercover to work for the Irish mafia And the latter he s an informant for selfsame mob Duality is the main theme here and it is explored well it s no accident that these two leads look so alike Both are affected by their double lives and both try to get help by and subsequently get to liking cop counselor Madolyn Nicholson does impeccable one of his best recent roles Wahlberg is quite impressive which is a bit new to me He also comes off really cool which goes for well all of the main cast Di Caprio and Damon are fantastic Sure the Boston accents are over the top well Matt s and a few others Baldwin appears to think he s portraying a Kennedy but that s easy enough to look past The slang is convincing and comes off mostly natural sprinkled across the sharp witty and swift dialog Characters are credible well defined and nicely developed through short effective scenes that set things up The pace is tight and the two hour 25 minute running time is packed This is directed superbly and the editing and cinematography are amazing The tension is thick and built expertly There is a lot of strong language bloody gruesome gory violence and a little sexuality in this The DVD comes with five trailers one of them for this the others being for The Painted Veil The Reaping 300 Blood Diamond I recommend this to any fan of Scorsese crime dramas and or the actors 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2513993/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,The Medal of Merit,Martin Scorsese should have won his Oscar for The Age of Innocence but had the misfortune to be up against Schindler s List that year The Academy finally made restitution by awarding him Best Director for this instead Thelma Schoonmaker s editing deservedly won a gong too but they definitely got a bit carried away when they also voted it Best Picture It s a terrific thriller with the usual Scorsese virtues of excellent production values performances and the usual Scorsese vices of almost comically excessive swearing violence It would never once have been deemed Academy Award material but it s 151 minutes flies by is full of twists and surprises and is easily one of Scorsese s most engrossing films to sit through,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5270673/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2006,Moles and the insidious tunnels they dig,Martin Scorsese has another major hit on his hands with the release of the intelligent chilling violent puzzling and completely fascinating THE DEPARTED This viewer has not seen the INFERNAL AFFAIRS on which this film is based so comparisons are not possible But taking this film solely on its own merits this is one gripping piece of cinematic art Beginning with a very smart script by William Monahan apparently based on the original screenplay by Siu Fai Mak and employing one of the best ensemble casts of the year Scorsese does what he does best in giving us a film that holds our attention our breath and our applause throughout The story involves two young recently graduated from police academy men from opposite sides of the law and backgrounds who are made moles within the Boston State Police department and the Irish mafia Leonardo DiCaprio is one and Matt Damon is the other and both young actors turn in committed and convincing performances On the polar aspects of the battleground are Jack Nicholson as the crime king Costello his finest work since A Few Good Men together with Ray Winstone as Mr French and on the other end are DiCaprio s mentors Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and Damon s mentors Alec Baldwin et al The very beautifully written female lead is played to perfection by Vera Farmiga who finally has a role a conflicted psychiatrist for the moles hat takes full advantage of her prodigious gifts as an actress Some may find the violence obsessively graphic but then this is Scorcese s style and for this viewer it is necessary for the drive of the story It is impossible to stop concentrating for a moment during this rapid fire drama spiced with just the right amount of wry humor making its running time in excess of two and a half hours speed by as fast as the many bullets in the atmosphere This is one of Scorsese s best films and one that begs to be seen again Grady Harp,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496987/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Brilliant,Having been a fan of the 2002 Internal affairs I entered the Cinema with a bit of trepidation Could they possibly match the excellence of the Hong Kong masterpiece it s 2 sequels Too bloody right they have This film seriously kicks arse Scorsese is truly at the top of his game the action is beautifully filmed Some top performances from DiCaprio 2 Whalbergs Matt Damon My only criticism is the that there seems to be less of an emotional connection between Sheen DiCaprio that in the original but it is more than made up by fast paced intelligent often hilarious dialogue If this film doesn t get Oscars there is no justice in the world,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491296/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2006,Don't Double-Cross Your Associates,More violence from Mafioso types in this latest Martin Scorsese insight to the underworld is not as brutal as Good Fellas or Daniel Day Lewis character in Gangs of New York but it does have it horrific moments perpetrated by Jack Nicholson Mark Wahlberg and several lesser Irish henchmen Apparently it s a less faithful remake of a revered Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs but true to the Scorsese canon and one of dedicated storytelling and character development Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play opposite infiltrators in the Costello Nicholson gang and city police department and they both are terrific It is a Brad Pitt production who originally had the Matt Damon role but it s a wonder that he withdrew and placed two actors who resemble each other Alec Baldwin shines as the police chief and is hilarious in a couple of scenes Martin Sheen lends suitable gravitas as chief of undercover detectives and Jack Nicholson is over the top in emoting and promoting his trademark leers sneers and swaggers There is a lot of double dealing and shocking set ups but it is a good film overall However it may not win Martin Scorsese his coveted Director s Oscar due to strong competition from other more family friendly films,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1533580/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2007,"Good, but overrated.",This was a very good film relative to a lot of the schlock that is out there these days but Best Picture Give me a break This is not even Scorsese s fifth best film in his cannon Good performances but the plot is unnecessarily confusing and Nicholson looks like he is just going through the motions It is worth viewing but it is not that great I think this was a weak year for the academy and they had to give Scorsese a Best Picture at some point in his career before he dies I think this film will be relatively popular on DVD but it will not stand the test of time anywhere near Goodfellas Raging Bull Taxi Driver and the very underrated Casino,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1623127/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2006,Good crime -thrilling drama by a directing legend that features an all-pro cast.,Last weekend when I went to the movies to see The Departed I knew I would see a good thriller and it didn t let me down Being a big Jack Nicholson fan this was a must see for me as I see all of his movies that was enjoyable but the plot and twist of this movie made it that much more pleasing Also The Departed features an all pro cast not only Nicholson but you have Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and being directed by a legend like Scorsese made it well worth a watch The Departed is a terrific cops and mobsters tale that is complicated and compelling You have the Massachusetts State Police ready to bring down ruthless mobster Frank Costello played perfect by Jack enter Boston bred police trainee Billy Costigan DiCaprio whose put undercover to dig dirt The police captain Sheen and command sergeant Wahlberg are the only ones to know of Costigan s assignment and nobody else does Scandals are unaware though when rising young sergeant Sullivan Damon is already in the special unit known only to his commander and Sullivan secretly is loyal to Costello who tips Frank off about the moves of police This movie then one by one becomes a puzzle hard to figure out as no one seems to be who they are I really like Scorsese s use of realism of the violence and intensity he shows of this film I guess that can be expected when dealing with the Boston mob though You will love the blood soaked gore and bullet scenes the best I ve seen in a while also The Departed is a film to me that shows one by one how people depart from business or the very life they have one by one as you will see in the film This is a must see because of the good plot and twist and the great acting,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1499171/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2008,Leaving the building...,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1865201/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,Not as good as Infernal Affairs,Having seen Infernal Affairs I had expectations that were perhaps unrealistic The 2002 film from Hong Kong had action and depth The writers of The Departed took an excellent story and expanded it The additions made added nothing to the story in fact they detracted from the main characters struggles The expansion of the mob boss character only served to highlight Jack Nicholson While I enjoy Jack as much as the next person the story is more about Costigan and Sullivan and their struggle with each other and their own demons I will admit that the acting was very good Unfortunately a great cast does not necessarily mean a great movie Scorsese was over the top in terms of the violence and side stories All in all I was very disappointed I expect American audiences will be pleased enough,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492527/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2006,A Nutshell Review: The Departed,The big question on the minds of those who have seen the original Hong Kong movie is whether this Hollywood remake is worth watching I d say hell yeah down to your last dollar weekend price or otherwise Infernal Affairs 2002 earned its place in recent Asian movie history for reenergizing the cop thriller genre Directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak the movie had a one of a kind storyline about mole vs mole in the underworld and the police and starred heavyweights Andy Lau and Tony Leung Chiu Wai in the lead roles with support by recognized character actors Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang with the appeal of Gen X Y actors in Edison Chen and Shawn Yue After opening to rave reviews and becoming a trilogy the rumour mill was out and about with Hollywood wanting to do a remake starring Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise whom to my personal speculation would have just been as riveting with either actors taking on either role It s a kind of Face Off situation where the distinction between good bad guys gets blurred Essentially with any spectacular gripping story you can have it done and made countless of times and each version should all come out great given that the source the story is the same However it is always easy to screw up and not meet expectations and herein likes the innate pressure that the cast and crew must have felt taking on something that works and making it their own In Martin Scorsese s The Departed the director teams up once again with Leonardo DiCaprio after two consecutive collaborations in Gangs of New York and The Aviator Here DiCaprio takes on Tony Leung s role as the police mole in the underworld headed by Frank Costello Jack Nicholson As Billy Costigan the biggest challenge is always to be on the positive side of an unsteady gangland boss and maintaining some form of sanity while dealing with an identity crisis Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan in a role modelled after Andy Lau s as the gang member inside the police force feeding information to Costello He finds himself living the good life and contemplates the risk in having throw it all away should he get caught And the cat and mouse game begins as both moles try to outwit outplay and outlast each other knowing that any revelation of their true identities will be totally disastrous each trying to flush the other guy out The acting s all round superb from both leads with a stellar ensemble featuring recognizable faces in Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin It s a welcome return for Nicholson back in the bad guy role after his recent attempts at comedies I thought each instance where Wahlberg came on is a hoot as his character Dignam comes with a dirty mouth which shoots off the cuff In fact Anthony Wong s character had to be split into two shared between Sheen and Wahlberg which I think is a nod to Wong s ability given two persons required to fill his shoes Newcomer Vera Farmiga took on Kelly Chen s role as the psychiatrist and Sammi Cheng s role combined into one doing away with probably an additional unnecessary character which the original featured There are other minor changes along the way no remake can be an exact copy of another but none too drastic keeping intact the integrity of the premise key scenes and plot elements and devices Clocking in at almost two and a half hours an hour longer than the original you will not feel its length even as the movie took its time to establish the story and its characters The dialogue is a major draw with some memorable lines and if you ve watched the original your mind is constantly racing to draw parallels but in most times you ll find it equally engaging and as exciting as if you re coming across the story for the very first time Of course the pivotal ending which was marred with the original having two of them to pander to being politically correct is one such scene which actually helps to build anticipation as to how Scorsese would have to conclude It s that sense of familiarity yet a sense of something new With some scenes being extended in duration it helped build a certain depth for the characters as well which does wonders for the movie But what I felt lacked in this remake was that personal link between the two moles of a what if scenario between the two before they faced off each other Here they are adversaries all the way but the original provided a sort of hint that if these two were on the same side of the law they could have been the best of friends Also in the first mole versus mole match up while in an attempt to be different from the original it unfortunately lacked the intensity that Infernal Affairs had but just for this particular scene If you re wondering if The Departed is as good as Infernal Affairs I d say it is a worthy remake except for that cheesy last shot before the end credits rolled Some folks are already screaming Oscars But remember Asian Cinema produced this gem first P S even though rated M18 locally there were noticeable cuts in the movie especially in dialogues,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1495498/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2008,It's okay,I found this movie to be rather boring I love Martin Scorcese s other films and when I saw this one win so many Oscars I expected something as good as Goodfellas which is a true masterpiece The acting was great and the cinematography was pretty good but the story barely held my attention About an hour and a half into it I wanted to turn it off but was compelled to finish it hoping for some really cool plot twist I figured that must be the reason that everyone liked it so much Perhaps there was too much hype but I was extremely disappointed I just don t see what all the fuss is regarding this movie Most of the movies that are coming out of the studios nowadays are complete garbage So now Scorcese makes a pretty good movie and people think it belongs in the top 50 of all time We re becoming complacent and settling for less This movie is good but not that good,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1793315/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2007,Mixed bag--Enjoyable but too many questions,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1636322/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2006,"Poor Script, Confusing Directing and Gratuitous Violence",This movie suffers from the unfortunate Tarantino Syndrome that we have to live with among Hollywood movies nowadays If you like to see brains blown out this is your movie You will probably forget that the plot makes no sense and that the directing does nothing but make it confusing Yeah of course you get to see many famous actors in one movie I guess that s the only positive I can say about the film Maybe it s not a positive thing considering the mess After seeing the movie I thought maybe the movie was suffering from difficulties of being based on a book but now I have read that it is really based on another movie Hong Kong movie Makes me curious if it could have been as bad as this I won t take the risk though,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1502143/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2016,"Great direction, writing and acting make this one a definite winner",With The Departed Martin Scorsese does that thing has done so successfully over the years where he takes what would ordinarily be pretty basic genre material and injects it with his particular dynamic style elevating the resultant movie in the process This of course was the film where he finally got the Oscar he so obviously craved and while this is certainly not his best film it s still a very good one indeed Its set around the Boston organised crime scene and it examines the blurry lines that exist between how the good guys and bad guys go about their business To this end an undercover agent is sent to infiltrate the Irish Mafia while in reverse the gangsters send in one of their young affiliates to enrol and work for the police department with the purpose of reporting back to the gangsters all police activity Before long their paths gets dangerously intertwined Aside from Scorsese s typically energetic and lively direction this one is notable for its extremely good cast There are so many top performers that it feels like an ensemble film Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play the two undercover men at the heart of the story and both actors offer up multi dimensional portrayals of their characters Its top drawer stuff from the two principals and it really helps draw the viewer in but there are so many other top actors putting in high calibre work here that it s impossible to mention them all in proper detail But suffice to say Jack Nicholson is at his charismatic best in the role of a somewhat unsympathetic and nasty crime boss Vera Farmiga is luminous and magnetic as a police psychologist who is the object of affections of both undercover men while Mark Wahlberg puts in an absolutely hilarious turn as a police boss with a decidedly confrontational manner This is superior stuff essentially Despite its many characters and plot avenues it s so very well written that it is always compelling and involving Along with the later The Wolf of Wall Street 2013 it showed pretty conclusively that despite his advancing years Scorsese was still at the top of his game and had certainly not mellowed with age,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3447020/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2007,Made me so angry,this is yet another remake of a classy stylish Chinese film called Innfernal Affairs Hollywood has managed to completely ruin this remake and instead of the gangsters being stylish they have become like poor white trash why would anyone think this is a good film granted if you haven t seen the original then the concept is good even if the film is not i would ask all those people who voted this as a good film to watch Innfernal Affairs the original then watch the departed the crappy remake and really think about whether you should give this film anything but an awful review thanks for taking the time to read this,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1570496/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2019,"Wannabe tough. Wannabe cool. Missing excellence. And I DID expect excellence from such a star cast. Could have been a lot better..., but it is still OK though",2 snitches try to rat out each other 1 good snitch Di Caprio is inside the mob 1 bad snitch Matt Damon is inside the police force Whose cover will be blown first That s the whole story A copy is often never as good as the original This movie is a copy of the original Infernal Affairs 2002 which is a much more subtle refined detective movie The difference in attitude is enormous Infernal Affairs is especially to be recommended for the arthouse movie fans and for those who find the many swearing and violent scenes obnoxious in The Departed The original Infernal Affairs is a gentleman s detective where one outsmarts the other with a smile and a polite yet deadly insult The Departed on the contrary is all about vulgarity and looking macho through acts of violence What a world of difference Something keeps nagging at me every time I see this copy with such a terrific star cast What do I miss I miss excellence And I DID expect excellence with such a terrific star cast Matt Damon is definitely miscast Matt Damon is always known to be the good guy in all his other movie roles but now he has to play a snitch a homophobic ruthless killer That role just doesnt look convincing although Damon tries his best The other actors are good in their roles but somehow I miss chemistry between them For that lack of chemistry I blame the director Scorsese Not every Scorsese picture has to be a brilliant classic but when a director tries to make such a grand star powered gangster movie he better deliver the product He missed the mark of excellence though But even when Scorsese doesnt excel it is still worthwhile the watch with such great acting talents therefore I will still reward it with 7 stars It could have been a lot better though,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5194594/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2008,Scorsese's Best Movie Sorry Goodfellas,Now although I thought Goodfellas should have won best picture over Dances With Wolves I m not quite sure what drugs the academy takes to name that movie best picture over Goodfellas this movie still takes the title as Scorsese s best movie in my opinion I believe Raging Bull Goodfellas and The Aviator were robbed of best picture sorry Gangs of NY but The Pianist deserved the 2002 nod for the best film of the year This would best Scorsese as the top director of movies that won best picture with 4 over William Wyler who directed three that took the title Mrs Miniver 1942 The Best Years of our Lives 1946 and Ben Hur 1959 However movies like Ordinary People Dances With Wolves and Million Dollar Baby stole Marty s fire I believe he is easily in the top 3 of greatest director s of all time Now for the movie One word MASTERPIECE The acting is top notch How Leo didn t get the best actor nod and Nicholson the best supporting actor along with Mark is a mystery to me At least the British Film Awards gave them both the nod Supporting cast along with Jack and Mark were great including Damon Sheen Winstone Baldwin and all the others make this a true acting masterpiece I m glad this movie finally got Marty the best director win while Raging Bull should have easily got him the award as should have Goodfellas and The Aviator and close competition with Gangs of NY but a loss to a worthy contender in Polanski The movie had just about everything a movie could have comedy drama suspense everything The screenplay was magnificent as well Bravo Marty 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1924966/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2022,Mother Macree joins the Boston PD*,I couldn t really see the first hour of this properly it was surrounded by a thick fog of Paddywhackery I hate films that make out a particular group of people to be somehow different and more interesting even especially when it s a group I belong to myself And when all s said and done it s a Hollywood movie whatever their supposed ethnic background the people in all of em behave much the same With its tragic history Ireland appeals to American sentimentality but the fact is they don t really understand it don t believe me Your president who claims to be Irish thinks it is okay to make jokes about the Black and Tans They don t make any distinction between Irish Anglo Irish Scots Irish and Scots History tells you there is all the difference in the world it s a bit like not distinguishing between Indian and Pakistani Serb and Croat or Russian and Ukrainian Characters like Jon McLane Carrie Matheson and Walter White are described as Irish because it s supposed to confer some kind of mystique but those aren t proper Irish names And a small example from this film why are the supposedly Irish in the grain Boston police pipe band playing Scotland the Brave on their Scottish bagpipes And if you were to ask does this stuff matter then your non Irishness is demonstrated without further possibility of doubt Most of all Americans can t do the accent certainly nobody in this can of course Englishman Ray Winstone plays his character as a cockney but that s how he plays every character from Beowulf to Henry VIII Okay I digress but so does this film When the ethnic fog does finally start to disperse it becomes a thriller a bit like GoodFellas a bit like LA Confidential a bit like Heat that for a while threatens to become interesting but in the end doesn t Jack Nicholson in what I suppose turned out to be one of his last starring roles is woefully miscast his pantomime style undermining any possibility of authentic grittiness In the end it s one of a string of indifferent films that have tarnished Scorsese s reputation as the guy who could successfully combine tough thrills with cinematic art I know it s not technically Boston PD but it rhymes,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8148501/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2007,"If Scorsese keeps this up,i might end up being a fan",The Departed is a searing crime opus directed masterfully by Martin Scorsese this film blew me away I m not generally a Scorsese fan but give the man credit when he wants to he can put on a directing clinic the film is populated with great actors inhabiting the roles of memorable characters both good and bad and some who are both or neither add in to the mix intense action double crosses and betrayal and you have one powder keg of a movie the movie is not told in a linear fashion in other words it is not straight forward yet never strays towards convolution or hard to follow territory the movie is ultra violently graphic and is very liberal in its use of profanity which makes it more authentically real there is a gritty almost unwashed feeling to the movie another positive the acting is second to none with a brilliant ensemble cast big name A listers and some lesser known though equally brilliant actors actresses the writers must also be given credit the dialogue is crisp smooth and intelligent The Depatrted is stylistic but with substance it will leave a lasting impact,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1565781/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2007,A Good Cast Working With A Great Story,Within the city of Boston there s a cat and mouse game going on Leonardo DiCaprio is Billy Costigan a Massachussetts State Trooper who s been able to infiltrate an organized crime group led by Frank Costello Jack Nicholson At the same time Costello has managed to get Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon into an influential position in the State Force s Special Investigations Unit The criminals know that there s a police mole in their midst and the police know that there s a criminal mole in their midst but no one knows their identities and both organizations gear up to discover who s betraying them To make things more interesting Sullivan the mole inside the police department ends up assigned to the task group trying to find the mole which is of course himself It sounds confusing but it really isn t The movie s quite straightforward and full of suspense over who s going to get found out first There are strong supporting performances from Nicholson Martin Sheen as Queenan who s in charge of the undercover cops and Alec Baldwin as Ellerby who heads up the Special Investigations Unit There are a couple of weaknesses in the movie I was unimpressed with Vera Farmiga s performance as Dr Madden the police psychiatrist who becomes Costello s live in girlfriend but who also develops an attachment to Costigan without knowing what either of them are doing Farmiga didn t strike me as believable in the role and the character of Dr Madden didn t strike me as very professional I also thought the movie became unnecessarily bloody in the last twenty minutes or so which detracted in my opinion from what had to that point been a nifty suspense movie I must have missed something in the body of the movie as well because without giving anything away I found myself confused by the last scene uncertain of the identity of the shooter or the reason for the shooting In any event I still thought The Departed was a very entertaining film and it certainly holds the viewers attention for its full two and a half hours 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1744473/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2015,Great,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3337869/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2020,A Rare Hollywood Remake That Outshines The Original In All Aspects,Helmed by a master filmmaker in complete control of his craft fuelled by a razor sharp script that packs armour piercing dialogues and further bolstered by a star studded ensemble that fires on all cylinders The Departed is one rare Hollywood remake that outshines its original in all aspects and ranks amongst the sharpest slickest most sophisticated examples of its genre Directed by Martin Scorsese the film marks the 3rd collaboration between Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio and finds the duo working in better harmony than ever before It is fast it is foul mouthed it is furiously paced it is frenetically thrilling Easily the most entertaining film of Scorsese s career until then the story exudes an unbridled energy that s unlike Scorsese s works yet exhibits his trademarks throughout What makes The Departed so gripping entertaining is that it never stops to take a breather and is always on the move Several subplots are at play and it s all headed in the same direction at the same pace DiCaprio impresses with another calculated input Matt Damon is excellent as well Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg are in prime form and yet all of them are overshadowed by Jack Nicholson s formidable show stealing act A dynamic blend of kinetic direction explosive screenplay energetic camerawork cut throat editing breakneck pace lively soundtrack outstanding performances The Departed is powerhouse storytelling that deftly merges style substance into an expletive extravaganza that will delight both Scorsese fans causal filmgoers One of the best films of its year one of Scorsese s finest and one of the greatest remakes in existence The Departed is genre filmmaking at its most vicious,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5408301/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,Fantastic,Was desperate to see The Departed because it was the first time I was catching up on a Scorsese movie in US on release date I am from India Making a 2 1 2 hr gangster flick is a very tough task But there are so many twists and turns that are there in this flick that 2 1 2 hrs just passed by without my knowledge Initially i took some time to get into the movie But once you are there you will get so involved with the characters that you actually feel whats going on with them Screeplay was very tight and gripping To actually make a movie about two guys who don t meet until the end is quite an achievement And the last half an hour was amazing I saw quite a few reviews which said that the climax as not up to the mark I totally disagree with them The scene when DiCaprio is shot the whole theater was shocked and I could hear the sounds like Oh My God Man it was amazing I was like What the heck was that One final word Marty You rock You simple do Planning to catch it one more time this weekend,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493424/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2018,Jack shows 'em how it's done,The Departed is a remake Therefore it must be merely a cynical cash grab right Wrong And it s not often anyone says that these days Yes it may be a remake of a 2002 film from Hong Kong but when it s directed by Martin Scorsese stars Jack Nicholson Leonardo DeCaprio and Matt Damon to name but a few you know that it s going to be very different some other recent remakes reboots and re imaginings I haven t seen the original so I can t compare the two films And I have a feeling that this US version will be remembered so fondly that many will soon forget that an original ever existing no matter how good it was A director as talented as Martin Scorsese it s no wonder he s dabbled with numerous types of film and genre but here he returns to arguably what he does best epic gangster movies I reckon that in time The Departed will be remembered alongside Goodfellas and the like It really is that good Or at least it is if you re into gangster films in general First of all there s the cast I ve already mentioned the main three but add Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin Ray Winstone just don t mention the Londoner s attempt at an American accent and Vera Farmiga It s fair to say that there isn t a bad performance among them and no Winstone wasn t THAT bad when it came to the accent they probably should have just made his character British and be done with it However for all these big names it s Jack all the way The old man of the film shows everyone how it s done Jack plays Frank Costello who is the head of the Irish mafia in Boston And therefore he s hardly a nice sympathetic character you ll feel inclined to root for Only you sort of do In the same way you d hardly feel comfortable sitting down to tea with Hannibal Lecter yet you can t help but see him as a hero or rather anti hero And this is all down to Nicholson s performance He oozes charm and likeability even when he s clubbing people to death or generally engaging in high level criminal activities In short this is Jack s baby The general story revolves around Frank s attempt to plant a bad police officer within the ranks of the force charged with the task of investigating him However what he doesn t know is that that very same unit is hatching a similar plot to plant a police officer among Frank s gang What follows is a pretty tense tale of cat and mouse where you re wondering which side will find out the truth first and more importantly the repercussions when they do I ll leave it there in terms of plot as there are more than a few moments that you probably won t see coming avoid internet spoilers if possible before watching There s little negative to say about the film it s quite long if that s really a problem when a film is this good and I think that the only people who may not enjoy it are those who generally aren t a fan of the genre If you don t like crime movies in general you won t like it Same goes for if foul language and violence is not your thing However if like most you can appreciate an excellent film that doesn t pull any punches and is just about as perfect as any film is these days then this is definitely worth a watch,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4331214/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2018,Top-Notch Gangster Film - The Departed,Martin Scorcese is a Hollywood legend He knows New York City He knows Boston and he knows gangsters The script is outrageously good The photography is outstanding Everything in the movie was impeccable except the casting And no I am not going to say Pacino should have had Nicholson s role Jack was just fine I just think that the two roles of the leading men should have been switched Damon is a tougher guy than Dicaprio And Wahlberg is tougher than both of them but he was cast perfectly Dicaprio in a fight with Wahlberg I don t think so Dicaprio as a tough guy Sorry I m not buying Didnt buy him in Gangs in New York as a tough guy either Just like I never bought Mongomery Clift as a tough guy in From Here to Eternity or in The Young Lions Seeing Dicaprio win a fight with anyone in a film gives me the same feeling as when I saw Clift win a fight with John Wayne in a Western It just didnt convince my senses Other than the switch in the lead roles the film is almost perfect except for the love scenes with Dicaprio which pretty much fall into the same category as the fight scenes Please Choosing Dicaprio over Damon LOL It was like watching Lily Tomlin in a love scene with John Travolta Great film though,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4411445/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2006,A Great Film,This is the best film i have seen in God only knows how long It was amazing Every performance in this film is flawless Mark Whalberg is amazing i didn t know he was that good Jack Nicholson is the top of his game Yes he is always amazing but in this film i think he is extra wonderful The scene where he is talking about smelling a rat is stunning I could go on and on but as i said there is not a bad performance in this movie Now let us talk about the genius that is Martin Scorsese Now i am a little biased on the judging of directing because i think Scorsese is brilliant but if you don t already agree with me see this film and i am sure you will The film is stunning This has to be Scorsese s year at the Oscars or something is up The writing of the film is brilliant You must see it to believe it You will not be able to predict a move in the movie especially the ending Highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a great piece of art,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1524300/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2016,Scorcese made another good gangster movie.,This film revolves around an Irish American gang and police attempts to fight it Directed by Martin Scorsese it has a screenplay by William Monahan and a cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson The film was nominated for five Academy Awards winning four of them Best Editing Best Adapted Screenplay Best Director and Best Picture This film is undoubtedly one of the most interesting films I have seen about organized crime The script is excellent with many twists and very good action scenes holding the public until the end The performance of the main actors is quite interesting particularly Nicholson who manages to make his character truly intimidating and unpredictable The characters of DiCaprio and Damon are equally rich owners of a complex psychology several moments of confrontation and very well thought out dialogue Even some supporting characters are particularly notable and complex which is less and less seen in current cinema but always welcome The photography is excellent and careful and the sound effects and the soundtrack by Howard Shore full of themes and moments with strong Irish flavor The direction of Scorcese seemed to me worthy of little criticism in a kind of recurring film on the work of the filmmaker responsible for Goodfellas So this is a great action movie full of entertainment and made to hold and surprise the audience,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3501747/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2012,"Meh, entertaining but nowhere near Marty's best work.",The Departed is a film with massive hype and expectation laid upon it but unfortunately it doesn t deliver Nicholson Plays himself its not believable that he s a widely feared crime boss there s too much larking around Damon He s too rigid A man who has been brought up around the mob would be violently bubbling with insanity under the surface not a cross between Spock and Jason Bourne DiCaprio Terrific throughout But his performance is distracted from by the terrible casting of the characters around him I d have liked to see Michael C Hall play Sullivan PS how can some people compare this to Goodfellas Different league,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2690568/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2007,This movie blows!,There is NOTHING redeeming about this movie The story is cold The performances are two dimensional Even Jack Nicholson portrays the stereotypical Jack Nicholson But worst of all there is 1 no character in the movie to identify with 2 No moral lessons 3 Poor direction most of the time you don t know whats going on THIS MOVIE IS JUST PLAIN SICK It s as gawd awful as porn and even worse The impressionable are the only ones that can learn anything from this how to get ahead in the mob And since there s nothing to be gained from this it must be entertainment I m sorry but seeing brains splattered against a wall IS NOT ENTERTAINING This is the most horrible film I ve seen in years It s just plain sick And those who like this movie are easily misled There is art and then there is crap This is pure crap,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1649889/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2007,"An Instant Scorsese Classic, Nicholson Dominates...",The Departed will join director Martin Scorsese s other classic crime dramas arguably on a par with GoodFellas in particular This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007 winning Best Picture Best Director Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay This classic film is set in Boston where two young police cadets Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are pulled into the web of betrayal and murder orchestrated by Irish crime boss Frank Costello played by the legendary Jack Nicholson The complex plot is based on the Hong Kong film Internal Affairs 2002 of which The Departed is a remake The film is packed with A list talent in addition to that mentioned above the movie also stars Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg The screenplay for The Departed is among the best ever written for a crime drama it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture a well deserved and long delayed honor for one of America s greatest directors It s easy to see why Scorsese won for this film it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director Jack Nicholson dominates this film His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen The Costello character is ruthless and Machavellian to say the least he adopts the young Colin character Conor Donovan played as an adult by Matt Damon who grows up to join the Massachusetts State Police thereby giving the crime boss an inside man within law enforcement and the perfect ally to protect and expand his various rackets From Nicholson s opening line he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries Leonardo DiCaprio has grown to full maturity as a true A List actor His third collaboration with Scorsese following 2002 s Gangs Of New York and 2004 s Tha Aviator as police cadet turned undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed illustrating Scorsese s continued ability to draw out DiCaprio s best interpretations Matt Damon revisits familiar territory as a South Boston cop this role recalls his performance in Good Will Hunting complete with authentic Boston accent Damon also works well under Scorsese portraying the duplicitous crooked cop Colin his performance is sharp and well balanced Mark Wahlberg s character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity giving him the majority of the hilarious one liners and zingers in this film Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg s character as Chief Queenan Providing further evidence of perfect casting is Alec Baldwin who portrays Lieutenant Ellerby the most crass and humorous of the veteran officers Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing authoritative Mr French Costello s most trusted enforcer The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets The Departed is a instant classic a great movie for fans of gritty violent crime dramas ala The Sopranos Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film his best work to date,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1636302/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2013,"Outstanding Performances All Around,",The Departed is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast Martin Scorsese hits it out of the park once again in one of his most impressive movies to date it combines all the aspects of film that he is fantastic at directing character development action and strong dialogue based scenes it all comes together to make an instant classic he may have done gangster and mob films before but this film stands out as very original and intriguing two and a half hours My only real criticism for the film would be that it focuses on Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio s characters too much I understand that they are the main characters but there were many other terrific characters that were left feeling underdeveloped particularly Frank Costello and Dignam they were both the most engrossing characters mainly because of their outstanding portrayals from Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg and I would have loved to have seen more from them The performances in this film are outstanding there isn t a single example of poor or mediocre acting here everyone gives it there all the film isn t really driven by one character it s driven by many and thankfully everyone knew what they were doing Intense very well acted and engrossing I would recommend the Departed to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film After two cops working for both the police force and an Irish mob gang learn they are in the presence of a rat they race to track down one another Best Performance Jack Nicholson,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2931993/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2019,"Gets Much, Much Better As A Crime Drama Over The Years",With an all star cast director Martin Scorsese has directed a tight emotionally tense stark crime drama Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg Vera Farmiga and Alec Baldwin produce powerful performances in this drama that depicts the psychological life and death interplay of two dueling characters each playing deep undercover on opposing sides of the dark streets of Boston Thirteen years after my first review which resulted in a mediocre seven out of ten this is a rare movie that has grown tremendously with a renewed sense of dramatic excitement as the riveting script and performances grip the audience It is likely the difficult but terrifying ending was experienced many years ago as so unsettling that to negatively color the entire movie But Boston is to be expected to be a tough town and along with it a tough movie to depict some hardened and strongly harsh performances The only slight weakness is how Matt Damon s backstory develops while Leonardo DiCaprio seems to get a much more slighted development Nevertheless from beginning to end this hard edged gripping crime thriller hits the mark as one of the smartest crime movies as opposed to typical action packed over the top thrillers 31 October 2006 While I understand why many moviegoers may get a bang out of this movie and can convince themselves that this is a great movie with all these great actors the execution of the movie still leaves something wanting The beginning of this movie is awkward as the backstory of up and coming Colin Sullivan get special attention while the more down and out perhaps even more integrity based Billy Costigan gets secondary attention The understanding of these characters are not convincing played out in the beginning but the eventual plot development into the tight corners is tense intriguing and very well done However by the end of the movie which is its major downfall is that the execution becomes murder literally manipulative and too easy a way out for the scriptwriter and director There isn t any of the more intellectually cool lingering on story that a more sophisticated and higher quality movie could have taken The love romance also seems weakly developed in both instances and the real potential of a starker more conflicted role is overlooked The director uses surprise shock value to attempt to impress its audience and push onto us a much more mechanical ending than a more deliberate convoluted and psychologically satisfying resolution of the movie The acting was great the interplay and thrills were spectacular Unfortunately the final product ultimately unwound itself outside Oscar quality except perhaps for several of the performances Matt Damon Leonado Dicaprio Mark Walberg do really shine nevertheless while Alec Baldwin is underperformed in the script Seven out of Ten Stars,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4598876/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,Departed Affairs...........,It would be a shame to compare this film to the Infernal Affairs trilogy though I would admit that I enjoyed Infernal Affairs still didn t watch the later 2 but you shouldn t look at this film like it was the finger print copy of the Hong Kong version because it s completely a different film Yes the story and everything else is identical to Infernal Affairs apart from the language and location All cars are running on the same concept since the day they were born you need wheels to drive you you need an engine to drive the wheels you need a fuel to drive the engine yet how come we got over a hundred different car manufacturers when its the same design under the hood think of it like this The Departed is a luxurious Italian car while Infernal Affairs is a luxurious British car the problem is people s taste not everybody in the world love football This is a great movie great acting and the cinematography is just simple and yet so complex Jack Nickolson is still a great actor though he did act like he was the joker from batman If you re going to watch this film then watch it like you ve never seen Infernal Affairs and if you haven t seen Infernal Affairs then I suggest you watch both but don t compare them,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1509393/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,"""I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.""",The South Boston Irish mafia boss Frank Costello has been raising his prot g Matt Damon since he was a child to one day grow into a respected police inspector take some good position in the police and with information and misconduct keep him and his criminal organization safe On the other hand the character of Leonardo DiCaprio goes straight from the police academy to prison in order to gain criminal credibility infiltrate the Irish mafia and lead to Costello s arrest The whole film comes down to a game of cat and mouse in which two informants try to expose each other And the atmosphere additionally heats up even when they both get involved with the same woman The cast consists of really big names Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Martin Sheen Alec Baldwin and they all did a great job except maybe Damon who is a bit wooden The Oscars for directing and editing are deserved but although the script and the film itself are at a high level those two Oscars in my opinion may be misplaced Although I didn t check the competition that year I doubt there were not any better ones The film is complex the atmosphere is thick and holds the attention for all two and a half hours but the characterization is at times quite unconvincing and I would say caricatured which is a plus in comedy or satire but in crime drama and thriller it doesn t hold water As the film progresses the story becomes less and less realistic and more and more like in comics There is more and more obvious unnecessary violence which passes without consequences and as the corpses pile up the film becomes more and more unconvincing and the ending more and more predictable The very end which if the film had been more moderate would have had a striking surprise effect is largely losing its force after all that slaughter However the last shot made me sincerely smile Awesome idea 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8128737/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2006,An excellent spy movie,Taking place in South Boston this is a tale of police officers and Irish gang members spying on one another Infiltrated young undercover cop assigned to the Irish mafia mob gets to gain the trust of chief Frank Costello On the other side another young officer has infiltrated the police department as an informer working for Frank Both of these cops become deeply involved with their own task and end up with a double life Each running scared trying to uncover the identity of the other man before it is too late This is a classic spy movie with great performance all around from some of the best in Hollywood If you liked the usual suspect you will like this film as well You will not know who is spying on who until the VERY end of the movie With multiple endings it leaves you thinking for days,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1521476/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,The Departed is one of the best movies I've seen in years!,Whoa I read the reviews on Ain t It Cool News and I have to say despite their hyper active vocabularies they nail it More appropriately Scorcese nails it as does Jack Nicholson Matt Damon Mark Wahlberg Leo DiCaprio Anthony Anderson Alec Baldwin and pretty much everyone else in the movie This movie rocks and rolls and it kicks ass so completely I was shocked I mean I went to see a Scorses gangster flick I didn t expect a gangster flick the sits up there with The Godfather In a lot of way Boston is getting a lot of attention from gangster cinema I mean I just got done watching Brotherhood really good TV and this is like that but a much bigger picture Departed is the ultimate cop rat movie and I hope Scorcese has a dozen more in him just like it I won t go into details but Baldwin Sheen and Wahlberg are amazing Nicholson gives an unbelievably believable performance and scared heck out of me And for once I d actually like to be friends with Leo DiCaprio That last is a minor miracle I never saw what anyone else ever saw in the guy Not till last night Enjoy it I know I did and I ll watch it a dozen times in the future enjoying every moment,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492309/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,"Taunt, fun, instantly forgettable",Is there any scenery left on set after these actors are done chewing Leo Dicaprio remains the most unlikable one note star of his generation here inhabiting yet another of Scorsese s anonymous compromised men meant to represent virtue in a film that mocks the very concept All the fun here is had by Damon and Nicholson And really no one else matters The Departed is just another entry in Scorsese s long line of gangster fetish plays overlong self important movies devoid of women and third acts The film is titillating but ultimately hollow and that s troublesome because so much of story is centered around filial bonding and deep connections Loyalty the film calls it But do these films ever have a different outcome Well into that third act you realize that every box has been checked and it s time to go home Everything gets resolved in the first hour yet we go through the motions because we trust Scorsese to entertain us The best Scorsese movies resonate with a sense of having come to terms with the internal world of a misfit Here only the gangsters show any soul and it s a tiny malformed one at best If this were a debut from a young director we d praise the film for its accomplished sense of tension and question it s length and self importance But as a Scorsese picture it s pretty unremarkable,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7696304/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,And they call it The Justice System?,The Departed 2006 I say it about a lot of films lately but this could easily be made in to a six part TV series There is so much going on and such an interesting story to tell that it could be fleshed out to fill six hours and never be boring because you know that there s loads of details that could be expanded upon However in this version as it is they have managed to get all the right information in without it becoming slow at any time and without losing the plot by moving it forward too quickly It s all shown clearly so that there s no danger that you might blink and miss things I would say that it has been perfectly edited and that is perhaps why it appears on so many top film lists It does have that brash American style that I just don t like as seen in other films like Goodfellas 1990 Boyz N The Hood 1991 and Seven 1995 you know the type of thing where they re all just shouting over each other and swearing a lot but this is certainly one of the best ones and manages to calm that tendency down to make it more enjoyable and easier to view They get the balance right The story is busy and quite clever both of the leads on the fence of the law hanging somewhere in between right and wrong and you can never tell who might do what for whom or what way they will ultimately lean The pair are connected so simply and yet are completely oblivious of each other in some ways As for the actors Leo looks like a little boy and the bum fluff on his chin doesn t help his severe hair cut to make him wholly believable as the mobster type He does do a good job but it might have been a better role for him five years later I wasn t as keen on Matt who reminds me of his character Linus from Ocean s Eleven 2001 so if we didn t already known that he was dodgy it would have been very obvious Again he does a good job but he is too recognisable in that devious and sneaky style They might work better if their roles were reversed I thought that about Leo and Joseph Gordon Levitt in Inception 2010 as well I wonder if Mr DiCaprio throws a tantrum if he doesn t get the part he wants When he can get through his new teeth Martin Sheen isn t bad but Marky Mark is obnoxious he actually makes me want to punch him and I m a complete pacifist It is nice to see him in a serious film and yet he and Alec Baldwin still seem comical somehow I expected him to go home and tell his giant Teddy bear about his day over a beer and for Alec to go to Central Perk to meet Phoebe Jack Nicholson though is superb in his role an enigma of sorts and not over the top with his delivery although there were very small glimpses of The Joker from Batman 1989 in there I think that perhaps other than Jack the main issue I have with this one is the casting because actually it is a very good film despite not being the type that I would usually prioritise to watch It slightly comes across as if the actors had produced it so that they could play the parts that they wanted to and didn t consider who was really the best for the roles although I can see that s not the case from the crew listings A welcome surprise I seem to have pointed out a lot of negatives but as you can see from my score it is still very much worth watching especially if you are a mobster film fan 811 04 1000,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7987935/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2023,Entertaining But Over-The-Top Depiction of Mob Violence and Police Corruption,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9399002/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2023,Overrated Misfire by Scorsesse,Very surprised at the the rave reviews for thsi bust It s basically a mobster movie with Irish instead of Italian mobsters Only Scorcesse is way better at the Mafia than the Irish mob The story is frenetic It bounces all over the place and the two main characters are just not that interesting DiCaprio and Damen just arent strong actors Even Jack turns in a lackadazical performance Mark is good tho And Balwin is non existent Frankly I was underwhelmed by the entire movie which runs nearly two and a half hours long The Scorcesse trademark rock and roll soundtrack is there but it seems like the vast majority of it is the Stones Not much variation I was thoroughly disappointed,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9400748/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2006,Scorsese back to form,The Departed 2006 Dir Martin Scorsese Rating If you like good things go see this film Scorsese s best film in years What s Good About It They say that people elevate the level of play if they believe in their coach Which is evident this year in the miracle that is the Detroit Tigers and it is evident that every one of these actors great in their own right upped every ounce of their game for Scorsese Scorsese is back to what he does best after more than a decade since Casino and he shows that he hasn t lost any of his balls in the decade despite the scientific likelihood that his ability to procreate has decreased with age Anyways despite a couple things I didn t like on his end this film was gloriously directed with the pace of a healthy bowel movement slow and steady with spurts of speed and spatter It also brings back a lot of the directorial instinct I liked from Taxi Driver and haven t really seen him explore again Some people say that being a child and being elderly are very similar and I hope that this is the beginning of Scorsese s second childhood where he re finds what made him a unique voice to begin with OK the acting in this film is some of the most top notch acting by a group of individuals I have seen in a long time They don t act like an ensemble ie United 93 which is what made the film a lot better all were individuals who were after their own goals and all even appeared to have their own mini film within in the film It s something that doesn t work very often unless you get the right mix of actors and this mix of actors is glorious all of which I would love to work with I would love to write a paragraph on all of them from Ray Winstone to Alec Baldwin to Kevin Corrigan but that would take FOREVER so I will talk about the highlights Finally FINALLY someone cast Leonardo DiCaprio in a role that he was suited for I didn t like him as Howard Hughes in the The Aviator I thought there were dozens of actors better suited for that role that Leo I am not saying that he was bad he just didn t have the tools or the look I am of the belief that Leo gets miscast more than any other actor just because people really wanna have Leo in their films and in only 1 out of 4 films is he ever cast correctly Such as Catch Me If You Can Titanic being the reason people wanna cast him and do so incorrectly for everything he was casted in before this i have no qualms with I think Leo really defined himself as an adult actor with this role before he was playing roles that he was still coming of age or still the young kid This was an adult role that he took and hit out of the ballpark out of the number of Oscar nominations I assume this film will get his will be one that was actually deserved not to take anything away from the rest of the film its just a film that the academy will over praise I am sure I was happy to see Martin Sheen kickin it again on the big screen and he was great The team up with Mark Wahlberg s character made for some of the most memorable portions of the film Both these actors are actors that I have enjoyed for a while and I am happy to see them both doing something other than The Italian Job 12 Wahlberg and small screen fare Sheen That will be all that I go into detail about what is good for there was so much that I can t really get into it all unless I write an epic and I don t write epics unless its about poo or holes in my shoes so I shall move on to What Was Bad I am going to go out on a limb and say Jack Nicholson He is so close to brilliance in this film but I feel it crossed over into ridiculous cartoonish evil Really I hate to say it because there is so much to like about the performance but I even feel that the film makers saw what I saw and his part in the film feels edited down also from the information I have read in interviews and other literature on the film Though I will give him praise for taking risks in his character for there were many because there isn t enough risk taking in Hollywood today and it was great to see a well established actor who is known for taking risks take some Also I will say this and I won t write any spoiler though it doesn t hold a bearing on the story the last frames of the film almost ruined it for me They did something I despise and that is toss in a simple ass visual metaphor and symbolism just so that the idiot average film goer can think he figured out a subtle insinuation from the film maker when and if you see the film you will know what I mean it s literally the last frames of the film before the creds Epilogue If you like any Scorsese see this film If you like any Quentin Tarantino specifically Reservoir Dogs see this film BUT DON T TAKE YOUR MOM S OR YOUR KIDS This film is rough so show it to people judiciously,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493772/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2006,Stories Grandpa used to tell,This film reminds me of stories my Grandpa used to tell They always started out great and got you hooked Then somewhere along the way Grandpa would lose his train of thought He would then mix it up with some other story he used to tell and get completely off base Then Grandma would come in and tell him to take his meds at which point he would give some quick wrap up to the story leaving us completely unfulfilled I loved the characters I loved the acting and I loved the development of the story However somewhere along the way the story becomes implausible and the ending falls off considerably Worth seeing but not memorable Oscar worthy in a slow year maybe,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1514580/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2013,A crazy ride,I saw Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs 2002 a couple of years before Martin Scorsese s Hollywood remake The Departed I remember little of it now but I do remember finding it to be an ingenious idea and a gripping little movie albeit a little overrated Scorsese obviously saw potential in the idea as The Departed is admittedly bloated but packed to the gills with eccentric criminals sweary cwops and CGI blood expanding the story and characters and executed in that uber stylish way that the director is so well known for I ll avoid comparisons to Infernal Affairs as the two share very little in common apart from basic story and Scorsese makes this film very much his own Colin Sullivan Matt Damon is enlisted into mob boss Frank Costello s Jack Nicholson crime ring at a young age and is raised to be an informant in the Massachusetts State Police New police academy graduate William Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio a rough and ready type from a colourful family is forced into going undercover in Costello s gang by Captain Queenan Martin Sheen and Sergeant Dignam Mark Wahlberg When a rat is exposed on both sides the two must search desperately for the other before they are unwillingly revealed Unbeknownst to the both of them they also share a girl in psychiatrist Madolyn Vera Farmiga If you go into this film expecting a gritty and realistic urban crime thriller you will be disappointed Although the subject matter is grim and it certainly doesn t pull its punches when it comes to violence this is a shiny movie with explosions of bloodshed akin to the comic book aesthetic of manga and asks you to suspend your beliefs for the duration I mean Costello is a known maniac with no fear of dispatching his own yet Costigan becomes his right hand man within months even though he is known to be ex police There are plenty of plot holes that I could mention but won t bother as they are there for the purpose of telling an entertaining story This is Scorsese as unhinged as he s been in years letting the story just unravel regardless of just how mental it becomes Nicholson an actor I cannot believe had never worked with Scorsese before gets frequently mentioned as stealing the show He certainly steals his scenes and grabs the opportunity to improvise with both hands waving a severed hand in a bag around in one scene and inexplicably covered with blood in another Costello wouldn t last a minute in real life he s just too obvious and psychopathic but in this world he thrives and is a memorable Nicholson creation But it s actually Wahlberg that steals the show getting lines such as if you had an idea of what we do we would not be good at what we do now would we We would be c s Are you calling us c s It s a testament to his performance that he has probably 10 minutes of screen time and received an Oscar nomination DiCaprio and Damon fill their roles admirably the former being the incarnation of anxiety and the latter proving surprisingly slimy given his history of generally wholesome characters But its the ensemble that really shines in this array of ridiculous and cartoon characters By the end questions of identity and who is really important to the story get blurred with a climax of endless bloodshed The prize of Best Picture and Best Director now seem somewhat silly and surely a sympathy vote for Martin Scorsese who has made at least ten other movies more deserving of rewarding his talent But this is a crazy ride and one that remains gripping and surprising throughout bolstered by a smart script and a hell of a cast www the wrath of blog blogspot com,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2885626/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2012,good 3/4 but bad ending,The Departed starts out great with Jack Nicholson narrating an overview of the crime scene in Boston beginning in the 1960s Jack is Frank Costello head of the Irish mob and at war with the older Italian Mafia Frank befriends Colin Sullivan Matt Damon who joins the state police organized crime unit and becomes an informant to Jack providing him with vital information Billy Costigan Leonardo Di Caprio is chosen to go undercover and then commits a crime in order to establish credibility with the mobsters and infiltrates the criminal underworld Departed then becomes a cat and mouse game with each side being aware of the others existence but knowing the actual identity The cast is magnificent with Jack Leonardo Matt plus Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin it is an allstar lineup The problem is both the two and a half hour running time and closing fifteen minutes so bad that it s laughable It s as if Moe Larry and Curley from the three stooges took over from Scorcese to complete the project Best Picture no way it should have been Pan s Labyrinth a masterpiece from Guillermo Del Toro The academy blew it big time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2587118/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2021,Tension Filled Crime/Drama,This is my third time seeing this movie It is such a great anxiety driven piece of cinema Watching this I said I couldn t do this type of work that means crime or bring an undercover cop I think the acting from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon The acting is great across the board I do think Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicholson can be a bit over the top but it doesn t hurt it We have good cinematography the effects we get are good and the soundtrack is fine It runs a bit long but I m not sure what I would trim This is an excellent crime police story with a wonderful duality of our leads My Rating 9 5 out of 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7389790/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2010,Excellent film.,The story of two moles One in the mob and he other in the police The Departed is a great movie with really great characters At first they might seem a too many at least for me but in the end you know that they all were important somehow The acting was great Nicholson is one terrific actor he is always great in his movies Damon is pretty good as well But DiCaprio really surprised me He turned into a great actor as well I now consider him as a really serious actor with more potential than I originally thought he had For instance he was in Titanic But that s just old news The plot was really well polished I think it was smart enough to make this film a good title And just like the story the script helped a lot But considering that many things were ad libbed the price goes for the actors In the end I recommend this movie It might enjoyable for everybody Even if this is not the original movie I haven t seen the original film Mou Gaan Dou though but now I m definitely want to watch it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2261829/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2016,"One of the Most Brilliant, Subtle and Compelling Thrillers of the Modern Era",It is not often that one is prompted to describe a thriller as brilliant but that description can certainly be applied to THE DEPARTED Set in South Boston a few years ago it depicts the struggles between the State Police and an Irish gang led by Frank Costello Jack Nicholson for supremacy of the streets Such battles are complicated by the known presence of moles within the police force as well as in the gang but no one not least the protagonists themselves knows who they actually are This is the bare framework of a plot that engages in complex issues of identity politics THE DEPARTED is a symbolic title not only referring to central character Billy s Leonardo DiCaprio s loss of personal identity once he joins the State Police but prompting speculation on whether other characters in the film suffer an equal loss as well Billy and Colin Sullivan Matt Damon are conceived as doppelgangers they dress the same go out with the same girl Vera Farminga and pursue roughly the same existences Their behaviors are so similar that it becomes difficult to separate them This is the film s point corruption is so endemic in South Boston that it is perhaps futile to separate the good from the bad or to expect those either serving or abusing the law to sustain their identities They have all become part of the same maelstrom engulfing the city It is this condition that helps to explain the complications of the plot It does not really matter who is doing what with which and to whom the characters are simply struggling to survive in a world that is beyond their comprehension Even Frank Costello the gang boss with a cocksure attitude about what he wants to do now and in the future often seems somewhat lost even though he conceals his insecurities beneath an arrogant exterior The action is perpetually edgy with no one really trusting in anyone else Colin is perpetually at loggerheads with his fellow police officer Dignam Mark Wahlberg and we never really know for sure which side Queenan Martin Sheen is actually on Police operations are elaborately planned but foiled by the criminals likewise the criminals seem unable to put their plans into successful operation It is perhaps because of this lack of success that everyone so distrusts one another In the end there is a resolution of sorts with the protagonists apparently getting their just comeuppances But Scorsese is keen to underline the ironies of the denouement just because some people have passed away does not mean that there won t be others ready willing and able to fill their places thereby continuing the corruption in Boston that seems insoluble As a comment on dystopian America in the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries THE DEPARTED cannot be bettered A modern classic,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3537613/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2010,A Great Thriller and A Great Remake,After years of rejection one of the greatest filmmakers in history won his well earned Oscar for The Departed Martin Scorsese could and should have won for Taxi Driver Raging Bull Goodfellas Casino or Gangs of New York but he has at least avoid being in the ranks of great directors who never won an Oscar like Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock The Departed is based on a brilliant Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs which was itself was attempting to be a Hollywood thriller Seeing that Infernal Affairs was a brilliant film which had two good sequels Plan B Entertainment did the wisest thing it could get the best writer and director available William Monahan and of course Scorsese South Boston is a famously Irish Catholic area of America it s underworld is run by Frank Costello Jack Nicholson a ruthless gangster who gets up to usual activities like drugs trafficking extortion theft etc He recruits a boy who trains to be a police officer Colin Sullivan Matt Damon who becomes his mole within the Massachusetts State Police Another recruit was Billy Costigan Leonardo DiCaprio a young man whom family is notoriously dodgy He gets recruited by Captain Queenan Martin Sheen and Staff Sergeant Dignam Mark Wahlberg in his best performance to go deep undercover and infuriate Costello s organisation So the mob and police have moles in each other and both men raise up the ranks within their organisations Sullivan does well for himself joining a special unit making money has a good apartment need the state building and forms a relationship with Dr Madolyn Madden Vera Farmiga Whilst Costigan has to deal with the stress of being undercover having live in a violence world deal with the enforcer Mr French Ray Winstone and has to see Madolyn Both the mob and the police discover they have moles in their organisations and a deadly cat and mouse develops as the two men have to find out who the other is These is an excellent remake translating the setting well to America It keeps the basic plot of Infernal Affairs adding a few elements from Infernal Affairs 2 but Scorsese and Monahan ensure that they make their own film an excellent thriller not just about crime and police investigation but about the ideas of identity betrayal and the psychological strain this world would have on a person Both the mob and the police are very macho worlds where people need to be tough to survive These are complex characters in a difficult world where loyalties can be made and broken Scorsese and Monahan also tells a complex plot with a number of things going on It is a film about the conflict between the police and organised crime Scorsese also shows his skill behind the camera once again showing some excellent images and a world of violence He brings you into this complex world They is a great cast in this film Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Martin Sheen As stated Mark Wahlberg was in his best role and could have won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor a shame he torched it all in 2008 There is also a good comic moment between Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin Vera Farmiga also shows her talent and is now doing pretty well for herself 2006 was an excellent year for film The Departed Casino Royale Children of Men Pan s Labyrinth The Lives of Others The Last King of Scotland Letters from Iwo Jima all worthy films that could have won awards at the 79th Academy Awards,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2205768/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2006,"Stunning remake: but why a remake, from Scorsese?",Writer William Monahan uses a borrowed premise borrowed plot for Martin Scorsese s exciting and violent new crime movie The Departed The Irish Catholic intonation of the title emphasizes the Boston setting We re far from the HongKong of the original Wai Keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak s Infernal Affairs A group of Chinese triad gangsters are mocked with racial epithets as if to further distance the new version from the Asian original But the HongKong source remains It s an illustrious one the original was a well made well acted film and so hugely successful two sequels appeared before this remake could be finished Internal Affairs mirror image plot structure is so clever and one might almost say so obvious that it s surprising it was never used before It gets deeper than ever into the always potentially incestuous sometimes interchangeable relationship between cops and robbers In this story the two main characters do cross over And their goal is to stay there In the original there is perhaps more of a sense conveyed of how hard it is to sustain the deception over time Everything is so fast and furious in The Departed we don t think of the time The cunning premise is that once upon a time there were two young men who both eventually became police cadets One almost from the start we see him as a mere kid at a soda fountain becomes the prot g of a gangland boss who when the boy becomes a man persuades him to infiltrate the police force and spy on its activities for the gang Matt Damon is at his most unappealing and blank as this slick liar The other is a smart kid from a seedy family with Irish mafia links but an honest if unsuccessful dad now departed who doesn t do so well as a police cadet but is eagerly recruited by the police undercover division as an ideal person to infiltrate the gang Leonardo DiCaprio is overwrought but strong as the pill popping pseudo crook who of course is in more danger He must live among sadists bad guys The cops have foul mouths this is writer Monahan s delight But they are not made to appear as psychopaths The two men are like stage managers observing and calling shots from inside to a force outside But unlike the God and the artist of Joyce s Portrait of the Artist who looks down from above within or behind or beyond or above his work refined out of existence indifferent paring his fingernails these two mirror image undercover operatives are always hiding and in danger of being found out vulnerable to the consequences of any action In the original you re struck by how alike they are They run the same dangers and play the same game of betrayal of associates Here in the American version somehow the contrast is made stronger The film is nihilistic and cruel but it is moral in this aspect Damon is a despicable fat cat given a posh apartment DiCaprio is a nervous outsider sensitive and suffering But even Damon and DiCaprio have a certain square jawed similarity The Chinese original had the two major matin e idols of HongKong film Jeff Lau in Damon s role and Tony Leung in DiCaprio s so you can t say it too didn t have big names It ran fifty minutes shorter though and the performances were more understated there was a greater economy and subtlety Using Damon Mark Wahlberg and Charlie Sheen adds to the authentic sound of the Boston accents The overlay is convincing Another new touch is having a woman both moles are interested in Vera Farmiga is a psychotherapist whom Damon dates and DiCaprio is treated by There s also Ray Winstone excellent as always as crime boss Costello s associate And there s Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello himself Since the running time and the baroque expansion of scenes gives the actors too much time to ham it up Jack just winds up being Jack Apart from that he doesn t feel like a crime boss He doesn t have the physical authority of James Gandolfini the stillness of real menace which Winstone has He feels like an over the top actor who s descended into mannerisms and comedy In the original film the parallelism is cunning it s all you really need the situation itself is extremely suspenseful You don t have to jazz it up The new version is also more moralistic DiCaprio is more of a martyr and Damon more of a scumbag The Chinese version makes you feel more sympathy for each more conscious of the danger they re both in and the parallelism of their roles Monahan is praised for his dialogue and it s certainly spicy but it s overdone All Wahlberg does as the undercover cops handler is insult and swear at people He s generally the most appealing character in a crime movie but this time he s a little wasted Nicholson s character is incapable of referring to a priest without mentioning pederasty or a wife without alluding to fellatio All this aside the two and a half hours go by quickly enough Scorsese s editor Thelma Schoonmaker does a bang up job the actors are in fine if in Nicholson s case overripe form This is Scorsese s first crime movie since Casino and his most entertaining in a long time It s also arguably his most nihilistic After everybody blows everybody else s head off and the bad guy gets a commendation but not the girl there s nothing left on the ground but blood and cynicism Great entertainment a damned good show But still the question remains why does a filmmaker of the caliber of Martin Scorsese want to do a remake even of a story as archetypal as Lau and Mak s Infernal Affairs,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492764/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2020,The Departed,The trilogy is integrated into this film so it has to be narrated from one line which is not as intense as the Hong Kong version The setting of characters is too simple full of the smell of blood and violence But it s probably related to the cultural differences between China and the West Despite the preconceived feeling it is a good Hollywood blockbuster,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5845331/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2007,tough guys shouting profanities with an intriguing plot,Do you want to see a movie with cops and bad guys and there is certainly some overlap between the two Then watch this movie The best part of this movie is the intriguing story line that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie In summary the cops have planted a rat DiCaprio in the criminal organization led by Nicholson But Nicholson has his own rat inside the police force Damon To make things more interesting there are also rats for the FBI and both Damon and DiCaprio fall for the same woman This then all plays out like a bloody game of chess where at the end both kings die This is a star studded movie where most of the actors do very well especially DiCaprio and Damon I found Sheen s Boston accent convincing and Nicholson of course does his thing Some times I got the impression that there was a bit of competition going on between the actors Like who can play the toughest guy The weakest point of the movie was the psychologist who is torn between DiCaprio and Damon The speed at which she falls for the convict as far as she knows DiCaprio seems unprofessional and unrealistic There is never a real confrontation between DiCaprio and Damon over her as one might expect but the documents that DiCaprio gives to her not to be opened until something happens to him end up being Damon s downfall,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1767947/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2006,The Ending. . .,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1496672/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2023,"""The Departed"" marks Scorsese's return to urban chaos, the criminal world filled with tragic gangsters, full of elements such as Catholicism and the moral and ethical dilemmas",A cat and mouse game in which the mice stand out The Departed represented Martin Scorsese s first Oscar As a director the filmmaker had already been nominated for his exceptional works in Raging Bull 1980 The Last Temptation of Christ 1988 Goodfellas 1990 Gangs of New York 2002 and The Aviator 2004 But it seemed that the Academy simply refused to award one of its greats as it had previously failed to do with Alfred Hitchcock Stanley Kubrick and so many others Many pointed out that the Oscar would have come at the wrong time given that and this is quite debatable the previous films would have been better than The Departed In any case Scorsese received the statuette for a visceral work an unpredictable thriller that puts stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon on a collision course in a world where appearances are always deceiving Unlike Gangs of New York 2002 and The Aviator 2004 his two previous feature films that had been nominated for an Oscar The Departed did not at least when it was released intend to reconstitute an important chapter of America and be accepted as an A class cinema I did want to tell a good story that involved electrified and instigated the spectator to stay on the edge of his chair tense and anxious to discover the outcome of the plot These goals apparently modest but difficult to achieve are fully achieved And much more Scorsese reminded everyone how he knows how to make movies and proved that it is not easy to tell a good story As in Goodfellas 1990 and more recently The Irishman 2019 The Departed is also part of the subversion of a young man who dreams of social ascension and success so preached by the so called American dream Colin character lived in adulthood by Matt Damon is a lower middle class boy of Irish descent who one day falls into the graces of one of the biggest gangsters in Boston the Machiavellian Costello Jack Nicholson The mobster prepares him since he was a teenager to become a policeman and thus be able to act as an undercover agent on behalf of organized crime A masterstroke at last Colin s trajectory coincides however with the unusual route taken by another key character in the plot Billy Leonardo DiCaprio also of Irish descent tries to do the opposite Coming from a family of bandits and criminals some of them linked to Costello himself the young man wants to join the police to clear the family name especially that of his father a man who never wanted to get involved in shady business but was always discriminated against for being honest It turns out that while Colin appears to be a cop above suspicion Billy carries the stigma of his clan and arouses the distrust of his superiors who submit him to a trial by fire pretending to be a criminal spending time in jail and then try to find a place in Costello s gang with the aim of arresting him once and for all Two faces of the same mirror in this case the working class and immigrants from the region south of Boston both Colin and Billy are at the service of a plot that dialogues with Scorsese s complex work Scorsese once again deals with the universe of the masculinity crisis within which the characters all very emotionally fragile and always on the verge of an identity crisis use violence as a way of resolving conflicts and self affirmation Elements such as Catholicism the choice to focus on the Irish community is not gratuitous and the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by the main characters are equally recurrent within the New York filmmaker s body of work The director manages to weave a plot that changes the main focus at all times now on Sullivan now on Costigan And that never proves to be a problem due to the splendid work of the filmmaker s regular collaborator Thelma Schoonmacher in making sense of all the comings and goings of the narrative The script is equally adept at leaving us engendered in the proposed web never anticipating the next moves of the central characters If being a very talented storyteller wasn t enough Scorsese has a good hand when it comes to casting Having Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio as protagonists is sure of a quality work Damon began to attract attention with Good Will Hunting 1997 a few years earlier and established himself as an actor of bold and unpredictable choices reaching the height of having in a short period of time starred in films as diverse as The Bourne Supremacy 2004 Syriana The Oil Industry 2005 and the trilogy Ocean s Eleven trilogy 2001 2004 and 2007 Leonardo DiCaprio in turn managed to improve his choices and since he started his partnership with Scorsese he has shown that he is an excellent actor more recently he gave the performance of his life in The Wolf of Wall Street 2013 In The Departed the two actors share the screen for a short time but when they are the protagonists of their own plots acting with Jack Nicholson Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen they manage to mark their territory Matt Damon chooses to give Colin Sullivan an arrogance and smugness that could even be seen as a reflection of his position at work However when he s alone with his girlfriend the beautiful psychologist Madolyn Vera Farmiga his confidence betrays him It was the actor s idea to make his character impotent giving an interesting dimension to a man who specializes in lying and who uses his masks to win in life DiCaprio on the other hand takes pains to build his Costigan sometimes emulating the speaking style of Robert De Niro Scorsese s former regular partner Always worried carrying the world on his shoulders Costigan is the typical hero who gets worse through circumstances He tries to do good but he can t overcome the rotten world around him Mark Wahlberg was the only one of the cast nominated for an Oscar and this is explained by the desire of the main actors not to compete with each other leaving Warner s hands tied at the time of the campaign for the award His character Dignam is one of the few that has a moral compass Although he doesn t appear to be a nice guy Dignam could turn out to be his best friend given his strength of character On the other hand the mobster played by Jack Nicholson in an amusing and unusual performance is an example of old power A person who no longer needs the money he earns illegally much less the stress his job brings him But he just can t let go of the bone He can t help but be a menacing figure Basically he doesn t know how to do anything but intimidate The narrative merits of The Departed are unquestionable If the film is an exercise in Scorsese s much more timid style at least he manages to sustain the tension from beginning to end The script ties all the ends very well and never lets the rhythm of the story fade New events are constant and the twists and turns in the mutual hunt between the two infiltrators are natural In no time the screenwriter demonstrates the need to walk in circles in a film so powerful from the narrative point of view which flows in one breath Scorsese s direction while better behaved than usual never chooses gratuitous or empty shots even if some choices are not as inventive and surprising as the director intended The slow motion that records the fall of police officer Queenan with a dry cut to a frontal shot of Costigan tries to convey to the audience the surprise of the second with the murder of the first The impactful effect that slow motion heralds is not fully achieved Most people were more pleased with the option that Scorsese will make at the end of the work when a truly unexpected shot proves capable of making the audience jump in their seats Also built in a frontal plane there is no preparation for the moment of shooting much less the use of slow motion which promotes an excessive narrative inflection when the intention is to cause astonishment soon after It is very interesting how this infamous shot triggers a cascade of murders that completely subverts the police genre itself in which the story usually goes somewhere whether it be with the victory of the good guys or with that of the criminals The Departed ends with a generalized slaughter totally fortuitous crushing the public s expectation of watching a round and comfortable ending In addition to causing the surprise effect the lack of anticipation in each of the shots is efficient to lead the outcome as a tragedy without glories or heroes Just violent cruel and wild Despite the film being over one hundred and fifty minutes long the direction is so good that it is far from tiring It s a great choice as it s one of those films that when you ve finished watching it you immediately want to point it out to your friends in addition of course to causing great reviews in a group of those who have already watched it Scorsese s Oscar winning feature may not be the best film of his career Not even among his movies about mobsters But it seems to me quite unfair the blas look that many give it treating it just like a commercial film by the American genius The Departed marks Scorsese s return to urban chaos the criminal world filled with tragic gangsters an environment in which he is a master But this time the action is also concentrated on the day to day of the police For rats are not an exclusive privilege of bandits,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8916312/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2006,Scorsese Back in Top Form with a Stunning Cast for an Unbelievably Taut Thriller,Filmmaker extraordinaire Martin Scorsese finally brings back the dazzling intensity of his earlier films such as Taxi Driver and Goodfellas with his latest offering a driving Americanized update of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs Adapted with intelligence by screenwriter William Monahan the now Boston based story focuses in parallel fashion on two young police detectives who are leading deceptive existences one is sharing the department s goings on with local mob boss Frank Costello while the other is undercover inside Costello s organization and secretly informing the police of their plans The informant is Colin Sullivan who impresses his supervisors with his savvy and unfettered ambition The other detective is coiled to the bone Billy Costigan recruited by Captain Queenan and his hot headed assistant Sgt Dignam to infiltrate Costello s gang Both detectives are loners in one way or the other because they are moles always looking over their shoulder lest they get caught and killed The movie dexterously goes back and forth between the characters with the linchpins being not only Costello but also a department psychiatrist named Madolyn She becomes Sullivan s girlfriend and also Costigan s doctor As you can guess the destinies of Costigan and Sullivan intertwine like a tightening vise but not without several interrelated story lines battling for our attention One of the key reasons that this approach works so effectively is the kinetic time jumping editing by longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker infusing Scorsese s masterful direction and the adept unraveling by necessity character development A stellar cast is in peak form here starting with Leonardo DiCaprio s riveting turn as Costigan Under Scorsese s tutelage for the third time he has finally matured into a role that capitalizes on his visceral intensity and delivers easily the best work I have seen him do If Matt Damon s solid work is slightly less electrifying with a vocal resemblance to the southie he played in Good Will Hunting it s primarily because the character is designed to be unapologetically covert and a braggadocio to boot Of course Jack Nicholson is getting the lion s share of the media attention because he is back in a showy role as Costello Whether making subtly threatening non sequiturs to the hapless in his neighborhood or sharing Costello s path to success with his young cohorts Nicholson blazes without resorting to the scenery chewing we have seen in past roles As Madolyn indie darling Vera Farmiga brings an unexpectedly idiosyncratic quality to what could have been the standard girl support stereotype bringing not only vulnerability but a guarded sense of adventurousness to her character In supporting roles Martin Sheen is solid as Queenan but it s the rapid fire profanity spewing out of Marc Wahlberg as Dignam that remains more memorable Ray Winstone brings his trademark menace to Costello s amusingly named henchman Mr French and Alec Baldwin shines in the smallish role of department head Ellerby It should come as no surprise that there are moments of shocking violence as the movie culminates into a series of scenes quite graphic in nature yet thematically resonant to the core story Scorsese has thankfully let go of the wearying pretensions of his last two movies The Aviator and Gangs of New York to produce an incredibly taut character driven police thriller It s aces for this kind of work,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1495334/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2007,Its Not Oscar Stuff.,I do not see any aspect of the movie to qualify for an Oscar It has a great cast no doubt but it is an action packed violent movie it was not pleasant in any way the viewer does not develop enough association with any character this is meant to happen in a movie with a grand cast There is rarely a moment when a scene touches your heart though it does leave a bad taste of memory on your mind something that you do not want to think about again I only watched the movie because of the cast and the probability that it might be an Academy Awards Movie There are violent and action packed movies Natural Born Killers God Father but this one just an agony to the mind,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1601505/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2006,Slow and first but then it's a wild ride,When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime It s not my favorite Scorsese film that honor belongs to Casino for me But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime The film is simple enough the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello That was Scorsese s little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day although his real name was an Italian one Nicholson s character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate I didn t add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life Getting this man won t be easy because he has a full bag of tricks One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side There are no dummies on either side the police aren t keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year he might have been nominated himself if he wasn t up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson s character is in the film If you think you know how this film ends I guarantee you will be wrong Nicholson s character has survived in many ways that s all I can say Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston s atmosphere as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time The cast didn t let Martin down at Oscar time and they won t let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1498107/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2010,great plot and twists and strong direction,PLOT a men from Police and an undercover agent who also works with an Irish mafia are off to find one person who is causing chaos in a happy going business Now the twist and strength of movie lies on that the person s identity How you have to watch the movie to know the answer Both of them are able to gain confidence of this mafia and are on a mission to find that person and also to take down the mafia Saw this one last week Its Scorsese so the plot has to be ridiculously complicated yet enjoyable Its like a never ending maze Movie becomes damn exciting after knowing who that person is D In entire flick the two men were making plans and gathering info bout Irish mafia struggling to find that person who is eating the entire system from inside and causing much trouble to everyone st half of the movie is quite confusing and boring as it should be but in 2nd half things took a sharp turn and suddenly everything opens up Its full of thrills and excitement those guys are on their toes to catch the culprit but when they come to know the truth they were shocked just like viewers watching the movie D Just watch this damn thing D amazing movie from another lord of directors Scorsese,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2357637/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2006,A Work of Bloody Genius...One of 2006's Best,For as much as I fancy myself a connoisseur of cinema I have never been too heavily interested in auteurs like Hitchcock Kubrick and Scorsese granted they have made some films I ve enjoyed but on the whole I lack the seemingly mandatory obsessive critical enthusiasm for their works overall But The Departed a surprising remake of a Japanese original is the type of film that might finally inspire me to peer into Scorsese s extensive backcatalog The Departed in addition to telling a story that s deceptively simple on first glance but brilliantly twisted with complication as it progresses also succeeds in assembling a cast at the tops of their respective games The film actually deserves its biggest accolade for convincing me finally that Leonardo DiCaprio is capable of playing an adult role without a hint of the sappy sentimental Titanic baggage that s long stigmatized him in my eyes when his undercover agent roughs up two hoods in a convenience store we buy it completely Similarly Matt Damon who s often seemed like a pretty boy recycling the same character has a fine turn as a cop who s corrupt to the bone whose long standing relationship with Jack Nicholson s Bostonian mob kingpin only drags him further down Parallels to The Score the 2001 heist flick that united Robert De Niro Marlon Brando and Edward Norton are not out of place but The Departed is more than a cinematic stunt revolving around a twist ending while the actors show their chops there is a sincere wrenching intrigue and dramatic force propelling this ride Scorsese s implications as we ve seen in GoodFellas and Taxi Driver are shattering and The Departed is no exception While the plot is intricate and I probably couldn t spoil it even if I tried it is only a tiny part of the bigger picture Scorsese s film might be the best fictionalized portrait of corruption among civil servants since 1997 s L A Confidential and the double and triple crosses perpetrated by DiCaprio Damon and Nicholson interweave beautifully While the script has its contrivances a romantic interlude between DiCaprio and Damon s girlfriend Vera Farmiga Scorsese not only makes us feel that something is truly at stake all the time but is not afraid to align our sympathies with his corrupt characters at any given time The Departed s constantly spinning moral compass and the coordinates it settles upon is one of the film s major attractions because it keeps predictability at a minimum At two and half hours The Departed is a tightly paced crime thriller that maintains such strong momentum that its minuscule caveats are easily forgivable In addition to the wonderful interplay between the three leads Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg also turn in strong supporting work This is a surprising enthralling film one of the year s best,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1515015/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2019,"Very violent, but very, very good.",The shocking violence is well placed The action scenes are always comprehensible no jump cut cheats here and the suspense will make you fidget in your seat What a corker,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4581952/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2006,'The Departed' is what all those critics have been waiting for,When you read reviews of Martin Scorsese s films from the past sixteen years you ll notice a sense of disappointment with the films as the critics usually express a dissatisfaction with the main character arguing that whatever film they re reviewing lacks in comparison to Taxi Driver Raging Bull Mean Streets etc Frankly I loved Cape Fear Casino Bringing out the Dead Gangs of New York and the Aviator They are all in their own ways unbelievable tour de forces that left me shaking by tail credits I m even coming around on Kundun I usually hate the day a new Scorsese movie opens because I m flooded with reviews from critics who are chiding that they weren t graced with another Jake LaMotta With this movie they seemed to find the pill easier to swallow and it s easy to see why It s bloody it has a cast full of a listers a plot that s been around so long every kink has been ironed out and Jack Nicholson who deserves a few more awards for his turn as Frank Costello I haven t had this much fun watching him since As Good as it Gets but this time it s a bit of a guilty pleasure He is funny frightening and pathetic all at the same time a character so large he practically jumps off the screen But of course when you watch a Scorsese film you re watching actors who are willing to take amazing risks because they trust the man at the helm everyone in this movie gives the performance of their life So I was happy yesterday to read the positive reviews in all the trades and papers Finally people are starting to ease up on the guy a little Not every film is Raging Bull and that suits me just fine This movie has everything for a Scorsese fan melancholic main characters a hint of religious undertone blood rock and roll Thelma Schoonmaker Michael Ballhaus and a third act that really gets the blood rate up I loved it so much I ll see it again tomorrow,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1491934/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,Quite brilliant,English speaking versions of Foreign movies are almost always far inferior this may be one of the very few which are better The acting script direction and music are all great A must watch,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7215506/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2014,"In the future, I tell ya to do a thing, you f*cking do it, you got that?",I started my day with 2046 I won t recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung Li Gong and Ziyi Zhang The music was excellent and Tony Leung s performance was spellbinding but the movie was hard to follow I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed which is a remake of that film I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version I just couldn t wait any longer so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent I have never been a big fan of Leonardo I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can but this performance was over the top Having said that I can t really think of another character s performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film The setup in the beginning was really a bore Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas one of my favorite films I really don t see him winning an Oscar for this film though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2935994/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2021,A great cast for this kind of film.,There aren t too many movies with so many big names like these ones in it and it truly pays off It s not Scorsese s best picture but the ending for sure really drives it home with the shock and the karma I ll leave it at that,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7338156/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2008,Another masterpiece by the master of crime,There is no question as to the level of genius that Martin Scorsese portrays in every piece of art that he creates Anything the man touches turns to magic Even with that said it sets the bar far too low to measure a masterpiece we know as The Departed I can honestly say that I am a fan of crime family mastermind scam and mafia movies They seem to appeal to the darker side of me that has never and will never be unleashed The Departed grabbed a hold of that darker side and did not let go until my darker side was whipped into criminal submission My Irish rooted soul was bound to the cast of characters in the lore of Mick cops and gangsters and the sex drugs and brutal use of violence left films like Scarface simply wanting I am not completely sure if I can say that The Departed is my favorite mafia movie considering The Godfather is still out there but it is up there on the chart I only have two suggestions 1 watch this movie as soon as possible 2 make sure that your children are out of the house for the night,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1870057/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2007,this film sucks,Just call me over sensitive old fashioned or what but I am really not able to appreciate it I never saw a movie filled with so many f words I can t stand this As a Chinese I sure have watched HongKong version Infernal Affairs which was in my opinion so so But The Departed is a failure out and out HongKong movie has a great tradition of Gang Movie Like western in American movie Gang Movie is a major genre in HongKong movie Most time they are heroes sometimes they are villains But they always get their due they are human being just like you and me They are not the pervert like the persona Jack Nicolson played They are family guys they got hearts hence it is hard for undercover cops to betray them I like old HongKong movies very much when I said old I mean ten years before twenty years before They were powerful not full of idiot comedies which is the case with HongKong movie nowadays What was really great with Hongkong movies was how they depicted and expressed the appreciation and friendship between guys It could inspire you like hell In Infernal Affair two undercover are not only rivals but also more importantly they appreciate each other They feel like they could be very good friends if they are not doomed for a fatal confrontation All this are missing in The Departed Awful Don t waste your precious time I didn t finish it actually,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1593729/?ref_=tt_urv
