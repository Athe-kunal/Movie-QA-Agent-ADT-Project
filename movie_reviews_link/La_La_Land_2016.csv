12 January 2017,"Like a dream come true, one of those films that totally banishes the blues away",Having just gotten back from seeing La La Land with a rare day off music college it came to me that it was one of the best new release first viewings for me in a while Very few films in recent memory has left me leave the cinema with my heart properly warmed a beaming smile on my face tears in my eyes feeling uplifted and properly moved La La Land however has managed that feat Would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after Disney s Renaissance period in the 90s and very much a modern classic Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me La La Land clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood musicals a somewhat maligned genre these days but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts due to being there myself The talent was also appetising starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone directed by Whiplash s Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Whiplash John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt It was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it Visually La La Land is a gorgeous looking film with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that s not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self indulgent territory The music and songs may induce and has induced mixed reactions count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious emotion filled and with enough to make one top tap and hum along The musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non stop exuberance The opening number is especially true to this The script is warm funny affectionate and poignant and also with an honesty It s not a complex script nor did it need to be and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple The story is admittedly slight in places then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere Something that is true with La La Land a film where anybody can relate to its themes Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age especially those with MGM with their bold colour exuberant marriage of music and dance it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like The Umbrellas of Cherbourg yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences Loved that the two leads relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love at first sight sort far from it more antagonists turned lovers with a meet cute first encounter again also not a case Chazelle s direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film making more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full of life rather than self indulgent The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work No worries there Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts Both of them give terrific performances performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance so many emotions such as vulnerability strength cheekiness charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy handed touch Gosling matches her if not quite as good showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm All the support although basically cameos registers memorably All in all a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away 10 10 Bethany Cox,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618065/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2017,"Nostalgic, Colourful, Joyous CinemaScope Magic",Do I like musicals Not really but damn La La Land is a nostalgic colourful joyful marvel Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his masterful drama Whiplash what were the chances that he could pull off similar success two times in the row Well if La La Land is anything to go by then I d say he did the job With just three films under his belt as of 2016 Chazelle is slowly becoming the next big thing this movie industry has seen His passion for classic movies and musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films like Singin in the Rain The Umbrellas of Cherborg and even Rebel Without a Cause the latter of which is one of my favourite films so seeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least after two previous collaborations their already strong bond helped them become one of modern day cinema s finest couples The music is bouncy and toe tapping catchy the cinematography is utterly stunning with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes and the locations sum up the American dream and the passion the characters hold for Los Angeles La La Land is by far one of the finest cinema experiences I have had in the past 5 10 years and although this isn t a film I would typically enjoy genre wise Chazelle has instead crafted one of my favourite films of this decade A film I would recommend everyone see in the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3622383/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2017,Love letter to Hollywood .. and a Heck of a Film,Writer Director Damien Chazelle who already had a nice career going for him explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful mesmerizing and completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown The opening sequence satirized on the Golden Globes really does not do the rest of the film justice It is as if the cast from the FAME remake grew up had children of their own and then those children hijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash mob dance sequence From that point on the film is hypnotic We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of the 1940s If the film had been in B W you would almost have expected to see Bette Davis in a 3 hankie tear jerker Except for the musical interludes of course which are pitch perfect and totally wonderful Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance but he delivers the goods Stone who was supposed to be the next big thing after Easy A 2010 steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well The awards should flow like water and she will deserve every one As I said deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood The film industry has always had issues with endings back in the day they would film several different endings per picture and then decide at the last minute which to use Here Chazelle pays homage to that by giving us an alternate ending along with the real ending along with a closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in Hollywood is actually real but everything still can be really fun Destined to be a classic Recommended Designated IMDb Top Reviewer Please check out my list 167 Nearly Perfect Movies with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries you can should see again and again 1932 to the present,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610731/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,Shocked me how good it was,I remember when I saw the trailers for this movie I thought it would be a sad but sweet love story and nothing more And while it is that it brings so much more flare and beauty that I would never have expected from this It took me three years to see it and it far out shone any expectation I had,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5283962/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2018,The best movie of 2016,The main characters in this Los Angeles romantic musical are Mia Emma Stone a coffee shop employee with dreams of being an actress and Sebastian Ryan Gosling a jazz pianist who aspires to open his own club that plays jazz like it was played in the good old days At long last a movie released during the 2016 awards season that actually lives up to the hype Early in the film there are two superb group musical numbers The numbers that follow are more low key relating only to the main characters but they are still well performed and executed The stories of career struggle within the broader narrative are very believable They include the hell of auditioning to people who are too busy plus the desire to maintain the purity of a great music genre jazz while too often being told it is a dying art Gosling takes a while to break into the role particularly where the singing is concerned but it s not long before he fits into the part quite nicely Stone is superb throughout the film She is even spot on as an actress giving mediocre auditions She s given a full range and not just as a triple threat and she fully lives up to the expectations especially during the song Audition near the end There is something uniquely enjoyable about Hollywood portraying itself The movie also gives nods to great classic musicals like Singin in the Rain Les Demoiselles de Rochefort and Les Parapluies de Cherbourg all the while being unique and standing out on its own In addition the set designs and photography add further to the film s greatness The reference to Les Parapluies de Cherbourg comes through strongly in the movie s final number This scene is probably the best scene of any movie in 2016 It leaves one with so many mixed emotions and extreme on either side The production number is magnificent while its mood is melancholy The teaming of director writer Damien Chazelle with musical composer Justin Hurwitz is one of the best matches since Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand in the 1960s dbamateurcritic OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS 1 Directing by Damien Chazelle 2 Acting by Emma Stone 3 Music by Justin Hurwitz,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4098735/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2017,For The Love Of Movies,Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies from Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy Hallellujah Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone go back to inspire us forward What s more surprising than anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the singing So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience Damian Chazelle Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle something like Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like Midnight Lace That s what happens when we discover a new and startling talent You want to see him do everything I have a feeling this young artist will,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628244/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2017,"""It's very nostalgic – will people like it?""",A little film Not sure whether you might have heard of it yet Damien Chazelle has followed up his astonishingly proficient Whiplash my top film of 2015 with a sure fire theatre filler in La La Land The old fashioned musical extravaganza is back and back with style La La Land tells the bittersweet love story of Sebastian Ryan Gosling and Mia Emma Stone who first meet in an LA traffic jam but then get thrown together by chance LA is such a small place after all Over the course of the next four seasons romance blossoms Mia is a struggling actress bouncing from audition to audition in a hopeless attempt to break through in LA s tough movie business She makes ends meet as a Barista on the Warner Brother s lot Meanwhile Sebastian is on a mission of his own a talented musician he is trying to restore jazz to the main stage something the film s soundtrack will undoubtedly help do by opening his own classic jazz bar As both strive for success on their own terms can love survive to deliver us the classic Hollywood ending The film is technically astonishing with clever continuous shots of the Birdman variety and masterly cinematography by Linus Sandgren of Joy and American Hustle The lighting team in particular is superb a case in point is Mia s in Seine sic song with breathtaking fades of the background to darkness a camera whizz around the actress for effect and then a brilliant fade back to reality Loved it Overall there are enough similar moments in the film to make cinema lovers like me gasp with delight There s a curious timelessness about the piece which is surely deliberate Whilst there are obvious and non apologetic throwbacks to the classic musicals of the 50 s like West Side Story and Singin in the Rain and references to Casablanca and Rebel without a Cause there is also a 60 s vibe to the girls getting ready sequence an 80 s A ha cover thrown in at a pool party and a Californian Prius obsession that is surely more noughties than current Most curiously while everyone has smartphones no one seems to text anyone to announce changes to plans the film is almost distancing itself from much of modern life In the acting stakes Emma Stone again shines like a beacon She is just magnetic on the screen tiny spoiler the biggest plot hole in the film is why on earth she wasn t given the part for her first audition I was disappointed she didn t win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Birdman in the 87th Awards she lost out to Patricia Arquette for Boyhood but she just keeps getting better and Better and BETTER Ryan Gosling s confident and cocky turn also radiates charisma in particular it is astonishing that Gosling could play only a few chords on the piano before training for the film A confidence boost for struggling piano learners everywhere It is actually difficult to imagine two better actors for the roles Emma Watson allegedly turned it down for Beauty and the Beast something she might be kicking herself for Are they both the best singers and dancers when compared to Gene Kelly Fred Astaire Debbie Reynolds R I P or Cyd Charisse No undoubtedly not but they have an undeniable charm all of their own Perhaps we will see the ilk of the great hoofers and crooners rise again with a resurgence in the classic musical Can Hollywood take a hint The big question now that both Stone and Gosling have won Golden Globes for acting in the Comedy or Musical category can they convert that to Oscar glory where there is a single category in play I d like to think so It s also great to see proper movie making taking place in the Hollywood studios again during my recent visits to LA there seemed to be little other than TV work going on in the main studio complexes there although its worth pointing out that for this film not all of the filming was actually done on the Warner Brothers lot Musicals are clearly measured by the quality of the music and Justin Hurwitz Whiplash has produced a gem with notwithstanding the jazz numbers and a catchy little pop number from John Legend merely a handful of simple but unforgettable melodies that recur in different variations throughout the film The soundtrack is already in my Amazon library and uplifting my mood on what is a damp and dreary Monday here in the UK Damien Chazelle has delivered a triumph in both direction and original script There is really very little I can fault the film on In what was the somewhat patchy Coen brothers offering from last year Hail Caesar there was a standout moment of a throwback song and dance number with Channing Tatum that I raved about you can find it on youtube If I was being picky then this tantalizing snippet would be a better representation of the style and vim of the original genre with the exception of the opening number few of the song and dance numbers in La La Land quite get to that Broadway Melody level of scale and energy This together with a few concerns about the pacing in some places led me to rate this as a 4 5 on first viewing However on now seeing it twice within 36 hours it s got me well and truly under its spell I normally emotionally resist films that arrive with excessive hype but in this case I give in 10 10 For the graphical version of this review visit bob the movie man

17 January 2017,Very Well Made But Not My Kind Of Movie,Did someone say last year s Oscars were too white So let s award most of this year s Oscars to something that looks like an explosion in a paint factory where every primary colour is splashed across the screen LA LA LAND was being touted as the film to beat even before most of the other contenders were announced and its domination at the Golden Globes confirmed everything Looks like the 2017 Oscars will be the most predictable event of this year Romantic musicals aren t my thing so my dread was realised in the opening scene with a California highway turning in to a song and dance scene so camp I thought I was watching a forest of pink tents which hints at what you re going to get feelgood factor whether you want it or not It was at this point I seriously considered giving up on the movie and going on youtube to listen to proper love songs by the likes of The The and Joy Division As the film continued the narrative did expose itself to being what you expect two young people a man and a woman who are embarking on fulfilling their careers in respectively jazz music and acting There s not a lot here we haven t seen before but what sells this movie is the visual work director Damien Chazelle has put in to it The language of cinema is very much to the fore especially the stunning cinematography and my abiding memory is the scene where the two protagonists meet and an impact aesthetic is instantly created by the way the lighting changes Many scenes are similarity beautiful but if there s a fundamental problem remains that no matter how well made a film is if you ve no interest in the genre then you won t become a convert As it stands LA LA LAND will dominate the Oscars like the French film THE ARTIST did five years ago then become quickly forgotten,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621535/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2016,Believe the hype,What a great movie Who would have thought anyone could bring the original screen musical back from the dead Yet here it is hale and hearty The music is melodic but never simplistic the lyrics are intelligent and intelligible the script is funny touching without ever resorting to sentimentality the two leads are not only skillful but full of a kind of charm that I honestly thought had disappeared entirely from American movies but here we have Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just oozing it The only pebbles in this ocean of inventiveness are some routine dance routines and over reliance on the device of lights dimming on set to isolate an actor in white light but that s me being r e a l l y picky It may well be that this is the best musical written directly for the screen since SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS All credit to writer director Damien Chazelle and his team and it really feels like a team movie for giving us this gem Sure it s a feelgood piece but it creates a world which is complex it acknowledges alternative outcomes for its characters it connects with people s passions and in the case of Ms Stone s big solo Audition it has a bona fide classic,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3559049/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,A true ode to the Golden Era of Hollywood,The vibrant colors and use of musical scores to set the mood for scenes transported myself back in time This movie feels not only like a beautifully nostalgic nod to Hollywood of yesteryear but also that of a timeless love story Gosling and Stone have a charm to their chemistry on screen during the musical and dance numbers All these aspects lead to a raw portrayal of love that many experience in life with still providing a sense of hope and wonder to the viewers I was entranced from the opening scene until the final note played by Goslings piano I absolutely recommend this film to any and everyone,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5050610/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2017,Pretentious nonsense,I ll call it right now La La Land will win Best Picture at the Academy Awards and for no other reason than the fact that the Academy loves a film about the industry If there s a film based around movies in anyway amongst the nominees list put your money on it to win Does it deserve the award No there were many superior films released in 2016 Hollywood seems to be obsessed with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a couple This is their third film appearance together and for my liking they just get worse every time Comparing the chemistry for example to Gosling and Rachel McAdams in The Notebook they are worlds apart Stone is a very good actress as far as emotional range goes but she can t pull off the likable tag very well I really enjoyed Damien Chazelle s previous film Whiplash In a lot of ways they are very similar films but in the more important ways they are worlds apart The biggest difference is the modesty that Whiplash achieved It had great characters yet it acted like it didn t know it La La Land has very average even poor occasionally characters yet acts like they re God s gift to cinema I was really disappointed coming out of La La Land Even though I knew it wasn t my type of film ideally I was willing to give it a chance and thought it might surprise me due to my low expectations On the contrary though it managed to fall below my expectations My advice would be don t be fooled by the reviews and probable Oscar nominations There s nothing to see here,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614495/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2021,"This ""hardly musical"" can't compare with the great song and dance films of the past",After watching this movie in early 2021 on DVD I was puzzled by its very high IMDb rating With more than half a million ratings La La Land had an average of 8 0 I am a long time fan of musicals of all varieties so the high rating of this film seems strange How could so many people think this film is equal to the best musicals of all time Do they really think it is better than all but a few musicals Musicals with a dozen or more songs With hit tunes With great compositions by famous composers With singing by the best and most popular singers With dance numbers and choreography by the greatest hoofers of all time La La Land has a total of six songs The great musicals have 10 to 18 songs Can anyone name a single hit tune from this movie Can anyone even remember one of the songs Did either of the leads record any of the songs Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone Are either of them known for their singing or recording Does either one have a hit record Are there any known dancers in this film I have seen way more than 200 musicals and most of them were better than La La Land So when I watched this film it struck me that most of the people who rated it just hadn t seen many musicals Surely none of the great ones of the past And that would mean that they have little to compare with what little music singing and dancing there is in this movie So perhaps it s a sign of the times Perhaps there aren t such gifted musicians and singers and dancers that past decades had Or it might be an indication of how starved modern audiences are for quality entertainment But there are a couple other possibilities for why this movie is rated so high The first is the sentimental romance story Modern people may be starved for good entertainment in the area of romance and love with the technology overload of the 21st century And then there is the sale of Los Angeles itself including Hollywood and related sights The publicity says from the start that this movie is a celebration of L A And it shows a glamorized city all clean and neat and without blemish One wonders how many of the ratings for this movie came from the movie capital itself from the 13 million people of the Los Angeles area or the 24 million of southern California It s not hard to imagine that a real propaganda film for the movie capital of the world got high marks from its own area And that some others who thought it a smashing musical are among a population that doesn t know the great musicals of the past and or that is starved for really great musical talent and entertainment Adding all of that together is probably the basis for the high rating of this movie I would wager that after separating out all the ratings of this movie that came from Southern California the resulting average from the rest of the country however large or small the number would not be higher than 7 0 and would probably be closer to 6 5 or lower There probably are a lot of 10 ratings from the Los Angeles environs and many 7 6 and lower ratings from the rest of the country I m not trashing the acting of Ryan Gosling Emma Stone or any of the rest of the cast of this film They were good to very good But none of them are accomplished singers or dancers While a couple of the choreographed larger dance scenes are good they are more acrobatic with modern dance than anything like the footwork of the great talents in films of the past This film has nothing to compare to Fred Astaire Gene Kelly Gene Nelson Ginger Rogers Eleanor Powell or dozens more actors who also could sing and dance With so many reviews already I m just weighing in to apprise younger audiences who enjoy musicals of all kinds about some of the truly great musicals of the past Here s a short list of films everyone should enjoy For starters there are three wonderful films from the 1930s Top Hat of 1935 Show Boat of 1936 and The Wizard of Oz of 1939 The last one was in color Color would take over after Broadway Melody of 1940 and following the war years The 1940s included top hits such as Blue Skies of 1946 with a dozen Irving Berlin tunes and Fred Astaire s debut of Puttin on the Ritz and Easter Parade of 1948 with Judy Garland and Astaire The 1950s were dynamite years for great musicals On Moonlight Bay of 1951 Singin in the Rain of 1952 with Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds The Glenn Miller Story of 1954 White Christmas of 1954 with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye and three of the greatest Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals Oklahoma of 1955 The King and I of 1956 and South Pacific of 1958 The 1960s had such great musicals as Westside Story of 1961 My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins of 1964 The Sound of Music of 1965 and Hello Dolly of 1969 And although the interest in musicals had waned by the 1960s every decade has had several musical films made some of them great films The musical still has a considerable fan base especially those with great music dancing choreography and plots So among later smashing musicals are Fiddler on the Roof 1971 Amadeus of 1984 Newsies of 1992 Immortal Beloved of 1994 Chicago of 2002 Phantom of the Operate of 2004 and Les Mis rables of 2012,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6886712/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,A Love Letter to Hollywood,La La Land 2016 1 2 out of 4 Struggling Jazz musician Sebastian Ryan Gosling meets struggling actress Mia Emma Stone and together they try to make their mark in Hollywood LA LA LAND is a film that pretty much came out of nowhere and ended up grabbing fourteen Oscar nominations The film is a homage to Hollywood and everything that Hollywood used to produce This of course is a musical so the film pays respect to the type of film that MGM and Hollywood was pumping out in the 1950s Is the film worthy of all the praise it s getting Calling a film overrated is something that will strike up an argument on any message board but while I don t think the film was that great there s no question that it s an extremely charming film with two great performances I will start off with what I didn t love about the film One was the opening dance number which was impressive in regards to how it was shot but at the same time I must admit that it really didn t pull me into the film I d also say that I didn t love any of the songs in the picture A couple were nice but I really didn t walk out of the theater singing any of them Finally I did feel that the film went on a bit too long and would have benefited from about ten minutes being cut out With all of that out of the way there was still a lot of stuff here that I really enjoyed but there s no question that the greatest thing were the two leads Gosling and Stone were so great and so wonderfully charming together that you couldn t help but fall in love with their characters and want to see them succeed I really thought both of them did a terrific job in their acting their dancing and their singing and you can honestly say that they were among the most entertaining couples from recent memory They really get to shine with the comedy the romance and the drama and they really pack a great punch I also really loved the Jazz music in the picture The music is certainly something wonderful and it just perfectly builds up the story and delivers the goods The film also benefits from some wonderful costume and production design with brilliant uses of colors that just leap off the screen As I said the film is a homage to Hollywood and there s some great dialogue about older movies older stars and of course Jazz musicians It s easy to see why people and especially Hollywood are in love with LA LA LAND It s a great throwback to the type of romantic comedies and musicals that were made in a different era I m sure many young people were seeing this type of film for the first time Hopefully some of those who loved this will go out and seek out the classics that this is paying homage to,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3635181/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2017,A Really Pleasant Experience,It s so nice that someone was willing to produce an original musical that wasn t animated Emma Stone and Ryan Goslin light up the screen The songs are very well written and fit well within the parameters of the romance that develops I think the people that are so angry about the hype this film has gotten forget that the musicals it mimics had pretty basic plots Oh so it s the worst film of the year Really This is a story about dreams and hopes and trying to achieve them in an environment where the chances are really slim The production numbers are sappy to be sure but that s what this kind of offering puts to us It tells us that we can just have fun and root for the characters,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614894/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2017,"Weightless--as it's meant to be--and not without heart, but this balloon wafts away instead of soars...",One can say many things about writer director Damien Chazelle s La La Land and indeed the critics plaudits and accolades have already infiltrated our national consciousness it s a valentine to movie musicals it s a musical for people who don t like musicals it s a feel good movie for all audiences it s a tonic for our national malaise The story separated into seasonal chapters is pretty basic Emma Stone is a barista on the Warner Bros movie lot who aspires to be an actress but can t get passed the audition phase Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist who longs to play his own compositions They encourage each other to follow their dreams which doesn t necessarily mean taking the financially lucrative road although having money in the bank would certainly be an incentive for a better future even if the artistic value isn t there yet Yes Chazelle is in love with movies he steals enough from the motion picture past to tell us that and certainly the opening musical number on a jammed Los Angeles freeway is full of contagious acrobatic joy and celebration The trouble is these two young people aren t willing to compromise perhaps that would be allowing for too much realism Chazelle attempts to show us that success doesn t always lead to happiness yet his protagonists don t see the big picture starry eyed they want instant gratification through artistic expression The dancing is polished too polished I thought and the early numbers such as one with Stone and her girlfriends have a sprightly quality that is old fashioned in concept and charmingly lacking in pretension Still the hardships of a romantic relationship pulled in different directions isn t all that interesting here mainly because Gosling and Stone seem so charmed and picture perfect She trembles with a beginner s desperation during her auditions and is convincingly unhappy when her one woman show doesn t pan out but watching her out to dinner with an affluent date and his friends reveals nothing more than a princess eager to try another throne Gosling has a moment or two when he s able to give us a natural response to a line or situation but his concern for Stone seldom registers The brightly painted film is reaching for a certain height a plastic paradise a movie heaven that will flood us with good feelings in its attempt and break our hearts with its climax However if you are not invested in these characters by the midway point it will all seem like a glossy charade from,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619349/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2016,You'll be toe-tapping from start to finish,You know when you re watching a film that you just don t want to end and when it does end you feel as if you could watch it all over again right there and then I had that feeling with La La Land the new film from Damien Chazelle who blew us all away with Whiplash a few years ago With La La Land Chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedy drama that serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears If you haven t heard of this film yet where have you been I m sure you will do in the coming months Mia Dolan Emma Stone is an aspiring actress serving coffees to film stars while Sebastian Wilder Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist playing a small time bar to make ends meet The two meet and fall in love but it s their dreams of success that soon threaten to tear them apart The most striking thing about La La Land is just how beautifully crafted a film it is the story performances music dance numbers and cinematography all playing their part in making this such an unforgettable cinematic experience I genuinely can t find one single fault in this film Chazelle proves yet again just how mature he is for such a young filmmaker writing and directing such a touching and often funny love story with a meticulous energy The whole feel of the film is a throwback to the golden age of musicals a decision a lot of filmmakers would have been too scared to make yet the pay off is massively satisfying The gorgeous cinematography from Linus Sandgren brings the city of Los Angeles to life awash with colour while his swift camera work including some impressive long takes in particular through the dance numbers immerses the audience right in the middle of this dreamlike musical Coming to the performances La La Land features two superb lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone both giving arguably their best performance to date Gosling has really grown on me as an actor maturing into one of the best in the business today He proved earlier this year that he has a knack for comedy in The Nice Guys and he proves it yet again here Stone always manages to impress me and she is dazzling in La La Land singing and dancing her way into our hearts The pair share an undeniable chemistry and I would love to see them both get the recognition they deserve come awards season Justin Hurwitz s score and the original songs in La La Land along with the wonderfully choreographed dance sequences including a great opening number that sets the tone for the rest of the film heighten the film s level of originality maintaining that energy Chapelle s films possess I dare you to try and not fall in love with La La Land I fell in love with it and I m sure many more will do so too,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3558376/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2017,Overrated. Sub-par music. Depressing Ending.,This movie won awards and praised by some so the chances are that you are going to see it eventually As a musical it lacks good music and good choreography It draws inspiration by classics like Singing in the rain and West Side Story but it can t compete with any of these masterpieces and it doesn t offer anything new in the genre In terms of acting Emma Stone is very good showing seamless transitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from Ryan Gosling who adds to the sad tone that the movie will eventually reach The plot it starts as a satire of todays and past and maybe future Los Angeles which is full of waitresses who want to be famous actresses and struggling musicians who have their own dreams to make it in a very competitive world Later it becomes a romantic story not only for relationships but also for dreams and wishes but in its final act the movie takes a serious dramatic turn where the two happy endings are combining to a depressing conclusion that even the final two reassuring nods can t repair Add to this an alternate timeline flashback that the director writer wanted to incorporate to his vision and you end up with an overall depressing movie that actually ruins the optimistic feeling and the romance that initially had Overall Depressing Mediocre forgettable music A classic story that ends up in a melancholic yet pragmatical way,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3687251/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2016,A wonderful and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world.,When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high The excellent cast the music and an exciting new director writer were enough to get me in the door I m always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals Will it be stagy stilted and awkward Not in this case Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this film s endearing observations trials and tribulations but anyone who s ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this film s gargantuan heart I m a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see but La La Land gave me all the feels and more I cannot recommend this film enough It s the kind of film you leave and you don t want the buzz the tickle the movie high to end I can t wait to see it again when it s in wide release The artist in me is inspired again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3545644/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2017,"La La Land: An Annoying, full of clichés, and Cheesy Torture",I don t usually write negative reviews But since this movie is stealing all the awards so far and some people are calling that dull cheesy film a masterpiece I felt forced to write something LLL is a movie made from plastic It is full of clich s and a it has a fake aroma of nostalgia The beginning does have neither weight nor meaning The director only wants to tell us here in case we don t notice afterwards that this movie is a musical Good for him because who could have guessed that with all the bad singing and the bad dancing The love story is completely predictable and fake for the first hour or so until the first fight Somebody has said that this film is a super white film about 2 baby dreamers and I completely agree Where is the Art Where is the real struggle There are today millions of people dying from hunger wars violence and incurable diseases and to sink because a play didn t turn out how you expected or you cannot be the jazz pianist number one is really childish Good things the cinematography and the flashbacks are very good The end is the best That turn is actually original but does not make any sense any way Let s not forget that the girl and the boy are where they are because she was depressed for her career failure So the turn does not actually make any sense The jazz is good too I mean the REAL jazz musicians And Ryan Gosling who is OK in the film but not amazing is actually playing the piano which in a Hollywood movie is already a lot Annoying things the worst is in my opinion Emma Stone I never understood her talent She is just a pretty face with a skinny anorexic body who seems to think she is too good to prepare for her roles Her singing dancing are awful Let s remember that in Irrational Man I love Woody Allen she didn t even bother taking a piano lesson for her role of pianist Her hairdo is very annoying she always seems to have just come out from the hairdresser and I never understood why she cannot appear in even one frame without make up How this mediocre actress won the Golden Globe for BP by an Actress in a MP Musical or Comedy in stead of the amazing Meryl Streep or the amazing Annette Bening shows how Hollywood is losing it And the fact that she won the SAG Award Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role in stead of Meryl Streep or Natalie Portman shows how this movie has blinded Hollywood The most hilarious thing would be that she wins the Oscar and sadly she probably will being in the same category as Ruth Negga who made an stunning performance in Loving Meryl Streep always amazing and always great Natalie Portman and Isabelle Huppert one of the best European actresses of today But hey if Sandra Bullock got and Oscar in 2010 Stone could definitely get one too Gosling can play the piano but he definitely cannot sing his voice does not have any power and it sounds like olive oil His dancing is as his partner s mediocre How come he ended wining the Golden Globe for BP by an Actor in a MP Musical or Comedy in stead of Hugh Grant who gave his best performance ever in FFJ is a real mystery Luckily and for the sake of Art he didn t get the SAG Award who went to the amazing Denzel The clich s of LLL are endless girl meets boy and at first they hate each other but after they like each other The detail with the famous actress who enters in the Caf is also predictable And how rude not cool is to refuse an invitation There are lots of holes in the movie Boy and girl keep bumping into each other in a city as huge as LA and many more but I am not going to tell them because I don t want to reveal the plot and turns of the movie 14 Oscar nominations Give me a break As somebody said it s the endless story about Hollywood in love with itself Pity I will definitely not watch the Oscars this year There were lots of really great movies this year and they did not get 14 Oscar nominations Collateral Beauty Loving Hidden Figures Lion Moonlight Elle Florence Foster Jenkins Smrt u Sarajevu Fences LLL should have got 1 Oscar nomination only cinematography Sandgren The whole movie even if it features some great black jazz musicians has a white ish taste that is unbearable I don t care AT ALL if the actors are white black yellow orange or green But this cheesy movie with 2 black actors definitely wouldn t have got 14 Oscars nominations Why Because from the 6 000 Academy members 73 are men 27 women 89 are white and only 11 are people of color The age average is 60 years old that can explain the love for this mediocre musical I would not call it a musical because in the musicals the actors actually know to sing and know to dance The world is sadly still very racist That s why many people are calling this film White White Land for a reason That LLL is stealing all the awards and probably will also steal many Oscars shows the decadency of cinema today in the US Either that or people are really bored and need an empty and cheesy love story to be entertained I think that Hollywood should learn from that reality that European cinema knows to depict away from clich s and empty love stories away from pretty actors with fake hairdos and plastic bodies If LLL has achieved something is that a new line of decadence clich s and cheesiness in American cinema,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625446/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2017,Overrated,Much like Arrival which the critics went gaga over and was a drama disguised as a science fiction film the critics went gaga over this as well Perhaps if they d had some musically inclined people in it rather than the cast they did it might have kept my attention But it didn t I find Ryan Gosling bland and really while I like Emma she needs to stretch her acting muscles The big eyed earnest waif act is wearing a bit thin Her character in this could have been her character from Easy A there s that little of a difference Some critics have compared this to Singin in the Rain but there is no comparison That s a classic and this is just another over hyped Hollywood movie I m sure some people love it But I m pretty sure just as many didn t,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3648736/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2016,"""La La Land"" is a wonderful and refreshing, but imperfect film.",In real life most people don t randomly break out in song and dance but the escapism of the big screen has been bringing Movie Fans musical feature films since the very first days of the sound motion picture Only the second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture was a musical 1929 s The Broadway Melody Oversaturation in the marketplace and changing audience tastes led to the production of fewer musicals but they never went away Some of the best loved musicals in film history e g Meet Me in St Louis and Singin in the Rain came out in the 10 year span 1944 1953 But the ensuing decades each produced very popular musicals West Side Story The Sound of Music and Oliver all Best Picture Oscar winners from the 1960s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Grease and All That Jazz 1970s Victor Victoria Little Shop of Horrors and The Little Mermaid 1980s Beauty and the Beast The Lion King and Evita 1990s and in the early 2000s Moulin Rouge Frozen Dreamgirls and Chicago which became the first musical in 34 years to win Best Picture 2016 s La La Land PG 13 2 08 is the purest original non adapted live action musical in many years and has both the pedigree and the quality to duplicate the accomplishment of 2002 s Chicago La La Land was written and directed by Damien Chazelle who was the writer director of 2014 s Whiplash which earned him Oscar nods for his script and his film This one is filled with original songs which are composed and orchestrated by Chazelle s previous collaborator Justin Hurwitz with lyrics by the award winning musical theater team known as Pasek and Paul Musician John Legend has a major role in the film and its stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are both past Oscar nominees who earlier appeared together in two other movies 2011 s Crazy Stupid Love and 2013 s Gangster Squad And yes they both sing and dance while telling this particular musical s story of romance dreams and hope It takes place in the present but feels like a throwback like the most entertaining musicals of yesteryear The film s title has a dual meaning 1 referring to people who live their lives in a seemingly unrealistic dream world and 2 the city of Los Angeles itself where most of the action takes place In fact the film opens with a song and dance number with commuters stuck on a typically grid locked L A highway At the very end of that scene aspiring actress Mia Dolan Stone has a random brief and unpleasant encounter with struggling jazz keyboardist Sebastian Wilder Gosling who acts like a real pianist The two run into each other again in Sebastian s jazz club immediately after he s fired by the club owner J K Simmons for insisting on playing his own music Sebastian is no more polite this time The two finally meet cute and before long Mia has left her roommates behind and moved in with Sebastian Neither life nor love go smoothly for this pair of stubborn dreamers but they sure do try hard at both Mia continues working as a barista on the Warner Bros studio lot and going to frustrating audition after frustrating audition Eventually she decides that her best way forward is to write finance and produce a one woman show which fittingly focuses on her experiences of leaving her hometown in Nevada and moving to La La Land to pursue her dreams After dropping the humorously humiliating job where Mia sees him at their third encounter Sebastian continues to hold fast to his dream of opening his own jazz club but doesn t really do much about it He reluctantly takes a job on keys in a music group run by an old acquaintance Legend but doesn t enjoy it because they don t play his style of pure jazz Sebastian s unhappiness turns to resentment and ends up being directed toward Mia just as her show is about to open The eventual resolution of their love story and their individual pursuit of their dreams feels right for a movie which celebrates dreamers but shows what happens when life doesn t go as we ve planned La La Land is a wonderful movie but not as some reviewers would lead you to believe flawless After three contentious encounters the two main characters just suddenly fall in love a development that isn t very well earned by the script or the acting Otherwise the performances are excellent especially Stone s and the script is funny poignant and grounded except for that whole thing about characters suddenly breaking into song But when they do those songs are both fun and touching The dancing however seems to lack some of the energy and joy that you find in the older Hollywood musicals that inspired this film Having said all that I have to put these relatively minor criticisms into perspective This is a very entertaining and affecting movie You ll likely be emotionally invested in these characters smile a lot and leave the theater wanting the soundtrack For someone who wants more variety and positivity in today s films this one is a gift A,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3565534/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2020,"Heart warming, highly poetic and gorgeous",La La Land is a fantastic movie better than what I could have expected before watching and it has rapidly became one of my favourite movie ever I loved Whiplash Damien Chazelle s previous work but this one is something special La La Land is about a couple and their love story which I have to admit isn t something too particular or too original even if I liked a lot the ending because it was something different but nothing that was never seen The real merit of this movie is the way in which everything is portrayed starting from the magnificent direction by Chazelle to the score by Hurwitz including the great cinematography and all the cast Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were both exceptional in particular in the last 20 seconds considering they also had to dance and sing in which they were pretty amazing Generally I don t like musicals but La La Land is different because first of all I found more contextualised the dancing and singing scenes than a usual musical secondly they are gorgeous And all the movie in particular is highly poetic because of its bright colours that warms the heart of the music which is fantastic and so thoughtless that brings you away from your dimension to make you live two hours in this pocket universe in which you feel light and without any mass And you look around to the bright colours and you listen to the music played and you elevate yourself like the protagonists in a memorable scene I know that it seems like a very good trip but I wasn t high it was just the movie that provoked me all these feelings and emotions For this reason I loved every single moment of it and it s one of my favourite movies ever So if you haven t watched La La Land yet be sure to check it out It s unlikely that everyone loves it as much as I do but the poetic aspect of it really touched some cords in my heart maybe will do this even for you And if not it is however visually stunning sweet to hear and it has an enjoyable story so it is worth watching anyway,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5425778/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,A nostalgic and joyful musical feast of a film.,A nostalgic joyful and oh so realistic portrayal of chasing your dreams and living in the la la land that is Los Angeles La La Land is a different kind of masterpiece as it pays tribute to the musical films of the 40s and 50s the Astaire and Rogers MGM kind of musicals while also bringing something new to the genre specifically the modern and original elements Damien Chazelle was already a promising newcomer when he made 2014 s Whiplash also an Oscar winning film La La Land however sets the record straight that this young writer director is a true talent and possibly one of the greatest of our time One of the most important elements within Chazelle s script and directing is in one word passion Pure passion for cinema is what it takes to make a great film and Chazelle sure does know that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone sparkle as the film s leading stars on screen like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall and Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn once did in the golden age In the film Stone and Gosling s characters share the same goal to make their dreams in both acting and jazz respectively come true What comes out when you put these two acting talents together in a film is pure enjoyment and an onscreen chemistry that seems impossible to break Overall La La Land is one hell of a film to watch as it may go down in cinematic history as one of the finest films made,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5418957/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2021,Good but not that good.,La La Land had a decent plot even if it s a story told several times before Hollywood musicals are not my cup of tea cause I m used to Hollywood movies which are not musicals It kind of kills the flow of story for me I don t know how to judge their dancing and singing But their acting was great in my opinion The best part is the cinematography The visuals look like they re from a fairy tale Great color palette To wrap it up La La Land is a good movie The ending was great but the musical part kind of tries to kill it It s definitely not worthy of all those 10 stars,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7324770/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2020,Hits the right notes,I ll be honest Musicals are probably my least favourite genre They simply do not interest me After hearing the acclaim this film has gotten and the fact that it s directed by Damien Chazelle I decided to give it a go This is the best musical I ve seen so far La La Land follows Mia an aspiring actress and Sebastian a pianist who fall in love whilst trying to achieve their aspirations for the future Before seeing the movie I wondered what all the hype surrounding La La Land was After watching it I was extremely impressed by Chazelle s vision for the movie as well as the performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling This movie starts off with an amazing song and dance number that looks like it s done in one take and lasts for five minutes This is just one of many astounding musical moments Not that just but the way each scene flows into a musical number was handled immensely well Usually when people burst into song and dance I tend to roll my eyes but I loved every single song and dance in La La Land The long takes stunning camerawork and choreography made me realise how passionate Chazelle was towards filmmaking and music It wasn t just the aesthetics but the actual songs were memorable It s been a while since I watched the film and the songs are still playing in my head If that already wasn t enough the performances are stellar I believe this is a career best performance from Emma Stone She was fabulous Ryan Gosling is always a win and his chemistry with Stone is perfect Their romance is believable and you root for them through the entire journey There is an iconic dance sequence involving them both and seeing them dance for the first time was exciting Whilst the story isn t anything new and rather quite predictable the message that it s trying to tell you has so much heart Many people say this film is a love letter to LA and that is evident through the gorgeous cinematography of the city but I think it s a film for people who have dreams and want to achieve their goals to be successful in the future Plus the film pokes fun at Hollywood through its representation of Hollywood parties and auditions Damien Chazelle deserves all the praise for his creative vision on this film He s slowly becoming one of my favourite directors working today With Whiplash and La La Land I feel he will go very far La La Land is filled with incredible musical numbers beautiful cinematography and terrific performances by both leads that culminates in a finale that will bring out the tissues,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5550350/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2017,I so wanted to love this.,I went in expecting something wonderful like Chicago or Moulin Rouge but instead was treated to mediocre at best The acting was good the sound was OK but there was nothing best about it I don t know how it was able to garner ANY Oscar nominations There just wasn t anything Oscar worthy about it It was trying to had to hearken back to the days of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and failed miserably The singing wasn t that great either I like both of the star actors but this just wasn t the right vehicle for them Their singing was just OK The songs were nothing memorable that I would want the sound track for The only really good song was the one sung by John Legend The City of Stars was a nice little ditty but that about it The whole movie from beginning to end was just underwhelming Both my partner and I felt the same way walking out In fact his first words were Well that s four hours we ll never get back I said It was only two hours He said EXACTLY Oh well I guess you can t like everything,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628715/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2017,Tinky Winky Land?,Lets set the parameters An Oscar winning film or any above average picture for that matter needs to fulfil criteria that sets it apart from the average It requires a breath of innovation story line integrity and impeccable acting that levitates the subject above the norm It needs also to vault hype and financial remuneration To create a musical which I believe La La Land aspires in many parts to be there has to be a synergy between book score and choreography Sadly for this viewer not one of these three elements can be considered by any stretch of the imagination exceptional It s triumph is evident in it s cinematography and lighting which were largely outstanding But the remainder The story is typical Hollywood fare predictable without significant twists or intellectual excertion Essentially nothing out of the ordinary happens and the blandness creeps to a predictable end The acting is OK You would expect as much from someone of Gosling s ability but I hope that one day he ll be provided with a script that alienates him from the type casting that befell Hugh Grant with a diversity that De Nero was astute to select Choreography What choreography That brief moment with the bench is all that taunts the memory Singing best not go there Marni Nixon could have played both roles And I read today that it s up for 14 Academy nominations Figures Trump was successful so there s no reason this will not win Emperor s new clothes n all,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626964/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2019,A lovely movie,Finally I had the chance to watch this movie I usually don t enjoy a lot of the movies that are nominated for the Oscars because they usually are too long and visually perfect but they don t make me feel something La La Land manages to be perfect in every single aspect The visuals are awesome the music is so good and the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is so perfect that it makes me root for them,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5248073/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,Musical's are meant to suck,I used used to say I hate musicals but after watching Hamilton and La la land I ve come to the conclusion I only hate crappy musicals I watched la la land inadvertently all I knew was it was nominated for and won awards so I was shocked I found out it was a musical but I was already there so I kept on and tried to keep an open mind to maybe understand why it s so highly acclaimed What I loved the most about la la land is even after you take all all the singing and dancing aside it s still a good movie I m a sucker for romance so for a long time that s how I convinced myself I liked it the love story it told between two struggling artists I ve now grown to admit I like it just because it s a good movie And Hamilton That I watched with intent I d heard a few songs that I liked and when I googled them I was shocked to see it was from a movie adaptation of a play I d been to a theatre play that I enjoyed so I was more open minded to this than la la land I went through British curriculum in school so I never learnt about america and it s founding fathers atleast not in detail hence why my favorite thing about this is it felt like a fun history lesson enjoyable way to educate yourself in under 3hrs Unlike la la land there was no talking in between songs the whole movie s dialogue is through them and you need to listen fortunately the performances are stellar so I really did enjoy it La la land was just an amazing love story but Hamilton had romance war politics and the soundtrack was amazing and for that I think it d be hard to find a better musical,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7716819/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2017,Zings ain't what they used to be,After rave reviews and the Golden Globes there s now an Oscar Bafta buzz attached to LA LA LAND Sorry to rain on the big parade but I was not blown away Yes there s some charm here with all the homage to the Golden Age of romantic musicals and Ryan Gosling remains the most charismatic of today s young stars but the music simply isn t musical enough Gosling and Emma Stone can just about carry a song and do a bit of amateur hoofing but really the singing is nearly as ragged as it was in the screen version of LES MISERABLES and the dancing is about as far from Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly as the first round of Dancing With the Stars OK Kelly and Astaire and Ginger Rogers and other co stars of theirs did not have great singing voices but they were fantastic dancers and the song and dance numbers in their movies were never less than dazzling The closest LA LA LAND comes to dazzling is in the final routine a low rent tribute to AN American IN Paris but it just doesn t have enough dazzle As musicals go fings ain t what they used to be The jazz club scenes hit the only high spots Gosling really looks as if he s creating magic on the piano but there s no magic in his singing or his dancing nor in Stone s who alas doesn t have her co star s redeeming charisma The love story has a certain amount of charm but like the music it could do with a bit more zing The Golden Age nostalgia also extends to a clunky tribute to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE But nostalgia just isn t enough and there s too much clunkiness on display here They say there isn t the money to create great musicals like we had in MGM s heyday Surely it would take only a fraction of the budget for a CGI heavy action movie or space opera to hire some first rate dancers and singers who can act or if we must actors who can sing or mime to a better singer SINGIN IN THE RAIN cannot have been a big budget production but it s still the greatest of the greats,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623369/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2017,Overrated copy of Jacques Demy/Michel Legrand,It seems not too many know the French director Jacques Demy s films especially his musicals like The young girls of Rochefort or The umbrellas of Cherbourg or Donkey Skin nor Michel Legrand who scored these as well as many other films Those were made in the late 60ies and 70ies They are available on Netflix highly recommended Obviously the director of LaLaLand watched them over and over again but he failed totally in recreating them and transporting them into our times I find the music of LaLaLand with the exception of its main song rather forgettable the same with most of the choreography The lead actors are OK but I don t see any depth The story line is rather thin very cookie cutter and weighed down by too much sentimentality,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3617233/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2017,La La Land was quite realistic for an original musical but also fantastic in some sequences,Just watched this with my movie theatre working friend who saw it before and said it was okay The movie seems to want to be both realistic and fantasy laden as evidenced by the location shots for the former and the more imaginative set designs for the latter Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the leads and they both seem believable enough playing a real life couple trying to live their dreams and also to please each other but it seems they can t do both The original songs are pretty entertaining and their voices are well serviceable for their characters Part of me did wonder if the praise was worth it but by the end it brought a smile to me face even if the ending was not a happily ever after one So that s a recommendation for La La Land Oh and glad it just got 14 Oscar nominations,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626925/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2017,Rating: A+,At the very beginning of every year I write a list of all of the movies that I ve been anticipating for a long time mostly based on comic books and those that either have a good premise a good director and or a good cast La La Land didn t have a release date in January I think but even if they had I d have probably left it out maybe I did I don t have a least favorite genre I enjoy watching every type of movie but musicals are by far the ones that I find to be less interesting or even well made so even with a great director and cast I only got the urge to watch this film because of all of the Oscar talk and the beautiful soundtrack that I ve been listening to in the last couple of days Perfect Magic Absolutely stunning I don t have words to describe how AMAZING Chazelle s direction is I mean anyone can enjoy this film because it IS great entertainment but the amount of work that they had with this MASTERPIECE is unbelievable Extremely LOOOOONG takes over and over again with excellent synchronized choreography and an original score to remember forever and ever Every single shot drops such marvelous quality that I kept being surprised every single scene This is the best directing skills that I ve seen from a director since God knows when Congratulations Damien Chazelle You won yourself an Oscar a Golden Globe and every other award that honors the man behind everything Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are incredible and I can t imagine any other actors portraying their roles Gosling is the usual funny charming and loving guy while Emma Stone definitely has her career best performance even better than on Birdman worthy of many awards The way they interpret the songs is so captivating and emotional that they just make the music even greater watching besides listening gives it such a more compelling meaning The score is so beautiful and heartfelt that it s impossible to explain through words the feelings one has as listening to them Just fantastic My only concern with the movie was the romance and the overall story I thought it would be super clich and follow the usual paths that this type of films have Nop Even the story is great I mean I don t want to spoil anything but let me just say that clich is not a word that I ll use to describe this movie It doesn t follow anything it has its own original story and the romance is super smooth as the actors terrific performances It FEELS real I never thought I d say this ever but La La Land is probably the best film of 2016 and my favorite for sure One of the best direction I ve ever seen from anyone please Damien Chazelle keep going an absolutely pitch perfect duo Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have a perfect chemistry a fantastic non clich original story about pursuing dreams and the most beautiful and heartfelt soundtrack that I ll listen over and over again for God knows how long Magical Rememberable I can t wait to watch it again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3773920/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2017,Reminded me of the Golden Age of Hollywood,First of all this movie is not a complete musical There is a lot of singing and dancing but the movie has a lot of normal dialog as well The opening scene is very neat and is basically one long shot that takes place on the LA freeway with everybody singing and dancing It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie though I liked how the opening also had the Filmed in Cinemascope at the beginning That gave you that old school feeling right away There were many great locations in the movie that make you want to travel to LA and just hang out in jazz clubs Speaking of Jazz Clubs I really liked how J K Simmons had a small role at the jazz club considering he played a jazz instructor in WHIPLASH I really love the chemistry between Mia Emma Stone and Sebastian Ryan Gosling It was such a nod to the old Hollywood classics Emma is such a wonderful actress and captivating on screen She will probably be playing great roles for many years to come The ending was actually very very well done and had a bittersweet twist to it Finally at the VERY end they show the words THE END which also bring back great memories of movie watching days gone by,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3697430/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,Colorful dreams,The title La La Land is wonderful This word is a common word in English Webster s dictionary define La La Land as the following an euphoric dreamlike mental state detached from the harsher realities of life that is a blissful mental state that is general in dreams and free from cruel reality In my opinion this seemingly cute and unintentional word describes the story in the film very accurately and concisely and also summarizes a message that the film wants to convey to the audience In addition La La Land is also an alias for LA Los Angeles where the story of the film is located Los Angeles the city of stars countless young people come to Hollywood to find their dreams and the dreams of countless people are shattered here However there are always people looking for dreams and some people are young The starlight in this city will never be dim and it seems that it will always be so beautiful This dream country is the lovely night under the purple and blue clouds the pier that ca n t be seen at dusk the bright galaxy with stars and the dreamland that you sing and dance freely when you are happy neverland Looking up all colors are bright and pure and the air seems to be sweet Do you say that there is such pure beauty in real life We all know that answer This movie is wonderful None of us are willing to ask this question,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5632806/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2020,An all time classic musical,This is like a great 50 s MGM musical was made in 2016 and I simply cannot understand how anyone would dislike the film It has everything a musical should have There s the two appealing and darling lovebirds to follow Striking and visual pleasant colors and direction that make the film a cinematic experience from beginning to end And the score is beltable lush and with with iconic songs This is like the platonic ideal of movie musicals Best of all the script has a relative sophistication to it there s a troubling ambiguity about how the film feels about Seb and him being way to into jazz In fact the script more or less acknowledges that he is a bit a prig Indeed the film leaves the distinct impression that the romance was sacrificed on the alter of personal ambition It is annoying how the Oscar race simplified this film In the end this is one of the great musicals,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5573312/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,Robbed of Best Picture,I can see why this won Best Picture even if it was only for 30 seconds This film was fantastic I m not usually a fan of live action musicals which is why I waited to rent this one but this was a great movie Although it is a little pretentious and narcissitic but hey it s an Oscar nominated film That s the very definiton Given that this is the only movie that I ve seen Ryan Gosling in I can t really compare his role in this film to previous works so for what I got it was great His singing is pretty good And now we move to Emma Stone As far as acting goes she was fantastic but her singing ability is average and at times a bit off key I ve heard better but I ve definietely heard worse This movie goes into date night movie territory but never chick flick territory thank goodness Hey I m a guy I m not the target audience for those Overall this was a fun romp and it deserved every award it was nominated for and won with the exception of Best Costume Design What costumes It s just regular clothes The story was pretty good the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was believable although sometimes the drama and arguments were a bit overacted and the choreography and songs were awesome I am going to be listening to the soundtrack on repeat for a long time I cannot get these songs out of my head It s a mix of jazz pop funk a little bit of everything There s something for everyone to love in this fun musical romp Grade B 8 10 3 5 5 stars,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5590831/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2017,Don't waste your time!,This movie is not good The high reviews are probably studio people or friends and family of all the cast crew involved in this film I really like both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling but neither can carry a tune in this movie I m not saying these two needed to be Shirley Jones and Frank Sinatra but at least find 2 people that can sing We know Emmy Rossum can sing and they could have cast Patrick Wilson For a musical it s not just star power the leads have to be able to sing or at least dub some beautiful voice in like they did for Natalie Wood in West Side Story Plus the story is quite boring and very slow Girl meets boy girl gets boy Girl loses boy Yawn Then there s the issue of maybe only one semi catchy tune add that to the boring story and you ve got yourself a snooze fest Which no self respecting musical should ever be JK Simmons is really good in the 2 3 minutes he s in the movie but no one else is even remotely memorable In a role any male actor could have played they waste Tom Everett Scott By the way the opening production number is very clever but the song is not good by any means I ve already forgotten the tune or even the name of the song The story isn t worth summarizing here as it s too boring to repeat Very very disappointing Don t waste your money and wait for it to hit cable,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3612268/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2017,An affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past,La La Land is a musical film written and directed by Damian Chazelle Whiplash and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling I ll admit musicals are a guilty pleasure of mine but it s been a while since I last saw one that I really got into Thankfully La La Land has done just that with its memorable songs and clever choreography In the city of Los Angeles aspiring actress Mia Dolan Emma Stone meets aspiring Jazz pianist Sebastian Wilder Ryan Gosling and the two fall in love Throughout the course of their relationship the couple strive harder and harder to make something of their potential careers in the fast paced and surreal city The film plays off as an affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past complete with stylish dance choreography and bombastic set pieces Also despite its jovial tone and brightly coloured presentation there are plenty of bittersweet moments that prevent the film from becoming too sappy and overly sentimental The songs were all great and they all segued perfectly into the plot The chemistry between both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic Both actors seem like they were having a blast filming their dancing and singing scenes I rate it 8 5 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3646022/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2018,Here's to the Fools Who Dream,In 2016 writer director of Whiplash Damien Chazelle scored big at film festivals and theaters during the holiday season with one of the biggest hits of 2016 La La Land Regarded as a luscious tribute to musicals of the 40s and 50s this film has become a critical darling and audiences have warmed up to it ever since it played theatrically in December 2016 Not only that but it broke a new record at the Golden Globes by winning almost if not all the categories from best motion picture in the comedy or music section to best actor and best actress to best director to best screenplay etc While the movie is still a phenomenal piece of art it s also the perfect movie to watch on valentine s day How is it better to watch it on that said holiday as opposed to just any other day Well it s quite simple really The movie is a romantic dramedy about two struggling artists Sebastian Wilder Ryan Gosling and Mia Dolan Emma Stone The former is someone trying to bring traditional jazz back to the modern day crowd whereas the latter is an aspiring actress who comes close to giving up from failed audition after failed audition After several dates and discussions about the magic of motion pictures music and acting Mia is convinced to make her own play and even do more auditions where Sebastian gets a gig with a hip hop jazz group that soon become a hit The perseverance from these two can really make one root for them as their dreams are quite common to several artists who just want to entertain and do what they love Even with countless struggles and failures it s best to not give up for you will still rise like Maya Angelou even when you feel like there s no point While their relationship does have its troubles it s meant to be a more realistic yet intriguing approach to two artists learning about each other Their passions are what really give the movie its heart and soul both in style and in substance The aspiring musician and aspiring actress may have different views of entertainment but they re still artists who care about making a difference nonetheless Mia and Sebastian have a lot of chemistry together while Mia is more into theater and acting than music or jazz Sebastian shows her how jazz musicians speak thru their instruments whether it be from their practice or improvised performances When Mia gives Sebastian a tour of Hollywood movie sets that s where they begin to express their passions to each other and begin to warm up as a couple Sebastian advises Mia to make her own play but that doesn t mean he can be there with his fame and music gigs The real emotional side of the film lies in the conflicts between their passions Due to their passions being different their moments of glory sadly intertwine their relationship and it even toggles their hopes for getting their own careers in the first place As my 12th grade creative writing teacher once said As old fantasy Hollywood musical as it seems it s also realistic in it s portrayal it doesn t always work out That s why the emotions of the movie really pay off it deals with something many people may go through Just because one has a decent career going for them doesn t mean they can always be with their loved ones and that s where the realism in the romance angle pays off Love is not like a Disney picture as it s more complicated to sustain for some but the heart from both characters are still there and caring is what got them their dreams in the first place And then there s the film s tribute to classic jazz theater drama and Broadway and musicals of the 40s and 50s The musical numbers were composed by the film s composer Justin Hurwitz with lyrics written by musical theater composing team Pasek and Paul and they really understand the beauty and amazement of Broadway and motion picture musicals The musical numbers from Another Day of Sun to Someone in the Crowd to the Oscar winning City of Stars bring out the movie its upbeat whimsical and timeless feel that will make this film worth being up there with classics like Singin in the Rain and West Side Story that would really make people dance in their seats The Fools Who Dream really creates an emotional and character driven arch for Mia as well The singing from Gosling and Stone is nothing fantastic at first especially with the song A Lovely Night but it warms up as the film goes on and it fits as they build up to persevere in their dreams and to support one another The Planetarium segment is pure visual delight and is pretty referential by trying hard to refer back to those old Hollywood films stated creative writing teacher But the one musical number that really shines throughout the continuation of the film is Mia and Sebastian s Theme as it progresses the optimistic tone of the film while giving Ryan Gosling a real showcase of his piano talents Don t be surprised if you find a lot to enjoy in terms of the musical numbers let alone dancing to them But I think the main reason this film is the perfect film to watch on valentine s day is not only because it s a love story but it s a more optimistic and hopeful one Since this film is about two rising entertainers who despite constant struggles and dilemmas still make it big one way or another it ends up being quite relatable to anyone who started off struggling at the bottom before making it to the top The determination and bravery Mia and Sebastian have really sells the movie and the theme of never giving up and always finding support really pays off Support is the best thing anybody can use when trying to make a name for themselves and that s why it s best to not look down upon your closest friends when they help you make it somewhere everything happens for a reason And that s why the film feels like such a love letter it says that you can still make a living out of whatever passion you have just as long as you don t forget about the ones that helped you get there Complete with a special ending of realization and wonderment at the end that won t be spoiled take it upon yourself to view this optimistic and bright feature with your soul mate anytime you choose,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4061505/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2017,City of Stars,La La Land is a wonderful musical movie that tells the story of Mia played by Emma Stone and Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling and how they follow their dreams while also falling for one another This movie reminded me of the musicals I saw when I was little since I haven t watched one in years and why these kind of movies are so lovely The performances are on spot and of high quality really gave me the sense of realism Also the soundtrack is marvelous with songs like City of Stars A Lovely Night Another Day of Sun or The Fools who Dream The cinematography was a delight so many wonderful pictures and the mood that they were shot on gave the movie more realism as if it didn t have enough already The story was good but sometimes felt a little bit sudden And this is my only issue with the movie There were some scenes that just happened without some good context to them and I was like ok how did we get here but it didn t bothered me so much so that it could ruin the experience I had with this movie Also there moments in which I was like This is gonna happen next Buy again it didn t bothered me or made me feel I was wathing a predictable movie The execution was what made me enjoy it even though some scenes were predictable There was even some comic relief in it but it never seemed forced or in there just for the sake of being in there like most of the recent Marvel movies There is a scene at the end that will make most people cry no spoilers here I almost did and it was so surprising to see this type of scene done like it was done here in a musical movie but it worked wonderfully to enhance the heart that this movie had Overall a wonderfull movie that I longed to see it for quite some time now since it won 6 oscars this year I would highly recommend it to musical movie lovers and to anyone who wants to watch a movie with good story and good acting by both the leading actors 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4011266/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2017,"Wonderful Hollywood Throwback, But With A Modern Touch",Before the fracturing of cinema into targeted genres there was a time when the general concept of entertainment was paramount All ages went to the theater together so the imperative to give a little something to everyone was first and foremost on filmmakers minds La La Land is a throwback to that style of movie production a rollicking musical that also features a solid plot and interesting characters For a very basic overview La La Land tells the story of two young people trying to make a go of it in Los Angeles Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a jazz musician with a dream of opening his own club Mia Emma Stone is an aspiring actress who never seems to have any luck in her auditions After a few chance meetings however they discover that it may take their beliefs in each other to make those individual dreams come true First and foremost La La Land is a musical to its very bones Much dare I say most of the emotion and character development is portrayed through song and dance numbers which run the gamut from jazz and big band to orchestral and popular Justin Hurwitz creates a soundtrack score that is truly one of the best I have encountered in my cinematic travails I can all but guarantee you ll be listening singing humming the tunes here for days weeks or potentially longer after viewing At the same time however La La Land is not vapid in any sense Its story of perseverance the power of relationships and dream fulfillment is endemic to the human condition and director Damien Chazelle is able to expertly weave such themes within the musical numbers The songs dances plots and characters all intertwine to create a perfect tapestry of emotion It doesn t hurt that the chemistry between leads Gosling and Stone is absolutely off the charts truly the stuff of legends Again a sort of throwback to the Old Hollywood studio systems where leading men women were often thrust together in multiple pictures The Gosling Stone combination was cultivated through previous pairings of their own and that familiarity comes to a perfect crescendo here Overall I consider La La Land to be a very deserving full star effort It may not make any groundbreaking political racial or societal statements but every time I watch I m instantly pulled into its fun atmosphere and endearing messages Sometimes a film even in today s fractured cinema environment can simply be all about the entertainment factor and in that capacity La La Land is at the top of my list,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3649661/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2017,Sum of correctly done parts does not make a correct movie,Although this movie is probably about pursuing one s dreams and sacrifices necessary in the process it ended up as a lousy musical with good music It s also dedicated to some golden era in Hollywood when musical was the best there is in the industry So instead of a clear emotional story of two star crossed lovers we ve got collision of dreams of two egoists who think their individual success is more important than than anything else It isn t It s just that could not reconcile one type of emotion craving for fame with another love Direction is not bad however not as good as in Whiplash and everything has been watered down with two miscast main actors who cannot sing and acting itself is also doubtful Ending of the story was predictable and probably many Hollywood staff would recognize itself here As for the musical unfortunately I liked only Sweeny Todd meaning that it could not function in any other form Summary Worth a look but soon to be forgotten despite the hype Four stars for cinematography,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3651500/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2017,Feels both traditional and contemporary,There was a time I remember sometime during the mid to late 90s when the idea of watching a musical was laughable It was a silly trend that was once popular with the movie going audience back when cinema was relatively primitive which saw a kitschy revival in the 70s and 80s with the likes of Grease 1978 and Xanadu 1980 but died a death when the rapid evolution of CGI made anything possible on screen Then came Moulin Rouge and its use of modernised classic tunes in 2001 and movie goers have been in love with the genre again ever since Its popularity shows no sign of stopping either and writer director Damien Chazelle who made a big impression in 2014 with the excellent Whiplash has sculpted one of the best musicals of recent times with the Oscar nominated La La Land a film that manages to feel both traditional and contemporary The film combines two elements clearly dear to Chazelle The lavish musicals of the 1950s and to a lesser degree the 40s and pure jazz The two wandering souls at the story s centre dream of leaving their mark in their respected fields but both are in love with the past in industries always looking forward Actress Mia Emma Stone spends time between humiliating and soul crushing auditions serving coffee near a studio lot where she occasionally crosses paths with a glamorous star as the rest of the room whisper excitedly Musician Sebastian Ryan Gosling cannot resist ignoring the festive playlist at his restaurant haunt in favour of some improvisation on the piano much to the annoyance of his boss Bill J K Simmons while he dreams of opening his own traditional jazz bar Sebastian is quick tempered neurotic and plain rude but Mia pursues him anyway They fall in love and express their feelings through impromptu song and dance routines Chazelle knows the genre inside out and seems to favour the lavish MGM musicals and the glamorous physicality of the era s stars such as Gene Kelly Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Opening with a near one shot song and dance routine beautifully photographed by Linus Sandgren it goes on to deliver many dazzling and classical numbers which are often glorious to behold and backed by a soundtrack of memorable tunes that manage to stay in your head for days afterwards They are performed admirably by the central pair who have real chemistry One of the few saving graces of the Amazing Spider Man films was the chemistry between Stone and Andrew Garfield and here she sizzles with Gosling It s the movie s main strength Rather than merely go through the motions and familiar tropes you really want them to be together You can truly feel their happiness every time they see each other La La Land stutters when exploring deeper more complex themes The second act sees the two achieve some degree of success with Mia developing a one woman show and Sebastian joining up with a fellow musician played by John Legend in a band making waves in the world of jazz Will Mia ultimately degrade herself in order to make it in a brutal industry that may not deserve her and how can Sebastian a hardcore old schooler be happy in a flashy group looking to move the genre forward It seems like a poor excuse to simply tear the couple apart to experience their inevitable rough patch and doesn t really fully explore the characters emotional quandaries But this slight lag doesn t last for very long and the final moments are simply perfect One of the great things about Whiplash was that final heart pounding moment of physical and spiritual triumph and La La Land wraps up the story with grace and genuine tugs on the heartstrings proving itself to be much more than a mere homage,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3696809/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2018,La La Land will always be remembered as the film that nearly got Best Picture.,Now as most of you know I dislike musicals Randomly bursting into song is just not to my taste at all Then La La Land came along and I consistently read overrated boring and snoozefest by most amateur reviewers After literally just watching this I can confidently say instantaneously La La Land is phenomenal Oh My Word I love it when I m wrong and I was so wrong about this I cannot fault it I have fallen in love with La La Land You could say I ve gone la la for it Where to even begin This isn t just a musical This is a homage to classic cinema an endearing tribute to all those silver screen masterpieces that have moulded Hollywood to what it is today Dive beneath the glossy surface and I found myself experiencing a story about fulfilling dreams pursuing passions and just live life to its fullest It evoked pure joy from me genuine happiness I have never smiled and teared up simultaneously to a film before ever Yet Damien Chazelle went and only done that His direction was absolutely outstanding From the gorgeous long takes to the vibrant colour usage He deserved every award Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both gave magically enigmatic performances particularly the former who mesmerised me with her solo audition performance The choreography during the dance sequences defines classy imitating the classic pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers The soundtrack will be instantly downloaded City of Stars and Mia Sebastian s Theme were the highlights The production costume and sound design were all perfect The dimming of the lights to focus on the characters felt refreshingly revelatory Urghhh I think I m in love This is why I adore the medium of film To capture the magic of a whirlwind romance in a joyous perspective It is undoubtedly rare to watch a film in this calibre I never thought I would say this but La La Land gets the perfect rating Damian Chazelle two for two congratulations Keep it up,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4072997/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2020,Movie magic,When I watched and reviewed this film for the first time about three years ago I spent most of the review talking about movie magic I did it because I believed this movie to be one of the finest examples of that Now three years later that belief has only grown stronger For some reason I had almost completely forgotten how happy La La Land made me Otherwise I wouldn t have waited three years to watch it again Indeed now that I had decided to see it once more I was incredibly excited to watch it Probably the most excited I have ever been to watch a movie at home But I was also scared You see this is one of the movies that I hold closest to my heart and quite frankly I was scared that I wouldn t like it as much as I did on the first time What if it didn t feel special anymore So in my state of excitement and fright I started the movie and as soon as the first scene started I completely forgot about that fright and just started smiling That s why I love this movie so much That s why it s one of my all time favourites Because it just makes me so damn happy La La Land is either my favourite or second favourite movie of all time I need to rewatch Whiplash to confirm which one it is One of the reasons why I love this movie so terribly much is because it s one of the only movies that I have seen that can just make me forget about everything else for over two hours I love the music and the dancing I love the way this film is shot and its gorgeous lighting And above all else I love the story and how it makes me feel Perhaps it is that unexplainable movie magic that makes this movie as good as it is I really need to make sure that I watch this film more often in the future To me La La Land really is just a festival of joy It s filled with feeling and wonder and it takes me to some other much happier place To end with my favourite quote from the movie Here s to the fools who dream crazy as they may seem,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6251166/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2018,Love or Hate musicals: Watch this film!,As you may be able to tell by the other reviews on this website everyone is split on whether this is a good film or a bad film Think of it as this the film is described as a Comedy Musical and Drama This film is funny when it needs to be I wouldn t call it an out and out comedy like a Kevin Hart or Will Ferrell film Nor would I compare it to a Wes Anderson film where it s a witty black comedy It s just funny when it needs to be This film is a brilliant drama The film begins and you may think Oh well this is generic but if you stay to the very end of this film you will find that Damien Chazelle has not only proved himself as a very good writer but is a world class director No other director can develop characters and make you care for them like Damien This film is also a musical surprise surprise I don t know what people were expecting coming into a modern musical but the Director chose Jazz Not everyone likes Jazz but personally I thoroughly enjoyed the music in this film and this comes from someone who doesn t like musicals OR JAZZ I won t ridicule you for not liking this film but no matter what you think about Musicals or Dramas or the film itself You MUST watch your film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4059822/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2016,Remarkable! One of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year,La La Land has the exuberance of West Side Story the willpower of Dreamgirls and the pizazz of Grease s romance Writer director Damien Chazelle who rocked our world with Whiplash a couple of years ago has done it again Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are a movie match made in musical heaven I seriously cannot find a single false note with La La Land The story is about Mia Emma Stone who is an aspiring actress struggling from one audition to the next her daytime job is working at a coffee shop in a studio lot where she can be near her dream Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a dedicated jazz musician struggling to make ends meet dreaming of someday running his own jazz club Mia and Sebastian meet and fall for each other but they live in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts Together they continue to explore the joy and pain of pursuing their dreams Damien Chazelle has found a way to reignite our love for Los Angeles the way Rebel Without a Cause did decades ago in fact much of La La Land is more or less of an homage to that James Dean classic The colors the look the design the tone even though it s set in present day the characters could ve easily been transported from a golden age era What an ambitious production Chazelle s crew even literally reserved a whole freeway just for their opening scene and trust me when I say that that scene must ve been worth the traffic because it s absolutely spectacular The songs the music the choreography are flawless they re on point they re upbeat they take you up to cloud nine And when the rejections roll in and the characters hit rock bottom and Ryan Gosling melodiously sings his City Of Stars song it s so tender it becomes your only desired remedy Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had worked together before on Gangster Squad so you can sense that these two actors feel very comfortable in each other s company The level of trust between them is evident It must be like returning to a familiar place One sequence stands out where they dance at the Griffith Park and they re so in sync you start to wonder how many takes did it take for them to get that down pat What s even more impressive is their abilities to play instruments and sing even if you don t like musical the minute you watch La La Land you ll stand up and cheer because the things that Gosling and Stone do will blow your mind La La Land is original it s remarkable it s one of the best experiences I ve had in theaters this year With this film Chazelle has established himself as one of the greatest storytellers of our time And the themes hit home Pursuing your dreams does come with a cost because it all comes down to whether or not you re willing to give it all you ve got It s so much easier to just play it safe and do regular 9 to 5 job like everybody else Pursuing your dreams is risky self doubt gets to haunt you every step of the way and failure lurks around the corner But what s wonderful about La La Land is that it points out the importance of having someone that believes IN you just like the way Mia and Sebastian believe in each other the world be damned Rama s Screen,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3594207/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2016,La La Land,I wonder if I had just stumbled upon this movie being Damien Chazelle s third as director not knowing anything or knowing little about it if I would ve liked loved fallen head over heels for it more than I did Because of the state of the independent film scene and this is one of those mid way movies like Pulp Fiction where it has its toes in indie and mainstream Hollywood the latter if nothing else via its stars and setting movies like La La Land come backed with the kind of hype that usually would be reserved for say a Star Wars movie It also has to do too with the director s previous Whiplash being a ride that gives Emotional Roller coaster its clich d status since it was the announcement of a director from my generation exact age group swinging for the fences And La La Land with its major reviews and festival runs seemed like another one And it is ultimately a great movie Could it have been better Hmm Sometimes furthermore coming right off from seeing as movie and dumping thoughts and feelings out like a raccoon spilling a garbage can at night and scattering the contents is not always correct as one might say It may take another viewing or a few days to get more of what I felt about it But I can say that this is a movie about musicals and musical about movies and usually these cross and twist like it s a dance out in outer space Chazelle is also bringing a story that is so familiar artists in music and performance close enough as the same thing who meet have a little push and pull at first they first meet by the usual serendipity of LA traffic jam that it could be criticized as a rehash Hell we just had a movie come out a month ago around this same time Nocturnal Animals that if you look closely isn t too far off though the endings are VERY different which I ll get to what is so gobsmackingly JOYFUL about this movie Gosling and Stone first were paired five years ago in Crazy Stupid Love and I m sure Chazelle knew this and bet on it being stronger this time around Though as a nitpick and it should be mentioned Gosling can t sing anything exceptional Stone can and they know how to dance and bond and kiss and bring the romance out in full force La La Land would be a beautiful exercise in technicalities of pulling off all of the care free MOVIE ideas that Chazelle has seriously he s about as geeky in his homage as Tarantino notice the Ingrid Bergman wall sized poster in Mia s place and other parts or the whole use of the WB lot but what makes it a triumph is that the actors work well together and separately More than well they find the truth in the clich s that come with artists trying to make it and sell it as well as Chazelle s script can get them to Which perhaps is the one thing that keeps me from saying OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I ve EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE which again hype it takes you so immediately into musical terrain with its opening number in LA traffic that it s jarring to then go back into the real world more or less Songs of course happen but it s a balancing act and all the while Chazelle s story points for these two is so familiar as far as the What Happens When You Follow Your Dreams in Artistic Corporate America thing that it goes into what could almost be dangerous terrain not embracing and finding a truth in clich but just being conventional i e how Gosling becomes a piano player in a group John Legend s got and this takes him away from his actual dream of a jazz club and then Stone s Mia s dream of being an actress etc etc so forth and so on And then the final 15 minutes or so happens where we flash ahead five years to what s happened with these two people who at one point went to the same planetarium as in Rebel Without a Cause and dance and go into the stratosphere of the galaxy I m reminded of the French New Wave a lot by the way in how much Chazelle embraces post modern self consciousness if Breathless was his Whiplash is this his uh A Woman is a Woman And the two of them have changed more or less and Gosling plays a song that transports into the what if and it s I don t have words for it It s what the movies are about It s a magical wonderful 15 minutes that reminded me why I can stand being around people whispering like I don t hear you old bastards and munching popcorn and can be transported into a completely made up empathetic landscape My first instinct is to go for the typical critical bulls of saying this is better than this that is Whiplash vs La La Land but it doesn t matter That last fifteen minutes and many other scenes and Stone s performance and the dancing and the whole color palette and the cinematography oh man I don t care if you re verging from homage into rip off of PT Anderson it s so delicious for my eyes to look at confirms that Chazelle is the real deal a filmmaker with something to say about the human experience about what it means to chase that unfortunate dragon known as the dream of artists and musicians and actors and so on and at the same time can bring it forward with soul It takes a little time but my instinct is to call this a soulful Hollywood movie first beautiful homage second,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601608/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2019,Once Upon A Time In (And Around) Los Angeles,There are various kinds of reality about Los Angeles and its surrounding environs One is the decades long reputation it has of making dreams come true Another on the opposite end of the spectrum is the equally long reputation it has of destroying those dreams And still another is one where every wacky thing that can happen to any part of the human race good or bad does indeed happen televised high speed car chases firestorms fueled by Santa Ana winds incredible urban flooding earthquakes ethnic gang murders riots entertainment scandals especially the latter because well there s Hollywood But in 2016 a totally unusual film came out that tried and in many ways succeeded in restoring a fair amount if not all of the reputation that L A has of being a proud metropolis That film was LA LA LAND a film that became one of the highest grossing musicals in Hollywood history and won a staggering six Oscars Beginning with one of the most elaborate opening musical numbers ever staged for any film done on location at the interchange of I 105 and I 110 the film charts an aspiring jazz pianist Ryan Gosling who finds his career going nowhere forced as he is to find gigs in dingy bars and clubs in and around L A and being prodded by a friend John Legend to adjust to the changing times of the jazz genre And then there is an aspiring actress Emma Stone who in between casting auditions that also go nowhere is serving her time out as a barrista to the stars No one would think that these two disparate souls with dreams that are either being stalled or going in reverse could possibly meet let alone fall in love But this being Los Angeles in general and Hollywood specifically it does indeed happen Of course nothing ever happens without some kinks Even as Gosling and Stone find themselves falling in love they also see their careers finally starting to rise which in turn leads to their budding romance undergoing as much strain as one of the region s many earthquake faults Stone is initially not even remotely fond of the jazz music that Gosling parlays his trade in and Gosling is himself cynical of the acting business and even the approach of Angelinos to life in general they worship everything and they value NOTHING Still in between these foibles and acts of dissolution and disillusionment both Gosling and Stone engage in wily banter and some of the most incredible musical numbers seen in any Hollywood film outside of animated movies for decades including the wish fulfilling City Of Stars Damien Chazelle who wrote and directed the 2014 Oscar winning drama WHIPLASH was taking a sizeable risk in making LA LA LAND He clearly wanted to bring about in the late part of the second decade of the 21st century the same kinds of emotions that one felt in past musicals like SINGIN IN THE RAIN WEST SIDE STORY and CABARET but with something wholly original But even with more recent box office hits like CHICAGO and DREAMGIRLS musicals are as expensive to pull off as almost any other kind of film except for comic book CGI extravaganzas and some of the biggest ones even if in the distant past have been tremendous box office disasters What Chazelle had going for him here fortunately were two extremely appealing leads in Gosling and Stone as well as supporting turns from Legend a devotee of old school R B and jazz music and J K Simmons who plays Gosling s boss and who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in WHIPLASH And even more to the point Los Angeles and its satellite cities and landmarks serve as supporting characters themselves the Hermosa Beach pier the Griffith Observatory the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena and the aforementioned I 105 I 110 interchange in South Los Angeles Although it is at times a bit emotionally distant LA LA LAND is still an entirely original musical in which the world or at least L A itself is the stage and the characters and the region itself all play their parts This is never the easiest thing to pull off but Chazelle and company managed to do it and do it like gangbusters,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4998965/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2020,"A masterpiece in technical qualities, breaking new ground with its tragic story while simultaneously being a love letter to years past musicals",A masterpiece in editing cinematography sound design composition and production design La La Land is a timeless showcase from director Damien Chazelle at his best breaking new ground with its tragic story while simultaneously being a love letter to years past musicals led by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling The technical qualities of La La Land are superlative Damien Chazelle expertly crafts the choreography with the editing and sound design The song and dance numbers throughout the film especially during the opening at the road interchange are flawlessly directed Employing long continuous shots do not distract from the singing and dance sequences In terms of cinematography shooting the movie on film rather than digital and using the widescreen CinemaScope aspect ratio gives La La Land a classical look Low light photography in select scenes reflects each character s emotional state The cinematography is contrasted by brightly lit scenes which further reflects the ambitious and high minded themes of the movie Every technical quality fits and transitions so perfectly and fluidly that it heightens the audience s connection to the characters La La Land is such a beautiful looking movie deserving of every technical award it receives best experienced personally Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are once again dynamite and electric as an on screen couple from their previous roles in Crazy Stupid Love and Gangster Squad Built on the back of their performances La La Land could never succeed as a romance film without the two protagonist s chemistry Instead of looking like speaking rehearsed lines Stone and Gosling convey a sense of genuine love and likability as their characters undergo development Stone plays Mia Dolan a barista aspiring to be an actress Gosling plays Sebastian Wilder a pianist with a passion for jazz Their life and ambitions are intertwined in Los Angeles Mia continues to audition for roles without success Sebastian somehow achieves stardom and financial stability when his former classmate Keith played by John Legend offered him to be the pianist of his jazz fusion band The part requires him to be on tour for months or years away from Mia His commitment leads to a fight against Mia when she protested his acceptance of the role which is against his musical philosophy Earlier suffering an embarrassing performance due to low attendance leading to the inability to pay back the theater and Sebastian s absence Mia breaks up with him moving back to Boulder City to continue her studies and abandon acting altogether Receiving a call for an audition Sebastian travels to Boulder City to inform Mia who returns to Los Angeles After the audition both confess their love but uncertain of the future In the boldest move of the movie 5 years are skipped Mia is a successful actress and married to another actor while Sebastian now owns a jazz club Going out for a dinner with her husband Mia inadvertently stumbles to Sebastian s jazz club aptly named Seb her original idea during their love life Noticing Mia among the audience Sebastian plays their song and a dream sequence occurs of what might have been Before exiting the club Sebastian and Mia share a smile as the movie ends La La Land speaks to everyone s burning desire for glory However do we achieve our dreams by ending our relationships with loved ones Do we sacrifice people with whom we have an emotional attachment to achieve our ambitions On the surface the movie ended with both protagonists parting ways but closer inspection reveals that despite ultimately leading diverging lives Mia and Sebastian retain their love and that it was anchored not by physical attraction but by mutual respect and the desire to see each other succeed The overarching theme of La La Land then is not about the common physical attraction but ideals of dreams and ambitions Driven by a character heavy emphasis the movie allows the themes to resonate emotionally by the time the credits roll Damien Chazelle delivers a musical masterpiece with modern sensibilities 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5380802/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2017,Lost in Hollywood,My wife and I were really looking forward to watching this Oscar festooned movie I personally love Golden Age Hollywood musicals and had read all the press about its revamping the genre for the present day Somehow though it just didn t connect with us I did like the cinematography with its Hopper like depiction of low rent Hollywood from film sets to restaurants and jazz clubs There were no sex scenes the camera work was fluid throughout and I appreciated the references to the past with the old style titles and old fashioned scene changes too But after that I struggled to relate to the characters Ryan Gosling s character is determined to make his actress girl friend like jazz and by extension the viewer but I know what I like and I didn t warm to the live club scenes with Gosling immersing himself in his music Likewise Stone s travails with her acting ambitions as she flunks screen tests and takes a waitress job as she seeks her big break I didn t hate them I just didn t care for them The songs were okay I guess but sitting here a day after watching it none of them is still in my memory The set piece choreographed numbers are likewise easy on the eye but again aren t particularly memorable especially compared to those from yesteryear Gosling and Stone are okay in their roles and work hard at their singing and dancing but I didn t sense much chemistry between them I certainly didn t think I was watching Hollywood s best actress of the year It probably helps to like and appreciate characters like this if you re in the entertainment industry otherwise they can come across as here as precious and vain Maybe I m being too critical in invoking the great films it seems to draw upon for inspiration but the fact that it got decorated with six Oscars the other day for me says something about the quality of competition today compared to earlier times No if I want to see a movie about a struggling jazz musician and his ambitious girlfriend I ll go back and watch New York New York,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3659200/?ref_=tt_urv

Not one bit!,Special opening comment for IDMB com Honestly I just wanted to leave my thoughts on the film itself but then I saw the overwhelming amount of positive reviews on this film and praising it like there is no tomorrow Love letter to Hollywood Really In what way is La La Land a love letter All it does is refer to some classics and then completely botches up the elements that makes us love the classics in the first place If anything this is making a mockery out of everyone involved in those high quality old school musicals that were made with love and passion La La Land is made out of greed You better remember this Now I have this out of my system my original review which you can read on my website Chrichton s World La La Land is a tribute to the old school musicals where actors like Fred Astaire Gene Kelly Debbie Reynolds and many others impressed us with their acting singing and dancing They were top notch in whatever they did on the screen and truly were stars all around However La La Land is not a particularly good tribute as it lacks a lot that made films like Singin in the Rain and An American in Paris classics So what went wrong First and foremost the musical numbers are far from memorable When I first heard the song City of Stars I liked it instantly It easily is the best song but at the same time a very flawed one Why Ryan Gosling is not a good singer I am sure he tried his best but you can hear that he can t sing that well In another version of the song Emma Stone chimes in and I don t like that version at all because she is even a worse singer than he is Both also can t dance and it s so bad that it was ruining the enjoyment You can tell that they are struggling and their movements were far too slow In the opening musical number you have a bunch of unknown people singing and dancing and they obviously know what they are doing as they move very swiftly and gracefully They also do a lot of impressive stunt work very reminiscent of what was shown in the older musicals And while this scene was good it exposed the flaws of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as leads Especially in the first dance scene featuring Emma Stone it becomes painfully obvious she is not a match for anyone in the opening scene Another huge problem is the story Or lack of Nothing in the story was remotely interesting and pretty by the numbers and the one supposed conflict was so predictable and forced that destroyed all the hope that was left What hope For this film to redeem itself And it never does Instead it gives us an ending opposite of what is expected since director Damien Chazelle is pretentious and very full of himself I guess the fame and success he achieved with Whiplash has gotten to his head And Whiplash wasn t that good in the first place And no I don t need predictable endings What I do need are endings that are logical and are written well It has to make sense why characters behave and act a certain way You have to give the viewer reasons to make their actions believable Chazelle never even attempts this He only gives a motivation out of convenience Also I am failing to see how anything in this film could be seen as comedic There maybe were one or two moments that were genuinely funny but enough for this film to be advertised as a comedy Not in the slightest Also just referring to the classics is not enough You need to add something of your own to make it unique or entertaining I mean these songs were the best they could do At points they showed L A in the background and it looked like more was going to be done with the scenery like Michael Mann did in Heat I think more beautiful shots of L A at night would have surely made some impact But of course that would have required real effort I don t feel like writing anymore Truth be told I was very looking forward to this film since I really was in the mood for some old school fun and all I got in return is anger and disappointment since this film is nothing like the classics I do think I have been very fair as this film is advertised as one of the greatest musicals films in a long time And this simply is not true Even with all the good will this film has no redeeming elements whatsoever,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630924/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2017,Very Good,Sebastian Ryan Gosling a traditional Jazz piano player and Mia Emma Watson an aspiring actress meet and fall in love Sebastian s dream is to have his own Jazz Club and Mia s dream is to be a successful actress I told them I wanted Westerns to be brought back and what they did was to bring back a Musical A Musical of all things Well it wasn t too bad and it got a lot better after the first 15 minutes when they showed a traffic jam on the freeway and everyone got out of their cars to sing and dance Pretty lame and you could tell the voices were dubbed in What was I in for when this movie was nominated for all kinds of Oscars Someone should have seen those first 15 minutes didn t work The music was not of the toe tapping kind the dancing was okay I guess but way overdone I was beginning to think this was going to try too hard Woe is us The story really starts when Sebastian and Mia meet and their chemistry was spot on Kudos We hear them singing and see them dancing The choreography was excellent for two actors not known for singing and dancing Hey it worked and was enjoyable to watch all the rest of the way Mia decides her auditions weren t working and starts to write a one woman play Sebastian is offered a job by Keith John Legend The music here is what I would call Jazz Rock and is meant to bring in the younger crowd because no one really likes traditional Jazz anymore Or that is what is commonly known Sebastian doesn t really like this kind of music but it s a job and he needs a job Things work for a while until troubles come to paradise and we see dream conflicts Oh oh The music and choreography after the first 15 minutes were very good and maybe those Oscar nominations were deserved after all Of course they were The movie did get Oscars for Best Actress Emma Watson Best Director Damien Chazelle Best Original Song City of Stars and Best Original Score Notable J K Simmons as Bill who fires Sebastian because he wouldn t play the traditional Christmas music and ended up playing some serious Jazz This may be the start of Musical Revivals but am still hoping someone will bring back the Westerns 9 10 Violence No Sex No Nudity No Language Only on F bomb was heard,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3694650/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2016,"An unashamedly romantic musical, infused with intense charisma and devastating emotion",I was interested in seeing this film because not only am I a sucker for a good musical but I ll admit to being a big fan of Ryan Gosling and I was intrigued to see what the director of Whiplash would do with a musical picture to make it fresh and unique So when I had the chance to see a late planned viewing at the London Film Festival I jumped at the chance FYI Ryan Gosling came to the screening as a surprise post film Q A attendee despite not appearing at the Headline Gala the night before so I was chuffed The premise of the story is that Stone is a young actress who has moved to LA to wait tables while auditioning to try and make it while Gosling is a jazz purist Anyone who doesn t like jazz just doesn t have the right context he insists who plays the piano in bars to make a living and dreams of opening his own Jazz bar Or to put it succinctly Two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing their dreams The musical flows thematically from first love to heartbreak and every other emotion between with great music throughout The most impressive thing about the film for me is just how daringly it dances between the old fashioned Singing In The Rain style of musical and a bolder modern style The song numbers are great the opening number received a round of applause in my viewing and are an undoubted homage to classic musicals a thoughtful mixture of old school dance numbers you d expect from a musical in the 50s and emotionally wrenching ballads that hit you where it hurts there is one particular sequence toward the end of the film which is a real gut punch Stylistically the film skirts this same line the film again looks and acts like a classic musical but frequently we see low key reminders that this is modern day actresses using their iPhones a video being seen on Youtube etc to remind us that this is set in the present day If we didn t have these reminders the visuals would almost have you thinking that this is the 1950s The cinematography is beautiful and overall the film is visually stunning There is also no doubt that it is wonderfully directed with the same masterful control of pace and tension that we come to expect from Damien Chazelle thanks to Whiplash Gosling in particular is absolutely terrific with a typically sardonic wit throughout At the start of the film when his sister says she s worried about him as life seems to have him on the ropes he responds I wanna be on the ropes I m just letting life think it has me and then before you know it BAM It s a classic rope a dope His delivery of these sorts of lines can t be matched and it s easy to see why the producers said in the post film Q A that he was the person they wanted for the role in their wildest dreams It s a role made for him with tons more of the above kind of lines But more than that Gosling captures a real emotional intensity at the film s emotional breaking points more specifically in the sequence towards the end of the film that I mentioned earlier He manages to convey such convincing emotion without so much as a word I d feel bad if I didn t also praise Emma Stone who has probably never been better She has wonderful emotional range from the ecstatic highs of love to the tearful painful lows In terms of the Gosling Stone films this is by far the best Their undoubted chemistry is given the full spotlight in this film with freedom to explore said chemistry without restriction The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be an unashamedly romantic musical infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling Stone wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle Oh and it s hilarious throughout too A genuine achievement must be one of the best films I ve seen in a long while I m annoyed I ll have to wait so long to see it again frankly Will surely win multiple Oscars and other awards,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3559256/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2017,Criminally over-hyped,To boot I loved almost all the separate components of the film individually but I didn t love the resulting bundle Aesthetically my eyes were gently caressed with beauty for the full duration of the movie and for that I m most appreciative Ryan Gosling is his usual immaculate self succeeding in gracing us with yet another stunning performance stylish suave and utterly charming Emma Stone has her ups and middles but never a down and she gave me one of the sole two scenes that made my breathing falter against an emotional hiccup another win Now on the musical side of things Meh The songs left me disinterested the overall sound dress of the film rang uninspired and repetitive only resonating with my pathos during a couple of instances while the rest lagged tiredly to the request of the more instinct driven scenes The story itself a bit silly no Simplistic almost benefiting from a strong start a fantastic ending and the sparking chemistry between the protagonists on the other hand lacking any sort of actual substance past the forced demand to fall head over heels with the kitty cuteness that we are being presented no questions asked I don t like having my arm twisted into feeling and this is where this otherwise whimsical tale of sensory affluence hit another miss for me To sum up I acknowledge the individuality of the project felt the strive and artistry that is so craftily weaved into the seams of this audiovisual extravaganza and I was without a doubt entertained On the flip side the way it all translated to my reason the shortcomings of La La Land make this a middle tier effort only edging ahead on account of the fact that along with the glossy couple I got to glide with effortless elegance through a Starry Night brush shoulders with Monet journey into the colourful and the capricious For that fact I will accept defeat bump it up another star and humbly take off my fedora to it,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623312/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2017,Great pretender,It is flashy and colorful and the acting is good the dancing and singing not so much some of the music is really well placed if forgettable But it is a movie that pretends for 128 minutes to be something it is not It is not a musical It tries to be But it forgets 20 minutes in and then remembers in the end for one wonderful classical musical scene that would be brilliant if it was all that La La Land was But the rest is not really a musical Mostly because while it doesn t lack music it lacks music numbers And the ones it has feel mostly out of place and there only so a bland love story can be called something more interesting It is a movie with music Not particularly good music either There are two numbers that stuck with me for longer then the length of the movie The rest might work within the story but doesn t manage to stand on its own The movie also pretends to be original Which it is not There has been stories like that And better ones The characters are not sympathetic either He is snobbish and self centered and even in his growth remains a jerk She has no idea what she wants and while she pretends to grow she remains a child If the actors were any less charming and worked less well together I would be rooting for them to get slapped for half the movie It made caring if they stay together or not and watching their struggles and their happy moments much less involved And uninvolved audience is not something you are striving for as a story teller And the ending of the movie don t even let me start on that I was somewhat looking forward to it despite the movie s flaws and then the movie slapped me in the face and spit on itself and me as well I ended up feeling lied to and took for a fool I have seen two wonderful movies that same week and going out of La La Land it was everything a movie should not make you feel Disappointed Mislead Empty Just like the movie is,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626148/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2017,Left me speechless !!,We Indians love musicals and each movie we make irrespective of the language has songs and dances Very rare we make a song less movie But hats off to Damien Chazelle for writing and directing a musical which beats us in our own game After watching La La Land I wondered why we couldn t make a movie like this with the kind of talent Bollywood and rest of the many regional language film industries India has I don t know where to start about La La Land The story of young struggling actress and a Jazz musician in LA could have been a run of the mill film but Damien is fine writer So he does include the clich s but also keeps small twists and turns in the story He tells the story in forms of the seasons in LA and how life changes like the seasons And when we audience think that all is fine he beautifully delivers the hammer blow at the end which left me speechless When I left the theatre I was wondering how my life is at the moment and how my life could have been if some dreams had come true My introspection is the result of power of writing Pity he didn t won an Oscar for writing Every frame in the movie looks like a painting and the movie deserves the Oscar for cinematography And the music is outstanding Gosling and Stone are a fine couple on screen and their chemistry lifts this film to another level Both of fabulous actors Stone beautifully shows the pain of a struggler while Gosling shows the unhappiness inspite achieving success Whether the film should have won the Best film well after seeing Moonlight I can tell But its a beautiful film that the reminds us that life will always have surprises,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3701680/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2016,disappointing,I so looked forward to this film and was greatly disappointed I find it hard to believe that it is being spoken of as an Oscar contender Ryan Gosling was fairly good in his movements but rather weak in singing Emma Stone is awful I do not comprehend her popularity at all she never seems genuine to me I feel I can tell she s acting and cannot get into her character Some of the dancing scenes were downright silly and the songs unrealistic thereby giving a feeling of falsehood The main premise was believable but depicted poorly The cinematography was fine as were the period artifacts displayed lending authenticity to the era However overall it was simply a letdown and I cannot recommend it to anyone at all,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3604969/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2016,I am heart broken and Damien Chazelle should 'Apologize'- No Oscars for this one,Dear Damien I really had great expectations for this film I waited for a year to see this film I was so excited that I walked ten minutes in the rain to go see this film I am going to tell you what I felt about the film as I watched your film so that you can learn something from my letter I was very happy to see the initial traffic jam and the first song I was thrilled to see what happens next As soon as the film started I started to feel there was no story line to keep me interested There were no plot points Who wrote this script I could not relate to Emma Stone s character because there was nothing to look forward to regarding her goal She was just an aspiring actress who was lost in Los Angeles failing auditions Whats interesting about that The film was dis jointed It was a big mess The biggest mistake you made was to cast Ryan Gosling This actor s face is bland He is probably angry with someone on the set and it shows on his face This guy has no expressions on his face He has no idea how to act in certain scenes He just keeps his face expression less so that nobody can relate to him in the film Deborah Aquila should have helped you find a better actor Who selected Ryan s wardrobe There was nothing interesting about his bland clothes to go with the musical His emotions on his face do not match the flow of the story Ryan you are not a face for musical or romance or hero for a romantic comedy You are a face of a villain or a boxing film You should do those films The way the director have these two characters meet is so weak There was nothing romantic about how they meet Emma Stone is a good actress but she kept emotionally staring in space in lot of scenes which were not removed in editing and it affected her performance Acting with Ryan Gosling also affected her performance There was one scene in the film where she goes and stands right in front of movie theater full of audience and nobody reacts or shouts as she stands in front of all of this audience while movie is playing How unbelievable I wanted to like something something in this film I tried very hard I wanted to like a scene where they are about to hold hands in movie theater but even Damien ruined that romantic scene by doing something stupid I wont forgive you for that Then someone gave you a museum to shoot in You should have made best use of those scenes but you did not There was nothing exciting about it There were sound problems with car horns It was so loud that I had to put fingers in my ears Out of the blue an African American guy John Legend gives Ryan a deal and music contract There was no development for that plot point Damien you need to really work hard on screen writing skills I wonder who gave you money to make this film for such a weak screenplay At one point the African American guy says to Ryan you are pain in the as Ryan honestly you are pain in the I so badly wanted to like this film and wanted some scene to touch me but when that moment came where Emma is called back for an audition I thought she will tell her own story which was so powerful she tells some aunt s story which made no sense to the story line What a disaster Emma says at the end It hurts a little bit You know what I am hurt I need Damien Chazelle and Ryan Gosling to send me apology letter for making such a bad film which I had to go and see I was in tears when I left the theater I am sure you will read this and you know where to write me My IMDb email address Best Regards Z,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3599643/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2017,Good actors in really trash booooring movie,I m completely baffled on all the hype around this the awards And it beats me why people write those 10 star reviews I love these actors music musicals old and new settings classics good jazz romance practically everything that was used to mix up this film Yet it fell short of being enjoyable by a mile Or ten The musical part has just one song really And while it returns 3 4 times can t carry a 2 hours sitting And there are good parts not even few but put together add up to maybe 15 minutes Definitely less than 20 2016 was a really bad year for cinema but even there 15 good content can not put you on the short list Or the long list Also it looks like shot directly for iPad watching Nothing in it requires to be in a movie theater And beyond a handful of minutes of piano and jazz parts even speakers are not to be missed So if you absolutely want to watch it I recommend do it at home equipped with food partner other distractions and a fast forward button But if you skip it altogether you hardly lose anything either Real shame wasting all that talent and more so fueling the hype and reinforcing the bad trend that keeps actually good pictures from being financed,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616961/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,Quick Review,It is true that Musicals are my sweet spot and La La Land is no exception It is indeed one of my absolute favorite Movies of all time The songs are memorable the two lead performances are just out of this world with Emma and Ryan having an amazing connection and chemistry and the overall camera work and direction being one of the true masterwork of the year La La Land is everything its name said and the exact opposite It is where you can find love and all your dreams becomes reality and it is also the sad finale a nightmare a bad moment in life If you haven t seen La La Land yet do yourself a favor and catch it with the first chance,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4576166/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2017,Somebody could explain why it won six Oscars?,Fortunately I have got this DVD as a gift from a family member and I didn t spent one cent for this boring musical I waited with my wife thirty minutes and still didn t happen something really interesting There is no substantial story or any suspense I am asking how if is possible that this one got six Oscars Thrown away instead of giving these to better films that have been done last year I cannot believe it but it confirms that I am right to not watch the Oscar shows It is not the first time that a boring movie got so many Oscars and I am not wondering I highly recommend it if you cannot sleep because I assure you that after some minutes you are falling asleep 3 10,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3723450/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2017,"Dated with a shallow, trite and tacky story line.",I have an eclectic taste in films so am not averse to a good musical especially with impressive dance routines West Side Story is one of my favourites with brilliant songs choreography and a powerful story Mama Mia was superbly acted and sung and loads of fun But Lala Land is so stale dated and tacky OK so there are some talented performers in it but the story line is shallow and trite and the music is so dated they deserved a much better script than this It might be considered to be a tribute to Old Style Hollywood by some but Singing in the Rain it ain t It s not even close to that standard I was bitterly disappointed and have no idea why it has won so many awards I truly regret the time and money I spent going to see it,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621059/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2017,A very wide gulf of opinion,Wow I have rarely seen such disparity in viewers opinion about a critically acclaimed movie I scrolled through the first 50 reviews on this site and noted the scores out of 10 given by reviewers Next to the score is the number of reviews from the 50 10 8 9 3 8 0 7 0 6 5 5 2 4 0 3 4 2 7 1 21 For the most part it seems that people either love La La Land or dislike it many intensely Note out of the first 50 reviews the film has been given a rating of 1 on 21 occasions This is not a bad movie by any means For the main part it is a very well made production editing lighting and direction are very good Emma Stone gives a great performance and Ryan Gosling if not equal to her in this department surely deserves huge accolades for his faultless mastery of a number of keyboard instruments The problem with this film is that as a musical it lacks zing in the dance routines and vocal renditions Both Emma and Ryan sing in tune which at least is passable but they are not vocal performers Emma s singing is so brittle understanding lyrics was difficult at times Neither lead actor thankfully was vocally challenged in any way at all The dance routines are really pale imitations of the greats of Hollywood s past Most obvious to me was the absence of any memorable tunes City of Stars is the best of a very bland selection although I must admit that if any song could possibly have success as an energetic well performed number it would have to be Start a Fire John Legend s rendition was the musical highlight of the entire film While I was not inclined like some other reviewers to walk out of the film it was most disappointing especially after have read rave reviews in the press Surely it could not win best film Oscar For fans of the two lead actors you will at least be rewarded Emma is terrific whilst a more subdued Ryan Gosling will really impress you with his musical talent,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3639061/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2016,My Most Memorable Cinematic Experience Since Star Wars - when I was six,The last time I felt like this in a cinema I was six years old and I was watching Star Wars I never imagined I would ever find that feeling again in a cinema That sense of being transported to another world The opening sequence took my breath away and I never got it back Not even at the end which left my head spinning It is a beautiful film with soul wit charm style and love It is simply outrageous Bold and fantastic and fantastical I am a straight man but my love for Ryan Gosling could change all that He s a melancholy genius and Emma Stone is our muse This film defies genre It is a masterpiece I urge you to see it I was lucky enough to see it at the BFI London Film Festvial It has been five days since I saw La La Land and I am still thinking about it and singing the haunting refrain that plays with your soul I mean it gets in there that music the music of the firmament Flying still dreaming still thank you Damien,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3559570/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,Not Bad but no Milestone,I like musicals but I must say I am a little disappointed by this one Sometimes it is easier to make your verdict if you compare two movies of the same genre to get your opinion straight Baz Luhrmans Moulin Rouge is imo in every aspect superior to La La Land the story more drama the music singing and dancing superior also the settings and visuals superior Imo first of all the story of La La Land is mediocre and so are the characters The story of La La Land is more of a soap opera than drama and so it lacks of depth and for a comedy well I miss the elements of comedy mostly I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone a lot as actors but compared to the performances and chemistry of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman they just look mediocre I mean Kidman dying in the arms of McGregor is more worth than all of La La Land Also if I compare La La Land with Sweeney Todd it loses the story the characters of the latter are just far more interesting I didn t liked the music of Sweeney Todd a lot but at least the story was interesting and captivating enough to hold my attention In La La Land I wasn t emotionally invested into the characters and in the music at all Ofc I am no lover of Jazz but I remember that the movie Whiplash about the drumming kid got me invested and I liked the passion and stuff conveyed by the maestro teaching his classes and the young talented guy I also liked the tunes Also another recent musical Les Mis rables with Jackman Crowe and Hathaway beats La La Land easy Okay I know Les Mis rables is a classic but the execution is just superb Imho La La Land plays in the league of Into The Woods Kendrick Streep Chris Pine latter got its problems with the story but imo the tunes and singing performances are still a notch better So all in all I would say for a musical the music the dancing the story is okayish the acting good but La La Land I would only recommend for lovers of the genre who must see them all If someone would ask me what musical he or she should watch for an introduction to the musical genre La La Land would not be on my list or well far from the top Tbh if this is Oscar material it just shows imo that the quality of recent Hollywood outputs don t belong to the best Ryan and Emma both already have done much better movies before,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621430/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2017,"A 100% Recommendation: Magical, Delightful, Sumptuous, Technically Flawless",On the surface La La Land doesn t seem too different to director Damien Chazelle s previous film Whiplash The two share a jazz and Charlie Parker obsessed male protagonist a love of music and even JK Simmons However this film is wholly different and represents staggering new ground covered by Chazelle and the team behind it as well as being a deliciously unique piece which seems a shoe in for being the best film of 2016 In fact La La Land is not only by far the best film I ve seen released in 2016 but also possibly 2015 Simply put everything about it works Firstly Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are perfectly cast in their roles with effortless natural likability and chemistry that most actors can only dream of Gosling provides charm a believable passion in jazz and incredible piano skills whilst Stone is as genuine as ever and acts as an audience surrogate that is easy to root for The music will not only make you tap your toes but also cause you to leave the cinema dancing with a wide grin on your face I was a moment away from standing up and giving a round of applause when it finished The songs beside being well sung and expertly choreographed are easy to re listen to and are very catchy On the aesthetic side the cinematography and the colour palette are beautiful Highly stylised and with an admirable range of techniques Some stand out sequences are the planetarium dance and heart string pulling epilogue Certainly the best thing about the entire film is its spirit and passion It s so incredibly enjoyable not a single moment is dull and though it takes place over a long period of time with a lot of events happening it is split into winter spring summer fall and winter again it is constantly fun Even in the most dramatic moments it is fantastic to watch simply for the pure talent on display and the realness of the drama despite the almost fantasy like quality of the film at times This review cannot go into enough detail about how delightful the film is it s also worth mentioning the fresh well written script also Chazelle s work that is often hilarious Honestly I can think of no negatives right now and it will just be interesting to see how it holds up a year down the line A must watch though inevitably those who are staunchly critical of musicals may be hesitant 98 100,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618833/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2017,Cannot understand what all the hype was about,I m a big fan of musicals on film and in the theater so I had high hopes for La La Land Combine its genre with the fact that it seemed like a love note to the great city of Los Angeles always a rich backdrop for a film and I was eager to see this movie I was sorely disappointed First the casting of Gosling and Stone is all wrong Neither can sing or at least certainly not well enough to make the many musical numbers enjoyable The dancing in the film is basic and didn t hold my attention including in the much lauded opening number So if neither Gosling nor Stone fit the bill based on their musical abilities maybe their on screen chemistry would explain their roles in this picture Not even close I couldn t believe for a second that these characters really loved one another There was no credible romance between them I d go so far as to call their relationship awkward Stone for her part delivers her lines very well and has much more range as an actor than Gosling who no matter how many movies I see him in always seems to be playing a caricature of himself But her talent isn t enough to save the film Then there is the plot There is very little of it The movie clocking in at just over 2 hours feels like 3 So little attention was paid to story and so much paid to fetishizing mid Century Hollywood filmmaking that I couldn t help by feel the film dragging and stumbling from one poorly written set piece to another without succeeding at captivating my interest at any point For example Gosling s character is set up as a down and out struggling musician without an ounce of opportunity or luck on his side What then explains his seemingly effortless rise in the film as he scores a gig playing with musicians he used to swoon for as a spectator or the way he suddenly hops into national stardom by partnering with John Legend s highly successful band There is nothing that really explains his character s quick transition from bitter failure to jazz superstar There is a charming final song and dance number in La La Land but it comes too late to save the movie Overall La La Land is a half baked pastiche of a movie with forgettable music lackluster dancing thin story and insincere character development SKIP IT,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615413/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2017,Bla Bla Bland,Given my love of both movies and musicals I had such high hopes for La La Land But alas it was not to be The good news is that the cast and production values are excellent Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are as likable as can be and the staging of the production numbers is amazing Ah but there s bad news There s just no chemistry between Gosling and Stone and since their relationship drives the movie this is a serious problem Another problem is that neither of them are very good singers And then there s the musical numbers which just feel amateurish My mom can make the costumes we ll use your dad s garage and we ll write the musical numbers Last but not least at 2 18 it goes on forever There s no good reason to see this movie at all If you re curious wait for the DVD streaming and then watch it with the sound off as you read a good book,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3707863/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2017,The best 21st Century Film Musical.,I always think Boxing Day is the start of the movie Year the new releases come out and then the Award movies leading up to the Academy Awards Well today was New Years Eve I loved La La Land not everyone will my movie partner hated it but to me it s much more than a nostalgic tribute to old Hollywood musicals that it is but it s also touching quirky off beat like the jazz score at times and very contemporary No spoilers here except to say it s a bitter sweet love story judge it for yourself A friend who is not into musicals particularly told me last week that he thought this movie could herald a new wave in musical cinema the way Star Wars heralded a new genre in Sci Fi escape movies I m not sure but I hope so the world needs to lighten up in these troubling times It would be difficult to find a more charismatic couple than Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone their on screen chemistry at times is mesmerising Think Vincent Minnelli American in Paris Umbrellas of Cherbourg and the great musical duos of Leslie Caron and Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire and Ginger I m talking about chemistry not singing and dancing ability even though Gosling and Stone are very talented Summing up a joy to watch unpredictable and very entertaining Academy Award worthy and I also liked the music,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3663158/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2017,Every other movie ever made deserved the Oscar more,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3643423/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,Wildly Overrated!!!,Insipid uninspiring and totally contrived LaLa tries to be a love letter to LA but instead became rather dreary and predictable and LA wasn t particularly shown to best advantage either It was Moulin Rouge without the excitement pizazz or pacing and that s not a particularly high bar After the opening scene which has been done elsewhere it devolved into more clich with mediocre dancing and singing The saddest part for me is that I love romantic movies and I found no genuine chemistry between the main characters Every note rang false except for the energetic musical performances which contrasted sharply with the low energy elsewhere,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619278/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2018,Nowhere close to a waste of a Lovely Night,From the very first scene La La Land captures your interest in a vice and never lets go It was so magical visually stunning and the songs will stay with you long after you leave the theatre And despite La La Land being a musical when people weren t singing and dancing it still had the feeling of a regular movie which made the story itself captivating I don t think Emma Stone has ever given a better performance than this She was good in Birdman sure but she soared in La La Land One scene in particular that sticks out to me is The Audition during which she was able to sing a beautiful solo while the camera circled around her all in one take On the contrary my only criticism is that Ryan Gosling wasn t doing much acting while he was singing and dancing He is a very gifted singer and a lovely dancer but his face remained a little deadpan during musical numbers But the whole movie is damn near perfect It was interesting story wise the music was fantastic it made me happy sad and made me dance in my seat But what really makes this movie to me is the ending sequence That was what made La La Land perfect It tied everything together so beautifully but also left some room for the viewer to do their own thinking and it even made me who has cried during only one other movie ever shed a tear La La Land is surely going to make cinematic history It s new and exciting and it s an experience you surely won t want to miss it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4150629/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2017,Finally ending 2016 on the right note...,Yes La La Land is a perfect movie and it s destined to be a classic in my opinion I went to see it last night and I had to go back today because I kept thinking about it and humming the songs This is a perfectly crafted film I have only have positive things to say about La La Land the movie I needed all year long Just by watching the trailers I could smell something special with the amazing cinematography and the beautiful music No need to say the movie exceeded my expectations The casting of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is simply genius I heard rumours that they initially had Miles Teller in mind for this movie but it wouldn t have been the same without Gosling Stone This is the third movie with them together as the leads with the underrated Crazy Stupid Love and the disappointing Gangster Squad You can tell they were made for this musical even though Ryan Gosling is not a natural born singer the performance and the dance numbers wouldn t have been the same without their chemistry Pretty sure Emma Stone is a lock for Best Actress Obviously the production design and the visuals are breathtaking this is a movie I m going to watch over and over again for the musical numbers Most of the times it feels like you are watching a dream and I think this is exactly what Chazelle was aiming for he succeeded at every level The synergy between the music the colours the camera work the editing the costumes and of course Gosling Stone made this experience incredibly unique There is also a lot of layers to La La Land the story was essential to bring those numbers alive Without spoiling anything the ending was beautiful I was not a fan of Les Mis rables and Chicago but Singin in the Rain and The Sound of Music are the best musicals ever made La La Land deserves a place among them of course we will give the movie some time to breathe but to me this already is a classic There s so many things I have to say but I will let the smarter people talk about it It s funny engaging beautiful don t miss it 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614080/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2019,A must-see film for anyone who aspires to something greater in their life.,In a world where people worship everything and value nothing I have found that I value the many messages present within La La Land 2016 While simultaneously shining a harsh light on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and showing how our dreams and passions move us to make tough life decisions I found myself deeply moved by the narrative presented within this film not only as a lover of movies but as a creative artist myself This film is for the dreamers It s for the people who never give up in pursuing what they want out of life It s for those who have a talent screaming to be noticed by others Aside from literally being the best musical I ve seen in nearly more than a decade Chicago 2002 is the only recent one that comes to mind what I found most impressive about this film is that it is only the second directed by Damien Chazelle For those who may have missed it his previous work Whiplash 2014 was an extreme look at the commitment a musician will take just to be a part of something bigger With this in mind we find that Chazelle has a passion for music that is easily grasped through his use of expert cinematography Much like The Young Girls of Rochefort 1967 La La Land makes me feel like the world would be a much better place if people sang and danced at the drop of a hat or stop of a car But even with the almost cliche romantic comedy beginning where La La Land differs from these films is the depth that it explores the relationships between two dreamers While we always want our life partners to succeed in their dreams it can be difficult to find a balance between somewhat contrasting goals A must see film for anyone who aspires to something greater in their life I give La La Land 5 0 stars out of 5,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4705861/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2017,I Actually Watch Old Movies ALL THE TIME,I heard that this movie reminded people of old movies which led to a slew of good reviews I LOVE Emma Stone and I LOVE Ryan Gosling I thought that they were wonderful together in Crazy Stupid Love And I admit to liking a lot of weird and strange movies Right now my favorite movie is Mr Right with Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell See it So fun I watch old movies all the time This did not remind me of an old movie It had a lot of singing in it By non singers I tried to watch this I did I couldn t get past the first twenty minutes I was BORED Then in hopes that it might generate some interest for me I watched the last 45 minutes Still MEH I don t care about these characters and I found that the songs distanced me from them They didn t seem real but rather were like caricatures of real people The last five minutes was really pretty to watch But still did not care So if you re wondering what all the hype was about and can t figure it out you re not alone,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3811388/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2017,most overrated film of the year,the camera work in some scenes is quite nice but the rest is just la la gosling and stone don t react to each other there is no chemistry the characters they portrait are only looking for their own careers stone doesn t play a talented actress nor does goslings character have a real feel for good jazz the script is bland there is no drama no fervor the main title song is good but the rest of the songs don t resonate also there are too few dancing scenes to call this a real musical stone is acting weak she shows more or less only one face expression this is not worth an Oscar portman was much better as jackie Im a fan of Ryan Gosling but he shouldn t have made this movie it will not help his image and his career the nomination for best actor was a joke he can do much better eg in the road beyond the pines,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655846/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,A perfect movie; even for whom dislike musical movies!!,Comparing any previous musical movie La La Land presents a major rate of non musical scenes which are really charming So it can be conveniently mentioned that this movie is an awesome mix of romantic drama and musical The movie comprises of a flowing story with many sub texts and suggestions and its sufficiency can t be explained only with or degraded to succesful careoghraphic music scenes or dancing and singing performances on the contrary to common musical movies which owe their success to those mentioned materials Absoutely also by these contexts the movie has an elegant and magnificent content there are masterful music dance long take scenes which may be rarely witnessed on the silver screen especially the opening scene Unless you really HATE any musical scene yes you absolutely will find something to please in the movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5060330/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2018,A Modern Day Musical,There are many musicals that fall into my Favorites category and this is definitely one of them For a Director to take two actors that have no singing or dancing experience however a dynamic chemistry with each other made it work The opening scene immediately draws the audience in with a snappy amazing musical number on an LA freeway This number was worth the Theater tickets As the storyline develops in the lives of these two people both struggling artists in different industries we are pulling for them both to find success and an enduring relationship If you haven t seen this yet what are you waiting for go and enjoy you will laugh and cry which definitely makes up a good movie Right We ve seen it at least five times and will probably again we grew up on Musicals,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4098692/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2020,Very delicate aesthetics,The direction was great and very clever in some scenes The plot of the film quaintly managed to be realistic in a fairytale atmosphere This movie made you feel pessimistic and optimistic simultaneously The performances of the actors were at least admirable Both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone seemed very talented something that made me feel pleasantly surprised about Gosling Though the bigger applause goes to the music of this film Robert Bresson wrote I would rather people feel a film before understanding it This film represents that you may dont understand it at first but you damn sure feel it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5496065/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2017,I Ran,Whether the wrong prize scandal in Oscar is a message to Trump by deep state or just plain dumbness this movie does not deserve any Oscars Far from it I cannot believe marketing is so powerful in today s movie industry It just turns a bad movie without any script any character development or quality even musical quality into a Oscar winning hype I watched this movie with my girlfriend and we counted the minutes waiting for a quick end to this torture At one point we wondered if there is love in this movie what is it that we feel for each other or if we are in love than what the heck are they telling in this movie If I say that the only good piece of music in the movie is I Ran A Flock of Seagulls you can guess the rest,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3666500/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2017,The Artists,Damien Chazelle whose father is French has made a Gallic tinged song and dance musical set in Los Angeles In some ways it is a modern variant of Singin in the Rain but without the overt optimism which modern life does not have The film has wowed the critics at the awards season but I think like the film The Artist it might not stand up to scrutiny a few years later This is a bittersweet love story between Sebastian Ryan Gosling a jazz pianist passionate about the golden age of jazz and wanting to open his own club to play the type of jazz he wants before it really does go to obscurity He keeps on bumping into Mia Emma Stone an aspiring actress who works in a coffee shop on the Warner Bros studio lot and goes to endless auditions looking for that big break but only to find disinterested casting agents Both of them are looking for that big break but find each other slowly at first but love may not be enough when these people also crave success Sebastian finds it first recording and touring with a successful group which puts their relationship under a strain Director Damien Chazelle dazzles with a big opening musical number in a traffic jam on the highway but the energy of that number cannot be sustained Like many modern musicals these days the songs are anaemic and unmemorable not helped with some of the jazz numbers The film is right much of the audience will be put off by the jazz music The dance numbers between the pair is meant to be easy going than emulate Fred n Ginger and in some ways it works Chazelle as in in his previous film Whiplash has found a rhythm to his film It has a sentiment that individual pursuit for your dreams may be the price worth paying for true love The story although at times tender as well as abrasive is not strong enough and the film really did feel stretched,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619607/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2018,A Classic Romantic Hollywood Mastepiece,La La Land stands as a cinematic spectacle From the opening scene you can understand that this movie is not messing around this scene delivers amazing feelings and prepares you for an emotional roller coaster throughout the film It is a pure Hollywood love story that has been portrayed by two amazingly talented actors The movie circles around two options Either choose love or choose dreams At the end of the film you will surely understand what the two protagonists choose and why they chose it again shown in a beautiful way It takes influence from movies like Singing in the Rain and demonstrates some iconic scenes in a new modern way that makes you feel nostalgic about the classic one It is so perfectly crafted but what makes this movie unique from any other romantic movies is its ending That ending Not only does it deliver some extremely emotional scenes but it changes the whole idea you had for the film Also in a musical the music needs to be stunning for it to be successful For the first time in a movie I have cried so loudly when hearing a song This soundtrack gives you the feels It is a masterpiece from song one until the very last song The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be an unashamedly romantic musical infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling Stone wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle Oh and it s hilarious throughout too A genuine achievement must be one of the best films I ve seen in a long while Cheers to the dreamers the men and women behind the making of this musical classic masterpiece,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4142080/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2017,A sad echo of a great genre,I see the universal adulation this film has had and there s much to admire To my ears though it s sadly lacking in the one key element every musical needs great songs With the possible exception of Audition The Fools Who Dream there s not a memorable tune or soaring line to be found It doesn t help that neither of the two leads has a strong singing voice and as for dancing the steps are limited and even within that scope not particularly well executed Dancing in a musical has to be over the top good to carry the energy of the film But the worst thing really is the lack of structure Musicals are selective in the parts of the story that they take to build the three act structure the characters have to be established before we can care about them have to face an obstacle so that we care more and have to overcome it or die trying at which point the big numbers come out Here we start with a big number the dance on the LA freeway but there s no reason for dancing as of yet The love not at first sight motif is a good old one but here it s so choppily presented that we re not sure whether we should care or not It could be a slow motion screwball comedy or a musical revue punctuated by little life dramas but to be a musical it must soar This one is leaden forced and was painful for me to watch despite much admirable production work and cinematography After I got home I watched Singin in the Rain as an antidote and felt much better It s not impossible to revive the moribund musical genre it was done in 1981 with Pennies from Heaven and several times over by Baz Luhrmann who even managed to make some of his non professional singing stars sound pretty darn good see Moulin Rouge But despite all the hype this film to me felt like seeing an old friend imperfectly resurrected from the grave with none of the old lively exuberance for which once upon a time he was known the world over,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3613307/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2016,"Don't believe the hype too much. Cliché and overrated/bland story. Some nice songs. ""The Artist 2016"" 500 Days of Summer is way better!!!!!",I just watched this a second time Someone in the Crowd very catchy and upbeat and City of Stars emotional are clearly the highlight songs of this film I love those songs It made me cry the second time watching it especially when Ryan starts playing City of Stars for Emma That part is very touching Sorry there is no way this movie is a 9 10 currently it will definitely go down once the hype dies down I was excited to see this but I think it is being over hyped too much I think it s better if you go in with low expectations I understand this movie is refreshing than the typical usual marvel comic super hero movies or animated movies always coming out in theaters but it s being too over hyped as if it s the best movie musical ever Is everyone not really focusing on the story and just rating on the visual It s like people criticize Michael Bay films right away because most of his action movies have a clich generic plot even though visually he knows how to show action well people seem to forgive the generic storyline of LA LA Land because of the visuals This is no 500 Days of Summer that was released in 2009 now that s a feel good movie from start to finish that breaks some clich which is easily a way better film than this and has a better message I can t help it but compare this movie to 500 Days because the whole different SEASONS things it takes place in LA some musical scenes about pursuing dreams romance what if it happened this way instead and that BUT 500 Days of Summer is just a way better solid movie LA LA Land underneath the surface take away all the dancing and nice costumes just actually feels less magical than 500 Days This movie also reminds me of The Artist which I m sure most people have forgotten by now was a major overrated over hyped Oscar win where it was clearly praised on the visual technical level homage because there really wasn t an interesting plot and the story was just bland and generic Honestly who really cares about Oscar wins anymore the people voting choices are always predictable Will Smith did not force me to write this like another dreadful boring overrated movie Spotlight won just because it was controversial subject This is a musical so they will randomly start singing like in Disney movies But the musical parts weren t as memorable catchy or exciting as I imagined or was hoping for from all the hype It doesn t sound like real music but just actors just trying to sing lines in a musical way I don t think it s on the same level as Moulin Rouge It actually came off more comical whenever Ryan Gosling just randomly starts singing Joseph Gordon Levitt can sing but I don t think Ryan Gosling has that singing level Even though 500 Days of Summer isn t a musical I enjoyed that film s musical parts and is way more memorable and feel good Griffith Observatory was underwhelming Also it s such a waste to see these nice large production sets extras yet the camera just pans fast across becoming just a complete motion blur Again 500 Days of Summer made LA look beautiful than it really is and felt more memorable They made that Angels Knoll park iconic I just don t remember any memorable moments except the opening freeway which is impressive on a production level but it wasn t as legendary classic level or worth the hype as it just felt out of place just randomly happening in the beginning of the film Clearly they just wanted to open the film with some sort of big bang but it s the same as throwing in a Michael Bay action sequence when there s no substance to the story I was more thinking during that scene why are we watching these people dance suddenly I don t feel the romance between Ryan and Emma at all their chemistry is more like siblings The director relied too much on Ryan Emma s chemistry reputation from their previous films together They re both very talented but I didn t feel the romance at all The part where they say I love you to each other was cringe worthy hard to believe In fact for them to get together is extremely forced and clich in this film I get the clich formula already where they act like they hate each other in the beginning but suddenly fall in love but this one is so rushed for them to get together It seems like the story was a second afterthought and the dancing sets were more of the priority There s a very ironic line in the film where John Legend says about being stuck in the old jazz from the past being a traditionalist won t bring the wave for the future yet this film still tries to be in the old days of Hollywood The film was shot in cinemascope I thought the projection at the theater I saw this at was really bad the colors were so dull faded but apparently this was how it was shot Just out of nowhere sell out John Legend comes to the rescue And out of nowhere out of all things on Emma s last audition where we expect to hear her maybe share about her whole magical experience with Ryan which may be cheesy instead she brings up about her aunt which is even cheesier Like where did that come from In harsh reality dreams may come true The irony in dreams dreams may not always come true,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3600467/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2017,Sweet and Fun with a Powerful Fantasy Sequence,La La Land is a fun sweet movie about two young artists their attempt to establish their careers and their love affair It s enjoyable but not the masterpiece reviews insist it is Mia Emma Stone is a barrista and an aspiring actress Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist They meet during a traffic jam get together at a party and go through the ups and downs of young people who are in love and who are also chasing artistic success La La Land is a musical People sing and dance That s fun Neither Stone nor Gosling is a professional singer or dancer so the singing and dancing are mediocre Mia and Sebastian go for a walk at night Their walk is cinematically reminiscent of a walk that Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse take in the 1953 movie musical Band Wagon to the tune of Dancing in the Dark Just like Fred and Cyd Mia and Seb begin their nighttime walk as bickering enemies but during the dance they warm up to each other They dance under trees and streetlights The difference is that Gosling and Stone can t begin to match the magic that professional dancers like Astaire and Charisse conjure in their dance number Gosling s voice is barely there In another scene Stone sings what might have been a show stopping number a song about her free spirited aunt who lived in Paris and went swimming in the River Seine During this song Stone wears a non descript baggy sweater and she barely moves Stone is very compelling as an actress As a singer especially during this number she falls flat Damien Chazelle s direction doesn t highlight the dance numbers as it might The opening scene depicts an LA traffic jam Passengers emerge from their cars and dance on the highway They sing a lyric dense song you can t hear them over the music in order to make out the words It s frustrating Their movements are not flattered by Chazelle s camera Even so I very much enjoyed La La Land Its strengths would have been evident whether anyone had been singing or not La La Land brings home how hard it is for struggling artists to nurture healthy relationships Mia and Sebastian live in poverty At one point he looks at a water stain on the ceiling and despairs They are crushed when their best efforts meet with failure They are tempted to sell out Their careers demand that they not be present for each other for months at a time Mia and Sebastian let each other down La La Land drags after a bit Stone and Gosling are virtually the only characters in the film Their key interactions are repeated La La Land redeemed itself for me in a final fantasy sequence that was incredibly poignant and true and that was unlike anything else I d ever seen in any other film I d recommend seeing La La Land for that sequence alone,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615313/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2019,I was blown away by this film,La La Land written and directed by Damien Chazelle was released exactly one year ago today in Australia To say the least I was blown away by this film The cinematography is exciting The editing is timed perfectly The production design is simple vibrant and beautiful This movie is put together like a masterpiece The performances are so real and grounded Particularly Emma Stone who never for a moment makes it known that she is an actor playing a character The depth of her emotion forms such a realistic and complex human being The music written by Justin Hurwitz is simply perfection This is one of my favourite movie scores of all time His music creates such complex emotions with his mixture of happiness and melancholy This is easily my favourite musical ever made This is because the characters and drama are not neglected at the expense of the musical numbers They a both intertwined beautifully Each element is placed together with so much thought that it successfully transports the audience into such a deep emotional experience This film contains so much talent and creativity that it would be impossible not to give it a 10 I know a fair few people who really dislike La La Land This movie is not for your average audience It s really for those who love and appreciate the craft of film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4757607/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2017,What a let down!!!!,I am usually mistrustful of over hyped movies but on this occasion I was in the mood for a feel good musical with an upbeat message not something I am usually drawn to The Sunday Times reviewer said that Hating La La Land is like hating a puppy and gave it 4 stars Well I like puppies very much but this movie was a massive disappointment Bad singing bad dancing and a mediocre script made this movie in my opinion one of the worst movies of the last 12 months How this can be considered as Oscar material is beyond me but then clearly I am in a minority although judging by many of the reviews on here not that small a minority The second half in my opinion was better than the first half And yes I did get most of the symbolism and the attempts at pastiche and various homages to the past This definitely won t be on my best of list,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620971/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2016,All the hype had me fooled,My summary basically says it all I had so been looking forward to seeing this movie particularly as l love musicals but am sad to say that I was hugely disappointed It started brightly enough with the traffic jam dance scene but from there on in it was all downhill for me I felt the whole film was terribly disjointed and it felt like they were trying too hard to recreate the magical musicals of years gone by The singing was poor and the dancing if you could call it that equally uninspiring Some reviewers have even gushed about this being one of the greatest musicals of all time What Have they never seen West Side Story Grease or any of the old Hollywood greats Obviously no otherwise they would never have made such a stupid statement For me this was 2 hours of ZZzzzzz,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3609133/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2023,All style and no substance,This movie is very polished very lush very bright and colourful The vibe is a very flawless aka unrealistic and stereotypical LA with an old school undertone I will excuse this completely unrealistic version of LA since I gather they purposely made it this way to suit the old school undertone and I can appreciate the creativity It s also campy but I don t mind a bit of that sometimes especially if it s backed up by strong dialogue Unfortunately this film does not hit the mark in that regard I finally had a chance to see this movie today and I had very high hopes given all the awards and rave reviews Ha Talk about a let down Sure it s cute but the storyline is meh and the dialogue isn t good enough to save it It just lacks I tuned out a bit about halfway through but I stuck it out until the end As others have mentioned the ending is depressing I guess I could see how someone would like this movie since it is very stylish but I prefer my movies with better writing There s more interesting dialogue in superhero movies for heaven s sake and I hate superhero movies again all style and no substance I am truly amazed by the high rating What kept going around in my head while watching this movie is how much better musicals were back in their hey day and how they were so good and wonderful and how much this one sucked They just don t make em like they used to,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9049967/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2018,Pleasant enough but ultimately superficial and a little smug,Blockbuster season and awards season two periods of the year where it is easy to get caught up in the hype but not always easy to find really good films In the awards time of year it is particularly hard since everyone is talking up films as much as possible and lots of proper films come out around then in order to qualify Last year was no different and La La Land was one of the films that we were all told was a big contender and would surely merit its place surrounded by the great films that had gone before it Years of disappointment has told me not to get caught up in the hype but just catch things later when they are cheaper and have lost their promotion With La La Land that time was now but the distance has actually only hurt it More on that in a minute Generally speaking La La Land is perfectly fine It is a pleasant film that has charm and good grace mostly It wallows in an image of Hollywood that doesn t exist and fills its delivery with nostalgia and simplification it is easy to see why it was so popular with those successfully in the industry and those all hoping that their big break is just around the corner As a story there is not much too it The delivery isn t as charming as it needed to be the musical numbers after that first great one are mostly only okay they try hard but they are only okay The characters are thin although they benefit from good performances mostly from Stone who I really enjoyed It is nothing special but it works in a sort of cheerful fantasy way One year on though and the MeToo movement and associated revelations cast a different light on a young woman in Hollywood trying to get ahead La La Land was a bit smug and fantastical before this but after it has an air of denial to it too unintended of course and not the film s fault but it is there nonetheless and the cheerful have a dream and get your break theme stands out badly Like I say though not the film s fault but even without that problem the film is at best just pleasant to watch but not more,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4191581/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2016,The best of both old and new Hollywood. Astonishing!,This is one of the best movies I have seen in my 62 years How often do you hear a theater audience burst into applause in the first 5 minutes From the spectacular opening of the film you realize that you aren t in Kansas anymore Anything can and does happen in La La Land The story involves a young aspiring actress Emma Stone who meets a jazz pianist Ryan Gosling who is determined to open a jazz club It should be noted that Gosling actually did his own piano playing in the film But it is Emma Stone who steals the show here with fabulous singing dancing and acting Emma just graduated to the Great Actresses Club with this performance The relationship between the actress and pianist has its ups and downs as they seek their dreams There are moments so beautiful that I wept for joy I may have to watch this movie many times It is pure bliss This movie is hard to describe because it has charming old fashioned elements yet it is at the same time super modern But above all it has a mountain of talent a great deal of intelligence and a beautiful heart You will love it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601657/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2017,"OK, I hate all musicals,,, except this one, dammit!",Never been moved much by musicals though I ve always admired those of Fred Astaire But this movie is not some glitzy re humanization of being rich during The Depression It s actually almost the opposite a musical centered on the little people striving to succeed while enduring the ups and downs of relationships and two branches of the entertainment business one an actress the other a jazz pianist Thing is the two leads here Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are not easy to picture in a romantic musical But without a doubt they re an inspired choice who will make you wonder just how much talent is there in Hollywood It s mind boggling to contemplate What s more these two fine actors are so evenly matched here that it s impossible to tell which came first the pairing or the script Clearly they had an uncanny grasp of the form though it s been years since there s been such a successful one This movie so deftly navigates all sorts of truth about so many elusive things that it s not worth picking a few Just go see it even if you don t like musicals It will win you over,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615761/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2017,The stuff that dreams are made of...,La La Land is the kind of movie that you can t help but fall in love with for the sheer energy that oozes out of every frame every note and every second its on the screen It really puts you into an inexplicable kind of trance you become completely lost in its lust and aesthetic beauty Director Damien Chazelle already the youngest winner of the Best Director Award in the history of the Golden Globes may very well accomplish the same feat tomorrow at the Oscars The premise of the film is simple A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles We ve heard it before but what La La Land actually creates with a rather hackneyed plot line is anything but unoriginal In fact Chazelle deserves a ton of credit for creating a completely original musical one that bursts with toe tappingly poetic songs and melodies that will be entrenched in people s mind for a long time He even pays homage to the more classic films of the Hollywood Golden Age by showing us alternate endings many films of that era were known to film two endings but how Chazelle masterfuly juxtaposes the fiction to reality merits an Oscar alone Aside from the incredible acting cinematography and writing one thing I must comment on about La La Land is the beautiful jazz score This soundtrack is near close to perfect especially for those that adore jazz It perfectly encapsulates all those idealist thoughts people have when daydreaming about cities like LA or NYC Have you ever listened to jazz music and to quote fellow IMDb user ElMaruecan82 just felt nostalgic over a time you weren t even born in Like La La Land Jazz has all the elements that pulls you in as a viewer it has melody it has harmony it has rhythm but most of all it has soul And boy does this film have soul It s energy is relentless and simply undeniable Coupled with the beautiful musical score and exceptionally well written songs City of Stars in particular is enchanting is first rate acting by Gosling and Stone Gosling can really do so many roles but where I find him most effective is in his minimalism he s really one of few actors who can show so much with so little His subtlety and nuances create such depth and mystery in a character like Sebastien you could find yourself spending hours pondering over what he is merely thinking Stone was great as well seemingly effortless in her ability to project a charm and likability Together their chemistry was electric they really just looked like they were having a great time out there for anyone who says they couldn t dance sing well Honestly I could go on for days about the magic of this film and this likely won t be the final copy of this review for reasons of continuing to think over and re phrase my thoughts of the film I get what people are saying about how the film finds a way to stick in your head Case in point La La Land is the stuff that dreams are made of And whether you re part of the group that despises the film or not one can t deny the elegance style and melodic magic the film possesses and the ability it has to totally immerse you in all its jazzy glory and isn t that by some measure what any film really aspires to do,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3648316/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2017,La-La Land,La La Land is a very important film It received so many Oscars but we have seen weak films awarded before that It is important as a proclamation of incompetence This film invaded the musical genre which traditionally belonged to artists who can sing and dance The film is about a young woman who wants to become an actor and a young musician Ryan Gosling who plays main protagonist is a good actor but this role is not for him he is extremely clumsy and when he dances around a streetlight it resembles a parody on Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain His voice reminds one of a whining mosquito Concerning Emma Stone she also cannot sing or dance At least she is not as clumsy as Ryan The film s choreography was made with the imagination of a kindergarten teacher The plot is a collection of trivialities and the camera work is made by a person who does not known anything about composition except for the central position in the frame which makes this banal film even more boring and trivial than it could be Only positive aspect is the light feeling of nostalgia is left by the film Read more at http indie cinema com 2017 02 la la land review,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3658520/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2017,Lack-Luster Land,It s hard to understand how this lifeless musical has done so well at the box office and swept up so many awards and nominations The film goes downhill fast after an impressive opening song and dance routine on a gridlocked Interstate overpass As soon as the traffic starts rolling again this love story between a jazz pianist and wannabe actress gets underway with a prescient gesture Thanks to interruptions for some undistinguished musical numbers it takes them almost an hour and several coincidental meetings before they re sufficiently motivated to kick start their tepid romance Unfortunately there doesn t seem to be much glue holding them together and they soon have an unconvincing argument about chasing their respective dreams This leads to a brief break up followed by a half hearted reconciliation Later it s revealed they parted presumably because they weren t all that into each other in the first place but the script doesn t bother to show how this separation occurred As the narrative approaches its conclusion LA s infamous traffic congestion facilitates yet another meeting and a final chance to ignite some drama The biggest mystery is why so many critics and viewers admire this drab love affair between two people who seem unable to communicate either affection or passion,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633966/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2016,Not even good as a musical,I went to see the movie because it was 8 7 in IMDb and somebody said its the best movie he has seen since Star Wars when he was 6 Well we were 2 couples and we left after 30 minutes Its an awful movie If you are not into musicals and if you liked Whiplash do yourself a favor Take a good book and stay home Its boring the plot is dull it is slow and the opposite of inspiring or interesting The beginning of the movie has a scene as if inspired by West Side Story But this is not LEonard Bernstein and the music does not meet the level Yet I thought its a Good start At some point it becomes more interesting and something is happening but then it is cut and slowed down by a romantic song in the middle of some action and the movie falls down again This movie does not deserve to be in the top 100 of IMDb Help me to take it down You will thank me for the warning,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3595889/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2017,Pleasant but ultimately forgettable,I m not really sure why La La Land got both critical acclaim as well as a pretty good turnout at the box office Maybe it s because Hollywood musicals are a rare thing these days so it seemed fresh and original to people It s not really a bad movie I admit The photography is first rate the lead actors are likable and some of the direction of the musical numbers is eye catching However the songs in these musical numbers while easy on the ears sound pretty much alike for the most part And they are not really memorable you ll forget the songs a few hours after watching the movie Another problem is that the movie moves at a really slow pace While at first the leisurely pace is refreshing in this era of in your face and strident movies eventually you ll be asking the movie to simply get on with it The movie is best reserved for a time when you want some pleasant background noise and images while doing a task that involves your main focus Don t worry about missing any plot points you ll be able to fill in the blanks easily and correctly,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3728326/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2017,Best Movie Musical of This Century,This is the one we have waited for a thoroughly contemporary film musical that balances romance and realism in surprising ways Director Damien Chazelle pays homage to classic musicals with allusions to among others Vincent Minnelli s An American in Paris and Jacques Demy s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort The selection of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone to play the romantic leads is brilliant their aspirations propel the plot and their very ordinariness makes us believe again that dreams and memories can sustain us through the inevitable separations that life brings Wisely every time Gosling and Stone break into song it ends too soon too soon to bore us soon enough to leave us wanting more Pieces of jazz rock and classical music are woven through the film but the thread that holds it together is the Justin Hurwitz score which includes the enchanting songs Another Day of Sun A Lovely Night and City of Stars as well as popular singer John Legend singing his own composition Start a Fire Los Angeles has never looked so good even during a traffic jam and who knew how much we missed the xylophone,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628190/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2016,A wonderful film that begs to be watched.,An observatory a boulevard a bridge a downtown trolley all make up filming locations of the new film La La Land These locations are iconic yet remain unnamed throughout the film The sum of these locations create the city of Los Angeles Any meaningful production is a sum of its cast members and in the case of La La Land there is no difference Sebastian Ryan Gosling and Mia Emma Stone come together to create a wonderful production but a lesser known yet ever present cast member is the city itself Throughout the epic musical sequences the city in its whole is either visible or represented by its historic street lights Some might argue that the city is a backdrop to the songs and dancing of Sebastian and Mia but the city itself takes center stage with the vibrancy of a leading man It lends its beauty to be danced upon by Sebastian and Mia without relinquishing its hold as being the center of attention Mia being a minor actress in Hollywood goes to casting calls where those auditioning look the same This image of Hollywood conformity lends itself to the character of Sebastian who has to change his performance identity much in the same way Mia has done in order to fit in and make a living in the beast that is Hollywood With this being said the performances of Mia and Sebastian are one of a kind lending itself to a sort of fantasy adaptation of falling in love The imagery of the film stops at nothing to convey the idea of love and the concept of a soulmate while the business aspects of Hollywood coupled with the necessity of survival keeps the two characters at odds The film represents a city a city that often times is at odds with itself a city that identifies talent based on familiarity rather than the unique and often overlooked aspects that create it Ultimately La La Land is a story about conforming and not conforming and the gains that can be had in between LA is marketed as the land of dreams yet is often overlooked and stacked on a pile of dreams that will never come to fruition The film explores the idea of what if and tackles the idea of a working Hollywood versus a Hollywood where the idea of art is paramount La La Land focuses on the idea of money versus art and shows that nobel aspects of creativity are often ignored to focus on the monetary aspects of the industry while leaving behind the very art that drove them in the first place The movie is very much paced in the realm of Hollywood where the cadence of the film is action packed with all the fervor of a young person entering Hollywood for the first time yet as Mia and Sebastian learn the inter workings of Hollywood the film slows down to reflect the realities that are faced when having to juggle income and art La La Land reignites a fire that has been lost from a Hollywood that is so focused on relaunches and reboots It s refreshing to see a totally unique film especially one that grasps the nature of Hollywood and Los Angeles in such an unconventional way The singing the dancing and cinematography move in perfect concert to give the appearance of something larger than life The long musical sequences often border on the surreal taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers in the clouds and in the stars Yet at times the pacing of the film seems to trail off to a point of being boring this is quickly remedied but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing Watching La La Land is like being awake during a wondrous dream there is something unique and magical about the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian as well as the visuals of Los Angeles that surround them As he sits at his piano Sebastian sweetly and softly sings Mia a love song a powerful couple of lines that represent love art and life City of Stars are you shining just for me City of Stars there so much that I can see Who knows is this the start of something wonderful and new Or one more dream that I cannot make true With La La Land a dream has come true and made its way onto the big screen,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3544736/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2017,Nice try.....but a miss,I appreciate the effort to put on a big musical but other than the main theme the music wasn t that memorable and the dancing mediocre I like both stars but think it was a reach for both of them to sing and dance Again appreciate the effort The songs didn t really tell or move the story along aka Grease and I found myself dozing during them I would have given the movie a 2 but the last 5 minutes at least delivered a satisfying ending and big plus Watch this one at home where you can fast forward through the dance numbers after you have had enough of them,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633429/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2017,What the La La?,I ve joined the hype train and I got really burned This film was mostly bad How in the world it won so many awards First of all E S and R G can t sing to save their lives E S got only one song which she really sang using her chest voice and I don t really think it was her voice because of the discrepancy of what she sang previously up to that point This film has no plot It s like a musical version of Fifty Shades of Grey without the action distilled for kids reaching really cringe worthy moments The love story is a Hollywood clich sterile and devoid of any real meaning or connection to reality I m really confused about the music since this is what I ve been doing for the past twenty years to make a living Most of the songs are somewhat immature in the composition manner while their arrangements are quite beautiful They are not close to how a true pedigree musical should sound like They feel like the cheap version for a true musical especially considering that the film goes to great lengths to substitute the ineptitude of the lead actors singers with many many instrumental parts that most of the time feel inadequate even though the orchestration and the mixing in theory is flawless The whole movie revolves around just one melodic motif which gets overused really fast Most of the arrangements are well executed yet simplistic in manner with mostly appearance over essence It s like reading a children s book For me that illustrates overreaching without the necessary experience or profoundness to fully grasp the important concepts one is trying to say The elements that constitute the movie just don t synergize good enough with each other to make it work However there are several jazz arrangements that stand out of the crowd and there s even a pop song which is pretty dope I think it was the high point of the movie The film digs deep into its technicality to recreate the look and feel of the golden age of American cinematography It uses almost all the tricks in the book they dress the extras in very earthy colors and the leads in bright and vivid colors so they can really stand out the use of silhouettes a lot of floodlight reminiscent of carbon arc lightning classic red green blue primaries color palette which is a true beauty to behold in several scenes They used old anamorphic lenses they color graded the footage as to be reminiscent of the glorious Technicolor age and its 3 strip process The sets are beautiful All this requires tremendous work and it really shines throughout the film The team that was in charge of the technical aspects is top notch first class hands down no question And here lies the true sadness what it is and what it could have been La La Land has many nods to different classic films It clearly pays respects to Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire And here lies another big problem Those guys were Gods with shoes on Compared to them R G is a world class grade A dilettante He s a good actor whatever but his dancing skills reminds me of that show Dancing With the Stars at most which I always zapped away from The film pays respects and nods at many old classics while itself achieving nothing except basking in a pool of mediocrity and worse it s getting big time rewarded for it No That s just wrong It s a disturbing trend and a symptom of a much greater and complex problem our society suffers from It s like anti vaxers for art The ending is the lowest point for this film I m obviously not spoiling it but it will leave you wanting your money back For me it was the killing blow If there s a word to describe this whole experience it s kitsch For a comedy it s barely funny and apart from the technical aspects which are really good there is very little of movie metamaterial that could hold up under close scrutiny when compared to the great classics or even other modern musicals for that matter I m sorry,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3622758/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2017,A modern musical classic!,Unusually for me I actually had good expectations going in to this movie I ve always loved the classic musicals of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and to see such a film as La La Land hit theatres in this day and age felt like some sort of revival of the long dead musical genre But the big question is is there anything under the surface Is it just a fun musical with great songs or is there more than just that Well it s with deep pleasure that I can in fact say it isn t just a musical if anything it s a good story first a great musical second Yes I went in expecting a good musical and to be honest if all it was was that I would have no complaints But this movie took it another level It had an extra layer that I wasn t expecting I enjoyed 2017 s Beauty and the Beast remake a lot It delivered with great songs and brilliant dance choreography but let s be honest if you take all that away what would you have It wouldn t be half the movie it was without the musical side of things Take La La Land and you have a movie that would work fine even if you took the musical side of things away The songs only make it even greater than it would have already have been The chemistry between the two leads feels genuine and believable They don t feel like fictional characters Instead they feel like real human beings with real aspirations and real dreams hoping to prove their worth As someone with big dreams of hitting it big this undoubtedly hit to heart with me I ve heard some backlash from some people who want to get over critical due to the movie s massive success Some say it s nothing but an excuse for Hollywood to glorify themselves with much narcissism Those people completely misunderstood the whole point of this movie This is a raw portrayal of Hollywood and the challenge one has to achieve success The ending I dare not spoil it It is the very cherry on top of a delicious cake I tell you if you have not watched La La Land believe the hype It s as good as they say it is,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3694818/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2017,Why make a musical with a lead actor who can't sing?,I m sorry but Gosling s singing was atrocious Unfortunately he wasn t the only person in this movie whose singing was not good enough for a musical production Right from the opening scene you are confronted with actors who wouldn t make it past the first casting round of a Broadway show Don t get me wrong I like Emma Stone but she doesn t fit the role of young aspiring actress anymore which makes her something of a miscast The story is plain boring and the dialogue is bland Who wants to see Gosling agonizing about the nature of Jazz music in long scenes drawn out like old chewing gum followed by semi neurotic love interest scenes which seem to pass for convincing romance these days I guess two people who qualify for couples therapy sessions after just having met is the new normal The cinematography is great and the director really knows how to paint moving pictures but it s all form and no substance making it the musical equivalent of a Michael Bay action movie In my opinion this is one of the most over hyped and overrated movies in many years,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3639865/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2017,This really isn't a good film and does not deserve the hype....,So we went to see this film as a family today What a disappointment Where did all the hype come from for this film The actors are decent but are not great at singing or dancing which is a major issue for this type of production The story is threadbare the characters are frankly dull what IS there to like So as a family we thought it was poor entertainment the people who left the cinema part way through never to return presumably thought it poor also We spoke to friends afterwards who have also been to see it thought it was rubbish also there is a theme here folks So we read up about the film after and read there is a backlash as frankly the film doesn t deserve the hype Which frankly begs the question where all the hype has come from So the film is released just before the Oscars the critics rave the public is TOLD you must love this film People vote positively or are they genuine reviews and don t get me started on the critics I m sorry but people have had the wool pulled over their eyes this isn t worth the time or money to see,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3648873/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,Puffed up piece of cupcake dust,Saw La La Land a week ago and I needed time to process how little impressed with it I ended up being It is a sparkly superwhite depiction of LA in an utterly apolitical hipster way that scratches it s soles to the beat of eras when most things were just that self centered posh people having dreams It is underneath the personal story of two people trying to be something an embodiment of make film great again as the dictator down south s mean spirited and ignorant slogan about America itself is It is a throwaway film most certainly does NOT deserve any Oscars and is actually quite forgettable except for the City of Stars song The dancing isn t just off it s terrible dare I say utterly lame Emma Stone s charm only got me so far through this puffed up piece of cupcake dust The use of Griffith Observatory becomes goofier than even the worst parts of Titanic Arrival Moonlight even Manchester by the Sea are far far superior films This of course means La La Land will win big time I enjoyed Warcraft more Seriously,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625205/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2017,Highly over rated,A struggling actress and a struggling talented musician are the backdrop to this musical I am Indian so I love musical movies and was so surprised seeing Singin in the Rain it was so beautiful So I came in with a little too much expectation I felt that the movie had too many songs It detracted from the story rather than adding to it Somehow Emma Stone was just not right for this part Debbie Reynolds and Merylin Monroe are the kind of actresses that are just perfect for this role A beautiful endearing smile and somehow you are rooting for them from the bottom of your heart Relatively Emma Stone seems cold though she seems to be acting very well Ryan Gosling plays his usual cool dude performance and he does a fantastic job But I would have loved to see Leonardo De Caprio in this role it would have been stunning They both have an interesting love story with the current trend of self deprecating jokes situation analysis etc which I am not a big fan of There are so many subtle things that I enjoyed like the car the studio the music things that you normally don t notice much when the drama takes center stage And the ending left me a little disappointed This is supposed to be an artistic movie so it was not supposed to have a typical Hollywood ending still not happy Finally a Hollywood musical is a special once in a blue moon thing and this just did not live up But thanks And I am happy this movie is a success and hoping to see similar and even better movies,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3787807/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2017,Short of greatness,Tis said that a really great picture is one where even the small character parts truly stand out Gone With The Wind boasts not just its four memorable leads but a whole flock of memorable characters who stand out Dr Meade by Harry Davenport and his wife Julia Meade by Jane Darwell are two examples and there are many more La La Land stands short of real greatness in that it only concentrates on its two leads with the rest of the characters well into the background But the two leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone being nominated for Best Actor and Actress and Stone taking home the Oscar gold La La Land is a salute to those old time backstage musicals in an age when movies just don t have the talented musical performers to do those films any more Emma Stone had some nice notes but Gosling did his singing in the tradition of Rex Harrison who as I recall won Oscar and Tony for being Henry Higgins with talk sing role Gosling is a musician a jazz pianist in the tradition of Earl Hines and Count Basie and he wants to bring back jazz He truly hates contemporary music and the fact he has to play keyboard in a rock band rather than do what those aforementioned gentlemen did I really identified with Gosling in my own life I m posting music with Bing and Frank and their contemporaries on Facebook and care not if no one else listens but me Stone just wants the world to notice her talent and in that cruel and heartless world that can be show business getting noticed about 3 4 of the battle She does do a reckless move that would and could dishearten anyone so the world will notice what she has to offer Besides Stone winning Best Actress and young Damian Chazelle for Best Director La La Land won 6 others and several more nominations like Gosling s The music is fine though I wish we had people like Frank Sinatra or a Gene Kelly to perform this stuff now La La Land is a wonderful film that falls a tad short on greatness,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3704329/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2017,Pure... emotion,It s very obvious that this movie is made with the utmost passion for both films and music I found this movie to be enthralling and perfect I cannot specify how much I loved this movie Did I mention that I loved this movie well I do Unlike a lot of people I talk to I have no problems with musicals and I quite like them I m going to make this short and sweet and try to list all the perfect things about this movie Since it s a musical I feel I should mention that the songs singing and dancing were absolutely flawless in execution I especially adored Fools who dream I am a huge fan of both leads and in my opinion this was a career best performance by the gorgeous Emma Stone and another brilliant performance by Gostling Their chemistry was 100 believable and they were very cute together The plot itself focuses a lot on passion and dedication to that passion It tries to make people want to achieve their goals and follow their dreams in an active way Directing and cinematography were absolutely beautiful I was born in L A so this movie made me very nostalgic and it showed the sort of artistic side of L A and I loved it It is a gripping experience but I would recommend watching this with a significant other 11 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3613551/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2019,should have won best picture,Everything about this movie is remarkable From opening number probably one of my favorite scenes ever to the final montage again probably one of my favorite scenes ever La La Land is a mesmerizing story about following your dreams The film starts with an energetic catchy and beautifully choreographed tune called Another Day of Sun which really has nothing to do with the story but sets up the mood and the context From there we follow two main characters as they pursue their dreams together For Seb a jazz musician For Mia an actress La La Land s most notable features are the music colors choreography and cinematography The music written by Justin Hurwitz perfectly fits and forms the mood of every scene I really have no complaints about any of the songs There are so many different hues of colors and each scene seems to have a different color scheme I don t know too much about dancing but to the extent of my knowledge the choreography is brilliant and entertaining though no comparison to Gene Kelly The cinematography strategically combines elements of both a Golden Era masterpiece and a stage play while also providing space to showcase the colors and music The actors try hard but to be honest I personally don t like any of the actors in this Other than my personal distaste of casting I have no complaints of La La Land It s a visual and musical masterpiece that I plan to watch many more times,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5057476/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2019,"Exploring themes of self actualization, finding love and chasing dreams",The score in this musical is simply phenomenal The individual tracks are catchy and does exceedingly well in captivating the feelings of our protagonists and their state of mind as well as driving the emotional story forward However the music is elevated to the next level by the interconnectedness of the repeating beats and overall To prove my point my top artist of 2016 on Spotify was Ryan Gosling That s how good the soundtrack is The acting also has to be commended especially from Emma Stone which gives the performance of a lifetime She does steal the show quite a bit in my opinion but the whole cast deserves a pat on the back and I find Ryan Gosling surprisingly hilarious in his role with his temper and funny quirks The story itself is naturally engaging in the musical way of things and our protagonists have a wonderful sense of chemistry that is hard not to fall for The overall themes however are what really keeps me thinking about this movie How the struggles of a tough career path and your personal love life constantly brings you ups and downs Do they change along the way Would you trade a part of yourself to achieve your goals How we deal with these situations and the sacrifices that has to be made along the way are challenges that most people can relate to I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone Especially if you like the grandeur Hollywood theme in and of itself or is a fan of musicals,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4989529/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2022,Very disappointing film,Even though La La Land was released in 2016 until yesterday I had only seen some of its trailers available on the Web As I didn t like the trailers I was never motivated enough to see the film Yesterday however I decided to watch it finally to confirm or not my initial impressions based only on the few scenes I had seen After seeing the whole film my first impression based on the trailers prevailed now in a more assertive way It is a very boring musical with a banal plot where the two main protagonists are very uninteresting characters and the dialogues between them simplistic and shallow The City of Stars that was awarded in 2017 with the Oscar for best original song is the only interesting and valuable contribution of this film,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8626890/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2016,this may be the greatest film of 2016,La La Land is a dazzling cinematic explosion made up of life love and music It s a magical musical ride through an unforgettable romance that is original and brilliant After directing Whiplash and now this it is obvious that director Damien Chazelle will live on to become one of the greats As a matter of fact this might be even better than Whiplash and it seems like it will certainly become a cinematic classic over time Although the film drips with a sense of homage it still does not contain an ounce of clich which is a real relief Reading the synopsis it may seem like an average love story but it manages to be unpredictable The depiction of the conflicts that arise during a relationship is reminiscent to Jean Vigo s masterful classic L Atalante and this film deserves to be compared to such masterpieces because it IS a masterpiece It is not only a masterpiece of cinema but also of entertainment music humor and drama It is an experience that will likely be appreciated by all everyone from high brow critics to young girls,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3606710/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2017,La La Long,When do I finally realize that I m not enjoying a particular movie This realization usually comes when a scene in the film reminds me of some other movie and I find myself longing to watch that film instead of the one I am desperately trying to enjoy In the case of La La Land this didn t take too long During the duo dance scenes between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling I found myself longing to watch Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell During the jazz music scenes I found myself longing to put on some music from Miles Davis or Dave Brubeck Damien Chazelle s souffl light screenplay made me long for some sort of story with substance Let s face it even your longest allowable tweet would carry as much storytelling weight as this script When considering Chazelle s direction I found myself longing for a musical directed by Vincent Minnelli And while all this longing was going on I was longing for a shorter film La La Land is not a long production when compared with West Side Story or The Music Man and let s not make any further comparisons with those great films but it sure as heck seemed like a long long movie Dictionary com defines the phrase la la land as a state of being out of touch with reality I won t disagree with that definition About halfway into this flick I was beginning to drift off into Dictionary com s interpretation Luckily I had some severe arthritis pain in my right big toe that kept me alert long enough to long for some relief algesic or cinematic and to keep me awake long enough so that I could make a valid critique of this picture Finally I long for the day when someone will make a musical that s even half as watchable as the last good Hollywood musical Hairspray which really wasn t all that long ago was it,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627634/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2016,Golden age of Hollywood cinema re-imagined for today,Telluride by the Sea Portsmouth NH led off its 2016 weekend film festival with La La Land a captivating film that hearkens back to the golden age of Hollywood cinema yet remains firmly embedded in present day Los Angeles life Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring a startling depth and nuanced feelings to what could easily have been another trite variation on the theme of falling in and out of love The film impressed me on so many levels for the quality of the direction and cinematography the seamless transition between musical song and dance numbers with a powerful narrative the inventive choreography the authenticity that Stone and Gosling brought to their portrayal of their characters and the amplification of the intensity of their romance enacted through their singing and dancing This film is not to be missed by anyone who loves the classic Ginger Rodgers Fred Astaire movies and who longs for a modern re invention of this genre,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3547171/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2017,"Takes your heart out to play it like a piano, and does that just right",In a sense creating perfect films and perfect relationships is a similar task You just start with the best and then simply keep it up never compromising not a single mistake not a single wrong step In a sense it s a technical task follow these rules and you are bound to succeed However simply perfect is just too simple Too plain When you come to expect the perfection you start taking it for granted and even the perfect things lose their shine and become kinda dull But how to create something perfect if perfect itself won t cut it The answer is you just have to wing it turning your heart into an antenna and listening to what it s telling you La La Land does just that And technically what it does isn t perfect at all The opening scene is way too cheesy and orchestrated the dissonance between the people and their song is tiny but stingingly apparent And you re already bracing yourself for another hyper hyped ultra colored hymn to itself At that point the film s all but a future disappointment But the perfect relationships are not a sunny day on a loop what s more important is being able to make it up for the flaws and turn them into the details you ll eventually love as well So after having overplayed the bravado at first the film becomes softer and more delicate not miming its song however perfectly but finding its own voice honest and sincere A voice in which Mia and Sebastian speak to each other At moments gruff at moments insecure but ultimately telling the most true story there is Right here is where most other participants take the smooth road to an inevitable happy ending And the summer in La La Land is sweet and promising enough to deliver just that But will the technically perfect thing be really perfect Or even a sunny day could get pale if not the clouds and rain to be its counterpart So the summer is bound to turn into fall and once inevitable the prospect of a happy ending vanishes like a sad pipe smoker s dream But that s when we re hooked with no way back From that point on we want to listen to the story no second thoughts no distractions there s only us and the storyteller Like children who stopped squabbling and all want to know if the prince eventually finds his fair lady Our emotions are already at stake and the elegance with which La La Land took them out of our pocket is almost illegal The thief doesn t even conceal himself playing our hearts openly and it s tempting to stop playing along and call the police After all the emotional manipulation is indeed a crime even when it s so sublimely carried out Well if you still had strength to resist the last shreds of it fall when Ms Stone takes the lead And it s not just her ability to act or sing which was out of question a long time ago It s how she takes the razor sharp blade of emotions concealed within the script and pulls it out in one impeccable move like King Arthur once did And oh boy don t you just start shivering at that moment so bright she shines And just after that it becomes really inevitable The mastermind of this brilliant spectacle Mr Chazelle might be young but when he s behind the wheel of a story he wrote himself he doesn t miss Every single romantic nonsense that we used to laugh about like and she felt as if those five years have never passed as if she was right there in that quiet restaurant at Christmas eve her eyes on him as if nothing else existed becomes alive in his hands and he literally takes us on a journey others could only describe The feeling you experience at that moment it s pure magic something that not only makes you forgive the pompous intro but makes you realize that it was the only right start for something that led you where you are now And that s when your feeling is finally complete Technically La La Land isn t without a flaw And if I was a grumpy old fart I might ve groaned on about it for a bit About Ryan Gosling s questionable singing or the plot s lack of complexity or the ending being not what we might want it to be But that doesn t really matter after all it s just technicalities What does matter is what the film emanates love Love for art love for those who dare to dream and dare to follow the dreams who dare to be open and true Love for life itself The kind of love that shows the passion of the person whose heart that love flows out of And these feelings don t just show off or simply graze you They reach out to you They ARE THERE for you And for letting me take that love as my own La La Land thank you,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3686420/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2017,"Overrated, unimpressive shlock...",The unimpressive opening dance number sets the tone for this mishegoss of a film Yet another case of The Academy ie anyone with a SAG card voting for films that they have clearly never seen How this qualified as a so called Musical is truly a mystery The musical numbers totaled less than 10 minutes Zero chemistry and zero character study between the main stars Stilted dialogue that chewed at my ears with no semblance of a plot La La Land was nothing more than an excuse to create lavish sets Despite my cousin having co produced this film I will still stand by my educated review In the end an actor s actor always chooses NYC over LA LA Land,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3758047/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,"Nostalgic, colorful and so much fun.",La La Land is a callback to old timey muscial movies infused with fun and technicolor From the opening scene where we find a group of people stuck on the freeway who suddenly break into song and dance to the closing notes it never forgets why it was made And that s to entertain and remind us of the Golden Age of cinema when big bombastic musicals were the rage What really sets this one apart other than the time it was made is that the main actors namely Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling aren t necessarily trained singers and dancers They re capable and they re able to pull it off but there s this note of amateurishness about them Not a bad thing in fact it makes this feel a lot more real We ve all had those moments that for whatever reason we do a little jig or maybe we sing a bit along to the radio and honestly most people don t have any training in these things So it s refreshing when somebody who isn t a pro does so Color also plays a big part in this You can see it from the opening scene where everybody is dressed in bright solid colors as they sing and dance along the freeway to when the girls go out to a party each in their own brightly colored dress It evokes the old films that were filmed in technicolor where everything was bright and colorful simply because they could show such a thing The story follows two individuals One is a musician who is in love with jazz and dreams of opening his own jazz club The other is a struggling actress who loves old cinema Again these are call backs to older movies and musicals It follows them through their life as they chase their dreams and fall in love It s all rather charming and it leads to a conclusion that a lot of people found offputting but I felt suited the tone rather well It s a shame this didn t win the oscar but it did win multiple awards so that s something,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5067628/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2018,"Majestic, enchanting and delightful... and that's an understatement.",La La Land starts off with an odd piece imagine the busiest highway in your city suddenly turning into a sing along with everyone dancing outside of their cars Shortly after that it bursts into a classic magical film laced with love the freight of dreams and the will to not give up on them I was a little bit skeptical at first not having been a huge fan of musicals in the past but I was very wrong It s more of a movie then a musical The musical as I think about it is just the cherry on top of an already brilliant script La La Land is filled with those simultaneous conflicts between dreams and reality hence the singing and the musical aspect of the film This makes it for the dreamers and the realists alike Do you want to make your dreams come true but you re dealing with some internal conflicts Then this movie is for you If you don t care about dreams this movie is still for you,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4171087/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2018,Cinematically appealing,From the internationally proclaimed musical director from Whiplash damian chazelle has come back strong with another musical film LALA LAND storming 5 academy awards and 6 golden globes has proven how successful the movie is besides it gains it The movie starts with the song Another day of sun with a group of people dancing in highway the choreography itself is remarkable enough but the real magic lies in the tracking shot throughout the whole song without any editing The cinematography by Linus Sandgren has not only stops at the tracking shot but the use of natural lighting throughout the whole movie The colour grading and the camera movement has created a tremendous nerves of visual sensation Each songs blends into the music perfectly with the camera following the choreography showing each dancing movement clearly This doesn t stop the cinematic magic of Damien Chazzele He himself is a musician he knows the music well enough that he understand how music may engage the audience deep enough to make an impact He finds Pasek and Paul to be the composer of the music soundtrack the soundtrack won the academy award forest original soundtrack After watching the movie the songs and lyrics keeps popping out in my head brainwashing this is how the cinematic magic works Words can t describe how appealing the movie is Some may say the plot is too realistic and the whole movie is overrated but these opinions comes to be objective Maybe the plot may not suites anyone s taste but you can t deny the fact that this movie somehow brings a impact to people letting people feeling nostalgic back to the 60s where it claimed to be the golden age of Hollywood after adapting ideas from Singing in the rain the umbrellas of Cherbourg and revel without a cause The usage of costume and colour somehow comprehend a special visual experience making the movie colourful and strong in sense The special chemistry between Ryan gosling and Emma stone also reminds us of the reality nowadays making us feeling someway desperate of the truth where people are unable to follow their dreams but to sacrifices lots in order to achieve our goal Emma stone has done a brilliant job of portraying the role of Mia maybe she can t sing but the acts and emotion of hers is undeniably relatable While Ryan gosling acting as the role of Sebastian frankly is a bit too ordinary Damien chazzele may be the new generation of musical director bringing new era of musical film to Hollywood Back in the 50s and 60s when musical film are a hit the hype ends in the 70s Nowadays less and less musical films are made in hope of Damien chazzele wishing he may bring back the hype of musical film back to Hollywood,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4070850/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2018,Highly overrated!,I simply cannot understand why this film rated so highly The best part was Emma Stone s acting but other than that there is virtually nothing worth praising If this was an attempt to revive the classic film musicals of the forties and fifties it fails utterly in my opinion The main problem is that Emma Stone can t sing and Ryan Gosling can t act Another problem is that in many of the other musical numbers including the opening one in the LA traffic jam you can t hear the lyrics As an actor Ryan Gosling reminds me of sixties actor David Jansen who played Richard Kimble in the Fugitive TV series he has one or at the most two facial expressions Overall the story is fairly boring too I m writing this review about two weeks after seeing the movie and I have no desire to see it again I m probably being generous in rating this 4 10,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4027807/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2016,Managed to surpass the high expectations I had!,Just saw this at TIFF and had a fantastic time Solid 8 5 10 Having seen and loved Whiplash I was really looking forward to Damien Chazelle s next movie The fact that it would be a musical with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just made me super impatient to watch it Oh I also love jazz so that just made it pretty much perfect Expectations were sky high from this team and boy did they meet them and then some The trailer was beautiful from its colours to the soundtrack to the fact that it didn t give away any of the story and it really was just the trailer since the movie and it s music totally blows you away The themes it explores though not new are relatable for anybody and the way the story is told really makes an impact Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were really impressive with their dancing and singing I ve always loved how natural their acting is as well and this movie was no different Thoroughly enjoyed both their performances The lead characters may be struggling in certain fields but it is their dreams they are chasing at the end of the day Something we all have done or are in the process of doing This makes you quickly feel like you know these people and what they re going through Throw in some comedy love drama and magical soundtracks as well as sequences and you have yourself a masterpiece I really haven t seen anything like this in a very long time Damien Chazelle has proved himself again and is definitely someone to lookout for for years to come,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3543291/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,As perfect as a film can be,I don t like to say it often but I think it s pretty much impossible for anyone with a heart and soul to dislike La La Land It s an exceptionally joyful and uplifting film full of vibrant and delightful settings dance numbers and cinematography It s also a story for the ages with an incredibly relatable and often bittersweet look at the difficult path to achieving your dreams Its lead performances are amazing Damien Chazelle gives arguably one of the best directing performances of all time and most of all its music is wonderful There s so much to talk about with La La Land and all of it is good However I think it s best to start with the man who both directed and wrote this absolute masterpiece Damien Chazelle His previous outing with Whiplash was something incredibly special and already seen as a modern classic but he goes to new lengths to indulge his love for cinema and music with La La Land And this isn t the sort of self indulging passion project like some recent Tarantino and Scorsese films that seem to be made to entertain the directors themselves more than anyone else because Chazelle is all too pleased to take us along on a magical journey through the wondrous place where dreams are made and broken harking back to the Golden Age of Hollywood better than any film before With his dynamic visual style the film has wonderful energy and ambition strengthening the story of our main characters striving to achieve their dreams However the way in which he uses so many motifs from Classic Hollywood including the bright vibrant colours of the costumes long and elegant instrumental sequences and even the odd touch of a film noir vibe from time to time is such a joy for any film fan to see With so many little details about Hollywood past and present sprinkled here and there I could watch this film a million times and still be utterly enchanted by its love for the movies But what s even more impressive is that the film s screenplay is also written by Damien Chazelle The film s story may sound like cheesy and fanciful rubbish at first but the success of the film s story is testament to how good Chazelle s writing is Uplifting joyful and wonderfully magical at almost every moment the central romance is spellbinding to follow whilst the conviction that our two main characters have to achieve their dreams even if they get knocked down from time to time is so admirable to see The result of that is that we have a story in which it s so easy to care about the protagonists hopes and ambitions and an absolute pleasure to spend two hours with them as they navigate a turning point in their lives The thing is Chazelle goes one better than an uplifting and magical musical by also providing some emotionally riveting themes Particularly as the film moves towards a spectacular and what I m sure will be legendary finale Chazelle inserts some beautifully tender and bittersweet emotions to the story as well as providing an exceptionally unpredictable and innovative way to tell a story of star crossed lovers Next up are the central performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling We ve seen the two work brilliantly on screen together in Crazy Stupid Love but there s something even more magical about their partnership in La La Land Apart from the fact that they make a wonderfully convincing and captivating romantic couple on screen there s never a moment where one overshadows the other The two work together to make their characters so lovable and fascinating and that means that whilst there s always so much to be impressed by in their incredibly dynamic individual performances there s nothing more special than seeing them together on screen Whether that s in some of the film s more blissful romantic periods or whether they re sparring they both play off one another with ease and make for the most entertaining and energetic leading lady and gentleman I ve ever seen And whilst Stone and Gosling aren t quite Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly when it comes to the vocals their singing is just as good as their acting However as a lot of the music in La La Land is a little more restrained than classic 40s and 50s musicals it requires a less showy singing voice And that leads me nicely into the one thing that might make you reluctant to see La La Land the music I love a good movie musical and my favourites are all from the 1940s 60s era just what this film is a love letter to Put simply however La La Land is easily my favourite musical of all time and undoubtedly one of the best ever made When so many movie musicals fail to weave storytelling and musical numbers together La La Land does it so effortlessly The moments where the characters break into song feel completely natural and the songs themselves aren t just entertaining toe tappers but integral parts of the story that accomplish storytelling better than any musical I ve ever seen As such I was always overjoyed when the characters broke into song something that I ve never really felt before in a musical So overall I was completely spellbound by La La Land Doing something that no movie musical has ever done to me before making me excited to see a story told through song as well as providing an uplifting funny and wonderfully joyful story the film is a real delight Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling s performances are pitch perfect whilst Damien Chazelle s innovative and passionate writing and directing are the icing on the cake for this absolute triumph of a film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621114/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2016,"Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, singing and dancing!",The dinner is served girls and boys Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are here to dazzle you with this movie musical serving as ode to both 1950 s musicals and screenwriter director Damien Chazelle s love for jazz The story is generic but cosy as your favorite pillow jazz pianist boy meets waitress aspiring actress girl and they fall in love And then a whole bunch of people dance and sing The two lovely stars are both singing and dancing themselves doing a good job at that Still personally I d have chosen an actress with stronger on screen presence to pair up with already legendary Gosling But you know whatever I am not actually into musicals so for me by far the most impressive thing about this feel good crowdpleaser is the boss man behind the screen Damien Chazelle The dude is only nearly 32 years old but he has done three movies already always as a director and a sole screenwriter You know him better as the author of 2014 s majestic surprise hit Whiplash So go see it If you like musicals you will be pleased If you don t care about them there s still enough feel good stuff to enjoy the ride for 128 minutes If you are a fan of Whiplash dying to get another dose of Chazelle then be prepared for a nice surprise in the form of certain bald guy who should have a bigger role here for sure,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3595307/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2017,Head in the Clouds...,I like the colours There I ve said something positive so hopefully that fulfils the required impartiality quotient I appreciate the craft and it s obviously been made with a lot of love but this just Was Not my thing at all It s the ultimate stage brat movie I have a lot of sympathy for those types of people I took drama classes but they tend to become grating after awhile and this film grated on me REALLY fast Life is not light and frothy Sometimes we have to do things we don t like Don t ask me to coddle self indulgence I knew going in that I wasn t a fan of musicals so you may ask why I freely chose to watch this The answer is that as with any genre occasionally I find an example that surprises me Top Hat Chicago Moulin Rouge Unfortunately I found no such surprises here The best part of watching it was knowing that as soon as I finished it I d never have to see it again I ve done my duty as an Oscars devotee and movie buff but now I need the palate cleansing of Trainspotting 2 as soon as possible,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3798539/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,Starts Well,Ryan Gosling is Seb an immensely talented pianist who wants to play pure jazz Emma Stone is Mia a would be actress who can t get closer to the movies than working as a barista on the Warner s lot Together they star in La La Land a note perfect but curiously joyless musical from writer director Damien Chazelle While the movie as a whole hits all the right notes for this lover of Freed unit musicals I enjoy a tremendous variety but for me the Freed unit was the best I have the feeling that everyone wanted to make a musical but was afraid the audience wouldn t understand So we get an opening production number on the freeway with a crab dolly zooming around the stuck cars a bit of a challenge dance and a big romantic dance to the sky at the Griffith observatory Then things fall apart The songs are decent the performances endearing I m surprised Gosling s character isn t named Danny Maguire but the musical performances are restrained and even tromped on Miss Stone s singing is performed in a weak quavering voice until her solo at the end at which point she lets loose with a pleasant if unexceptional voice The ballet at the end shows what should have happened but did not The result is a pleasant movie that should please the not too critical but in the end shows a failure of courage and the result is an effort at irony that renders the movie self effacing rather than ebullient,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8049707/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,Five bags of popcorn,Powerful musicals make me feel like it s a crime to put words to them After seeing La La Land it was clear to me that the film was one of the best theatre experiences I will ever have I worship the beauty of La La Land It s all so big and beautiful And Emma Stone is brilliant She does the best thing an actress can do to find a way to be the most compelling woman in the room without having to be the loudest She conveys the most power through her subtleties and this is partly due to her wonderful chemistry with Gosling The humanistic wonder expressed through Gosling and Stone s eyes when they look at each other is enough to carry any movie The music is the spirit of their romance This is especially prevalent in their intense moments with one another like in the Planetarium sequence It s just as much about their faces while they dance as it is the dancing La La Land portrays extremely vital parts of human existence that are easily forgotten about and given towards normality or daily life Stone sings that a little bit of madness is key in an ode to the ones who dream This particular song makes cements the already prevalent attitude of the film that vision imagination hope endurance and love make the impossible a reality Brutal realism in film and real life complements the hazy dynamics of love making the emotion so much more powerful within the human being The dynamic screenplay adds to the film s realism contributing to its overall power For example when you see the scenes like her at his concert like him missing her play it s clear how much they love each other but how in order to fulfill themselves and become who they are they need to do it separately Then their lives took them away from each other and she met someone else and had kids It all becomes clear at Seb s at the end They still love each other but almost too much their circumstances make it so they couldn t be together they re too invested in each other and have to be near each other and in their two journeys do not collide well enough to be sustainable La La Land is a movie about love and passion the intersection and division of both within the creative life,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3603182/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2019,"Stunningly good, to my amazement.",I actually avoided watching La La Land for 3 years even the title of the movie I found annoying Romantic Hollywood Musical in 2016 give me break I can t think of a more boring way to spend a few hours of my life Boy did I get this one wrong I can t praise highly enough the performances of both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone nothing short of stunning is there any guy on the planet that didn t fall in love with Emma Stone as the movie progressed Direction music production are close to perfection I was truly amazed,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5164869/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2017,No Toe Tapper..........,I wanted to like it but sadly it just didn t live up to the hype for me As hard as they tried Ryan Reynolds and Emma Stone just came across as amateurish in the musical numbers and I couldn t help but think how much better it could have been with a Donald O Connor and Debbie Reynolds in the leads but of course there s no one of that musical caliber around these days No memorable songs either even the much talked about opening number on the freeway was a letdown bunch of people jumping on and over cars a few unimpressive dance moves and some incoherent song I doubt Busby Berkley would have given it the thumbs up Why everyone s raving about this film is a mystery to me I can only assume there s a lot of people out there who have never seen a musical from the 30 s 40 s or 50 s Maybe it would have worked better if they d set it in the 50 s and left out the modern non melodic pop songs Also thought the ending was quite bizarre A good try I suppose but it just fell flat for me sorry,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615036/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2017,The worst movie I have seen in a long time,I have never seen such a horrible film since 2012 It had terrible acting terrible music and an incredibly mind numbing plot Emma Stone is without a doubt the most annoying actress I have ever encountered She is so horrible that I will make sure she is not an actress in any film I watch again I wouldn t even see her films on a bet I would go if paid to do so but only with earplugs and an eye mask The plot is a typical boy meets girl over and over again til they become a thing Which is fine if it s pulled off well This wasn t for the reasons I named above I can t believe this movie got good reviews at all I had to walk out after 30 40 minutes I waited until my very tiny thankfully bag of popcorn and beer were finished which I downed as quickly as possible so I could get the heck out of there and then I got out of there like a bat out of h e double toothpicks You might want to watch it if you don t consider Emma Stone the worst and most annoying actress ever and or watch Ryan Gosling desperately try to keep up with her poor acting he had some trouble but he managed to be a bad actor as well Anyway good riddance to bad rubbish I m glad I got outta there and that I didn t go with a person who wanted to stay Find a film that isn t annoying and go for it Well that s my recommendation anyway,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631823/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2016,Ga Ga for La La Land,A year after enthralling audiences with his second feature film Whiplash Damien Chazelle is back at it again with his magical and mesmerizing Musical La La Land starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling a film that doesn t just capture the style and essence of a musical in the vain of Singing in the Rain but also perfectly blends it with the style of modern day cinema thanks in part to being set in modern day but taking place in a traditionally Hollywood part of Los Angeles and boasting some beautifully colorful cinematography that gives you the feeling you re in a sublime and dreamlike state The direction and editing on display here is quite flawless Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling once again show off their undeniable chemistry as two struggling performers trying to make it big in the city of stars In a year full of such disaster and indifference La La Land is just what the doctor ordered,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601781/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2022,Awful,Having heard so much about how this was a nice musical film like the old MGM musicals of the 50 s we settled down with great expectations Off to a good start with the big opening number which was quite a technical feat if nothing else But after that the film took a sudden turn for the worse with difficult to hear dialogue characters mumbling to themselves people arguing etc Just as we thought there might be the beginnings of an actual plot we were plunged into another song After about 40 minutes of getting nowhere and finding the film cold irritating and incomprehensible we gave up It had almost nothing in common with the old warm and enjoyable MGM musicals we fondly remember,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8023227/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2018,Musical I enjoyed!?!,Never been a fan of the genre Musical If you watched Paint your wagon or Cat Balloo you will understand why In my view only Singing in the rain was an acceptable musical Now there s a second one and it s not because of the great singing there isn t any of that It s because of the magic rhythm and photography that I actually enjoyed the musical parts that I would normally find boring and unnecessary interfering with the plot development What a nice way of telling a tragedy,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4149887/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,I didn't want to feel things,First film ever that made me tear up like a baby While probably being my favourite musical the songs in this film weren t really what stuck out as exceptional to me It s just beautifully shot well acted with great dialogue and it perfectly encapsulates emotions of sentiment I must admit this film s hard to get into at first but I quickly got past the cheesiness of musicals and was loving it from Ryan Gosling s introduction onward I also love the way the messages are portrayed The grim depiction of conflict between dreams and relationships The way it communicates with jazz how art needs to evolve to survive and how that s not necessarily a bad thing This film itself is a modern reincarnation of 70s musicals poetically playing into its own metaphor about helping old art forms survive Something about the characters just hit especially close to home though watched it twice so far and still love it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5544220/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2017,"Great production value, but painfully boring and overrated.",This movie is so overrated It has great production value but it kind of ends there The movie is a musical but half way through it decides to suddenly stop being a music and just turns into a boring drama with a dull plot Although the movie started with decent momentum it quickly just falls apart and gets really boring in the second half of the movie Musicals often don t have very strong plots but makeup for it with music La La Land did not do this Instead they just have a few songs and a boring plot Also Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were terrible choices for this movie They both are mediocre singers especially Gosling and terrible dancers the dancing scene seemed so forced and unnatural There are literally thousands of amazing theater actors and singers out there but for some reason they chose two people who have zero experience in show theater Makes no sense Critics need to stop judging movies based on production value This movie was mediocre at best and doesn t deserve any special recognition,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3649875/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,"Really a good movie, which justifies the hype around it.",Who doesn t remember La La Land It was released in theaters in 2016 and was one of the most viewed and acclaimed films of that year It was a film that was virtually carried in the lap between festivals and awards of the seventh art and that seemed destined to clean them all up as Titanic had done two decades before When he arrived at the Oscars he had practically nominations in almost every category where he could be included Of the fourteen nominations however it collected only six statuettes with the seventh Best Film slipping through the fingers in what was the most absolute embarrassment in the entire history of the Hollywood Academy the infamous but historic exchange of envelopes that we all have in our memory But when I said only it is necessary to put things in perspective what many producers would not have given to win six Oscars in one of their films Like it or not it was a great achievement and La La Land received a well deserved accolade that night The film directed by newcomer Damien Chazelle is a worthy homage to musicals from Hollywood s golden age and features a generally sympathetic script an aspiring starlet trying to become an actress meets and falls in love with a purist jazz pianist Who wants to restore people s interest in the musical genre he loves and which he feels is slowly being lost It is their mutual passion that makes them not give up on their respective dreams but it will also end up dictating that both follow their own paths And indeed the film s bittersweet and slightly too realistic ending shockingly clashes with the magic felt throughout the rest of the film It s like having a very beautiful dream where anything is possible with some effort and serious work and ending up seeing that dream trampled by a heavy raw and often unfair reality And it must be said although the characters seem likeable they are selfish and only think about themselves and their interests They seem to stick together only as long as it really benefits their individual interests Although I don t like the characters very much Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling offer us in the film two magnificent works of interpretation and also of singing and dancing Gosling showed hidden talents on the keyboard of a piano and both are very good at choreography although singing is not particularly strong point for either Both are young and it is quite possible that they will give us even better dramatic performances in the future The rest of the film s cast hardly matters it s one of those movies where the main characters are so overwhelming and omnipresent that there s no room for anyone else Technically the film has several frankly good aspects that deserve our attention and our praise For starters the film s honest and intelligent way of recreating and inserting scenes and dance routines from the great musicals of the past from Shall We Dance to Singing in the Rain and West Side Story The scenarios the elements the routines are there The cinematography colorful frank generous with light is magnificent and a feast for the eyes The editing was done in an excellent and very skillful way The scenery couldn t be better taking advantage of the Hollywood Hills or the Griffith Observatory in the best way The soundtrack melodies and songs are excellent,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8848430/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2018,A special gift!,ONLY OPENING SPOILER When La La Land opened with a clich of people singing on the street I couldn t help but think of Bollywood and how I can t help to cringe a bit But La La Land made me forget this very fast It s very hard to describe You find yourself rooting for both main actors and their success Not only because they are such likeable characters but because you re never sure you can predigt whats about to happen When I finished La La Land I wanted to rewatch it immidiately I think I ve never had this urge to rewatch a movie that fast again Many things speak for this The scenery is unique likeable characters engaging plot etc The biggest reason might be how I wished this was a Videogame with different endings It s funny because the movie has a message for the viewer how freedom and chasing for your dream are important It gave me this feeling of freedom that I thought I can rewatch it again and change something in the plot so I get another ending So why do I want to change the ending In terms of sending the message mentioned above the ending is perfect A very very strong and meaningful one It s just that I have a soft spot for likeable characters in movies and want them to have EVERYTHING in a perfect way imaginable,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4182584/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2017,La La (Ha Ha) we fooled you. Signed Hollywood.,Don t get me wrong I appreciate Damien Chazelle as a director his Whiplash is a classic but not La La Land In film school and Damien if you read this you should now and I know you will read it you sold a lot of yourself to the producers in this one I know you had a pure heart and wanted to make an indie film and knew it wont go far But Hollywood inflated it like a pretentious balloon This is a pure Hollywood automatic driver car film It was stated that the dancing and singing was intentionally natural and nor professional because it will add to the authenticity of having normal people acting Come on wake up guys a dancing musical and singing should portray a great example of professionalism because that was this GENRE is all about You can t make a romantic drama and just add some amateur dancing and quality production music and make it a musical The music production in this film was great and that is it dancing was mediocre acting was average the sets were copied from old musicals even cameras they were so blurry because they filmed on the original old cameras and lenses I don t mind that but It does not work for me like that An old 35mm camera in a modern coffee shop is so pertinent Damien I love you but you ate the blue pill by friend I know you are a very talented director musician but please distance yourself from Hollywood because they took your film as their own like Chicago and Crash Don t imitate the oldies do something that raises a middle finger to the establishment I like the music production songs are great in this film and that the ending has a nostalgic feel and it can have a powerful but the rest when you make an overall statement it s just like any Hollywood fake flower Show us real stories like you did with Whiplash,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633505/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2017,"La La starts fast, crawls at finish.",With its gangbusters intro appropriately taking place in an LA traffic jam La La Land looks like it is about to serve notice on the American film musical with an exuberant energy informing the audience it is in for a fun ride The energy level however begins to waver when the dependence switches from music and dancing to melodrama and the film divided into seasons like LA has them begins to stumble just before Autumn Sebastian Ryan Gosling and Mia Emma Stone first meet in less than amicable fashion on the everyday bumper to bumper existence of the LA freeway Actress Mia works as a barista on a film lot and spends time off going to casting calls that end in disappointment Sebastian is a quirky purist jazz pianist and his own worst enemy when it comes to being employed The two cross paths again hook up and continue their artistic struggle for recognition When success knocks on both doors it threatens the future of the relationship La La Land offers up a handful of well done musical numbers imaginative dance scenes as well as a some early comic friction between the leads but the story line remains banal Director Damien Chazelle attempts to circumvent this by adding some what if moments to the story to give it more life but it only packs on more minutes to this already overlong musical As bargain basement Fred and Ginger the duo offer less than fancy footwork along with pedestrian singing voices but that is part of their charm Stone at least looks like she is enjoying herself while digging deep enough dramatically to hold some of the films more torpid dramatic scenes together Gosling is simply a lightweight whose abrasive character offers little to like to begin with and his singing and dancing along with a series of faraway stares grows tiresome by the second half and what started out with the promising chops of another Cabaret eventually degenerates into the mawkish graceless excess of New York New York,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614042/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2017,"It coulda been OK if it wasn't for all the hype and expectations, but not now",I usually don t use the word the worst to describe a movie but sometimes you have no other choices The opening reminded me of those stupid teen songs of today s that give me goose bumps outta disgust whenever I accidentally see them on TV the story is boring and worn out the music is forgettable and it gave me a headache that I won t be able to study tomorrow the dancing is an uglified Singin in the Rain and the performances are mediocre except for Emma s who also didn t deserve to win and a nomination was enough for Isabelle Huppert was so perfect in Elle the award was hers and hers only The only thing worth watching in this movie was the cinematography It could ve been an OK average movie if it wasn t for all the hype but after the built up expectations it s one harsh slap in the face when you finally sit through it waiting for something extraordinary,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3686359/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2017,Los Angeles Land: where people like predictability,This film is a bit over hyped 14 Oscar nominations seriously I saw this film yesterday and I m pretty sure it won t stick with me for a very long time The story is too flimsy It misses edge plot drama It misses depth I was tricked by the beautiful and inspiring trailer which summarizes the film actually I was also tricked by the misses who really really wanted to see this film which she didn t like as much as she thought she would To go short positive aspects of Lalaland theme song performance of Emma Stone scenery and colors Negative aspects of Lalaland flimsy scenario without much edge inconsistencies sappy songs besides theme song and average film all in all I wouldn t even call this film a musical because there isn t that much music in the film And definitively not enough jazz Three people walked out of the cinema yesterday out of 15 people Hardly a sign that this is a must see movie no,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3637077/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2023,"""..and here's to the fools who dream.. ...here's to the hearts that break, here's to the mess we make""",With every rewatch my respect for this movie and Damien Chazelle increases They hardly make such beautiful and realistic mature stories about love nowadays Love as a whole has been made so cliched over the years as the perfect emotion that gets us through all the hardships making us achieve our dreams and then letting us live our life together happily ever after But a bit farther away from the fantasy world and closer to reality love has never been about that if so then it is not love Falling in love has become a trend and less emphasis is being given to the process of growing in love even if it may end up in two people not being together It is all about making those selfless sacrifices whenever required wanting the best for each other amidst all the challenges and adversities After all Life is not a fairy tale and the process is not always smooth and meets expectations And La La Land is an essay on love and passion in all its glory and on understanding the boundary between Dream and Reality,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9157985/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2018,La La Land Loveliness,La La Land is the type of movie I hate starting to watch It s not because I hate movie musicals quite the opposite in fact What I dislike intensely is those films that use the old Hollywood movie genres like those old screwball comedies or the old musicals as a basis and then proceed to get them wrong Down With Love anyone That s exactly what I thought would happen with this movie I couldn t have been more wrong The film as well as being visually stunning is full of characters that you want to spend time with especially that of Emma Stone Her character Mia is played fantastically To my mind this performance from Stone ranks with her best That s not to say that Ryan Gosling isn t also good because he is The songs if not completely in the style of the old Hollywood musicals given the film s contemporary setting stay true to their essence and the story is engaging too Much like Pirates of the Caribbean and The Artist breathed life into long dead genres I think La La Land will give those people who don t really give movie musicals a second glance a new appreciation La La Land is a delightful modern movie musical and I m sorry I ever doubted it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4215576/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2017,Beautiful and unpredictable masterpiece,Boy I am glad I got to watch this at the cinema because it is definitely worth watching there I want to describe La La Land as a visually beautiful non clich romantic movie that not only has a stunning love story but also goes much deeper into topics like Dreams and Music while the movie stays rooted in reality which gives a lot of credit to the title La La Land I found it quite easy to understand why and that is exactly what I personally like about a movie of this scale It is capable of telling a story about difficult characters in difficult situations and explaining this in a simple way to the ordinary viewer This is why I think it stowed away so many Oscars at the Academy Awards and also why it received so many nominations I will just mention a few of the obvious ones here just to awaken your movie hunger a little if you haven t watched it yet Emma Stone did really deserve that Oscar for a portrayal of the lost actress in L A of epic proportions Ryan Gosling was nice to see as well in a more sophisticated role where he must have worked a lot harder with the character in this movie than some of his other typical bad boy roles In addition I also do feel the need to greatly applaud the entire music soundtrack in this film as it underlines the beautiful imagery and scenery of the movie Behind the camera it is obvious that magic was worked here too I mean talk about experimental camera angles and zooming I haven t seen anything like it since Birdman So in conclusion what Damien Chazelle created here as the director and won the Oscar for Best achievement in Directing is truly a remarkably beautiful timeless picture that will most likely be worth re watching again and again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3665019/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2021,La La Land,La La Land is one great musical in a every sense of word and even if i liked some more i still think that this one was also one greatly made and directed film with two great acts from Gosling and Stone who had brilliant chemistry between them and their characters were also very releatable and real with the world that is full of problems and hard decisions Story was also sometimes sweet and towards the end sad but that two thing combine withe ach other in a great way La La Land is one of better musicals that i saw,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6434891/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2017,"Overspilling with artistic originality, class and wit, ""La La Land"" promises to be one of the greatest films of this generation",La La Land is utterly wonderful a remarkable blend of romantic idealism with the harshness of reality Damien Chazelle illustrates the Los Angeles setting delightfully capturing the everyday difficulties of life within love and the external challenges it entails with sharp confidence yet absolute serenity Exploding with beautiful visual contrasts expertly demonstrating the director s vision of the romanticised average dreamer s lifestyle La La Land emerges as undeniably one of the defining movies of the decade if not the century And if not that the new pinnacle of both the romantic and musical genres alike All singing all dancing La La Land boasts some of the best choreographed dance scenes in popular culture of recent memory and huge credit is deserved to choreographer Mandy Moore who has managed to orchestrate multiple intensely exhilarating movements that so beautifully complement Chazelle s chosen one shot style Collectively the filmmakers have successfully managed to transport the viewers right back to the classic ages of Hollywood to the era of musicals playing with nostalgia so respectfully as head cinematographer Linus Sandgren provides us with shots of such magnificence it truly is a modern art film of unprecedented prosperity The film contains a glorious soundtrack written by Chazelle s Harvard University friend Justin Hurwitz who manages to grasp the fantastical nature of the film excellently The songs remain resonant after the credits have rolled each of them classics in the making which is exactly what one would hope for in a fresh new musical Everything in this movie conjugates to form this masterful outcome with extraordinary spontaneity nothing ever feels rushed or forced as each scene flows from one to the next naturally driven by the dynamic character force and chemistry between lead actors Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling Stone shines the brightest proudly demonstrating her ability to perform sing and dance throughout thus completely nailing each scene she is in She feels perfectly fitted for this part handpicked by Chazelle after he saw her in Cabaret Their respective commitment to these roles is also highly commendable Gosling went through intensive training and learned jazz piano in just three months and listening to the outcome it is rather difficult to believe judging by how eloquently he plays Both look like they are enjoying themselves immensely dancing and singing with such fluency and passion which reflects onto the screen sensationally And that is ultimately what makes this film so great it s the dedication of the people involved to making something that one can simply enjoy and appreciate in its own right It is easy to see that Chazelle has been dreaming of doing this project all his life and the product of his fantasies is an outstanding spectacle of pure joy a genuine heartfelt translation of stage onto screen done with such admirable grace it has certainly earned every shred of praise it gets and much much more,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621468/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2017,Where did the Golden Age of Hollywood go?,La La Land is an American romantic musical comedy drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle in 2016 After its success at the 74th Golden Globe Awards I couldn t give a go by the musical that set a record and won seven awards including Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy Best Director Best Actor Best Actress Best Screenplay Best Original Score and best Original Song What can I say after finally watching this film Well best wishes to the New Hollywood Era Your Golden Age has gone The idea of recreating and breathing a new life in outstanding musicals of Golden Age if Hollywood turned out a complete fiasco La La Land is full of weird clich s awful mise en sc ne poorly rehearsed dancing actions and doubtful twists in the plot Furthermore the production department failed to make outstanding shots as well as edit them in a right way with a good taste I won t even start to complain about bad color correction and sound Seriously For the budget in thirty million dollars they couldn t produce clear recording that is supposed to be a number one factor in musical Bad for them The first scene on the highway gave me full understanding that this musical is just a frustration The dancers probably failed to join one of the Step Up movies and were redirected to La La Land as a joke Choreography is terrible when the viewer can t see it as a whole action or focus on main characters Choreography in La La Land is more than terrible I was laughing Not in a good way And again it is one of the main parts of such genre as musical The plot itself is boring and slow There is no progression and no drive that brings the will to continue watching it Half of actions and scenes were added and shown with no particular reasons to show them Actually there is no evident chemistry between the two protagonists What is kind of shameful especially because of the fact that it is not the first project where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play together Come on guys show some love for each other Some drama at least Their relationship on stage was more comedic than tremulous Acting One of the strangest things for me is to watch the Golden Globe s Best Actress in a movie where she can barely act On the one hand she was supposed to be a failed actress who went her journey and reached her goals But on the other hand Emma Stone haven t done a good job in the general scenes also Regarding Ryan Gosling his passion for Jazz was overacted as he has no passion at all Besides as a musician myself It was a pain watching his performances It was so obvious that he just can t play piano I almost closed my eyes so I can only lose myself in music As well as in their dancing scenes It looked too lame To sup up La La Land is a pure frustration mixed with some dramatic comedy I can t call it a musical with a capital M Actually I can t call it a musical at all No good music no good sound no good dancing,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623250/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,La La Land,Recently filmmaker Ridley Scott admitted that he found the current state of cinema to be declining and even himself admitted to being asked numerous times to be a director or somehow involved in any number of superhero related movies Thankfully to this day he has not done so and while some of his choices as a director or producer tend to be a little perplexing and leaving the viewer wondering why he did said project I think he may be on to something with the general statement that cinema does seem to be declining in quality and what would have played on the big screen even 30 to 40 years ago is not the same today and that same level of expertise artistry and quality just doesn t seem to be there a lot of the time Jean Luc Godard once famously said that cinema began with D W Griffith and ends with Abbas Kiarostami With the unfortunate passing of Kiarostami this past year does that mean cinema is definitely gone for good In some ways yes but then again on the other hand you have a film like La La Land which is very much in the same kind of style and spirit of the movies of yesterday while being completely original on it s own so maybe in a sense there is still hope for today s cinema yet Within the first ten to fifteen minutes of La La Land I really was not anticipating that I would end up liking the film as much as I did The film started out with bubbly and very much pop flavoured dance and musical numbers that seemed so happy and bright that I felt that if the whole movie was this upbeat and sunny than I probably should have seen something else at the theatre instead because what I was witnessing was so sickeningly sweet that it would even turn most kids who grow up on that stuff off of it Thankfully however the trailers I had seen for the film as well as everything else I knew about it proved to be true and that wasn t the kind of film this was going to be Instead we do have a film that in it s own way is trying to recapture the magic and charm of the movies that generations ago people grew up on and films and music that we should be watching today instead of the countless hours we throw away on mindless entertainment and games with no redeeming qualities whatsoever The film loves old Hollywood from the movies to the actors to the big budget musicals of yesteryear It also pays homage to music such as the jazz classics that I know any die hard jazz fan would go head over feet over In a sense those also attuned to movies with a more European feel think the French New Wave of the 50 s and 60 s will also most likely find a lot to like here as well because this film is not simply just plagiarizing these movies and cultural icons of old but instead borrows from their styles and techniques and as I said earlier they make a movie all their own using those trademark pieces of style and music and they do so in a way that is pulled off to perfection and will leave even the hardest of film critics longing for movies from decades ago pretty pleased at what still proves to be talent and good work with movies and filmmakers in this current generation The film is more than anything else a love story between two people who often at first seem completely at odds with each other but with any good romance sometimes the opposites do attract and can lead to magic The film also incorporates old Hollywood and the fact that many classic films and even styles of music are dying because today s generation is different People are now so into themselves or their electronic devices that they no longer have the interest or curiosity about the true arts anymore I once had a film professor acquaintance who told me that in his university film class that the students he had did not want to see older movies but things that were current or modern at least to them How incredibly sad La La Land reaches out to those lost arts and shows us that these forms of art definitely need to stay alive and need to be rediscovered by each and every generation The film also details the struggles of trying to make it in the arts scene and with all the rejections and disappointments you get sometimes it definitely is hard to keep your chin up However these characters have perseverance and will give it everything they got and ultimately prove that dreams can happen and sometimes with a little help you get not just get what you want but maybe something better is lying just around the corner for you La La Land has a lot of style the musical numbers are all very well done and it s a film with some great character development and it truly will be relatable to this generation but countless others as well This is a film of originality that proves that Hollywood is not dead yet nor is film and we might just have a few surprises left from some up and coming filmmakers so with films like La La Land Hollywood and film is still alive and thriving for now at least which I think is a great place to

15 January 2017,What A Lovely Night Indeed,MINOR VAGUE SPOILERS BELOW Chazelle s La La Land not only succeeds at being an outright love letter to the golden age of Hollywood and be able to convey the magic it had but also succeeds at being a grounded profound and genuine depiction of how we aspire for dreams The film shows another side of how we try to achieve success or how we essentially try to be the best in our craft and passion just like in his previous film Whiplash 2014 but what s so special about this film is the fact that the dreams of the characters give way for their love to flourish but at the same time it inevitably sets them apart The classical and nostalgic backdrop of the film compliments the dream like aesthetic and feel that drips in every scene From being presented in Cinemascope to the the Ingrid Bergman wallpaper to the breathtakingly fitting colorful color palettes the musical numbers that make you wonder if this film truly is set in the 21st century and the dialogue that is reminiscent of the usual golden age superstars like James Dean and Humphrey Bogart All in all this film breathes an atmosphere that truly makes it feel like we are dreaming along with the protagonists and it also makes you want to go back to the times where films weren t bloated with excessive blockbusters or piffle cash grabs and instead bring in the uplifting or melancholy magic that they should truly present Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring in their best performances yet with a triple threat esque nature to their performances just like the legendary actors from the golden age of cinema as both of them truly knew how to sing dance and most of all act The simple nuances each character bring to screen even in the smallest detail of visual comedy which people rarely do nowadays or visual story telling in each scene that makes the audience learn so much about a certain character with just one look or change in their face this is real acting show and don t tell This is the same reason why we remember Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart so much from Casablanca because they did not need to convey their love through oblivious dialogue but through one glance at each other and we know it tells countless stories We immediately know Stone s character Mia s aspirations as she glances at an actress and see a strong emotion present in her face she didn t need to say anything more or outright say This is my dream through some sort of monologue This is tremendously subtle and well done acting that we rarely see nowadays The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and stunning in each scene the locations are incredibly iconic and nostalgic and the back drop of Los Angeles especially at night gives the movie an unique feel that will definitely remind you of the golden ages The story and plot is quite simple yet layered enough to be such a universal story that anyone can fully grasp or have some sort of relation to Sure it tells a faithful love story to the usual tropes and stories we saw in the 40s or 50s but it tells it through the lens of so many specific and realistic aspects of life The use of jazz once again by Chazelle just like in Whiplash and of course acting as a profession helps layer the story to a more grounded level their dreams Another way to view this film is to see how it may not have been entirely a love story after all Sure there is no denying the chemistry and love brought by the two DID EXIST but in the end it was a story about conflict and compromise and about how sometimes compromise is walking away from something for each person s benefit no matter how hard it is The film presents that love can be used as a tool to help you achieve your dreams and how even at the end if not everything ends up the way it is you acknowledge and find compromise in that arbitrary feeling and connection of love that helped you in the way In the film Whiplash the protagonist had to leave his girlfriend because he thinks that love was a distraction to the goal he needed to achieve but in La La Land they explore how love CAN also help you reach the goals you want in life But in the end just like most things in life you cannot have everything and this is why this film is such an honest and inspiring depiction of people who want to aspire for something In the end La La Land wasn t just a love letter to the golden age of Hollywood it was also a love letter to the fools who dream it s a love letter to anyone who wants to find someone in the crowd who can lift them off the ground it s a love letter to anyone who may have been discouraged or disheartened in achieving something it s a love letter to anyone who feels like dancing and singing see themselves flying off with their dreams Verdict 9 9 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619800/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2017,Charming BUT,I can only give LaLa Land a 6 With all the hype I really thought I would be more entertained The story has been told so many times The dance scenes are fun not quite old Hollywood but close The special affects were fun like the dancing in the stars actually quite beautiful even though you can tell how they did it Very little dialogue and that was OK but it was missing something to me cannot quite put my finger on it The colorful costumes were fun the music was good but I do not think I will be humming any song tomorrow John Legend was good and he did write some good songs for the movie So to me it was an interesting movie and if the Oscars had a musical best movie award it would probably get it since there is little competition I do not see it as a best movie for 2016 I do not think I will be thinking of this film in the next week and to me when I am still thinking of it later then it has stirred something in me to make it memorable I know it took a long time to get this film made and I respect the diligence of the director to do that But it just did not do it for me Sorry I think I may be in the minority but that is my opinion,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623966/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2017,"An indecisive picture, pointlessly drifting between genres",Throughout the picture Damien Chazelle doesn t take a decision on what kind of picture to show The film appears to be a random collage from a number of chapters from some cyclopedia about film making Being rapidly dragged through diverse genres heartlessly knitted together it s hard to get emotionally bound with the story or with the characters in the picture I felt like a 1st grade student watching a training movie presenting a sketch of different genre styles The base story a Becoming of Age story is obtrusively filled with all kinds of styles I was permanently asking myself Why is he doing this now What s his motivation What s the story s motivation For example I guess the musical elements where supposed to convey love emotion But why have the actors been so unemotionally even dismissively playing it What s been the reason for taking so much time for conveying that the Mia character is an actress That fact doesn t add to the story at all There is an utterly awesome long lasting uncut scene It s a performance highlight But why on earth is it applied to a negligible chat between lovers Why are all the musical artists depicted in the film so emotionless I understand the jazz club scene as a reminiscence to the jazz club scene in The Glenn Miller Story But how dull is the La La Land version compared to that Speaking of dull The score was extremely boring Cheap jazz licks carelessly arranged In the musical scenes I was very much in doubt whether the musical text was meant to be serious or ironic I was asking myself Is this a Fourth Wall movie or was this a movie with a story to cling to All in all to me the movie appeared to be some kind of a bachelor s academic thesis And I don t understand what makes the movie worth a nomination for even one single Academy Award,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3638434/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2023,good actors not so good movie,I did have high hopes for this one Stone and Gosling are likable and have charisma and are certainly not lacking in talent but despite feeling Stone got the emotional range of the character right and feeling bad for her at her lowest moments overall the movie doesn t work for me Maybe had it not been a musical it would have worked better I didn t feel they got the singing and dancing down pat it was a weakness Stone is good in so many things and Gosling has proven he has more range and a flair for comedy so it s not something I say with any pleasure I just feel it missed too many marks I also don t have a problem with the ending it s not something I felt ruined the whole movie or like some feel it was good until we knew how they ended up I actually thought it made more sense that way,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9225873/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2023,A classic.,Perhaps it s rather apt for me to admit as an audience member I wasn t actually ready for this movie when it originally hit cinemas in 2016 as I can remember bailing mid way through upon my first watch mistakenly writing off the feature as an insufferably romanticised unbearably naive celebration of America s capitalist relationship with artistry lensed through rose tinted goggles tailored for gullible theatre buffs who would mistake the catchy music for genuine meaning yet inspired by the filmmaker s latest release Babylon which I utterly loved far more direct in its unrepentant cynicism also ahead of its time I thought I d revisit Damien Chazelle s previous project realised to my shame poetically mirroring my relationship with La La Land the purpose of this narrative is to explore what happens when you meet the right person at completely the wrong time Emma Stone plays Mia a wannabe actress with an unquenchable thirst for fame Ryan Gosling portrays the co lead Sebastian a passionate eccentric musician with big ambitions the duo are each in possession of the raw talents required to make a star the two of whom seem destined to be together from their chance first encounter journeying to Hollywood with hopes of making a name for themselves both creatives desire to pursue their dreams yet their separate goals despite being similar in nature regarding the expressiveness of one s self through performance seem to be at odds with the other s development Therein lies the catalyst for the film s thematic conflict motivational driving force to analyse within the context of a love story the price we pay for success to question whether it s truly a worthwhile sacrifice Plus the narrative subversively challenges usual formulaic tropes by using a tale about love to question whether we can adore our craft more than we do ourselves each other when one can rarely have the two simultaneously Not only that but utilising jazz as a reference throughout the reason for its appeal as a means to reinforce the message of the plot s intention by drawing parallels between one the other Utterly inspired resulting in a movie that s gloriously focused in the eloquent articulation of its profound wonderfully realised delivery Not to mention the glitz the glamour Linus Sandgren s astonishing cinematography Meticulously cultivated perfection,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8872039/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2016,I saw it with my parents and they loved it!,LA LA LAND Five Stars Out of Five The critically acclaimed romantic comedy drama musical from writer director Damien Chazelle who also performed both duties on 2014 s WHIPLASH my favorite movie of that year The film tells the story a jazz pianist that falls in love with a struggling actress while they both try to get by in Los Angeles The movie stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in their third film together playing lovers after CRAZY STUPID LOVE and GANGSTER SQUAD and it costars John Legend Rosemarie DeWitt and J K Simmons in a cameo appearance he won an Oscar for his performance in WHIPLASH On top of being almost unanimously praised by critics it was also named one of the ten best movies of the year by the American Film Institute and it s expected to likely win Best Picture at next year s Academy Awards I really enjoyed it Mia Stone and Sebastian Gosling are both struggling artists trying to make a living while doing what they really love in Los Angeles Sebastian is a jazz musician who attempts to pay the bills by playing bars and parties while Mia is an aspiring actress who gets by serving coffee to actors on the set of a movie studio The two meet and don t immediately take a liking to each other but eventually mutual attraction appears to grow between them They then take turns supporting each other in their different passions while attempting to maintain a relationship Chazelle is a drummer who wrote LA LA LAND back in 2010 when he was still just an aspiring filmmaker All three of his movies including 2009 s GUY AND MADELINE ON A PARK BENCH which is also a musical focus heavily on jazz music I think this is a very passionate subject for him as is film and it s because of this strong heartfelt passion that his films become such great masterpieces This is an old fashioned soon to be classic musical I saw it with my parents and they loved it Because this genre of film is so rare I think it will win Best Picture it s definitely one of my favorites of the year Gosling and Stone are both fantastic in it and they have beautiful chemistry together once again the romance between their characters is both very touching and believable as well It s a great film Watch our movie review show MOVIE TALK at  youtu be ufnweLGYJ4,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3611825/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2016,Strenuously enchanting,Mandatory fun were the first words I scribbled in my notebook after sitting through Damien Chazelle s oppressively whimsical throwback This year s The Artist La La Land is another hollow exercise striving to be a simulacrum of a thing while pretty much missing the whole point of what it s trying to replicate Yet much like Michel Hazanavicius instantly forgotten 2011 Oscar darling 2016 s presumptive Best Picture winner has inspired a bizarrely defensive cult of otherwise intelligent level headed people blathering uncritically about movie magic while hurling personal attacks at we bitter folks who dare not adore their beloved confection In the weeks since being underwhelmed by La La Land I ve been told I have no heart no love for film and that I must be unable to experience joy So basically it s a superhero movie for middlebrows The strain shows from the opening number in which commuters stuck in gridlock on the Los Angeles freeway jump from their cars and begin belting out one of the film s many unmemorable tunes Chazelle sneaks his edits inside of whip pans to give the illusion that this is all taking place in a single unbroken shot But his time may have better been spent working on the choreography which seems to be comprised mainly of the dancers throwing their arms up in the air and then putting them back down again As with the Full Metal Julliard histrionics of his previous picture Whiplash there s no pleasure in the filmmaking here just the blood sweat and gritted teeth of Chazelle s self conscious virtuosity Every frame of this film cries out Are you not entertained Five minutes in I wanted to pat the poor guy on the head give him a cookie and tell him it s okay to chill out a little bit Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone star as Sebastian and Mia two mismatched lovers struggling to be real artists in a city rotten with commercial compromise He s a jazz pianist one so committed to his art he gets himself fired from gigs all over town for refusing to play standards and improvising like a lunatic instead On their first date Sebastian takes Mia to a jazz club and mansplains the music to her in that especially insufferable way white boys have of putting people off the entire art form It should also be noted that for all of Sebastian s fanaticism he appears to have no qualms about loudly talking over a live performance Mia wants to be an actress and claims she s an outcast because she loves old Hollywood movies yet strangely all we see of this is her lying about a film she hasn t seen There s not really a character here just lots of vague idealism that Emma Stone s considerable charisma somehow manages to make watchable As we ve seen in films both decent Crazy Stupid Love and unwatchable Gangster Squad she and Gosling are enormously charming together Their chemistry props up La La Land for far longer than it should particularly as these two struggle mightily with the singing and dancing Speaking as someone who still feels sorry for Russell Crowe and Pierce Brosnan I ll never figure out why filmmakers continue to insist on casting actors with no musical theatre training in musicals Were Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick really that busy Anne Hathaway not returning phone calls Why go with the one guy from The Mickey Mouse Club who didn t dance or sing Chazelle studiously mimics the candy colored palates and elaborate soundstages of classic musicals and ticks off all the expected references without understanding that the pleasures of those old movies lie in their elegance and relaxed grace Everything s about exertion with this dude The writer director s monastic bent comes up again in what becomes the movie s misguided central conflict John Legend pops up as a hugely successful musician who hires Sebastian to play keyboards in his touring band But this dream gig isn t artistically pure enough for Mia who attends an arena show at which much mockery is made of the audience for enjoying it Pretty sure I m not the first to point out that Legend s band is treated with the derision of Ghost World s Blueshammer Okay so it was here that I really started to hate Mia Her guy s landed a job most musicians would kill for and she s chewing his broke ass out for not somehow magically finding the money to open his own jazz club instead She s also still a freaking barista at this point And let s not even get into the ugly optics of the two white leads with middling musical talent being held up as paragons of artistic integrity while John freakin Legend is presented as some sort of sellout loser He s also the only black guy in this movie that s allegedly about jazz which at least is one more brother than was in Chazelle s last film about jazz This is progress I guess La La Land lunges for the bittersweet melancholy of Jacques Demy s The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg but has no interest in that movie s heartbreaking economic realities The super entitled Sebastian and Mia have amazing career opportunities fall out of the sky into their laps and both get pretty much everything they ve ever wanted in the end without having to compromise or work very hard The final ten minutes of La La Land are undeniably effective just like the ludicrous ending of Whiplash was because Chazelle knows how to work an audience over until you say uncle As for the dopey received wisdom that nobody s making movies in this genre anymore on my ten best list last year were both Chi Raq and Magic Mike XXL two musicals full of more joy innovation and imagination in any given number than you ll find in the entirety of La La Land s labored freeze dried replica,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601921/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2019,A poor attempt to capture the essence of earlier musicals,I should say that I stopped watching after one hour That was enough The film still hadn t started Apart from the fact that the music is mediocre the real problem lies in the lack of authenticity of the characters She is supposed to be a down on her luck actress and he is a down on his luck jazz pianist The trouble is they fail to portray this vulnerability because there is none of it to portray If you think about Billy Bigelow in Carousel he puffs himself up and puts on veneer of bravado because underneath he believes he s a nobody In the end this is his undoing In La La Land the two main characters are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling rather than the characters they are supposed to be portraying I don t buy into the characters at all She lives in a nice place They both have cars They go to nice places if they want to There is no sense of feeling disenfranchised or smashed by life There are no songs anything remotely like If I loved you Feed the birds The sound of music High school musical is way better,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4682361/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2016,Where is the talent?,The fact that this movie is rated 8 9 out of 10 and Chicago is 7 2 and Moulin Rouge is 7 6 is literally beyond me Although I like Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as actors they really should not be casted for musicals Neither of them can dance or sing properly no matter how much they tried and I bet they did I wonder if anyone here giving this movie a 8 or a 9 has watched Chicago or Moulin Rouge Both had incredible Cinematography plots AND had lead actors who could sing dance the hell out of their movies And now here come Ryan and Emma who are mediocre at best at this musical I m kind of disappointing at their casting as lead roles because I think that with different lead actors two who can actually sing and dance this movie would ve been breathtaking On another note it was a charming film with beautiful cinematography and a pleasant vibe I did not mind the blurs as someone mentioned or thought there were plot holes I would recommend it to other but only to realise that Emma and Ryan should ve not been cast,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3605934/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2017,People were leaving the cinema..,and i wish i did the same This was nothing A movie designed to please the academy awards committee in a self glorifying tribute to themselves A remembrance to the movies they used to make and watch in the good ol days By Hollywood for Hollywood There was no story I was waiting for the movie to start I wanted to leave SO bad but i didn t want to ruin the experience for the other people i went to the Cinema with turns out they were all doing the same thing And when we left the the cinema i heard people saying it s the most boring piece of crap they had seen in a long while I m not a buffoon honestly i like a good musical I grew up watching Fred Astaire movies with my grandma This was not that This movie is living on a hype Don t buy in to it Oh and if you kinda went oh ehm wtf in the flying scene you re not alone,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3657791/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2016,One of The Best Movies Ever Made,La La Land is one of the greatest movies of 2016 It has career defining performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone the highlight being Stone The Cinematography and Music are the other two highlights both being some of the best of the past decade The movie is a great homage to old musicals like Signin In The Rain and does this extremely well opening with things like cinema scope and technicolor In addition the dancing has some of the best choreography for dancing in a movie since movies like Signin in The Rain It should get nominated for best cinematography best picture best actress best director best production design best actor best original song and best original score 10 10 go see it now,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3604157/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2017,Hollywood Escapism,It seems likely that La La Land is going to continue to pick up a rack of wins during the award season This alone makes it worth watching as you can either agree or disagree with the awards panels around the globe For those people who don t know it is a musical that harks back to the classical musicals of the mid 20th century The main storyline of the movie is the relationship between Mia Emma Stone and Sebastian Ryan Gosling To be fair the two leads throw themselves into the movie and there is certainly chemistry between them To be honest there was probably less music and dance than I expected The movie is a little too sweet for my tastes and I didn t especially care about what happened to any of the characters Anyway you need to see the film and see what you think as there s no doubt that a lot of other people rate it extremely highly,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3636688/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2017,Decent Movie- More Fitting in BollyWood than Hollywood,BollyWood is the nickname of the Indian film Industry largely centered in Bombay now called Mumbai It produces a steady stream of pisi kaka every year So much so that it is in Guiness book of World Records in some category Most of BollyWood films are in that sense musicals because it has a lit of music and dance and they are absurd the song and dance sequence but cleverly done With that out of the way I think the reader can figure out why I chose the above heading If you have seen the movie not sure why are you reading it although I read reviews after I seen a movie to just check out what other people think and if you have not I would suggest you do go watch it I have been meaning to ever since it came out and been postponing it because I wanted to be sufficiently depressed so that if the movie sucked which it kinda did on many levels then my day could not get any worse And it did not It is a strange movie Almost like Seinfeld A TV show about nothing Although there is the loose connection with one s dreams how dreams are almost difficult to pursue bla blah blah and of course ends with the hackneyed clich where boy meets girl boy and girl fall in love boy and girl go separate ways and boy and girl meets 5 years later to think what could have been Boring So BollyWood Emma Stone is not even pretty but she grows on you and looks cute in the middle Gosling is in equal parts good looking good actor and does a decent job Neither his performance nor Emma Stone s or for that movie as a whole is nothing to write home about So aptly if I may use a symbolism summarized in Emma Stone s Mia s phone call to her mother describing Sebastian her new boyfriend he is not anyone yet There are hardly any other characters of any significance in the movie The guy who plays Kevin or Keith besides perpetuating the clich White Boys Can t Jump You have to have Black People if you are talking Jazz do not see what was his role in the movie I hear he is some kind of a musician of some fame My advice would be not that he needs it or cares that do not give up your day job Talk about Product placement Acting is ordinary sets are great and THAT dance sequence with the Canary Yellow Dress which is plastered all over the promo material is really good Besides that not much Why it is so much of a craze I would not know Why 14 nominations who knows I don t get to nominate And frankly who cares besides the folks who made the movie It does not deserve the hate did not even know it had hate till I stumbled along the boards nor does it deserve 14 Oscar nomination or 7 Golden Globes surpassing One Flew Over Cuckoo s Nest seriously My wife watched the movie with her girl friends on release day and described it as Magical I knew then I better not rush to watch it It is a chick flick but with a sub text The queen of unrequited love is the man How BollyWood A solid 6,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628844/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2017,"Sublime, Beautiful, and Award Worthy",There are several scenes in La La Land that have no dialogue only a dreamy background score and the actors expressions guide you through The beautiful thing here is that you don t miss the spoken word at all This and many other things make La La Land a subliminal watch It is a gorgeous movie full of heart and soul and I loved every minute of it The film is a musical journey about an aspiring actress and an undervalued jazz musician who meet at a low point in their lives and keep running into each other until sparks fly The story traces their life as they find themselves and pursue their dreams whilst falling in love The musical genre isn t my favorite odd I know since I adore Indian movies but this isn t just about the song and dance routine though that s an integral part of the film The movie starts with rush hour in LA and people from all walks of life sing their way through the chaos This first number sets a tone that s rare for movies nowadays joy However the movie isn t all happy the characters grow face rejection fight but interestingly the mood is never bleak Its charm is infectious and leaves you wanting to tap your feet Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and perfectly cast as Mia and Sebastian Ms Stone delights as a struggling actress whose eyes speak volumes and who can make the most trivial of activities seem noteworthy At the risk of sounding too cheesy she is the heart while Mr Gosling is the soul of this gorgeous masterpiece He is charming without arrogance He is funny slightly broken and good a lethal combination Both complement each other marvelously and the chemistry they ve built over the years can almost be touched There are ample songs in the narrative of course and they are enough to whet the palate without leaving you feeling burdened The singing isn t perfect but we can t expect our actors to do everything flawlessly The choreography and the ease with which the characters dance is applaudable As the seasons change you notice brilliantly executed shifts in our leads without ever losing the essence of the movie There s a fine screenplay at work here Bravo Damien Chazelle your vision is glorious Watch this film you ll find ample reasons to love it I left the theatre feeling a little giddy with a smile on face What more could I ask for  stuffiwatchblog wordpress com 2017 01 05 la la land,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3613037/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,Welcome to the Gosling & Stone show,La La Land was the toast of the town this past Awards season earning scores of nominations and six Academy Awards But while critics loved the film to death and most of the movie going audience was cool with it too there s no denying that it s a schlockfest that s high on itself and its pretentiousness Despite this La La Land clearly benefits from the vision of Damien Chazelle who recognized an opportunity to bring back the musical genre in a way that hearkens back to films from decades ago From the opening freeway sequence to the many impromptu song and dance moments scattered throughout there s a lot of commotion going on This musical whiplash might be interesting to some but it can be very jarring for those who are not bonafide fans of the genre Even though these musical numbers might seem somewhat all over the place they are actually a useful device that help guide the audience through the story between two struggling Los Angeles transplants Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone While annoying City of Stars is the song that acts as a needle that threads everything together But yes La La Land is basically the Gosling Stone show Both are major stars in their own right and together they do bring a good deal of chemistry to the screen But when a film relies too heavily on its leads it can have some weak spots in other areas For La La Land this includes the fact that there s pretty much no supporting cast John Legend s role is an elongated cameo and there s really no there there for a plot Sure the somewhat straightforward progression of the film is thrown for a loop in the climax which is refreshing but it s still not the mark of a first rate film La La Land may not have won best picture but it won enough critical acclaim that was mostly based on what some were hoping the film could be not what it actually was It s not the worst thing to come out in 2016 but it s also far from the greatest,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3778695/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2017,"For dying jazz, brilliant choreography , beautiful cinematography and those who dream",La la land isn t just a movie it s an experience to remember Damien Chazelle s musical romance is a dazzling beauty that will never be forgotten The movie is about the love affair between a jazz pianist and an actress who are struggling hard to chase their dreams Through the cycle of seasons their love affair develops and their lives too keep on moving but their dreams could hardly be fulfilled in the city of stars Finally as Sebastian starts to settle while Mia could make even that much they are ripped apart each after their own dreams The movie has moments to remember the first time when Mia and Sebastian met and through some beautiful dance moves they exchange what they feel about each other it was o so beautiful Another favourite moment of mine was when Mia saw Sebastian five years later both being equally successful then and Sebastian played their love note over the piano and Mia imagined how their life had been if they both would ve been together The cinematography and the set design here was something to remember Talking about the screenplay unlike most other romantic dramas La la land races away in 120 minutes The music was excellent with meaningful lyrics City of stars being the special one Finally La la land leaves with a message To chase dreams one must make a sacrifice To handle so much of things in a fashionable way Damien Chazelle must be applauded for a wonderful direction In two hours La la land offers more than you would expect Almost everything you can expect from a film This musical masterpiece will be remembered even in years to come,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3690542/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2016,"Old school Hollywood romance, a classic musical.",So this turned out to be a good one Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are two people who find each other in the craziness of La La Land the perfect star cross lovers situation as Gosling plays a jazz musician dreaming of opening a pure Jazz club and Stone is an actress just trying to get a part and their brief encounter turns into a love affair Not really that big of a fan of musicals Just the idea that at any moment the cast can break out into song and dance I just find a little annoying But I really liked the production design of La La Land It s just so beautiful and gives off everything that you d find in golden age Hollywood The art direction was made to look glamorous to show off the magic of La La land The photography gave homage to the movies of yesteryear The story was perfectly basic something you seen many times before which was used to enhanced the beauty of how the story was told And the cast Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did a descent job trying to be Fred and Ginger The two have chemistry Gosling was my favorite out of the two I think I ve only seen him do really intense stuff so it threw me off watching him do comedy but the offset only made it funnier As a musical it works for me overall I found one or two songs classical but the rest was more of an overall feeling No single song steps out as much as everything works so well together to enhance telling the story Filmed by the guy who made Whiplash La La Land has a small role for JK Simmons who won an Oscar for his role in that film I still like Whiplash far better but this was a great follow up http cinemagardens com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3597543/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2017,"Boring, Actually",I m giving this film a three for the opening scene The rest was room temperature unsalted oatmeal I tried to like Ryan and Emma s characters but they were empty vessels partly due to bad writing and partly due to their lack of commitment to the roles Ryan looked like he was about to soil his undies at any moment whether because he was righteously defending his bachelorhood or jazz his go to expression appeared to be constipated Emma whose face looked oddly proportioned in tight close ups was a wisp of a character ungrounded and therefore unbelievable The aspirational lecturing about jazz and watching Rebel Without a Cause came across as pedantic Overall it all felt tepid and safe and soft shoe i e no passion I was bored and felt time weigh heavily on this film The music was bland as well dreamy goopy overly sweet generic and also boring I can t say I would ever be inclined to recommend this film to anyone for any reason It just never got going I actually can t believe it won as many awards at the Golden Globes as it did Now I understand why Ryan had such a look of surprise or was it constipation Who cares,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621762/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2016,Like Films from The Golden Age,La La Land is one of the most different and entertaining movies of recent times I have ever seen The acting and the melodious musical numbers mesmerized me The colorful setting and dresses also add to the cinematic flair The story is about two aspiring people with dreams of what they want to become Sebastian Ryan Gosling and Mia Emma Stone Sebastian is an exceptional jazz pianist who wants to revive jazz with his own jazz club which he dreams to make and Mia dreams to be an exceptional actress The two meet under random circumstances somewhat rudely Drawn together by their aspiration to do what they love they fall for each other However their dreams conflict with their love for each other Ryan Gosling excellently expresses his love for jazz and Mia He enacts the piano playing part exceptionally well and it really looks like he is a gifted jazz pianist Emma Stone is a show stealer as Mia with her expressive eyes aspirations and acting skills especially during the scenes where her character auditions and her chemistry with Ryan Gosling is amazing John Legend as Keith utilizes his short on screen time well portraying a man with a different taste in jazz which Sebastian doesn t like and he happens to be a good friend in need Damien Chazelle s direction keeps the movie flowing from one beautiful musical number to the next Mandy Moore s exceptional choreography charms us particularly in A Lovely Night which was done in one shot on a hilltop on Sunset and includes amazing dancing from the main actors My favorite scene is the scene in the planetarium with creative visuals such as Sebastian and Mia flying in the sky dancing Sebastian and Mia s dresses in the movie are spectacular and some of the best I have seen in a movie The film is also shot in cinemascope which gives it the vibe of many golden Hollywood musicals The movie has a positive message about Mia and Sebastian never giving up their dreams Despite multiple failures Mia still pursues her dreams about being an actress and the same with Sebastian about starting a jazz club I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 The only inappropriate thing about the movie is some of the language but that is infrequent This is a movie which everyone will enjoy This film opens in theaters on December 25 2016 so go and check it out for a unique musical unlike any other Reviewed by Arjun N KIDS FIRST Film Critic For more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3611821/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2018,Young Love,A movie that should have won picture of the year La La Land is a movie about hope It is a love story and big dreams Sometimes you don t end up where you thought you would but in the end it is the experiences that make the journey worth while I love the tender scenes of this young couple in love It gives you a hope for a better tomorrow and not to worry in the end it all works out,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4210183/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,Theme song,FINALLY a movie with a theme song like days of yore It s been over 20 years since a movie has had a nice melodic theme running thru the film Something you can actually hum when one leaves the theater So tired of these rap type songs with no melodies whatsoever Just a bunch of noise and lyrics that can t be understood or even heard As for the movie itself excellent Good story with innovative scenes and alternative story lines For non singers dancers both leads do well Let s hope they start bringing back old fashioned musicals once again Enough of the junk that s produced today with all special effects car crashes explosions and super type heroes Not to mention recent movies that use the F word like it s nothing nudity and graphic violence No I m not a prude but let s leave the rough stuff at home and start producing ENTERTAINMENT with a capital E See LA LA LAND,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3606829/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,One of the Best Musicals of our Generation,Apart from the direction and technicalities what makes this film one of the best musicals of our generation are the charming and exceptional performances by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone It gives the characters joy love inspiration new experiences and satisfaction on the other hand sadness insecurity uncertainty exhausting efforts and heartbreaking sacrifices are included in the movie La La Land is simply wonderful It s a firework of joy and excitement that it s really hard not to fall in love with,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6664015/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2017,"Comedy, Drama, Musical..it's all that",Guess what It has plenty of scenes that are all about singing and dancing it s why it s called a musical I would dare to say So if you don t like musicals it s quite possible that you re not gonna like this one but if you are willing to give it a shot please watch from the beginning to the end with respect because if you are willing to pay attention it may offer a good moment I like musicals not all of them I am not fond of every word being said while singing but I usually tolerate and sometimes I quite like it This movie is much more then a musical It s a tribute to musicals to old cinema to acting to jazz and yet still manages to tell a typical story in an original manner When you think it s all about the pretty songs and scenes the movie starts punching you with some reality and then reality strikes I found it amazing for giving me all those elements I just read a message and it made sense for me I laughed I felt like singing and dancing some times and I cried It gave me all that in about 2h so for me that is a great movie but I think it s not the typical story that is delivered to you like in stories that are so strong by themselves they basically wouldn t need anything more to be worth watching or Marvel movies that have many effects so it s always an experience to watch so I can understand some people not liking it it s not typical and if you like that then it s new fresh and amazing,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630468/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2017,"Nice cinematography, that's all",I ve given 3 stars one star for each 10 million of the cost and also because I found this production as a musical third rate The colors sets and film shots were interesting even imaginative but beyond that I was disappointed that this was the best Hollywood could come up with in the musical genre The script had abrupt transitions between scenes and time lapses The dance scenes by professionals were choppy and didn t show dance moves The story didn t get started until halfway through the two hours The scriptwriters took the easy way out toward the end by skipping over five years that I could imagine were more dramatic and emotional than the movie up to that point The viewer is cheated out of better story lines with no transition at all to bring the movie to its conclusion The last half hour had more flair and drama than the rest of the movie Standards have been lowered and the younger generation must see oldies to get educated There was nothing exciting or inspirational in the dancing or the music as performed by amateur leads In all of this world are these the best musical leads that could be found You can find better singers pianists and dancers on TV competition shows or in community theater Were these the best actors for the leads Emma Stone is charming as an actress but Gosling s profile was the only attractive attribute he has going He had no expression on his face for two hours other than sullen It s very impressive that stars with no background in music and dance could take a crash course to prepare for this movie but the results were passable only If the director wanted to show how average people sing dance and play instruments he succeeded But the public deserves to see and appreciate the best musical talents around,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3650208/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2017,People are missing the point!,I had to write this review as so many musical purists are completely missing the point I m fed up of reading that the lead actors can t sing or dance and that that makes it a bad film This is nonsensical as this film is an evolution of the musical not a musical made in the 50 s I would argue that most of the classic musical greats contain awful and hammy acting which do not resonate with a contemporary audience and do not make them bad films By having actors perform a musical in a real and raw way is what drew people in and made the film relatable we look at Emma stone dancing on the screen and think I could do that To judge this film on the actors singing and dancing is missing the point just as some did with Les Miserables The beauty of this film is the drama humour and romance created by talented actors acting their socks off Ok apart from Ryan gosling who looks like he could tap dance through a terror attack and I mean that as a compliment the musical numbers are endearing and are tools used by the director to make you feel for the characters not as a recording for an album I can normally find a small fault with even the best films but I could not for La La Land which is why I have given it a 10 Needless to say the cinematography is gorgeous while the costume design has inspired me to make an appointment with my tailor Lastly the ending reflects the authenticity of the performances by being based in reality ironic considering the location of the movie and again relatable Interestingly I watched this film at a specific time of my life and it reminded me that there is not just one route to a happy life That is what I took away from la la land Oh and that I want to be Ryan gosling,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3856211/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2017,Disappointing,Ryan Gosling They may as well of had a piece of driftwood acting opposite Stone This guy is so useless I was embarrassed for him To start with he sounds retarded is he His serious face makes him look constipated I was half expecting him to let one rip the entire way through I ve seen stroke victims with a wider range of expressions than him He s so vanilla lame boring possessing a total lack of charisma The best reviews he ever had were for roles with barely no lines moody films like The Place Beyond the Pines and Drive when all he had to do was sulk If he wins an Oscar for on the back of this performance it will be an absolute travesty He can t sing he can t dance and literally sucks the life out of every scene he s involved in Now Emma Stone is lovely She s sweet but one dimensional in that she s always playing the same character This was a gross miscasting you can t help but pity her when she sings it s like your 5 year old niece at a school play but worse no depth or range at all completely drowned out by the music in every scene She has some rhythm when it comes to dancing but the set pieces are so laughably childish it s hard to gauge her true capabilities clearly dumb ed down to accommodate Gosling s lack of talent To make matters worse time has not been kind to Stone Whatever youthful looks she may or may not have had are long gone Her face is beginning to morph into yet another plastic Hollywood mess She s not hot she s not sexy but neither is Gosling so I guess in that respect they re evenly matched The script was OK Stone s character begins and ends the same with no progression mentally and Gosling well he s so boring you just give up caring However the rest of the cast were stellar John Legend has some smooth vocals but he is rather oily Had they cast people with real talent in the lead roles then I think this could have been magnificent Worth mentioning The cinematography was excellent visually stunning an orgy of colour bursting out from the screen in each and every scene and the songs although forgettable had a certain unique charm to them I predict a theatre production in the near future To sum it up If your date makes you chose between this and Titanic I d chose this Just don t go expecting it to live up to the hype Peace x,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626675/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,"Electrifying, charming, and swelling with vibrant performances, La La Land is a true cinematic masterpiece",In the age of countless romantic films lacking originality and falling victim to tiresome formula Damien Chazelle the intelligent mind behind the exhilarating music theme drama Whiplash in 2014 makes a return to the director s seat to deliver arguably one of the most sensational romantic tales in recent years La La Land Crafted in a style of an old romantic film noir from the 1950s through slick editing and vibrant storytelling this film shines with the powerful cinematic appeal of actress Emma Stone and supporting actor Ryan Gosling both of whom blossom on screen in a romance that not only feels original it almost magical in every sense It is sweet it s sexy and most importantly vastly unpredictable And if the cast performances and sensational musical numbers tightly grips your attention Damien Chazelle also has a sweet appetite for visual storytelling an aspect this film greatly embraces Set in modern day Los Angeles this follows Mia played by Emma Stone a struggling actress who crosses paths with a passionate jazz pianist Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling As the two bond and a boiling romance develops between them their separate careers grow further and further in the entertainment industry which puts a rift on their relationship Damien Chazelle effectively breathes life into the romance genre operating on both narrative and technical elements have been abandoned since the Golden Age of Hollywood back in the 50s Opening up with a vibrant musical number on a crowded highway this film mixes elements of classic musicals with a gripping love story that gracefully comes to life on both a narrative and visual scope The pinnacle to the film is a love story between two individuals of different backgrounds who grow further and further in love and before too long are progressively drawn into each other s remarkable world And rather driving the story on overbearing melancholy Chazelle proceeds the story through a sense a humanity and spirit without feeling the need to rely on redundant formula To add icing on the cake the film expresses a sense of spirit and sensation through a series of musical numbers that are not only evoke nostalgia of classic 50s musicals but play out very provocatively During these scenes we are introduced to both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s surprising singing abilities arguably very few knew they ve processed And these scenes blossom with beautiful cinematography by Linus Sandgren of David O Russell s Joy and American Hustle who strives to not only capture the energy of these of the duo s lively performances but also the colorful palette of nighttime Los Angeles and the character s outfits Emma Stone and Ryan Goslings are both the apex of the picture and explode on screen with performances that can only be described as mesmerizing and even that sounds like an understatement Emma Stone who rose to Oscar territory with her performance in the Oscar winning picture Birdman shines her light with charm and vibrancy in her role And the biggest surprise comes not only from her ability to drown herself in a dramatic characterization but also with her lively singing ability which she displays on screen a good number of sequences Down to Earth and swarming with humanity Stone breathes life into her character Working along her side is co star Ryan Goslings who steps in the shoes with her romantic partner Sebastian a jazz musician with a passion to igniting a future for jazz music and disillusioned by the fading light the classic music genre has evolved in America s culture When he crosses paths with Emma Stone s Mia he almost desperately tries to his artful world upon learning of her lack of appeal in the classic style of music His performance along with his singing ability is a thing of beauty and by far the most enthralling performance he s ever ignited in this career The chemistry these two share is brought by Damien Chazelle s engrossing direction which renders their romantic spark simply irresistible even during long periods without them on screen together The romance between these characters never feels contrived or hokey but thoroughly uncompromising La La Land is an electrifying romantic masterpiece swelling with vibrant performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and best of all boasts an outstanding directorial exertion from Damien Chazelle Furthermore it ignites life into a dimming romantic genre In a stunning conclusion La La Land takes a soft spot as one of the best films of 2016,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621296/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2022,Extravaganza,La La Land is a technical force Although the script has flaws the film creates an atmosphere that s simultaneously nostalgic and fresh The story follows two struggling artists that connect over their creative passions They go through trials often balancing their dreams and their partnership Despite these obstacles they maintain a mutual admiration These plotlines of romantic conflict and struggling artists aren t particularly unique but the ending culminates in a way that strengthens the narrative Meanwhile Gosling s emotional notes are somewhat dry but he offsets that with singing dancing and piano skills Plus Stone provides vibrant vulnerability and singing chops Still it s the filmmaking of La La Land that makes the experience special The cinematography is excellent using lengthy shot durations dramatic lighting intentional colors and exciting movement to unite realism with surrealism The abstract sound emotionally blends scenes retro editing techniques add stylish flare and the production design fuses past and present Furthermore the soundtrack is an instant classic and each song is paired with ambitious choreography All together Chazelle had a precise vision that comes across spectacularly Overall La La Land is detailed in every technical aspect overcoming its deficits and dazzling as a true extravaganza Writing 8 10 Direction 10 10 Cinematography 10 10 Acting 9 10 Editing 9 10 Sound 9 10 Score Soundtrack 10 10 Production Design 9 10 Casting 10 10 Effects 8 10 Overall Score 9 2 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7897097/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,Not sure what all of the hype is about....?,I ventured to my local cinema to see this movie on the basis of a number of excellent reviews by critics and patrons on here I will admit that a musical is not my normal preference for a movie but as I love both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and with these reviews in mind how could I not go and see it The opening sequence was quite impressive and I also knew from the start that the cinematography was going to be to my liking old style Cinemascope with great coloring Unfortunately that s about where it stopped The ongoing story line was very weak and the music was even weaker its not that Gosling and Stone performed awfully but Moana has better song list than this The movie limped along through its two hours becoming more and more predictable as it progressed very disappointing I have to really question how this movie could have been nominated for 11 Golden Globes and actually won 7 when there are movies such as Hell or High Water and Arrival and Nocturnal Animals out there all of which were considerably ahead of this My only assumption is that like The Artist a few years ago this is a result of a wrist kissing exercise by Tinsel Town aiming once again to congratulate themselves on how wonderful they think they are Seriously peeps whilst its not absolutely awful its also nothing special and certainly not as special as this critics are making it out to be to be,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620999/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2017,"Pleasant, but not remotely great.",I went to this movie with reasonable but not overly high expectations and in the end it was a pleasant enough time But to suggest this is a great movie is astonishing It is a musical that looks back nostalgically to earlier great musicals But the leads can t sing can t dance can act a little pardon the reference it seemed in keeping Equally bad there are no songs of any worth in the whole movie The lead actor is a jazz purist who is willing to put put his life in turmoil to live out his dream of playing real jazz Instead everyone around him plays excellent jazz and he plays nothing but a very undernourished pop song On a positive note the opening scene was a gas Superficial yes but really fun and impressive with its long tracking shot It gave me hope for the rest of the movie but that was the end of anything of any worth The complete split of opinion between this being a great movie and it being a very ordinary one is bizarre Best Picture Really Have people not been going to anything else this year There have been some absolutely wonderful movies this year I do not understand at all Perhaps it is because I love musicals and watch them a lot that I have something to compare it to I don t know But I have never been more confused,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625922/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2016,For the Dreamers,There are two things that can really win me over in a movie great music and a great ending La La Land has both and then some Coming off of Whiplash one of the best films of 2014 the pressure was on Damien Chazelle to come up with something to top what he did previously Not only did he co write 13 Cloverfield Lane earlier this year but he finally got to direct his passion project La La Land In fact the very plot of the film echoes Chazelle s relentless devotion to getting this film made all these years And for the most part the result is magical Surely there s nothing like it you will see this year Like many classic musicals of the 40 s and 50 s La La Land s narrative tends to wander into dreamy and surreal territories but it s at its best when it is simply telling the story of two ambitious artists in Los Angeles one a jazz musician and the other an aspiring actress I think Chazelle s vision would have been fine with other actors but there s no question that a ton of credit has to go to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Their chemistry bolsters this story and really is why I cared so much about these characters Both of them will be nominated and both of them deserve to be Their relationship through triumphs and struggles may be the best romance of the year La La Land is one of those movies that doesn t really hit you until the car ride home or even a few days after Sometimes the wandering plot and the inconsistent presence of musical numbers is frustrating but it all leads to one satisfying ending So much so that I significantly upped my score because of how hard the ending hit me It isn t predictable or easy in fact because the ending wasn t what I originally hoped made me enjoy it even more The final few shots gave me a whole movie s worth of emotion and it made it worth it in the end This is clearly a tribute to the musicals of the golden age of Hollywood and also a constant reminder at the brilliance of Jazz music but I found the touching romance and struggle of these two artists to be the most rewarding aspect to La La Land The beautiful score and equally subtle and swashbuckling songs contribute to one epic theater experience I m still processing how I feel about the film as a whole but I m certainly pleased that I saw it Stone Gosling chemistry Music Unpredictable Satisfying ending Middle act wanders 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3603098/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2016,La La Land is Simply Amazing,Dreams LaLa Land is about dreams The tag line is Here s to the fool who dreams and its truly fitting Emma Stone was lovely charming and bright per usual fan of hers since Easy A but I was most impressed with Ryan Gosling I had no idea he was so talented I was astonished by his grace and pure perfection as Sebastian I mean Ryan Gosling as a jazz musician was everything I never knew I needed He sang he danced he was absolutely sublime Like many others would say Emma and Ryan have a chemistry that is undeniable and it s hard not to watch them together on screen They are captivating to watch the energy flows through them and into the audience and its really something special John Legend was pretty excellent in a supporting role initially it took me a second seeing him in a different capacity but he was great Acting isn t his trade but I liked seeing him even though I thought it was a bit brief Having him sing in the film was a real treat for those who may not be familiar with his music His voice is like a fine wine like honey in your mouth thick rich and sweet His addition to the cast was smart and really upped the ante musically because John is just so supremely talented As far as direction Damien Chazelle was able do what so few directors can and that is create magic on film It s really astonishing considering the undertaking this film must ve been for someone who s only directed one other feature film LaLa Land was directed as if by a seasoned veteran scenes were seamless and so precise in some parts it felt like I was watching a live play The film is the best kind of fantasy filled with love joy and life You can t help but walk away thinking about your own dreams feeling inspired to make those dreams a reality This film is a homage a love song to a film genre that s been long gone and sorely missed It reminded me of old Hollywood glamour the sophistication and raw talent seemed to have the audience gripped from start to finish It was refreshing and yet envelops you like a warm blanket on a chill winter s morning It was effortless clean and pure perfection I did like that the film also had some clear undertones and commentary on Hollywood as well as personal growth Without saying too much I think that these points really rounded out the film making it very robust and multidimensional The film was able to position itself as somewhat nostalgic while not being clich or predictable One of my favorite lyrics in the film is madness is key to give us new colors to see and this is so true and poignant when it comes to the dreamer The dreamer is mad considered not to be practical similarly Steve Jobs once said the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do Sometimes madness and genius go hand in hand so don t fear it embrace it embrace the mad chaotic beauty of having big dreams hold tightly to them and remember that its always worth the fight to make it a reality Bottom line LaLa Land is a must see You must experience the songs the dancing the joy and happiness this film brings you It infuses you with hope and sends you back out into the world as a dreamer I highly suggest this film be experienced by all it is an incredible achievement the amout of applause at the end of the screening I saw as deafening This is a definite Oscar contender no question about it Go see it A,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3603798/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2020,A wonderful experience and my favorite movie,Nothing I have ever seen captures the wonder of love music and hope quite like La La Land At first glance it seems like any other romcom with above average visuals La La Land is more than just that La La Land is a masterpiece that should be on everyone s radar The performances of Ryan Gosling and Emma Gosling are one for the books and their chemistry together absorbs the audience especially Stone who won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for the role Damien Chazelle masterfully directs a flawless combination of the Hollywood musical along with a beautiful romance Winning the two well deserved commendations of Academy Award and Golden Globe the film is visually spectacular The music composed by Justin Hurwitz is my favorite score of all time fitting the feeling of the scenes like a puzzle piece The ending sequence of this film is nearly perfect Stylistically its one of the most beautiful moments in cinema and pushes the movie to the next level This movie will never get old for me I thought it did everything perfectly and will be my favorite movie for a long time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5650513/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2018,"When the words 'The End 'appeared on the screen, I had to contain the urge to stand up and applaud!",It may not have the depth meaning or questions that some seek in the seventh art but cinema is above all a spectacle and La La Land is absolutly that A visual and sonorous spectacle that has not been seen for a long time and will hardly be seen again This musical is not one of sing a longs attests to this fact the existence of only 4 5 songs in a film of two hours so to speak but of music that is a constant throughout the film There are in fact 3 cast songs that are a little meaningless and sung in studio which not being to my taste ends ups being understandable as an appeal to the nostalgia of the old musicals that truth be told were the first blockbusters These three more flourished numbers occur in the first 20 minutes of the film and then what is in my view the best film of the 2010 s actually begins The interpretations are excellent having the main actress more opportunity to shine in great height The screenplay appears to be simple but develops in such a way that it looks like something of Woody Allen at his best A story about two people who fall in love and come together to achieve their dreams open a jazz club and be an actress But as I began to say La La Land is a visual and sonorous spectacle so that the technical characteristics of the film gain even more relevance The color of the film is extraordinary at every moment and the play of lights in each scene plays a decisive role in that which is transmitted the background cinematography is a luxury that makes of this a film of obligatory visualization in a theater As for the sound no movie ever sounded so good At any point in the film the viewer sits within the scene thanks to the sonic realism that transports anyone who is watching this play from the audience of a screen to the audience of a stage Concerning music itself it is a constant and never below excellent playing an active role in the unfolding of events and not just a prop to the scene In this film the song is one of the characters and is so relevant that the only scene where it is not on stage gains an impressive dimension Besideds all these attributes that are well above average is an immaculate directing effort that transforms this cinematic experience into an extraordinary journey through the imaginary of what is a relationship with love goals anger commitment happiness and sacrifice To finish I leave just one more personal note when the words The End appeared on the screen I had to contain the urge to stand up and applaud such was the feeling of immersion that the film caused,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4164913/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2018,Great Film!,I saw this on 2018 on February just before the Oscar Found this movie real good very good picture it is indeed a fantasy film with real good dancing scenes I happen to play the piano so the jazz parts were a candy to people who like watching jazz Mia is adorable her struggle in Hollywood seems convincing I think this Film makes you either hate the industry or inspire you It s a long movie over two hours but they spread it over four seasons to make it reasonable in conclusion I never watched something like this before 34th imaginary yet real good screenplay,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4082520/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,The Best Gosling Musical,La LA Land is about a couple that meet and follow there own dreams and get driven apart This movie was great First the music for this musical was great It made you feel like you were in the moment Cinamatography was a key to this movie The way they went out of the scene was great There was no better way The actors where great Two of the best actors ever were in this film You got Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling They both did amazing Writing was great The writer made you feel for the character a lot La La Land is one of my favorite films It is truly the best musical,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4314540/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,What a let-down!,In a word turgid Given the hype I had expected an up beat colourful all singing dancing romp Boy was I disappointed Save your money and take your loved one for a couple of beers instead The opening traffic jam song dance sequence was a nigh on unintelligible uninspiring mess that added pointless minutes to what turned out in any case to be an over long film From there on we limp though a lacklustre passionless romance until we reach an ambiguous ending There are a couple of cute songs along the way The dancing is disappointing especially if you re thinking of something along the lines of Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers Ironically the high spot for me was the sequence where Ryan Gosling s character is playing keyboards in a pop band something that conflicts with his jazz based musical values Gosling s character seemed mildly depressed throughout which is not appealing And although Stone can act convincingly there s a limit to how much big eyed gazing I can take When good films end an audience will be buzzing with conversation with smiles on faces This one ended with silent shuffling There was a palpable sense of disappointment Did wives feel guilty for dragging their husbands to such a turkey And did husbands fume at losing 2 hours of their lives which could have been spent watching Homes under the hammer on TV,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621676/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2018,My Favorite Movie From The Recent Years,As someone who loves classic musicals like Singin in the Rain West Side Story Sound of Music On the Town and others I had low expectations for this film A film trying to replicate the joy and wonder that the old musicals brought to so many sounded absurd and would probably fail in its attempt I WAS WRONG I loved this film It was a wonderfully fun and has phenomenal score to back the energetic dancing The production design can not be overstated with the over saturation of colors to reflect the once brilliant L A and when there is a conflict between the characters the colors become more pastel and faded The cinematography was amazing with a very fluid camera during dance sequences defying the stereotypical wide stationary shot that would include all the dancing and singing Acting was great and included real emotion from Ryan Gosling that did not involve him eating cereal TLDR Takes all of the amazing aspects of the old musicals and Broadway and compliments them with surreal emotion and story telling Must see if you enjoy musical theatre or looking for a film to watch and have fun 9 6 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4164041/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,La La Land. The greatest movie musical ever made? No spoilers I promise.,A bold statement I admit when you have to size it up against West Side Story and Singin in the Rain But from the first bar of Another Day of Sun a huge Busby Berkeleyesque number that erupts on the gridlocked freeways of LA you know you are actually in heaven The two central characters Mia and Sebastian are introduced at its finale and we set off on a love story like no other Are there even any other actors in the film I ll have to look next time Oh yes John Legend completely taking the Mickey out of himself Tip your hat to him for that Well it s like the Umbrellas of Cherbourg actually but better so so much better There are only actually 7 songs in it So it s quite an unmusical musical And neither Ryan Gosling nor Emma Stone can really properly sing But that s beside the point Writer and director Damian Chazelle Whiplash another magical movie about jazz subverts the musical genre by having almost no music in the third and fourth acts But it doesn t matter because now he has a story to tell Emma Stone is nothing short of mesmerising Those eyes That cinematography Those costumes Ryan Gosling A fault free cinema superstar He rises eloquently and handsomely to the occasion But even though they are both brilliant this is Damian Chazelle s movie He has the mark of a master with his direction and storytelling It even has tap dancing I won t spoil it for you by sharing the full storyline as I knew nothing of it before I went to see it but I confess I was worried about the hype and the knowledge that the leads can t sing There was no need to worry and you shouldn t either because this movie is about the unique vision of Damian Chazelle He is clearly a scholar of big studio big budget musicals and has used the power of Whiplash s success to create a dream that no one has been allowed to tamper with It s a deconstruction and reconstruction of everything that makes great musicals great but with the twist outlined above City of Stars has already picked up a Golden Globe and rightly so but it s not even the best song in the movie It s difficult to go much further without spoilers so I ll leave it at that Probably the best musical movie ever made I led the applause and went to buy a ticket for the showing immediately after the one I d seen but circumstances prevented me from watching it back to back I ll have to wait until later this week when it opens properly Put it this way I m now extremely jealous of the 99 of the world s population who have yet to see La La Land and I beseech you to follow my actions A straight 10 10 No question,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616040/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2016,A beautifully filmed dazzling retro musical about young dreams.,It is a great loss to modern cinema that the most escapist of all film genres the Hollywood Broadway musical has been presumed buried for decades Born in an era of world wars and depression the musical was the most effective happy pill ever invented Only in the musical could you find the unbridled eruption of emotion expressed through spontaneous song and dance with scant regard for narrative or dialogue and even less for everyday reality Closely related to the fantasy genre the Hollywood musical has resurfaced in modern hybrids but the traditional form exists only in libraries and memories That is until you see La La Land 2016 The opening scenes are a perfect example of old fashioned musical showbiz driven entirely by spectacle rather than logic High on a Los Angeles freeway a young woman jumps out of her traffic jammed car and bursts into song and dance She is copied by scores of other motorists all gyrating in sync filmed from above in a single take A boy and a girl make eye contact not in a nice way and this is where the story begins Mia Emma Stone spends her days humiliated by repeatedly missing out on auditions for her big chance in Hollywood while Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a surly dreamer who wants to open a jazz club for people who love jazz It s not a good start for romance but a pre dawn song and dance routine a la Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers sets them up for love This is a story about dreamers and the dream factory carried aloft by music and generously wrapped in nostalgia Beneath it all there is a narrative but it feels inconsequential to the music The bitter sweet romance is harmonic scaffold for songs and dance that lift you with promises and hopes then land you onto the soft sands of life s disappointments The characters of Mia and Sebastian are not developed in great depth because they are avatars for generations of dreamers who have been drawn like moths to fame Their synergy is palpable This film is full of memorable moments The scene where Sebastian talks passionately about the dynamics of jazz musicianship is captivating the moonlight walks through the city are surreal and the final scene against a painfully hesitant piano solo of City of Stars will squeeze tears out of anyone and then make you hum the melody for days Great cinematography is not unusual these days but the La La Land camera is like an artist s brush that composes beautiful portraits against stunning urban landscapes in colour palettes that are richly retro yet totally modern This is a film to bathe yourself in let its exuberance musicality and nonsensical scenes of flyaway romance dazzle you Today s world needs more la la land,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3596282/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2017,Not simply just a musical or a romantic drama - this is so much better than that,Mia played by Emma Stone is an aspiring actress working in a coffee shop She gets auditions but nothing has come of these Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a struggling jazz pianist playing small venues His dream is to open his own jazz club The two meet but don t hit it off Over time however things change I generally dislike musicals and romantic dramas Romantic dramas tend to be incredibly formulaic schmaltzy and unrealistic Musicals are irritating because instead of spoken dialogue you have someone singing words at you and it all seems so contrived and out of place this is if you re lucky Many musicals just use music as padding So it is with some trepidation that I watched La La Land The opening few scenes didn t help my fear that this was going to be a campy West Side Story like implausible song and dance fest or a Les Miserables like constant stream of nails on blackboard irritation However it soon became clear that La La Land is better than that The answer to How much better increases the more into the movie you get What sustains the movie initially is its warmth the wonderful often funny dialogue and the interaction between the two main characters The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic and their performances especially Emma Stone s alone are worth the price of admission Even the music is okay sporadically used not as intrusive as it could have been and it seems to integrate into the plot well Moreover rather than just serve as padding it helps move the plot along This all said I would have preferred genuine dialogue At this point the movie was still heading down a rather safe predictable boy meets girl yadda yadda happily ever after route The stuff of easy box office dollars rather than genuine art Then writer director Damien Chazelle of Whiplash fame ups the ante moving it from a mere romantic drama to a drama that covers a host of themes artistic integrity the price of fame chasing dreams the trade offs between relationships and careers missed opportunities and life s big what if moments An incredibly emotional bitter sweet ending ties it all together perfectly What appeared to be a quaint yet innocuous film turned into a wonderfully profound hard hitting work of art,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615983/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2020,A Masterpiece!,Pros A Masterful portrayal of pursuing your dreams and how fate can play its part The performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are superb I completely fell in love with both characters The score of this film is fantastic composer Justin Hurwitz did a tremendous job with this especially City of Stars This is exactly what film is all about It s why I love Film Cons It s not a fault of the film but I wish the ending would ve been different La La Land is a brilliant renaissance of the film musical In my eyes the film has become this generations Singin in the Rain The performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are brilliantly done and I can personally relate to Ryan s character Sebastian a lot because of his ethics and what he stands for That directly relates to the message of the film which is essentially to never give up on your dreams and passions Special mention to the cinematography in the film shot by Linus Sandgren which is mesmerising at times with how LA looks Finally the climatic 20 25 minutes of the film is special and the perfect way to conclude this story The first time I saw it I was not a huge fan but now after multiple watches I am now convinced this was the way to finish One of my all time favourite films It made me look at films in a new way and La La Land is the main reason I am a film fanatic and student now Quote I m always gonna love you Mia Rating 5 5,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5863654/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2017,I went in expecting to be bored and hate it and ended up actually liking and that is a sign of how good this movie actually is,City of stars are you shining just for me Mia Stone is an aspiring and struggling actress who spends her time in between auditions working as a barista When she walks into a restaurant and hears Sebastian Gosling playing piano the lives of both become entwined Now both are struggling to make their dreams come true while at the same time supporting each other but somethings don t go as smooth as you hope This is a movie that had everything going against it for me I was not in the mood to watch it I usually don t like movies that have this much hype behind it and I was expecting wall to wall singing and dancing and sat down expecting to be bored and uninterested I m not sure if it was those expectations or not but I ended up liking this much more than I expected to In case you re scared the movie is not wall to wall singing at all and is like Chicago in the way that the musical numbers are large and full out but placed sporadically and in ways that actually make sense after the opening This is not a movie that will convert non musical fans into theater lovers but at the same time it won t offend those that hate them either This is a movie where I can see why it won the awards and Emma Stone did do a tremendous job in this very intense part Overall much better than I was expecting I went in expecting to be bored and hate it and ended up actually liking and and that is a sign of how good this movie actually is I surprisingly give this a B,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3697962/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,"average, but keep trying Hollywood",The dancing was average at best The opening scene was the best routine These actors are not Ginger and Fred I am not sure if the talent was missing or something else The singing was either weak or mixed poorly The song writing was unique but not strong enough to remember The story line was predictable but sweet I was so looking forward to seeing a musical movie It has received great reviews because I believe those reviewers were all so desperate to see an upbeat musical love story as was I So in conclusion it is worth seeing if only to just to send Hollywood a message with your dollars More of this but better quality please,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620926/?ref_=tt_urv

Highly over-rated movie..,I went to watch this movie as its getting lot of praise all around But I found it just an OK film In fact there were times I was looking over my watch when will this movie get over Ryan Gosling is attractive charming but in some scenes he gets expressionless Emma looks just average Her acting is way better than Ryan Gosling However movie is colorful musical background track is also good Music is superb but I expected a bit more on the story part Overall I could not connect with this movie Really think that I wasted my 2 hours and money on this movie,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616424/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2019,Huuuuuuge disappointment,I saw this at the cinema on its release As we walked out myself and others were heard to mutter certainly NOT a musical so what was it all about To classify it as a musical is a misnomer One or two production numbers and the same musical number played over again doth not a musical make The scene where Gosling and Stone attempt to dance on a hill overlooking LA was absolutely cringeworthy for any real dancers watching and really does she happen to have her tap shoes with her after leaving a party just watch that scene closely again Clearly Hollywood does NOT produce the allrounders from the golden age these were actors actresses who could act sing AND dance think of Danny Kaye Vera Ellen Judy Garland Gosling and Stone try hard but are wooden in their dancing and Stone s singing wouldn t even rate a star on here No it was far from awesome although clearly Ryan Gosling worked hard at learning the piano so must be commended for that Not a film I would want to sit through again but this is the only place I can vent my spleen or be generous with praise as I cannot be bothered with social media,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4693184/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2017,Blah Blah Land,I really don t know what the big fuss was about this film Admittedly it was beautifully shot and produced the music and little dance numbers were brilliant and it was visually stunning the whole thing reminded me of a Chagall painting I would say that was my favourite thing about the movie it s all very romantic looking and stylish However these things were all smoke and mirrors to me to hide the fact that the story was shallow and pretentious It just wasn t all that interesting and couldn t hold my attention Is it just me or do Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling just seem to play the same people in every one of their movies I feel like they re the same no matter what roles they play it s the same with Ryan Reynolds as though their acting spectrum is very limited so they can t take on a wide variety of diverse roles In a nutshell beautifully made and visually striking but rather uninteresting story and uninspired acting Totally not deserving of all the Oscars,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3796354/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2018,Sing Your Emotions,Seemingly frivolous details can destroy one s most cherished dreams Feelings of excitement and disappointment are reflected in the music and lyrics In La la land the lyrics are enjoyable and life affirming The film teaches people to sing their emotions For the average person to express her his feelings of love is quite difficult But for example if someone tried to form into a song his her feelings of anger hate sadness that might possibly help in saving the beloved and prevent tragic consequences And finally song is a beautiful way to share emotions among people,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4346921/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2016,La La Land (2016) Review,La La Land 2016 Starring Ryan Gosling Emma Stone J K Simmons Finn Wittrock John Legend Rosemarie DeWitt Tom Everett Scott Jason Fuchs Jessica Rothe Sonoya Mizuno Callie Hernandez Josh Pence Anna Chazelle Meagen Fay Hemky Madera Zo Hall Dempsey Pappion Claudine Claudio Jordan Ray Fox and Olivia Hamilton Directed By Damien Chazelle Review HERE S TO THE FOOLS WHO DREAM Finally it took a while but it s finally in theaters so I go to see it I saw the teaser when it first premiered online and when Ryan Gosling finished singing City of Stars I knew I had see it Along with the fact that my wife Emma Stone is in it LOL No but I ugh I knew it had to be special Mia an aspiring actress serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and Sebastian a jazz musician scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart I am not a big fan of musicals but to name a few from the past I do enjoy they re Grease Les Miserables and Into The Woods But this is the best Musical I have ever seen It even feels like an old Hollywood original film Mia Emma Stone who is an aspiring actress works at a coffee shop right next to a building where they filmed Casablanca and has posters in her room Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a pianist who loves Jazz and has a passion for it You can tell just n the first 15 20 minutes by lines of dialogue You could totally get into there characters because of there passions The cutaways for the film reminded of like a serial or old TV show or movie even the way it ends The reason I m not a big fan of musicals because when the movie finishes I usually don t sing any of the songs or they just don t hit me But I couldn t stop singing City of Stars or the fools who dream when I left the theater La La Land is the best film I have seen in the genre of romance Musical has beautiful editing and singing Great songs that you will be singing long after you see it and has lovely performances from two great actors who have proved to have chemistry I m giving La La Land a five out of five this is destined to be a classic nay it is a classic,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608596/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,"La La Land is not a movie, it's a dream",I got to start by saying that I really really hate musical movies they are just so boring to me but La La Land was different cause it s not a movie it is a dream First of all the opening scene of the movie was the worst opening scene in history I think I felt like it was so long meanwhile it was just 5 min It has nothing that grabs the attention or makes the audience want to watch the movie and continue it I loved how in the movie we are seeing what the characters are seeing or a better way to say it what they are dreaming that s why I said the movie is a dream not a movie while i was watching La La Land I felt like I was thrown in a dream The movie s cinematography colors are another level it was so pretty and reflecting what each character was feeling and seeing The customs were beautiful especially Mia s Played by Emma Stone dresses their colors were beautiful and they really fit the character very well The music score was so strong and just pure absolutely deserves an oscar and a golden globe win Ryan Gosling Plays Sebastian and Emma Stone Plays Mia gave us a performance that I personally will never forget in some scenes especially the one when they were having dinner after Sebastian came form that tour with the band I felt like they were not acting at all and that is all real the chemistry between these two was i don t know what to say The dancing moves the music and all that were not easy to perform at all but with the right cast crew they made it look so easy and possible La La Land is a movie that will live for years really enjoyed the movie Hats off to everyone who worked on it My rating is 9 5 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5970023/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2017,"One of the most enthralling, magical and enjoyable pieces of cinematic escapism and entertainment in years.",A record breaking haul at this year s Golden Globes awards gives some indication as to just how special a film La La Land is With 7 deserved awards including Best Musical or Comedy Best Director Best Score and Best Actor gongs for both its lead stars this has proved to be a powerhouse of cinema which will be remembered for some time Directed by Damien Chazelle following up on the excellent and critically acclaimed Whiplash La La Land sees Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone deliver performances reminiscent of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in this hugely entertaining love letter to the golden age of Hollywood and traditional Jazz music A comedy romance drama and musical all encompassed into one sublime production we follow Jazz musician Sebastian Gosling and aspiring actress Mia Stone as they seek to follow their dreams and head down the road of self discovery and sacrifice Having previously worked together on the brilliant Crazy Stupid Love and not so brilliant Gangster Squad the chemistry between the leads is palpable as they embark on a blossoming romance and enable each other to pursue their own ambitions This idea of following one s dream encapsulates the very essence of the movie and it is a theme enhanced by the majestic fantastical and dream like world which Chazelle has created for his protagonists a beautifully crafted stage on which possibilities are endless if you persevere Indeed this Hollywood that Chazelle portrays is encased in a sense of nostalgia and romance for the lost magic of what music and movies were all about art forms within which anything can happen and anything can be created Such is the nostalgia here Chazelle even filmed La La Land in wide screen Cinema Scope as a deliberate homage to the style and feel of the movies from the 50s and earlier There are references to this bygone age too with Mia discussing how she grew up watching classics like Casablanca and Bringing Up Baby She even works at Warner Brother Studios where parts of the film take place and classic sets from vintage movies are seen Sebastian meanwhile complains that Jazz is dying in a plea for this particular art to be saved yet struggles to make it relevant for a modern audience He is asked how can you be a revolutionary when you are such a traditionalist and it is a question which was perhaps considered by Chazelle when creating this homage to a mainstream audience This vintage style is evident throughout the film and especially in the sporadic musical sequences in which Gosling and Stone were mesmerising as they performed their dance routines and songs with hugely impressive assurance and skill Whereas Gosling s singing voice is perhaps on the weaker side his delivery was perfectly befitting of the character he portrays whilst Stone was utterly captivating in all of her routines but particularly during her solo towards the end of the movie Both Sebastian and Mia are such likable characters who complement each other so well that they add a huge element of charm to an already uplifting premise It s near impossible not to root for the both of them and support them as they pursue their dreams and as such it s heartbreaking when we witness the sacrifices they have to make in order to do so It is here the dramatic element comes into play ensuring La La Land never becomes too saccharine or twee It could have been easy for Chazelle to get lost in a world of fantasy and endless opportunity but he reigns in the nostalgia and the sentiment by bringing his characters back down to earth and reminds us that following one s dream is not easy nor simple but that it takes hard work perseverance compromise and of course sacrifice Credit is therefore heaped further on Gosling and Stone who put Sebastian and Mia through a roller coaster of emotions throughout as they celebrate their successes feel humiliated at their failures and laugh and cry together Perhaps the most heartening aspect of all is the way in which they support and encourage each other and refuse to let each other ever give up on their dreams it s a hugely inspiring notion Complimenting this degree of restraint which Chazelle imposes on his protagonists both Gosling and Stone deliver perfectly pitched and understated performances which also serve to enhance the sheer scale and scope of not just the musical sequences but the production as a whole This is perhaps epitomised by the very opening sequence a single take shot of an entire freeway traffic jam breaking out into a fanfare of song and dance which sets the standard for the rest of the film catchy music sublime choreography and the panning out of the freeway in order to fit in the vast Los Angeles landscape hints at the grandiose nature of the production The music that is played throughout is not to be ignored Justin Hurwitz had teamed up with Chazelle on Whiplash and returns here with a score and soundtrack that brings La La Land to life For a musical there are not actually that many song and dance routines but music as a medium is a pivotal and consistent theme here and one that Chazelle ensures is not lost amongst the Hollywood nostalgia The choreography also deserves a mention for enabling some truly memorable scenes none more so than Sebastian and Mia s first dance together in a setting which truly embodies the library of classics which Chazelle is paying tribute to Perfect performances including solid support from the likes of J K Simmons and John Legend fantastic routines and wonderful music all combine to tell a relatable message delivered by superbly written characters which serves to make La La Land one of the most enthralling magical and enjoyable pieces of cinematic escapism and entertainment in years For further movie reviews please visit  www facebook com

16 August 2023,"I'm in the minority, I know",Musical Fantasy has always been my least favourite as genres these are way down in the pecking order still I wanted to check this one out primarily for two reasons One I just saw Yorgos Lanthimos The Favourite and I was blown away by Emma Stone s incredible performance and wanted to explore more of her works Two I have been planning to dig into Damien Chazelle s filmography for quite some time now so I decided to tune in and I realised almost immediately that Musicals aren t my thing They never were nor they ever will be Now don t get me wrong I do not mean to downplay their creativity in any way nor do I intend to demean their efforts Matter of fact I admire Chazelle s vision and input as he is someone who always strives to put something fresh onto the table It s just that those musical numbers and his over dependency on the music often came across as inessential distractions needless nuisances rather than something pivotal to propel the narrative ahead As a result the core drama failed to leave a strong imprint on me leaving a lot to be desired Although this time more than on the movie I am angry at myself,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9263218/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,Here's to the one who dream,Unhappy is a person who never dared to dream This world and our mind have the endless opportunities and we have to be really miserable to even try to suppress those opportunities because without our perfectional ideas and notions of life and how we should live it we become empty bodies and let physiology do its thing Only when you dare to dream you let yourself flow in a world of pure imagination and possibilities you create your individuality and slightly optimistic and romantic perception of life which helps you get through the tough times and standard routines of daily life Having the hope that someday you can achieve whatever you have pictured in your head gives you wings and positives to go on And this one s for dreamers out there who dared to dream and achieved something in their life for those who are on their way to do so and for those who are too scared to try Yes it may go in a completely different direction but you will never know until you try Sometimes life has better things to offer than we can imagine and it may lead to something wonderful and new Lumiere brothers had only visions in their heads and ambitions when they invented film as we know it now being inspired by Thomas Edison and others Would they have done it if they never chased the dream You know the answer The answer is A Trip to the Moon City Lights Casablanca Space Odyssey The Godfather Schindler s List Lord of the Rings and La La Land The latter one is a perfect addition to the history of cinema absolutely deserving of all the praise it receives Would I change anything in it Not a single word or move From the astonishing play of colors and tones to the hopeful and sparkling eyes of the characters were captured wonderfully by one of the bravest and inspiring dreamers of modern Hollywood Damien Chazelle Dreaming is simple he made it clear to himself and to the audience with this movie No tricky turns and twists in the story line no complicated dialogues Everything is clear to the point that it lets you just enjoy the whole spectacle with a bit of nostalgia of your own forgotten dreams of where you are right now in your life and where are you heading to All of this is spiced up with magical hidden character called music From City of Stars to the last note of Mia Sebastian s Theme the soundtrack is wonderful It is cheerful it is sad it is hopeful and simply mesmerizing Undoubtedly the best film in recent years deserving of all the golden statues including the main one for best picture proving that the best movie of the year can be about a simple subject and not about a slumdog boy who becomes millionaire or a king struggling with his speech or American heroes saving lives in Iran or elsewhere This movie is relatable to everyone Although dreamers or la la landers are considered to be out of this world and not aware of what is happening we are all still foolishly with a bit of hope and enthusiasm trying to chase our dreams and create our own world of reality So here s to the one who dream,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619407/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2020,Fall in love with a dream,Damian Chazelle could already be considered one of the best debuts in recent years With Whiplash he already gave a hard blow showing a chilling energetic situation and with a handling of suspense that is enviable And although with La La Land it follows an equally musical course and at first glance it seems a much more hopeful film than its predecessor it hides an equally painful reality from which it is impossible to escape The story follows two characters in the city of Los Angeles in search of their dreams Both coincide on several occasions and inevitably a romance arises This story is elevated thanks to Chazelle and his own direction with a stylization and a surreal staging with a color palette that expresses emotions and a sublime handling of feelings And likewise one could name a string of technical aspects by which this film stands out from the crowd and generates a product that feels authentic even when its premise is not However in his own opinion taking that route is to belittle and put aside what truly makes this film one of its kind And just as David Fincher showed the domination and triumph of the digital world in the face of the loss of humanity in The Social Network Chazelle unfolds the realization of dreams and the death of love leaving as a result the saddest reality possible The director and screenwriter builds this story through the seasons and images with dream colors which seem to be accompanying the idealization of reality but which at the same time are a perfect rhyme with the emotions of his characters and how dreams o love must die at a certain time This is the dark side of the American dream the one that sacrifices love in exchange for the fulfillment of dreams and personal satisfaction something that the creator of this tragic opera understood and captured in the most painful way possible I m not going to lie when I criticize a film I do it in view of its ambitions the vision of its director and how much these two fail always trying to stick to the elusive and almost impossible objectivity However with La La Land I can t help but fall for its charm and embrace subjectivity in its entirety For this very reason this criticism may not have any validity if one does and it only remains for me to say that this movie makes me fall in love Fall in love with music fall in love with love fall in love with dreams fall in love with cinema itself I think this is the greatest gift that Damian Chazelle has given us a movie that makes us fall in love once to us fools who dream,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6050059/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2017,A wonderful throwback or over-hyped?,La La Land is one big awards contenders of 2017 sweeping the Golden Globes and been nominated for 11 BAFTAs at the time of writing and received near universal acclaim But is really worthy of this praise or has it been over hyped Mia Emma Stone and Seb Ryan Gosling are two artistic dreamers living in the City of Angels who inexplicably keeping each other in the metropolis Mia is an aspiring actor and Seb is a jazz pianist who wants to open his own jazz club They soon for start a relationship and encourage each other to follow their dreams but the harsh reality of real life test them regarding the personal and professional life Damien Chazelle is easily considered one of the great emerging directing having already made Whiplash and now has La La Land to his credit it has been announced he would be reuniting with Ryan Gosling to make a biopic about Neil Armstrong La La Land opens with an excellent song and dance number on an LA freeway and Chazelle embraces the old fashion nature of the film The film celebrates the fact it was shot in cinemascope and it uses a lot of techniques that was common in the technicolor era using long tracking shots making the dance numbers even better and the editing transitions But some of the early songs do have the same structure a soft beginning becomes a bigger numbers as the song process and then two thirds through the song one singer has a moment of introspective before a huge finish One of the best moments is a big tap dancing when Mia and Seb start to get to know each other wonderfully reflecting the musicals it s reflecting When Seb and Mia finally get together the musical number pretty much stop and La La Land becomes more like a serious drama about a relationship Whilst this part of the film of fine but it was not the pastel coloured detail that made the first act such a delight It becomes a romantic drama about the highs and lows of a relationship There is a logic in the film having less music during its middle act because of the reality of their situation but one of the big selling points of La La Land was it meant to be an all singing all dancing aware It doesn t go back to being a musical until the third act in an extremely drawn out ending The retro style and story about the struggles in Hollywood La La Land has similarities to 2011 s The Artist the story of a silent movie star whose career takes a downturn whilst an actress he helped out becomes a huge star Both films were celebrations of a bygone era in Hollywood using the same techniques that the films that were referred used This is usually a great way for a film to gain awards attention La La Land personally reminded me of John Carney s Begin Again both similar openings including showing two characters having bad days plot points and themes about success vs artistic integrity La La Land also looks at the reality of a relationship and artistic lifestyle and it is essentially a story about the American Dream looking at the sacrifices people need to achieve their goals La La Land offered a lot of promise with its big opening and the film as a whole should have been a big song and dance feature throughout There is too much of a lull after it s great opening act and whilst La La Land is enjoyable it is not the masterpiece some have made it out to be Moana is the best musical of 2016 and Chazelle s previous offering Whiplash was a better film,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623057/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,What am I watching?,I wouldn t say I tricked into seeing this but I had no idea before going that the film would be a nonsensical forgettable throwback style musical that was clearly written for the demographic mindset of 40 year old single women with three wine coolers in them It was clear that the story supposedly about Jazz or Theater or something was aimed at pasty White people who don t know the first thing about Jazz or Theater Mix in a lot of forced chemistry free smiling brutally crafted ideas for singing and dancing and a couple of out of place f words to make it seem that this is supposed to also be a film for adults and you have a recipe for a bloated overrated piece of glittery junk that looks more like a thrift store basket filled with cheap deceased people s jewelry than the most amazing film in decades I kept waiting for Mary Poppins style cartoon birds or penguins to show up Get over yourself if think this was any better than the awful Chicago which by the way was just as forgettable although it stupidly won an Oscar and beat out several much better films The dumbest film I have seen in years Thanks for the nap,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3624772/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2019,La La Land will surprise ANY viewer in a GOOD WAY!,The incredible work and vision of the creator Damien Chazelle with La La Land seems to have surpassed expectations and the known problems of putting movie musicals together Another Day of Sun A glaring beginning with song and dance on a crazy hot Los Angelas freeway bridge in the full heat of the day The first scene opens with dancing singing and acrobats setting the whole mood with the first words of the song in the middle of a traffic jam keeping both your eyes and ears glued to a scorching bridge over the freeway Little by little you re given a chance to peak into the lives and circumstances of two struggling creatives who find each other through some very particular circumstances not once but 3 times Their personalities seem to collide but they decide that there is an ironically funny circumstance driving them to be together Someone in the Crowd La La Land is a cutely colorful para nostalgic style story that captures the unsaid hunger of those who set out on to make their way to make it in the entertainment business and get caught in life Some end up breaking through the bonds of normal expectation and they get a few breaks Some end up working a low paying job with very few benefits with just enough money to run from audition to audition for a movie role A Lovely Night In the style somewhat of Fred Estare and Ginger Rogers the eclectic version of the life of Los Angeles wannabe stars is played out by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone All the scenes in this almost tangible movie musical make you want to be there you want to see the stars you want to smell the fresh air you want to dance and look over the edge of the hill to see downtown Los Angelas in the glowing hue of the sunset City of Stars The solo warm tones of piano with a lonely piano player who meets a great girl brings you into the essence of a romantic interlude appreciating the atmosphere Gaslights illuminate the boardwalk pier as Ryan Gosling strolls and sings offering a true performance of the professional he is The night seems to sing along with him He dances his way over the walk as the stars and the night become the best friend of Sebastian the character he plays Let s Start a Fire The appearance of John Legend is a surprise that lends to his first debut in a movie with a speaking part His music was impeccable for the scene Let s start a fire La La Land Presents to us a fantasy like reality of Los Angeles dreamers and doers It s a great movie musical that will stick in your mind for a long time with an eclectic version of original music by an artist like John Legend and other music written by Academy Award winning composers like Benj Pasek Justin Paul and more,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4727522/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2016,La La Land,With its extravagant fantastically choreographed opening scene all done in a single long take La La Land shows that it is inspired by the great classic musicals from the golden age of Hollywood yet I can say with certainty that this surpasses all of those Last year the most technically impressive films of the year were The Revenant and Mad Max Fury Road two intense action films This year it s La La Land a romantic musical The cinematography set design costume design and choreography of the film are all pretty much flawless Almost every dance scene is done in one perfect long take as the camera flows naturally with the characters dance and when they are cuts it is edited flawlessly and each moment transitions into the next perfectly The cinematography and editing are fast paced and energetic when they need to be but also slow and elegant when necessary The film is incredibly ambitious which fits considering it s about having dreams and ambitions and just going for them On top of its technical brilliance the film has fantastic writing and characters and just as the set design and choreography and cinematography and lighting and lyrics of each musical number perfectly align the musical numbers flow perfectly with the story The musical numbers are reflections of the characters romanticism of each other and the world around them and as they slowly lose their romanticism the dance numbers begin to happen less Even outside of the musical numbers the cinematography lighting and colors of each scene match the feelings of the characters Vibrant reds blues greens and yellows show up often to depict the joy and happiness of the characters while more dull and standard lighting shows their displeasure with their life at the moment There is also one fantastic montage in which the cinematography depicts how both characters while still in a relationship now feel distant and lonely due to complications with their jobs The film is also incredibly comedic at times mostly towards the beginning and the performances by the main two leads are very charismatic and passionate and it allowed me to easily connect with these two characters Damien Chazelle has proved himself to be among the greatest and most original directors working today In 2014 he did his first film Whiplash and it blew me away Now he has done his second film and it is completely different in tone genre and style yet is executed just as perfectly,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3603788/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2017,"""Dancing with the Stars""",La La Land is NOT a top notch musical in the company of great musicals like West Side Story An American in Paris Gigi The Sound of Music I could go on and on It s a wanna be musical that seems to owe its appeal by being seen as an homage to these earlier musicals without being a worthy musical on its own merit Apparently given its high rating it s also being rated by people who haven t seen these great musicals to realize how bad La La Land is On the positive side Emma and Ryan are very nice eye candy and do some nice acting which helps to redeem this movie from being a complete waste But this is a MUSICAL where leads need to sing and or dance And perhaps our culture has gotten so used to watching non singers sing and non dancers dance in TV shows such as Dancing with the Stars that it s completely appropriate to have the two leading characters be people who can neither sing nor dance But let s not pretend Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling cannot sing or dance Musically there really isn t a ton of music Although it started off looking like a musical with a big production number there s very little music in the middle of the movie A few of the songs are appealing but none are show stoppers or particularly memorable no one would hum a tune from La La Land when leaving the theater And although musicals tend to have songs that reflect the story line La La Land has mostly done away with that convention Oh that must be why it s gotten awards Instead we have a few songs used as themes that are repeated in the movie What about the story It s really a fairly standard romantic trope but without the standard ending Oh that s got to be worthy of an award The movie is also rather long someone should have edited it a lot The cinematography seemed fake too much color and I hated the camera work hand held dizzy work in some scenes and too too many close ups of Emma Most people feel compelled to see La La Land given the number of awards and nominations but it s not really worth the time Go rent Grease or Cabaret instead,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630003/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2017,Vanity,My wife and I found this movie dull We even dozed off a little It appeared to me to be strictly a vanity vehicle for the two stars their undeniable good looks and their mediocre dancing The plot was superficial with a pedestrian ending Before the ending the story line dragged on without much excitement or even interesting twists It stretched an oft told story of romance into a boring feature length film This movie s award performance says more to me about the Hollywood awards themselves than about the movie The Hollywood community praising itself and it s favored members Vanity of Vanities all is Vanity Ecclesiastes I 2,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616921/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2017,"Overrated, why the big hype?",It started out OK but then I got the feeling throughout the movie that the filmmakers tries so hard making it the kind of movie it wants to be A movie where it seems natural to start dancing and singing anytime But it don t That s the major problem for me they just don t get away with it It tries to be relaxed special and weird in a good way artistic but it just don t and it huuurts Then there s the fact that many scenes seems to have been made without any effort of perfecting them there s a long shot were the main characters are small talking on a distance where they have OBVIOUSLY been doing voice overs of themselves the lips aren t even following their words Then there s no chemistry between Gosling and Stone they re just being stiff specially Gosling who s even more stiff when dancing he s pretty cute though And it s absolutely outrageous that Stone won an Oscar for this Haven t seen the other nominated movies but I find it hard to understand that someone couldn t be better than that And what is the movie even about It s NOT a story worth building a movie upon it could be a sidetrack in a bigger film it don t justify itself Too long Too pretentious Mr Legend on the other hand is what his name says a legend He s totally funny And the music is sometimes worth the while even if it s really not that catchy Overall I find it weird that it s so hyped I guess it s our generation that haven t seen the classic movies in this genre and think it s something new when it s really a poor effort of recreating a concept that used to touch,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3673858/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,You might enjoy this if you are La La,A stone cold performance from Emma and the goose is cooked where Ryan is concerned Any attempts to recreate the chemistry of so called Hollywood golden classics it attempts to emulate are a weak fizz Slow and contrived the plot is weaker than a cup of tea made from a tenth dunk of the bag An imminently forgettable score appears built around one pleasant enough motif but is bashed beyond compare There is richness in the jazz that underpins it all but much like its syncopated rhythms this one misses the beat No more so than in the much hyped opening scene I was hoping someone might get some road rage and move the story on The critical hype is clearly written by those with their heads firmly placed in la la land,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608208/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2017,"Over-hyped, over-rated and over here!",I was expecting a wonderful song and dance extravaganza with a great story Wow Was I ever disappointed I wanted to leave half way through it was so cheesy The big song and dance routines in particular were embarrassingly stupid I endured until the end but sadly it didn t even begin to recover my anticipatory enthusiasm The jazz was great John Legend was great Ryan Gosling is a very attractive man and I enjoyed his singing and dancing and found his character very likable but that s all of the positives Emma Stone s character has a vacuous narcissistic and superficial personality with little talent and no idea of real values I could not identify with her or feel any empathy at all for her plight I suspect many of those voting for the Academy Awards may be cast in a similar mould and therefore may have found it appealing There must be some explanation I can t believe anyone with roots in the real world would find this film particularly riveting or enjoyable hence my one star rating,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621695/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,A La La Land That Works,Living in La La Land that s exactly what director Damien Chazelle wants people to feel when watching this film and he really did accomplish that A struggling actor Mia Emma Stone and a passionate jazz musician Seb Ryan Gosling cross paths through a series of weird events that eventually bring them together Throughout the film I really felt like a part of the story and while the writer pulls you in with the compelling plot in the movie many other elements including acting the soundtrack and cinematography contribute to the overall wowing effect Right off the bat the acting seems very realistic Ryan Gosling often plays softer characters with little musical background however when his character Seb gets fired from his job the facial expressions he uses are striking and makes it seem like he really cares about Seb s passion for music During this moment the audience can really see the raw emotion of Chazelle s characters contributing to the wonderful acting and emotional grasp throughout much of the film Again with Emma Stone you can tell she really cares about her acting within this movie because she seems very emotionally connected to her character Mia When Mia is auditioning for her final role for a movie in Paris she begins to cry and have various flashbacks and fantasies Again I really liked the acting in this scene because it made the characters seem more real and connected me to the plot Overall the acting in this movie was great and really added to the likeness of the film for me Also the soundtrack throughout this film continues to show this fantasy effect of a sort of La La Land as well as tie in elements of a theatrical production Usually in musicals the soundtrack can be very cheesy and contain almost all love songs La La Land definitely has some of these and at times I laughed because it was very dramatic and unrealistic But maybe these moments weren t supposed to be funny and laughable Sometimes it seemed as if the soundtrack didn t add the right emotion to the movie as the director had hoped however the songs are very catchy and provide an avenue for soliloquy For example after Ryan Gosling meets Emma Stone he walks onto a pier to what it looks like reflect on the moment but instead he sings City of Stars which although a sadder song does not portray all of the emotions he is feeling at that time but instead adds to this theatrical style that Chazelle creates Lastly the cinematography really emphasises the style of this movie Without it it would break the film to be honest During many moments of emotion or theatrical expression the director does a really great job of capturing it by zooming in to gain a more personal affect and zooming how to get the full picture Also the colors they use in this film are amazing and make it seem as if you are apart of this floating setting the director creates However sometimes I thought the way they filmed it seemed childish because they were so focused on the color and show like atmosphere that some of the deep character development is lost Even though it could be taken as childish I really do think for the most part the cinematography added to the film In conclusion La La Land surprised me because of how great it was and how connected I felt to it when I watched it The acting soundtrack and cinematography in this film very much made it an impactful one,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5432758/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2016,"La La Land is an impressive, magical experience that shows that movie musicals are capable of",A lot of major cities have a lot of hidden history The majority of it can be found in books and the Internet but there are some things right in front of you Take a city like Los Angeles that has plenty of history with Hollywood and the impact that it s made on the film industry Buy a map to the starts and you ll probably be able to find the Chinese Theater Paramount studios and the Brown Derby hat What a lot of those maps don t show is that many elements from Hollywood s heyday are still around like certain theaters homes and even murals You just have to look for them Today s film pays plenty of tributes Old Hollywood is just a part of that La La Land is like a wave of nostalgic feeling from a time where musicals were part of the movie going season and I mean an original musical When s the last time that you remember a musical that was not based off of a Broadway play not counting animated movies It s been a while and to sell one in today s time it would have to offer something we ve haven t seen before La La Land brings back the original musical Mia played by Emma Stone is an aspiring actress who works as a barista for an on studio coffee shop The few auditions she s given are either stopped after one line or interrupted by someone who clearly feels more important then her At the same time jazz musician Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling is having problems with money and trying to get work that ll allow him to play the improvisational music that he prefers A gig at a restaurant only allows him to play Christmas music but he tries his hand at a beautiful melody that doesn t catch the eye of a lot of people It does so of Mia who happened to discover it by chance The two are initially not introduced that evening but they encounter reach other months later at a party The two strike up a friendship which ranges from Sebastian taking her to a jazz bar to curve her interest in the genre to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause This eventually blooms into a romance as the two move in together and continue to chase the Hollywood dreams of making a mark within the world of entertainment I ll say right off the back that La La Land is one of the best most entertaining movies of 2016 I expect this to be a major hit with everyone even those that don t typically watch musicals This is a rare musical where I can recall all the songs being great City of Stars Another Day of Sun and Start a Fire are all candidates for the best song Oscar Director Damien Chazelle Whiplash clearly loves older music as jazz is given a bigger spotlight here then before The tunes plays by Ryan Gosling and John Legend who also plays a part in the story are just delightful La La Land is also one of the best made movies of the year It takes several cues from Martin Scorsese as many of the scenes especially the musical sequences are done with long takes This made me realize just how too often modern musicals rely on editing to make the shooting easier La La Land shows the hard work the actors went through to make each step and tap flawless When editing is present it pays homage to movies of the 1950s How does it do that I really don t want to give anything away I ll give this ten old Hollywood murals out of ten If 2016 has brought down your spirits then La La Land will bring them back up I highly recommend this to everyone This is a fantastic work of art that justifies much of the hidden history and beauty our world holds to us Dance your way to a screening of this and sing a long if you wish,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610057/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2017,Not bad at all. For a musical...,I can admit right off the bat that I m not a fan of musicals AT ALL The only other musicals I watched in my lifetime was Little Shop of Horrors because of the special effects and Chicago because it also won best picture over what I think are better candidates Hardly if ever watched them again So I tried to see what all the hype is about this one Was it good Yes admittedly it is I like the characters The opening was one of the best tracking shots I seen in a movie comparable to The Third Man 1958 along with some other scenes in the movie that I was impressed with The music didn t over weigh the plot and the it made sense within the story especially in Ryan Goslings case I enjoyed this film and could recommend it to anyone willing to give musicals a shot And I would of preferred if this won best picture over Moonlight sorry I just think so,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3705096/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2017,It Ain't Funny Girl,I m not a fan of musicals but with all the rave reviews I thought I should at least watch it before turning my nose up I guess you have to be a fan of musicals or a fan of one of the actors I was neither Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a piano jazz player insisting on playing only pure jazz but finds the lure of the dollar to hard to resist Mia Emma Stone is a struggling actress working as a barista in between auditions They fall in love just as their careers take unexpected turns As for me it took to long to get into the story but it did keep me intrigued as to where would Sebastian and Mia s careers take them Would they stay together Would they break up and then get back together Good movie for the teen girl sleepover,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3819042/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2020,This movie has a special place in my heart,This is my 2nd favourite hollywood film Loved all of Damien Chazelle s films I gave him a lifetime pass and will watch all his future films thats a lot of them coming I am a Bollywood fan so have seen a tonne of musicals And movies with great music are always my favourites I still listen to the soundtracks City of Stars Mia and Seb I am frequently playing the tunes in my head Seb s piano is hands down my favourite ever so that I started learning piano online and ended when I could play the first part of Mia Seb The long take dance had masterful choreography and we can see a lot of hard work went into the film The Purple Sky LA is one the greatest cinematography I have seen each image could be printed out and seen as ART The acting of Ryan and Emma was first class speacialy Emma in the audition scene The chemistry is one the best there is music scene where Ryan messes something up but they both laugh it off and still continue Romance films with tragedy break ups are always my favourites as they stick with me for longer time This movie is more speacial because of the What if sequence That scene is the most relatable thing I have ever seen in my life I recommend this movie to a person and I still have What if scenarioes of my own with her This is one of those movies I promise myself to see every year,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5826814/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2017,Nothing like it,This may be the best movie I ve ever seen It brilliantly uses the trappings of 1940 s and 50 s movie musicals to make something entirely unique I have only seen a few of those movie musicals but this made me want to watch all of them The movie uses a fairly unique form of nostalgia so that those who love the old movies want to watch them but those who don t know the old movies want to track them down I saw it with a friend who while he likes stage shows hates movie musicals and he loved it Usually movie musicals feel like the directors are trying to decompress a stage show with most of the energy of the stage being lost in the process This is absolutely not the case with this movie I don t think I ve ever seen a movie with this much energy This movie also does something that all all fiction should do it tells a story in a way only that medium can It uses the locations the costumes and the subtle symbolism that would be lost in any other medium First if you can see it on a big screen do so I usually wind up checking my watch or looking at the curtains or thinking about something not involving the theater when I see something on the big screen but not with this one The format of the big screen is used to its best here The big dance numbers feel grand and the quiet character moments feel personal and affecting This is to the credit of cinematographer Linus Sandgren who should win best cinematography hands down The direction of the movie is absolutely astounding There are many sequences without any spoken or sung dialogue that are among the highlights of the movie I don t know anyone who can do show don t tell as well as Damien Chazelle A lot of character is also reflected in the truly stellar costume designer Mary Zophres Not only does these costumes look really really good but they are an important indicator of character For example the costume we first see Seb in clearly shows the audience that he s really into retro I would be remiss to review this show and not discuss the jaw dropping score The songs are all excellent with lovely jazzy melodies by Justin Hurwitz and witty lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul There aren t many of these songs there s a story reason for that but they re all gems I would especially like to call out the final sung song The Fools Who Dream The melody is somewhat melancholy but very sweet The lyrics are witty with a twinge of sadness I will talk more about singing and acting later but this is the song where Emma Stone gives her all This is also the rare movie where I notice the instrumental score also by Mr Hurwitz It uses recurring themes or leitmotifs if you will absolutely stunningly Mia and Sebastian s Theme is never sung but it was one of the songs that I was humming on my way out of the theater Mandy Moore no not that one takes these tunes and choreographs them with suitably retro sensibilities This film has drawn many comparisons to Singing in the Rain and her choreography is a good piece of why Also tap dancing I never get sick of tap dancing The actors all knock it out of the park particularly Emma Stone The movie is tightly focused on Mia Ms Stone and Sebastian Ryan Gosling but the smaller characters are all good Ryan Gosling plays this role with elegance and arrogance prickliness and sensitivity However he is eclipsed by Emma Stone Her role is somewhat underwritten but you wouldn t realize it unless you were staring at the script Ms Stone can express more emotion with a slight movement of her eyes than her peers can with their whole bodies She takes the character and makes her a person in ways the script really doesn t I will be absolutely shocked if she doesn t win Best Actress in February The one point of the movie that has some technical flaws is the singing but I think it s justified If you are looking to this movie for Big Broadway Belts you are looking the wrong way This movie has a quieter style to its singing that works very well As for the leads they aren t perfect but they suit the material they sing I did not expect Mr Gosling to sing like that His singing voice is very unique Maybe not the greatest technique in the world but it s very jazzy and distinct Ms Stone spends much of the musical singing in her sweet but slightly breathy head voice and falsetto but as her final song proves she can also belt All of the singing is incredibly expressive The two leads also have glorious chemistry Every conversation every dance break every glance from across the room is believable and you want these two together the moment they interact If you like musicals if you like Emma Stone or if you care about movies you should absolutely watch La La Land,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615085/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2017,"A film of spontaneous, colourful magic and charm",A film of spontaneous colourful magic and charm La La Land captivates us from the very first scene Visually it is spectacular All the elements sing in harmony and coalesce together to form a beautiful artwork It was director Damian Chazelle Whiplash s dream for many years to get this film made and what a passionate special film he has created It is a treat for your eyes and ears and especially your heart But let s talk about that opening scene A hundred dancers enthusiastically and joyously dancing and singing during a traffic jam on a freeway Chazelle doesn t wait he gives us the best from the very start As the audience we are immediately enchanted by a symphony of joy and delightful music I won t spoil the entire scene but it is done with such incredible craft and skill it will be remembered for a long time to come On that freeway our protagonists Mia Emma Stone and Sebastian Ryan Gosling are introduced Both are struggling artists trying to find their way in LA Mia is an aspiring actress and Sebastian is a talented pianist determined to revive and preserve traditional jazz music Through a series of chance meetings the two eventually fall for each other and pursue their dreams with one another by their side The chemistry between and Stone and Gosling is undeniably instantaneous The fiery intensity of their connection reminded me of the classic Hollywood couples we admired and loved like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall A city of dreams there is no better place than LA to tell this story On the surface to those of us unfamiliar with the true essence and identity of the city we can easily be mesmerised by its allure and its potential for achieving our romanticised ideals Chazelle wanted to re create the classic and nostalgic look of the city during the 1950s and he has successfully captured not just the aesthetic but also the timeless feeling the city exudes with a tinge of novelty To Chazelle the sound of LA is jazz Justin Hurwitz s score is a blend of pure extravagance and subtlety With its jazz influences and undertones each note tells a story of its own The trumpet gave the film its life and energy while the piano touched our hearts and soothed our soul I was particularly awestruck at the daedal use of light and the camera work in this film Each shot must have been planned meticulously and yet they appear very natural The dance sequences are flawless effortlessly blending in with the story itself The hilltop dance between Stone and Gosling I can imagine just how much effort was invested to get it perfect As it is taken in one shot one mistake meant that they would have to start again The characters of Mia and Sebastian essentially embody our hopes for romance and our passions Their journey begins with zealous optimism and as the story progresses the harsh realities begin to emerge and unveil themselves as they navigate through the challenges Each one is extremely relatable In this respect La La Land is essentially a realistic fairy tale In the first half we are overwhelmed by its elegance and beauty and in the latter half we get opportunities to rest our eyes a little and that is when our hearts start to feel Beneath the dazzling facade the story waits for us to discover that warm but painfully real dynamic that exists between Mia and Sebastian The music gave this film its rhythm but it is the love story between these characters that gave La La Land its heartbeat Each frame of La La Land could be paused and turned into an exquisite photograph I am very glad for the success of Whiplash otherwise this film may not have been made the way it did It is creative refreshing and daringly speaks to our emotions The songs the dances the story and the characters are immensely addictive The ending of La La left me stunned It took a while for me to process what has just happened But this is why this film is so great The audience is incredibly invested into these characters and when we get results that we didn t expect we understand it It would just take a little while for our hearts to mend,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3639478/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2017,Just a wonderful movie experience,Normally I would avoid any sort of musical film like the plague I don t like musicals I never have and thought I never would But when La La Land scooped up 6 Oscars and was nominated for a further 8 I just had to see it Not only did I not hate it but it was probably one of the most enjoyable and memorable movie experiences I ve had in a long time There are so many factors that contribute to making this film what it is but I just have to talk about the incredible cinematography which is on another level to anything I ve seen before Each scene is crafted with immaculate attention to detail and each frame is like a work of art it really is a joy to watch Then there s Gosling and Stone who bring so much to their roles and seemed to take to the singing and dancing effortlessly I must admit that I was a little skeptical about the enormous amount of hype surrounding this film more often than not it leads to disappointment On this occasion however I think it s justified La La Land is a wonderful viewing experience and one of the year s must see movies,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3770539/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2018,You should surely give it a try.,One of my favourite movies and favourite musicals First of all you should not compare it with classical musicals they are great on there on place La la land is a kind of modern musical which is still revolved around some of the old school techniques It s a great movie Greatly written greatly acted and greatly executed The musicals scores are the best part of it Other than that the movie is unique It s not the kind of movie you ve already seen Don t hear what the people have to say about it Be your own judge and give it a try,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4121518/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2017,Somewhat Disappointed,I finally got around to viewing this tonight and after reading all the hype I was disappointed I don t want to be too harsh on Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone because they are obviously not singers or dancers and it was brave of them to do this To be honest I am not a lover of musicals but I do like jazz Many times after seeing a movie whether it is a musical or not there is some music or song that sticks with me and I end up buying the soundtrack but that will not be the case with La La Land Last month I bought the newly released blu ray of The Boy Friend by Ken Russell which I saw in a theatre in 1971 and is one of the few musicals that I love While watching La La Land I couldn t help but think how it paled in comparison to The Boy Friend in terms of music dancing and amazing musical numbers,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3707354/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2016,La La Land (2016),All I needed was one whiff of the original trailer for this film accompanied by Gosling s City of Stars and I was in love I really loved Damien Chazelle s Whiplash I m generally a fan of films driven by music and that film was a great student v teacher scenario However this was on another level and felt so honed There are so many things about this picture that I want to applaud and I know that if I watched it again I could probably write another essay on a set of different things about this that I enjoyed From the very opening scene the films aura is set The musical numbers are expertly choreographed and the multitude of vibrant colors are present very often Some of the scenes are just so gorgeous and pulsating There are scenes where the backdrop of LA looks magnificent The original songs are very good Even if you do not appreciate a particular song you will love the busy work on the screen There is something going on in every frame your eyes will be glued to something City of Stars is such a catchy tune I wasn t surprised that Ryan Gosling was able to sing and perform on the piano as I m a big fan of that hunk and know he has his own band Apparently he learned the piano for this film which is insane especially if he played the piano for all of his scenes You would think he s been at it for years I think there is good chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling Emma Stone s character is identifiable She s the prototype of someone who has high ambitions passion and is unsure of whether others would feel the same way I found this very real There s an inherent theme of having a dream and how much hard work is involved in succeeding in that dream Its tough to accomplish the dream because not everyone will feel the same way or identify with what you are doing At times you have to take the practical road in life However if you stay on course for your passion you may achieve something down the road This resonated so much for me and I loved it but I don t want to get stuck in talking about that Before I go off another tangent let me just say that this was the best performance by Emma Stone yet Both leads had to show a bit of versatility for this film and they did very well I d say there s not much else going on with the other characters outside of the two leads The spotlight is on Gosling and Stone the entire time and I liked it that way The set designs within the film were eye popping and beautiful to look at A lot of this film is a love letter to Hollywood You see it in the Ingrid Bergman the Marilyn Monroe painting and other places throughout the film The film is essentially a tribute and revival of 50 s Hollywood which is another reason why I really liked this film The musical genre is sort of dying in Hollywood much like jazz in real life and in the film I did not like jazz growing up until I took an intro to jazz class in college and started appreciating the art form So much goes into jazz its improvisation and I appreciated the pioneers of the genre who paved the way of not only other musicians of the genre but popular musicians in other genres to follow I loved that Gosling s character was enamored with jazz and its history The two leads are so passionate about what they love another thing that resonated for me The mix of music and cinema blended so well together The last twenty or so minutes of the film honestly floored me and I really wouldn t change any of it I think a lot of people will enjoy this film From a technical standpoint I think this is definitely the Best Picture frontrunner It doesn t have that heavy handed emotionally dramatic plot that the Academy loves but everything else about it screams the favorite for the Oscar Chazelle did a fantastic job of mixing his love for jazz music and film and finding symmetry with this film I d have to compile a list of the best films of the year but this will be somewhere near the very top Very pleased with La La Land One final thing my man crush on Ryan Gosling has grown tenfold The guy can rock a suit better than anyone in Hollywood and is as charming as they get 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3600811/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2017,Bad but in a really bad way,A film that fails the Turing test in reverse Or something What I mean is that after the first 5 minutes the unpleasant sensation crawled over me that I was participating in a rather sinister experiment watching a movie made by a computer which was testing me by attempting to provoke a human like response Stuffed with algorithms culled from proper movies and musicals the computer has generated a script and a set of scenarios based on user preference and targeted directly at my very own demographic Its eerie the songs sound like songs but aren t quite the dialogue sounds like people but not quite nothing that happens has a real reason or point other than to crank through the plot the jazz looks like jazz and sounds like jazz but isn t quite and the set ups calculated to provoke an emotional effect left me untouched and feeling slightly hollow What has been thrown hurled and heaved at this film is Oscar seeking acting Oscar seeking direction and Oscar seeking technical twiddling And hey ho and guess what it got Oscars Its the apotheosis of junk food finally You don t even need to make the effort to chew it can now just squirt directly into you via the eyes and ears a simulacrum of nourishment over flavoured glop taking the name of real love real music real acting and real life in vain,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3649339/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2016,The ending was lame,I was excited to see this movie but as soon as it started I could tell it wasn t going to be great The costumes clothing in the movie were utterly hideous I have no idea who dressed these people but whoever that person happens to be I want to ask them what the hell they were thinking Could they dress her in any more unflattering clothes It looked like an anthropology nightmare Ryan and Emma also had absolutely no chemistry whatsoever Yes the dancing was OK but I would hardly call what they did singing it was more like talking Lastly the ending was pretty awful 2 hours of my life wasted The only people I would recommend this movie to would be ppl who like jazz or people that like musicals Across the universe was slaughtered by reviewers and critics but it my opinion it was ten times better than this supposed musical,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3606405/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,Sorry Should be retitled Blah blah Land...,What I liked Ryan Gosling what s not to love about such a talented endearing genuinely gifted actor who is also so gloriously easy on the eye Emma Stone s portrayal of a would be starlet Mia is both believable and engaging The cinematography though far from innovative definitely compliments the plot providing an essential dynamism and facilitates a colourful landscape upon which the story sits comfortably The films score is irrefutably blatant in its repetitiveness yet none the less befits the plot and at times is both heart rending and catchy The plot while hardly novel in concept rather a mulch of countless let s make it big in Hollywood films of the past still manages to command interest I didn t fall asleep Indeed I felt myself rooting for the film and experienced an overwhelming keenness for it to realise success What let it down Both Ryan and Emma are certainly accomplished young actors who are completely lovable and engaging So much so dear reader that I am almost ashamed to lament that neither can really sing So let s be real now how can one hope to deliver a seminal musical piece if the lead characters pipes don t cut the mustard Add to that a distinct lack of chemistry between him and her re examine their on screen kisses the passion just ain t there an overly repetitive score a far too obvious plot line weird are they on acid scenes that simply don t fit and far far too many lulls in the plot line where many people in the movie theatre started chatting or going to the toilet etc and you re left with a film that sadly can only be described as average In my opinion Hollywood is so desperate to resurrect a time honoured musical tradition that it has blindly bought in to La La Land desperately touting it an exemplar of musical excellence for the millennium when in truth the film offers little more than a pedestrian jaunt along a lane oft tread albeit doing so with significantly less pizzaz than its predecessors If I m honest however I must attend to the question of why I harbour so much guilt at leaving such a disconsolate review Perhaps I am missing a trick It is possible that this is a film that warrants a second watch or a particular kind of viewer to really get it I advise you to watch it and judge for yourself,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3635109/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2017,Towards a Touching Masterpiece,One can easily imagine all the elements to inevitably appear in a La La Land story and they re all here This might dissuade some to sample this movie but that would be a mistake Somehow through skill and good taste the powers behind this movie and the stars themselves have wrought a miracle a true gem of a touching masterpiece There are times when the schmaltz goes on too long especially in the alternative reality towards the end but for much of the rest of the time one can be held in awe as to how good the music the dance choreography especially for two non virtuoso dancers the acting and directing the writing and the actual realness of it all turns out to be Of course it doesn t hurt if the touch of lunacy the dream theme and the curse of ever trying the impossible have woven themselves through the viewer s life,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3703817/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2017,Greatly Overrated,I went to see this film feeling I had to after the rave critic reviews the 14 Oscar nominations and the high IMDb score I am not a great fan of musicals but remember Grease etc for some great dancing and singing I went with my wife and 3 friends Usually our perceptions and views on a film are quite varied In the case La La Land we were all in agreement that the film had nice scenery and photography and good acting from the two leads but overall was a very ordinary film of a sentimental love story The backdrop is the taken for granted opulence of the California wealthy where even an actress searching for work drives a new Toyota Prius probably hybrid and the lead male character apparently short of money gets a suit made to measure and somehow buys a bar nightclub In conclusion the film is over hyped overrated average romantic tosh Don t waste your money on this but instead go see a much better film such as Manchester by the Sea This is my first written review which I felt compelled to give as IMDb s average score and critics have got it so wrong,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630713/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,An overwhelming ode to the City of Stars,Thoroughly engaging and moving at the same time I remember being floored by The Artist 2011 s Academy Award winning Best Picture and it s still one of my favorites On a similar level La La Land celebrates the transporting power of the movies with music and magic that never feels routine rather a heartfelt ode to cinema itself It isn t just a musical either Like The Artist before this is a very simple film none of that mind bending stuff but also brutally honest on the harsh and often destructive nature of show biz while the media is always ravenous for Hollywood scandals what we don t often see are the painful choices and sacrifices these artists have had to make And for that reason La La Land isn t just a device to revive musicals but also a heart wrenching account of what it takes to be successful in show biz Kudos to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone not just for their Velcro like chemistry but also for perfecting that colossal irony often expected at the movies a happy ending That ending segment when we see what could have happened was almost unbearable but it s also the director revealing the quintessential soul of this film and for me it is in a perpetual state of enchanting melancholy,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615980/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2017,La La Land beautifully unites Hollywood and the Everyman (Audio),Our Hollywood critics Ann Elder and Les Roberts adore this film from start to finish The opening scene has beautiful cinematography fabulous dancing and a great musical number and these elements are carried brilliantly throughout the rest of the film They think it is a fresh look at all the Hollywood musicals of the 20th century and adore the way it portrays the Hollywood outsider The musical numbers are great although Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are not great singers This casting is intentional though because it shows the common man s pursuit of Hollywood Emma Stone absolutely owns this film and Ryan Gosling gives a stellar performance Les was blown away by the incredible dancing Ann and Les hope to see a revival of this kind of original musical For more of their review listen to the podcast here  www thefrontporchpeople com greenlightreviews la la land,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3645689/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2017,Over hyped tedium,The opening scene showed promise with an expansive dance scene but after that the film took a nose dive There were no memorable dance scenes apart from opening and closing sequences The dialogue story line were mundane I wanted to leave the cinema half way through but felt that my wife preferred me to stay though afterwards she agreed it lacked any good music or dance and was awful If you have memorable memories of great musicals from the likes of West Side Story don t waste your money There were no memorable songs Today I don t remember any which says something One song they flogged and played throughout in different ways but it wasn t a strong piece The lead characters failed to dance to any high degree of skill though it could be argued in their defence there was little opportunity for them to dance If you enjoy the musical genre and have memories of West Side Story The King and I South Pacific etc you will be so disappointed Each one of those musicals has a list of memorable songs that stay with you years later This film had none The film will disappear into the ether and be forgotten Hollywood hype and exposure has won over film quality,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626081/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,A Beautiful Film.,LA LA LAND is wonderful even for those who aren t fans of musicals If you like good filmmaking and movies in general this is a must see Definitely deserving of all the Oscars it received The songs are all quite catchy and I had a couple stuck in my head after watching The cinematography is amazing the film is incredibly colorful and a true pleasure to look at There are many many beautifully framed shots with Los Angeles obviously serving as the backdrop and sometimes as the focus The movie is definitely an ode to the classic techniques of Old Hollywood to Los Angeles and to the many dreamers who have and still do call it home Emma Stone gives a career defining performance and has excellent chemistry with Ryan Gosling who is also very very good The script is very sharp well written and witty Stone and Gosling bring it all to life with very convincing and moving efforts Good singing and dancing as well All in all this will likely go down as an all time classic of the musical genre Go see it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5717379/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2018,This movie is all about the ending,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4033616/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2018,Melody,When you look at Musicals as a genre the train of thought is immediately followed by a cheesy and cheeky end that you might ve seen on any other film This doesn t have any this does however contradict logic a couple of times but movie is meant not to be perfect but to encourage perfectness I despise Musicals but now after watching this I must refute from my claim partially This movie has a charm an aura beautiful colors and beguiling melody Jazz is jazzing throughout the movie the reverberations the claps the beats the shakes the chords all blend into unison to concieve a piece as great as this Audio though was a little brittle don t know if it s universal or for the theatre I watched in Watch it if you love Musicals And watch it if you hate them,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4308802/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2016,a gem with full spectrum of emotions,Greetings again from the darkness Is this a nostalgic throwback to the movie musicals of Stanley Donen and Fred Astaire or is it a contemporary film designed to revitalize the movie musical genre in an era dominated by superheroes and sci fi However you might choose to label writer director Damien Chazelle s follow up to Whiplash 2014 it s clearly one of the best and most entertaining movies of the year While the opening credits are still rolling Presented in CinemaScope being the first gag the film kicks off with its only large scale think Busby Berkeley on a L A freeway rather than in a swimming pool musical production Another Day of Sun It s also the first of 3 less than warm and fuzzy meetings between the two lead characters before they finally click Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling light up the screen with the same incredible chemistry they displayed in Crazy Stupid Love 2011 Mia Ms Stone is a struggling actress wannabe working behind the counter at the Warner Brothers studio coffee shop Sebastian Mr Gosling is a pianist committed to the traditions of jazz music even as he toils in a club playing mainstream tunes for folks who aren t even listening As their relationship develops we get a tap dance number in the Mulholland Drive moonlight Soon Sebastian kind of a brooding Gene Kelly or a dancing James Dean is forced to make a choice between finding a way to open his own jazz club or compromising his integrity by making lots of money joining a hot band led by John Legend while Mia is focusing on auditions and her writing which leads to a disastrous one woman show Director Chazelle and cinematographer Linus Sandgren create a look in line with Singin in the Rain but a tone more suited to A Star is Born There is no shortage of romance and music but it s equally balanced with melancholy foolish dreams and shattered hopes While it s an homage to old Hollywood Los Angeles and movie musicals it seems to gracefully swing between past and present and reality and fantasy Mia has a bedroom wall mural of Ingrid Bergman while Sebastian treasures his piano stool that once belonged to Hoagy Carmichael two more examples of past and present intertwined Ms Stone and Mr Gosling possess solid not exceptional singing voices which aids in having the songs tell their story Ms Stone is quite a talent and especially stands out in her audition scenes we feel her pouring her heart out to casting agents who may or may not even be paying attention It s remarkable work from her Supporting work is provided by Rosemarie DeWitt as Sebastian s sister JK Simmons as a club owner and Sebastian s boss Finn Wittrock as Mia s boyfriend and Damon Gupton Also in supporting roles would be the Griffith Observatory after a Rebel Without a Cause viewing the Los Angeles scene and the Warner Brothers lot The What Could Have Been ending sequence is top notch filmmaking in all aspects and perfectly caps a movie that drips with nostalgia while also being touching funny and downright fun Watching this film is much like going through the ups and downs of a relationship and it deserves to be seen on the big screen enjoy the full palette of colors and the full spectrum of emotions love and heartbreak frustration anger and utter joy This is one to tell your friends about don t wait for them to tell you,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3592898/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2017,"Uplifting, sweet centred detour from the norm",STAR RATING Saturday Night Friday Night Friday Morning Sunday Night Monday Morning Mia Emma Stone is a barista on a Hollywood film set who dreams of becoming a famous actress but keeps having bad luck on auditions She crosses paths with Sebastian Ryan Gosling a brash abrasive musician who also wants to make it big and is frustrated at anyone s inability to appreciate jazz Although irritated by Sebastian s manner Mia does admire his musical ability and on this tender footnote they develop a friendship that blossoms into romance and the ups and downs their paths take from this point Damian Chazelle s glossy celebration of Hollywood from a time gone by suffered at the cruel mocking hands of fate in the most humiliating of ways over the last fortnight when the unbelievable drama of Oscars night unfolded across the mainstream media and after being announced as the winner of Best Picture it turned out this was a mistake and the award actually went to the urban drama Moonlight While drawing more attention to this catastrophic farrago seems tactless I had been planning to see it even if this hadn t happened and Oscar embarrassment aside it s still a swirling magical re ignition of a genre that was popular in the golden age of Hollywood While it s a celebration of something from a by gone age it s very much updated to modern times capturing all the funk style and spirit of the modern music and fashion scene and so enthralling to those who are fans of musicals from the olden days and appealing to those who are up on current trends Considering the nature of both the main characters lead stars Gosling and Stone are inspired choices since their personalities match their demeaneurs so well Gosling s moody withdrawn but appealing character perfectly complimenting Stone s sturdy downtrodden but hopeful and resilient heroine And just so it doesn t forget what it is that makes it so appealing to modern audiences the song and dance numbers are perfectly magical too really springing to life at the right moments and lighting up an already beautiful homage to the bygone musical,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655493/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2018,What it feels like,La La Land is a special movie and Damien Chazelle is to be congratulated for creating it Each musical number is in some way an homage to a different previous type of Hollywood musical style More significant though is the way this love story captures the progression of sensations experienced when you are simultaneously concerned about ambition achievement and about love The one criticism I ve heard of the movie is that it s not realistic Really Not realistic to have hundreds of people dancing and singing during a freeway stoppage Who knew The movie isn t trying to achieve realism its artifices are transparent The point is to represent and maybe more importantly evoke in the audience the emotional moments that can occur during the trajectories of two sometimes intertwined sometimes contradictory life goals the desire for achievement and the desire for love,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4188079/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2022,It's a dream come true,Well if I got this script to direct I would have done it the same particular way like Damien chazelle it s my favorite type of storytelling A type that makes you feel like you re dreaming but you it s a dream and you gonna wake up eventually We spend the whole movie with 2 dreaming lovers seeing Thier challenges and how it affects their relationship and the opposite is happening too Regardless how much the movie looks like a dream it s the most realistic musical I ve ever seen it just feels real Actors got a lotta challenges here they had to dance sing play and they should be giving a great acting and for surprise they did and Emma stone is better than Ryan gosling she got more challenges Cinematography like I said looks like a dream it was astonishing beautiful I couldn t like it more because it s not just beautiful it explains the characters feeling just like it says what they feel even the seasons quote that in the brightest day in the blackest night hope will always rise I know it s awful but it s what I feel Music is a whole new world I won t say anything just listen it s 10 years worth At last the movie is a revive to the old era and what is cool that it was explained in the movie it s a masterpiece,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8412356/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2020,Not Worth The Hype,I finally got around to watching this movie and wow what a let down While there were things that were nice about it there was so much more that wasn t First off I wasn t convinced by the love story Sebastian and Mia meet go on a few dates and then suddenly are together There isn t much of the falling in love and in fact they never even say they love each other until the scene where they re breaking up I think for me to be emotionally invested in them as a couple I needed to hear or see more things that showed why or how much they really cared about one another Second I am so sick and tired of professional singers and dancers not being cast in movie musicals There are TONS of people who even perform on Broadway that have the ability to sing dance act etc and they are rarely hired over mainstream actors and actresses It s very frustrating listening to people who aren t really singers try to sing these songs that are beyond their vocal capabilities Emma Stone wasn t horrible but she wasn t great either No one in this movie other than John Legend could sing better than average Third aside from not hiring true dancers I didn t think the dancing in this movie was all that great In my opinion the choreography just didn t have the same wow factor that a lot of the old Hollywood movies had Last I didn t care for the songs There were two that were likable but nothing that I wanted to immediately listen to over again Maybe this could have been fixed by having better singers who could have made the songs into something special who knows But otherwise they were all passable Overall I m honestly really surprised by how highly this is liked,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5828107/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2017,Prepare to be DISAPPOINTED! La La Land or Blaah Blaah Bland?,We should give credit when it s due but not when it doesn t deserve it Damien Chazelle did an excellent job in writing and directing the movie Whiplash in 2014 but not so with La La Land in 2016 This latest film was utter garbage and deserves less than a 1 10 It wasn t only painful for me to watch but I also was robbed of my precious time and energy because of the media s thumbs up reviews which should have been all thumbs down Although the actors where good the chemistry was awkward and boring The story line was a C poor It needed much more substance and quality I will never trust movie reviews ever again How this got so many nominations blows mind This proves to me that Hollywood is truly corrupt and filled with favoritism There are way too many movies better than this that did not get nominated Shame on you Hollywood Shame on you movie reviewers who lied about this being great I felt like I was stabbed in the back multiple times by watching this crap and the lies that are trying to keep this movie afloat Don t give into to the hype This movie is just not right,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633697/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2017,One for the arty farty brigade,I saw a trailer for this and was pumped for it I love Jazz I love modern jive I love dance I love theatre But for me it fails miserably After watching trailer I was expecting something along the lines of Grease Mama Mia or a good old fashioned Singing in the Rain type affair If you are an arty farty type person it may be your thing It was long There was a lot of material that just felt like filler It felt disjointed There was nothing memorable about it Most of the time we were wondering where it was going The ending was abrupt It was clever but after such a long film I felt this bit was neglected It felt rushed I love the actors but this one is easily forgotten Won t be watching this again Disappointed,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3624640/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2017,Agree with other reviewer--- Insipid,OK a musical where neither actor can sing or dance That is not a good idea to say the least I find Emma Stone to be annoying and a terrible actress She is monotone I must be the only person that doesn t like her but I think she is terrible I didn t like either of the self absorbed self pitying characters I didn t care what happened to them The dialog is thin It could have been written by a child The music is uninteresting I did like the one song John Legend did Need I say more I find it sad that movie goers today are finding this piece of trite amazing Don t waste your money,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3641936/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2019,Bland Expensive Mediocrity Clothed In Superficial Nostalgia,When the film started out it was so treacly awful that I was sure this was a gimmick that would be central to the conceit of the movie And the film does improve slightly on the introduction of the second main character about 15 minutes later But lo and behold the script continued to be quite mundane It s as if the suits behind the making of this film said Just write a whatever script that will propel the set pieces that will kind of evoke musicals from 50 years ago Script is most important to me and all the other technical excellence in the movie just doesn t amount to a hill of beans by comparison,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4697854/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2017,City of Stars,This review of La La Land is spoiler free 5 5 A modern Hollywood film about the glitz and glam of Hollywood with an addition of pure unadulterated joy is in very short supply in this crazy sometimes nonsensical world both on and off the big screen This is the short reason why the irresistible La La Land is so cherishable today It s just as light on its feet as Fred Astaire and just as beautiful as Judy Garland Sure enough Whiplash was very intense especially with J K Simmons Terrance Fletcher screaming that s not my f king tempo every so often and throwing a chair at Miles Teller s head La La Land is a little more bittersweet than that in its first half it s footloose not Footloose and fancy free buoyed by the catchy soundtrack such as City of Stars which definitely deserves some awards recognition thanks to the production team for coming up with that Its part New York New York part The Umbrellas of Cherbourg with a little bit of Singin in the Rain we can just imagine the sweet singing voice and quick footed dance moves of Gene Kelly running the streets of modern day LA though it s a bigger budgeted upgrade over writer director Damien Chazelle s short Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench with more or less the same idea The story is Mia Emma Stone an aspiring actress trying to make her life in Hollywood who soon learns that if you don t make it the place will eat you up whole and use your bones as a toothpick she meets with Seb Ryan Gosling a jazz pianist trying to become a famous musician It s an incredible part of the story which is the definition of simplicity and initially as soon as the pair meets the chemistry is electric as sparks fly in every place both literally and figuratively Whether they are singing to a jazz track or dancing on a hilltop to a Technicolour backdrop they are unfathomably a match made in heaven and almost inseparable At one point the two are walking through the modern streets of LA Seb is talking about his chances as a Jazz musician suddenly Mia states that she hates Jazz so he teaches her that it is everything with his irresistible dance moves or playing A Ha on a key tar she learns to like his taste in music a bit more When she gets the chance to star in a one woman play the tension becomes unbearable between the two and they decide to go their separate ways Mia s and Seb s career takes off on a high the two become famous and their life starts to go in different directions Unfortunately there isn t much of a story which falls horribly flat in places due to some sadly misplaced Pulp Fiction esque narration techniques but with the sound track the dance moves and the electricity of the stage the message is clear that La La Land doesn t need much of a story Despite the story falling flat in places their chemistry is electric the music is terrifically catchy the dancing is irresistible and the awards calibre performances keep the film on a high La La Land will make you sing dance and cheer if there is a musical you watch in 2017 make sure it s this one VERDICT Fast paced very funny audacious and beautiful Hollywood doesn t make this kind of film anymore truly an instant classic with a lot of heart it s the best movie of 2017 so far 10 10 stunning,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3617944/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2017,Another Titanic,Another lost love story People that know me will confirm that I maybe don t know to cry but this movie really touched me if I knew how to cry this was my moment She didn t say hi WTF Is definitely a sad movie and probably his purpose is to remind us the humans how stupidly we choose money and a job over love the feeling that many pretend is the focus of their life It is sad to forget what is really important and lose someone over a job choice I find it painful to have the what if in your shoulders but again we all have a different understanding of what happiness means The first part of the movie is quite slow so be ready to give it a chance it is worth it Is not much auction there but again you know you re going to a romance I loved the fact that the story started and ended in winter like the two main characters probably where feeling He hitting the rock bottom trying to find a way to make some money without giving up on his dream and she is training to keep her smile up while at every single audition is rejected and ignored The beginning remind me of Bewitched they keep running into each other like they were supposed to be together The moment the movie starts you will think they hate each other so much they have to be together Is like they are made for each other which by the half of the movie the story line proves you were right they do belong together La La Land is a triumph on so many levels and hopefully a lesson for many single people to think twice before they decide their life This guy give up his career because she asked to and she She didn t say hi WTF,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623199/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2017,La La Land didn't live up to my expectations.,The main 2 characters were well developed but I felt the film lacked in depth and the story was very generic This felt like just another milked Hollywood film with a lack of a plot The film did some things right The main actors were great and their relationship felt pretty real Overall this film was mediocre It did some things right but a lot of things wrong My score for La La Land is 6 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3657457/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,"""West Side Story""",While all musicals since West Side Story are by definition flawed and therefore redundant this one really works Starting with a great number in Los Angeles traffic it also helps that there s plenty of room for conversation between songs and both are well written Also there are some pretty neat visual tricks especially in the final act which even comes with a little twist at the end It s pretty sweet entertaining and most importantly well acted A real treat,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7777921/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2017,Total waste of money and time,What are they thinking How is it possible that this crap movie got 14 Oscar nominations Did they really see it It is bad from the beginning to the end Saccharine style and no substance You see better musical numbers in commercials The opening number was cringe worthy and then it got even worse The singing and dancing is absolutely awful The storytelling is so poor and predictable It is an insult to the intelligence of every three year old And even worse the movie is so terribly terribly boring I should have been warned although because the over hyped movie Whiplash of the same director bored me almost to death before The only reason I did not leave the cinema was the beautiful and charming Emma Stone Even she could not rescue this wreck of a movie In the end it was a bitter disappointment Is this the best what we can expect from Hollywood It is the perfect film for the Trump era Thumb hollow and a big nothing Lets hope this era is short,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627775/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2016,Not a masterpiece,I ll keep this review straight and to the point I liked La La Land but I didn t love it and I m a little perplexed about why it s a front runner for the Best Picture Oscar I think the film looks beautiful from the camera work to the costumes and the lighting Emma Stone also gives a very good performance But other than that there s not much else I can really praise It kept me engaged but I wasn t riveted by it La La Land is an attempt to revive the musical genre by giving it a more modern twist It s about an aspiring actress Emma Stone and a struggling Jazz piano player Ryan Gosling trying to reach success in their respective industries They fall in love without much build up and they encourage each other to achieve their dreams but there are some bumps along the road I don t want to spoil it It s a pretty routine bittersweet love story about the conflict between chasing your ideal career and personal happiness I think the main reason La La Land is getting so much buzz is because it s nostalgic about 1940 s musicals and it makes show business seem like an important industry Hollywood and the critics eat up those kinds of movies I don t think the songs or the dance numbers are particularly memorable though Script wise it s nothing special either Director Damien Chazelle s camera work and Emma Stone s performance are the real stars here While I don t think the actual songs are memorable they ARE filmed well La La Land deserves many technical awards I think most people who go into La La Land not expecting a masterpiece will be very pleased I just don t get the people calling it the best movie of the year Different strokes for different folks I guess,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3605795/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2017,An incoherent mess.,La La Land 2016 Written and directed by Damien Chazelle and that s the problem A textbook example of the folly of letting a writer direct his own script I ve rarely seen such a pretentious muddled incoherent mess The basic problem is that Chazelle doesn t know whether he s written a romantic drama or a musical romance An independent director would have cut and rewritten the script to be firmly one or the other Either way it would have been a good movie As it is two fine actors are wasted as are some fine musicians and dancers Worst of all the movie was boring Only plus some well done jazz,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3649806/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2017,Being a fool who dreams....,There comes to be some difficulty when creating a modern film Certain expectations have been set and the job of a filmmaker is to either meet or defy them La La Land does just that and in the most brilliant of ways What Emma Stone and Ryan Gossling bring to the table is one of the things this film does right Their chemistry and sense of humor play a part in why La La Land will be able to be repeatedly watched The soundtrack gets better the more times you listen to it on Spotify and songs will never leave your head in the best way The thing that absolutely stands out about La La Land however is its ability to display the utter truth of life some dreams have to be postponed or completely dropped in order to make room for the others while still delivering the message that dreaming is one of the most important aspects of life And with all that being said I wholeheartedly smile every time it is mentioned La La Land will always remain near the top of my favorite motion pictures,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3693296/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2017,This is true Cinema in every way there is !!!,This movie is so good it will make you not want to see anything else for a while that s how strong the after taste is The music is beyond brilliant and so appropriate that it just flows effortlessly through the film making it even more delightful your gonna search every track everywhere on the internet and be disappointed with half baked covers my advise would be to just purchase it from Itunes it will be worth it Ryan Gosling is such a James Dean it s not funny He has achieved the Cult Status already hope and pray he just stays longer unlike his predecessors James Dean Steve Mcqueen Heath Ledger Emma Stone grows over you slowly to only make you eventually realize that no one could have done it better The Director has done us a favor by creating this masterpiece for our viewing pleasure and engaging our senses in ways that are totally unpredictable and therefore completely refreshing He has made the biggest contribution to dying Jazz music through La La Land Whiplash I wont get into the Climax because it is the most amazing one you have ever seen and my words cannot do justice to it You will remember everything i have said and thank me later when you do yourself this great favor of watching it immediately in the big screen if you haven t,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619116/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2022,A boring and overrated film that doesn't take off...,Attracted by a lot of extremely positive reviews I made up my mind and I watched it Another film about actors that try to make their Hollywood dream come true with a lot of romance in the process Let s see After 20 minutes watching it had become painful but I decided to resist Maybe the finale could have been surprising I love Ryan and Emma believe me but their talent is so wasted in this directionless boring and overrated film that tediously drags on to a non exciting ending Let s understand each other well technically flawless beautiful photography beautiful music maybe too much singing superb actors but when the direction and the editing is not good enough the film doesn t take off,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8196661/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2017,Mediocre at best,I don t usually bother to write reviews but I just couldn t stand by passively on this one This film simply does in no way shape or form deserve above 6 and that s why I m giving it a 1 now it is at 8 4 currently In a word LLL is mediocre The dancing and singing are poor The plot is clich d yet contrived The characters are charmless and lack chemistry The music is OK but not great at all The acting is alright but just that I could go on The only plusses are on the technical and production sides I thought it missed a great opportunity to tell a more important original and uplifting story about when you don t make it even if you re good It decided not to do so in a really forced and lazy way I don t even know if this is a musical a Nicholas Sparks type film or a feel good comedy It tries to be all and is mediocre to bad at all as well as in the overall end result The movie says nothing worth saying is a bit depressing and very boring which is no small feat considering it s supposed to be a musical Well here s the thing Hollywood to make a great musical you need a good or fun story with great actors who are great singers and dancers You also need at least five great compositions and choreographies Oh I see you don t because people are increasingly sheeple and stupid All you really need is a great marketing machine Come on people Wake up,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3658032/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2017,Atrocious,This is simply the worst musical I have ever seen It was clear to my wife and I about 30 minutes into this that the actors director and composer where too young to remember or too young to understand the old musicals and just how much talent went into those productions The music was dreary and unmemorable the story was uneven and made little sense I think Emma Stone is a delightful actress but this was a huge overreach for her Ryan Gosling was stiff and bland as he is most of the time My advice to people who gave this a 10 please go watch SINGIN IN THE RAIN WEST SIDE STORY THE WIZARD OF OZ THE SOUND OF MUSIC CABARET MARY POPPINS A STAR IS BORN MY FAIR LADY AN American IN Paris MEET ME IN ST LOUIS ON THE TOWN THE BAND WAGON Start with that line up then come back and watch this rubbish and see if its still 10 stars,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3654043/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2017,La la la la...,La la la la afterwords I left the cinema theater dancing with my girlfriend lifted by a strange feeling that my dancing the film the la la la life is not real Anyways movies are not real but part of reality I dislike liking La la land That was a kind of film with all the right musical formulas applied to it but something was wrong See the leading actress Emma Stone She seemed pretending to be that girl who strives in the artistic lifeline waiting her turn The same happens for the main actor They are good actors the screenplay helped the film to get its end in a professional way In the end a good moral message This total sum is less than its parts Why Maybe musical films are out of date because our era is an era of breaking stereotypes and most musicals bear lots of stereotypes To watch La la Land was like to eat the same favorite sandwich over and over because it feeds you well but you are undernourished sorry La la land is good but after an hour or so you feel kind of hungry,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3635692/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2016,Return of the unabashed musical,I ve been waiting for a return of the unabashed musical and this one announces from its opening scene that it s a movie where actors burst into choreographed song and dance routines on the spur of the moment This is a good thing Part of the death of the musical involved the casting of actors who could not sing and or were wrong for the part Naturally I was nervous about the casting Gosling and Stone are good actors as singers they re effective her more so As a dancer Gosling is a little clunky You get the feeling Channing Tatum might have done it better The plot echoes a 30s musical with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler though not quite as artificial and stylized There are also elements of Gene Kelly including a 50s style ballet sequence Plot wise A struggling jazz pianist and an aspiring actress are looking for a break in Hollywood fall in love and struggle when they begin to find success The romance and much of the comedy echoes Woody Allen s screenplays especially Annie Hall and his own musical Everyone Says I Love You luckily the actors don t act as if they re in an Allen film no matter how much the script sounds like they should Story and plot don t tend to matter much in a musical but the lead characters and the love story works The style and design are mostly spot on though it s not a showcase of costume and sets The editing is a bit odd and sometimes it seems that the singing is not quite matching the lip movement When John Legend sings though his songs are not good we hear what a polished singer sounds like and can clearly match his mouth to the sound None of the songs in the movie are breakout hits exactly Emma Stone s audition song is the most effective and but it heavily echoes Paul Williams I could hum Rainbow Connection over it Overall despite criticism I think it s a great movie for the present time It may succeed better as a gimmick given that this type of musical is so seldom made now In a year with multiple musicals I m not sure how memorable this one would be I will say in almost all respects it s well worth seeing and probably seeing in a theater for full effect,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3592740/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,Damien Chazelle does it again.,Firstly I ve got to start off by saying I am not a fan of musicals or romantic films in fact I ve never completed a single one With that said this film was just a delight to watch a treat from start to finish You re probably wondering why I went to see this film after declaring myself to not be a fan of musicals and romantic films That would be down to the fact that this film was directed by Damien Chazelle the mastermind behind Whiplash 2014 He demonstrated his ability to create meaning through sound and cinematography in that film Chazelle asserts his talents in La La Land creating vibrant images that hold your attention The second reason is simple the wonderful trailers I tried to not look into this film too much or reading about it online The teaser trailer gave me enough insight as to what to expect but boy was I in for a treat The narrative is simple Sebastian and Mia meet perhaps through unconventional means at first and fall in love There are many layers to this story however and it most definitely has a lot of heart Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have wonderful chemistry and both are extremely quirky and personable The film has heart through comedic moments that work gorgeous and lavish set designs and the beautiful soundtrack The numbers work and part of me now wishes people would just break out and dance on the motorways much like the film portrays I enjoyed how the film presented the struggles of relationships and handled them in what I would argue is a realistic manner The camera work is extremely efficient in providing information about characters For instance a simple wide shot of an isolated character walking down the street in the film told me a lot of what the director wanted to show Overall this film was one of the most enjoyable films I ve seen in recent times if not the best It really demonstrates the wide array of films out there even in genres you may not expect I can t wait to see Damien Chazelle s project First Man La La Land was a truly unique experience one that I do not regret going to watch,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618885/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,If you enjoy watching movies or are interested in the award season of films this is a must see!,La La Land is Damien Chazelle s most recent project starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone These two actors actresses have been in a few movies together already and you can clearly see that in this movie their chemistry in this movie is so good Their relationship seems so real it feels like you are a fly on the wall just looking in on two real life people in a real life scenario This movie will go down as a classic Let s start with the obvious the music It is so great in this film Some of the greatest song in the modern film era You will find yourself singing the songs repeatedly in your head over and over again And the fact the Ryan Gosling learned the piano just for this movie and played it that well is absolutely astonishing Another thing I loved about this movie is the way they pay homage to older musicals this movie is shot in cinescope and it makes the movie truly beautiful I really love the way Damien chazelle did the shots in the movie he was able to show the classic musical style in this movie so well Now that brings me to my next thing I LOVED in this movie and that is Damien Chazelle he did it again After his great movie titled Whiplash he comes back with yet another classic film He directed this movie so well all the shots were absolutely perfect I can t wait to see what he does next I can t say enough about this movie it is so amazing if you even slightly like movies you need to see this film The performances are so good and the movie really tugs at your heartstrings and makes you really feel for the characters And this movie drives home the theme of the dying art in the film industry and it shows that plot so well I m giving Damien Chazelle s La La Land a 9 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3606675/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2017,A lot of potential wasted,While La La Land is certainly entertaining it isn t up to the level of expectations that critics and awards have been creating The first half hour suggests that this is going somewhere fun among others the scene of Gosling playing the 80s piano man at a pool party is hilarious but then it turns out to be an emotionally flat movie Gosling and Stone are great actors and superb at their jobs but the script turns out to have no tension and you find yourself not caring for whatever happens to them Regardless of how much you may enjoy the dancing scenes which are clever to be correct and cool Emma Stone can t sing and I felt embarrassed at times Gosling didn t bother me as much but the songs are really not interesting or catchy I can t remember any of them so as a musical I d say FAIL of course I hadn t watched the trailer a zillion times The only scene were I could feel some emotional involvement with the story was at the very end with the parallel story thing I truly cannot understand all the accolades it is getting from movie experts unless they are all falling for its Hollywood nostalgia as one critic said it s the endless story about Hollywood in love with itself,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625673/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2017,Don't waste your time!,I had been hearing about this movie for days kept reading everywhere how good it is and decided to go see it Worst decision ever Ever I love me some musicals don t get me wrong but this movie was so boring that my friends and I had decided to walk out thirty minutes in It was supposed to be a comedy Yeah I don t know about that Just another overrated movie But I do want to give it up to Ryan he did an amazing job and that he was the only good thing about this movie Coming from an Emma Stone fan It didn t deserve all the golden globes that it got Hopefully the next Gosling Stone movie will be better cuz they do have a great chemistry,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3629557/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2020,More visual than aural,The City of Angels gets a luscious dream like rendering in Damian Chazelle s muscial La La Land as does the very idea of the Hollywood dream itself The aesthetics are lovely and while no account of the life of a wannabe actress will ever compare to that of Mullholldand Dr rarely has a movie made better use of southern Californian skies The film s essential cosiness is epitomised by the fact that an in film character ridicules the idea that an affection for 1950s jazz makes a contemporary figure a radical artist but the narrative embraces the thought nonetheless true radical art discomfits which La La Land does not As a cinematic musical it lacks the immediacy of spectacle that a live performance provides and it doesn t help that the stars don t exactly have strong voices In fact after an opening section dominated by song there are fewer numbers as the story continues at relatively little cost the strength of this film is more visual than aural,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5805444/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2017,"How was this movie given award for""best screenplay""?!",This movie appealed to the Hollywood screenwriters and actors because it was about them not because it was a good movie It was disjointed and I can only imagine the producers and writers cheering themselves on and saying how they did a great job and the out of touch Academy saying This is brilliant It was very disappointing because we do need more WELL WRITTEN musicals but this one was not and was SUCH a waste of time I will not argue however that Emma Stone is a very good actress,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3748163/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2017,La La Land ShowMeTheMovies Review,Critically acclaimed and currently totaling 14 Oscar Nominations 11 BAFTA Nominations and 7 Golden Globe wins musical La La Land is not as incredible as you would expect Myself and guest writer Natasha tell you why Plot Summary La La Land s centres on Seb Ryan Gosling an overqualified restaurant pianist with a penchant for Jazz and Mia Emma Stone an aspiring actress lacking in successful auditions Upon meeting Mia and Seb push each other to make their struggling dreams a reality and the movie follows how their relationship moulds as they attempt to reach their goals He Said Damien Chazelle director of La La Land clearly knew with this project that he was on to a winner but why did he have to make such a song and a dance about it With its dazzling aesthetic and charm it is difficult to imagine La La Land going home empty handed at this years Academy Awards particularly for costume design and cinematography Emma Stone clearly the star of the show I felt Ryan Gosling s performance was not particularly special nor any of the rest of the cast bar Stone For its praised musical elements certain shots and songs were overused at times every other song it appeared would open with dimmed lights and a spotlight on the performer eye roll Perhaps due to the overwhelming acclaim it has already received my expectations were set high and La La Land was not the solid 10 10 I had hoped it to be The plot itself wasn t overly ambitious and through all its glitz and retro glamour had an aura of arrogance despite being far from perfect She Said Did I like La La Land Of course Did I love it Hmm perhaps not With fantastic use of colour and costumer as well as a hint of Baz Luhrmann esque beauty in its shots and cuts the storyline and catchy songs kept my intrigue until the end But whilst I understand some of the hype I can t help but feel it could have been a little less pretentious This self indulgent piece of cinema portrayed a bland Ryan Gosling some fairly odd pacing or total lack there of and an unusual disappointing lack of chemistry between Gosling and Stone Emma Stone was breath taking as ever endearing gawky and not afraid to laugh at herself but I felt paired with far too Hollywood a role The films music think 20 s speakeasy Parisian jazz cafe contrasted with blatant cheese whilst catchy was paired with some fairly mediocre singing and dancing The whole thing just seemed a bit unnecessary and its overzealous approach to the arts just reminded me of the movie Midnight in Paris FYI not a favourite of mine My final words Over hyped but a fun ride,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3636059/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2017,One of the best movies I've seen this year! (or any other year for that matter),I ve always been a fan not just of fine acting in a movie but of well written movie as well In both instances La La Land does not disappoint From the opening scene to the end credits La La Land is one of the most Thought provoking emotionally fulfilling and romantic films in recent memory The pacing is perfect The acting and writing so good that the movie seemed a lot shorter than it s actual run time around two hours Yes it s that good It s funny too because Jazz is one of my least favorite musical genres However this did not adversely affect my enjoyment of the film one bit It was simply Sebastian s passion Ryan Gosling as Mia s Emma Stone was acting This film has won many awards and deservedly so It s not by accident that the scores on IMDb Rotton tomatoes and metacritic are off the charts I understand that universal acclaim does not guarantee that one will enjoy this film as I myself have seen films in the past that were wildly popular that I did not enjoy as much as the majority But the fact of this films success should grab your attention at least I guess what it comes down to is whether you like Musicals with original songs that are actually memorable long after the movies over Or whether you enjoy an intelligent movie that s well written and executed to near perfection Or if you enjoy the work of Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling Because if you like all or only some of the above things than your almost assuredly going to enjoy La La Land,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623288/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2017,I'm beginning to question the IMDb Ratings system,There have been many many really great movies over the decades This includes all categories from action and adventure to romance comedy and musicals etc For many years my wife and I have used the review rating system here on IMDb to help us make an informed decision about what movies to see and which ones to avoid The last two movies including La La Land had ridiculously high ratings Ratings that exceed some of the greatest movies of all time While we didn t hate La La Land it certainly doesn t merit a score of 8 9 I m a romantic at heart so I didn t walk out of the theater and I endured the slow parts In the end I was okay with the film but walked away disappointed because it didn t deliver on what I expect from such a overall highly rated review Recently a famous retail online website named after a famous rain forest in South America started filing lawsuits for a recent flood of false fake and misleading reviews that make the product appear better than it is I can t help but wonder if the same problem i e hacks is now infiltrating IMDb I certainly hope not NET If you like musicals just reset your level of expectations to average Don t expect to see anything great My time in the theater was pleasant and relaxing I enjoyed the popcorn and the quiet time with my wife but we both agreed it failed to live up to the high ratings found here on IMDb,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3612028/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2016,This is a poor man's Woody Allen movie!,I ve read 8 great reviews on this film I went and saw the movie last night and I m usually a very positive person but was very disappointed The highly ranked reviews must be from Sunshine Pumpers who are desperate for a comeback of a 1940 s musical or don t have a clue about a great musical Chicago West Side Story Moulin Rouge Grease Singing in the Rain Cabaret Oklahoma King and I etc etc etc None of the songs were catchy or memorable The good Emma Stone did some very good acting Also the sets were creative and colorful Miscast Ryan Gosling he can t sing think of a 25 year old stoic Kevin Costner He would have been better type cast in a sports western buddy movie mystery gangster or in a drama Most likely cast as eye candy for the 18 to 24 year old gals The opening scene is a hot sweaty LA traffic jam on the freeway where 50 or more people jump out of their cars and start dancing and singing It s a long non stop shot that is VERY difficult to film think of Orson Welles Touch of Evil but we have all been there no fun brought back bad memories of heavy traffic jams and I just couldn t see the fun in a traffic jam It s like I wouldn t want to see a song and dance scene of a ER room or of Anne Frank No memorable classic lines Show Me the Money You ll Shoot Your Eye Out Kid There s No Crying in Baseball Folks this film will be forgotten in a year Don t expect the next coming of The Sound of Music This is a poor man s Woody Allen movie,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3581720/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2017,Visceral hatred for a con job,If a producer is going to deconstruct a genre the producer owes it to the audience to warn them early on like in Purple Rose of Cairo or Unforgiven This film which has been lavishly praised earns my visceral hatred because it did not do so and I frankly cannot recall a movie which has ever triggered that sort of reaction even though I have seen thousands of them I went to this movie because I was in the mood for a warm feel good movie The promo s and a goodly part of the film deliver that feel good warmth like The Artist but this time as an updated classic song and dance film of the 1930 s to 1950 s You can also see the homages like those to Astaire Rodgers and Kelly as well as a knowing glance to a key scene in Rebel Without a Cause Sounds just like what I wanted But about two thirds of the way through something begins to change no spoilers here The crack widens until the end which at least one review has called bittersweet For me I felt rage I got conned without warning into seeing the kind of movie I did not want to see So you bet I m angry In terms of the mechanics the film does not quite follow the basic lines of an early song and dance musical Invariably there is a secondary subplot involving different characters who depending on the film build tension contrast or comic relief None of that existed here although there were some opportunities which never bore fruit Perhaps some more false leads by the writer I saw them as distracting dead ends There are also a number of plot holes which are annoying a couple of which involve cell phones and unexchanged cell phone numbers that would have happened in real life Any musical expects people to suspend disbelief but the suspension of disbelief is generally in the musical parts not the narrative Two of the best parts of the movie were the acting by the two leads excellent They were also game at the singing and dancing and clearly worked darn hard to do a great job But to be honest Gosling s singing a presumed effort to mimic Astaire s approach was not good and Stone s dancing didn t hold a candle to a really trained talented dancer like the lead in the opening number You can make musicals which have twists like the ending in West Side Story but they don t pretend to be homages they make it clear up front they are something different So for ruining my Sunday afternoon I give this movie a 1,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3611038/?ref_=tt_urv

already loaded with comments and details telling me this is going to be a larger than normal post Possibly exceeding the IMDb word count of a thousand let s see Damien Chazelle does it again firstly where he bashed my head in with a drumstick or two with 2014 s Whiplash which was so intense it had me sweating in the cinema Twice I had to watch it again the very next day and wasn t any less sweaty the second time round An absolute masterpiece Chazelle again displays his absolutely stunning visual brilliance whilst tilting the hat to classic cinema and musicals like Casablanca Funny Face and The Red Balloon Having been to L A countless of times I find it to be my less favourite of the American cities I ve been to but Chazelle manages to add a glossy vibrant veil over the top that s inspired me with a new appreciation for the city I still find it incredible and slightly unbelievable but in a good way that he s managed to take a modern bustling and dirty city and still make it feel retro and vintage using abstract cinematography like creating its very own time zone altogether He even opens using the original 20th Century Fox logo and the fade out focuses make you feel like you re watching a theatre play There s a long list of scenes that stay with you because of this style and of course being a musical Chazelle honours the classic musical methods with astonishing and exuberant long takes that makes your smile stretch from seat 1 to 20 The opening scene alone is a tremendous feat with epic cinematography and beautiful imagery I could dissect the whole movie recounting each joyful and pleasant scene by scene but it s truly something that has to be marvelled at by seeing and not reading The story is about a turbulent romance between Seb Ryan Gosling a confident proud and passionate pianist those ambitions sits with having his very own jazz club and Mia Emma Stone a struggling aspiring actress trying to make her way in the superficial Hollywood The cars they drive is a sweet analogy of their characters in way Seb driving a classic 82 Buick Riviera and Mia driving a Prius It must be familiar ground for both playing aspiring performing artists such as they are in real life Apparently the auditioning scenes which are torturous were drawn from both star s actually experiences in auditioning The chemistry between the two is as always perfect This being their third outing after Gangster Squad and Stupid Crazy Love Gosling oozes a certain coolness but with quite the finazz of confident arrogance Whilst Stone appears vulnerable reserved and bashful but what s simmering is an audacious creative and inspiring woman It s so well balanced and enriched by both you could be forgiven for forgetting John Legend is in the movie Chazelle and Hurwitz love of Jazz shines through just like it did with Whiplash now I know I keep referencing Whiplash but please note these are two very different films which make this all the more impressive It s the similarities such as the music being very much a subject matter to both films I m no expert but I m a lover of Jazz too and this soundtrack itself is utterly amazing infectious and makes the heart glow with instantly recognisable tracks like Someone In The Crowd City of Stars and A Lovely Night Justin Hurwitz composes a mesmerising enchanting musical that reminds me of sitting in Ronnie Scott s and has me weaving in and out of traffic whilst listening to the songs in the car Gosling and Stone perform the songs and dances excellently displaying a gracefulness that would make any non musical fan a lover and a dancer The choreography is majestic throughout especially the two scenes at Griffin Park Observatory the tap dancing in particular Gosling actually learning to play the piano for his parts entirely says a lot about him as a star and as an actor getting the emotion to come through The whole production is flawless and as I ve said before this zesty imagery is made up dazzling costume designs great atmospheric sets and masterful use of lighting The dresses Mia wears set against the plots she s on is just eye candy and Seb s shoes I want a pair of those shoes Have you ever watched a film and thought it was a personally message to you sent from the cosmos whether it be a dig or a reminder The conclusion certainly hit a few chords on my heartstrings bringing a tear to my eye it s the perfect ending to a glorious movie It s only shame is not having enough song and dance but it a good thing to leave wanting more and the film already has a runtime of 128mins As always I haven t read any reviews but from what I can gather from the quotable taglines they are awarding the film with they re absolutely right it really is what everyone is saying A dazzling delightful masterpiece that s amazingly good for the soul heartfelt and a prefect blend of modern and vintage style Being nominated for 14 Oscars 11 BAFTA awards and won 7 Golden Globes should speaks volumes I was totally swept off my feet and urge everyone to watch this film at least twice Running Time 9 The Cast 10 Performance 9 Direction 10 Story 10 Script 10 Creativity 10 Soundtrack 10 Job Description 10 The Extra

19 December 2016,Chazelle makes a statement with this contemporary love story told as an old movie musical,Classical cinema sensibilities collide with 21st century realities in Damien Chazelle s La La Land The Whiplash filmmaker follows up that highly acclaimed effort with its tonal opposite a breezy colorful romance wrapped in original songs and musical numbers While something feels contradictory about combining a contemporary independent comedy with an old Hollywood movie musical Chazelle blends the two with visual ingenuity and strives for the utmost artistic integrity The result is a wholly unique albeit strangely familiar movie going experience The 31 year old Chazelle has made a couple things clear in his short but noteworthy career thus far he really loves movie musicals and he really really loves jazz Jazz music has played an integral role in all three of his features and two of his films have featured original song performances La La Land follows aspiring actress Mia Emma Stone who keeps having fated encounters with jazz pianist Sebastian Ryan Gosling until their Hollywood based romance blooms and they challenge each other to pursue their dreams in new ways The film goes heavy on the music early on as if to announce itself as a full on musical It opens with a rousing number during gridlock traffic on the LA freeway Another Day of Sun intended to look like a single take full of sweeping camera movements bright colors and diverse faces Not long after we see Mia musically preparing for a night out with her roommates Someone in the Crowd in stereotypical fashion a number that ends in a choreographed pool party sequence Yet these are two of the five original songs in the entire film In other words Chazelle didn t start his film that way just to be cute Once Mia and Sebastian finally connect on a sunset stroll that results in tap dancing A Lovely Night the musical numbers slow down and what few new songs remain are of the soul searching introspective variety Chazelle organizes the film in seasons and the tone changes as we go from winter to spring to summer to fall So while he begins the film in a showy way creating an idyllic portrait of Hollywood and romance the story slowly accumulates more depth and we see the characters their relationship and their struggles more clearly Stone and Gosling s on screen chemistry has already been proved twice before Crazy Stupid Love Gangster Squad and that makes Chazelle s job much easier Having movie musical chemistry and screen presence is a whole other beast however and in this regard Stone really steals the show Gosling looks unbelievably sharp and he clearly devoted a lot of time to his piano skills in preparation for his role but he s more cool than charming almost too cool Perhaps that s by design but Stone has the singing starlet aura She s effortless to watch and love qualities that Gosling has but not to the same degree and not in a way that s utterly transporting Both actors however provide exactly what La La Land needs in terms of being a contemporary comedy Both have excellent comedic credentials and dramatic chops their performances embody the fine line between playful humor and emotional honesty that reflects how Millennials see themselves in the world and lest we forget amidst all the old timey flair in this film that Chazelle brings a Millennial perspective to the director s chair Part of that perspective is that movies like these especially musicals are far too rosy They create unrealistic expectations those of us who grew up with this art and internalized its fantasies as truths or ideal to strive for have felt burned This is a particularly common theme among contemporary films and TV shows but Chazelle is really the first to address it from a place of deep love and intimate knowledge of the genre To satirize and provide effective commentary on a genre you kinda need to master it in its most classical form and Chazelle demonstrates impeccable skill in this regard We already knew from Whiplash that Chazelle could film people playing music in an electrifying way he s sure to make the world s best music documentary someday but the way he s able to break out of the two dimensional viewpoint that most musical directors even movie musical directors fall prey to and craft visually compelling musical numbers warrants all the awards attention he s already getting for this film La La Land isn t emotionally sweeping like most people want from a romantic musical but its honest message and craftsmanship elevate it from an interesting experiment of blending old school with new school into a powerful reminder of what it really means to love and what it really means to dream big Steven C Thanks for reading Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3602413/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2016,"A Great Score Accompanied by Genuine Writing and Performances, Unfortunately Falling Flat in the Second Act",La La Land follows Mia an aspiring actress and Sebastian an aspiring jazz pianist who meet and fall in love Upon my first viewing I really didn t care for this movie The music made it stand out but that was about it On my second watch I found that while it could be tedious it was a very well made film Let s start with the obvious which would be the music It s fantastic Every single number is memorable and a pleasure to listen to well after seeing the film This effect does die a little after the second viewing but perhaps that was due to the fact that I saw it mere weeks after my first watch and everything was still fresh in my mind Regardless there s no getting around the fact that the score is great But more than that it flows into the movie really well No track feels forced into the movie for the sake of slapping a musical genre sticker onto it It takes time to both allow the music to play then the audience to get into it The music always fits the movie well too so none of it really feels unnatural save for maybe one track towards the end The acting is very good and while I definitely don t think these are the best performances either actor has pulled off they were very impressive regardless Both Gosling and Stone get into their roles so much that they feel authentic and moreover seem like they could actually be lovers in real life Or at least really good friends The performances are a great compliment to the writing which is also fantastic The conversations are authentic and I could legitimately see myself speaking in a similar way Just probably not about jazz And sure the movie follows the typical romantic movie formula but most every aspect of that formula is handled in an almost seamless way It takes it s time to build up the two leads relationship at the beginning so that it doesn t feel rushed and the end is handled in a very realistic and engaging way The directing here is most always stellar The movie opens with what appears to be one long take of an entire musical number and probably the best in the whole movie While that single take gimmick was easily faked it still goes on for quite some time in between the obvious cuts There is one scene in particular aside from the opening in Gosling s character s house that is spectacular Sure it could have easily been cheated but it looks great regardless There s a style to it and it s clear that whoever chose that shooting style knew what they were doing Despite all the glamour and masterful film making on display this is not a film without flaws While it does follow and improve upon the romantic formula it still has trouble putting the love into the leads relationship The turning point is mostly understandable but little things about it make it harder to accept as reality Other little things here and there bothered me but that was the biggest of those gripes My biggest problem however was with the second act When the two leads finally start dating it divulges to the Hollywood clich of showing a montage of the two lovers running around together instead of actually developing their relationship If there was even a little of that in the in between portion to build a bit of early relationship them I think I d have liked it enough to put up it s rating It made a jump that just didn t flow and I had trouble looking past it Overall La La Land is nearly amazing The performances are while not necessarily Oscar worthy pretty darn close the music is outstanding the directing is usually amazing the writing is authentic and just about everything else is great too However it suffers in it s second act and a few other little places here and there In the end I would recommend this movie,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610176/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,A romantic comedy that won the major oscar awards,This is a romantic comedy that won the major academy awards and its a really big deal for a romantic comedy Normally romantic comedies are not that favored for oscar recognition but LA LA land is that rare movie that scooped the best director best performance by an actress in a leading role best cinematography best production design best song best music score This movie is absolutely beautiful and gorgeous it s a feel good movie with a message The dancing is songs are top notch Emma stone is such a delight to watch as she s charming and delicate its no wonder why she won the Oscar award,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8598781/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2020,Hollywood cliche after Hollywood cliche. They work!,La La Land 2016 was written and directed by Damien Chazelle The move stars Ryan Gosling as Sebastian a pianist dedicated to jazz and Emma Stone as Mia an aspiring Hollywood starlet Naturally they fall in love Director Chazelle doesn t try to avoid cliches he glories in them In fact the movie is filled with cliches What we have to remember is that cliches are cliches because they work This is the film you want to see when you re not in the mood for a movie about a misunderstood German army officer or a downtrodden Bulgarian railway worker It s all singing all dancing and all romance It would definitely work better in a theater but it worked well enough on the small screen La La Land has a very high IMDb rating of 8 0 I thought it was even better than that and rated it 9,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6144260/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2020,Best Movie I have seen in 15 years,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6221873/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2017,A Musical That Is Pure & Magical,Charming Magnificent Great This was a pure magical cinematic experience I love musical movies and I was waiting for this movie since I heard about it Wow It exceeded my expectations Ryan Gosling Emma Stone were perfect Now we can easily say that Damien Chazelle became one of the important directors working today Everything was stunning in this movie The songs and the music were amazing The dance sequences were done brilliantly The cinematography the editing and the production design were excellent A lot of people said that La La Land looks like a dream Yes it is a dream A dream that has a lot of charming moments but also has sad moments If you have big dreams or passion about something you will find this movie inspiring to let you follow your dreams and passions La La Land is one of the biggest surprises in 2016 I was really happy with every second in it I enjoyed it on so many levels And again since I am a big fan of musical movies it gave me full satisfaction,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3613499/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2018,Awful in every way,Two annoying clueless white people drone in monotones and shuffle around Emma Stone cannot sing Ryan Gosling cannot sing Neither can dance Neither of their characters is likeable The acting is non existent The storyline is bilge I am at a complete loss when it comes to the Oscars and the hype because this film is just plain terrible in every way,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4073478/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2017,Truly awful and amateurish,After getting over the fact neither of the two actors in this movie deserve leading roles I steeled myself to watch this movie and thought I d give it the benefit of the doubt The movie starts with a song and dance on the freeway and everyone getting out of their vehicles and dancing and singing together Sadly this was supposed to be one of the highlights of the movie As I said I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but the first song was forgettable boring and the voices weak The dancing looked extremely forced and clumsy As the movie progressed I couldn t believe how bad it actually was I don t know anything about Ryan Gosling other than he is no leading man in my view Contrary to what others would have you believe he is not handsome Eyes too close together a very long face and a perpetual gormless look Emma Stone isn t much better It was actually very difficult to watch the entire movie It s slow and amateurish and looks like it was directed by a 15 year old The sets look cheap and the whole thing made on a budget of 500 It also seemed like it was made in the late 1970s A TV musical Wholly forgettable HIGHLY overrated Madly so it s criminal Avoid unless you re being paid well by someone to say it s great,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628752/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2016,could have been better,Movie Starts on a great note but looses steam in between The director could have done something about this there are scenes in between why you start feeling the protagonist is acting in the movie Its a good movie no doubt but i was comparing this to all time classic musical hit The Sound of Music Director should have retaken some scenes to have a smooth flow between the events for ex the way Mia ditches her ex makes no sense She just runs away to see a movie with a new guy crazy Sebastian is having dinner with Mia the dialogues look so forced on to the audience compare the other romantic movies the notebook or 50 first dates The feel that you get after watching the movie it stays on for few hours I liked the idea of the ending but again looks very disconnected 5 years not in touch what came in between them for those 5 years ego or plain interest lost between them don t try to pull a Nolan here,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3604525/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2017,Very boring movie,I must admit that I am not even such a big fan of musicals so I wasn t necessarily disappointed by the music But this was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my life I almost couldn t finish it I was expecting to like this as the imagery was beautiful and I like almost any love story no matter the style of the movie But each scene was void of any feeling The story was nothing I am sorry but I really couldn t enjoy it,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3718172/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2017,Painful to Watch,La La Land is certainly the most hyped film of the year Maybe it s a film for people who don t like musicals or have never seen a really great musical film As much as I like both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone neither of them can sing or dance well enough to star in a musical It s mind boggling to think of all of the talented men and women on Broadway who could have really nailed these roles The opening musical sequence is embarrassing And way too long kept looking down to avoid watching the screen Also much of the plot is a rehash of another crummy musical New York New York 1977 At least that one had Liza Minnelli to sort of save the day whenever she started singing The ending especially is the same downer It doesn t work So catch this on a rental if you re curious but it was not enjoyable Will probably win all kinds of Academy Awards knowing Hollywood it s that bad,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616209/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2017,Pretty but boring,I came into this with low expectations It has managed to surprise me with how utterly boring and awkward it is It is beautiful The shots the costumes the works That is one thing he has going for him and I now completely understand a big reason why I found Cloverfield lane so amusing to watch even though its over the top and weird He truly has moments of brilliance in setting up a scene But as a story and a musical its incredibly boring The songs are completely forgettable for the most part the singing is using soft falsetto voices making it often difficult to read any emotion from them and in some cases even difficult to understand at some points The dancing of our stars seems like they are just trying to get the steps right There s no ease of movement that musical lovers are expecting and are used to When you take into account that the choreographies themselves are not that grand or impressive it makes it even more obvious that our stars had no time to think about the emotion of the scene but were focused on getting the steps right There s no lightness to it when you compare it to classical Gene Kelly movies for example It makes it very boring to watch because there is no chemistry I found myself more interested in the costumes and the back rounds than the characters Its not funny but its not serious enough either And Emma Stone is amazing for funny for me at least This one didn t get a laugh out of me It didn t get me invested in the characters either I think its partly because for the longest time the movie makes us think the characters themselves don t really care so why should we And this kind of superficiality would work if the music numbers were more exciting and fun There is a reason Audrey H was dubbed in certain movies they understood that they needed a strong clear big voice This movies choices baffle me The only reason I can honestly think of this being praised this much is people going along with professional critic and the movie attracting an audience that hasn t seen musicals before with Emma and Gosling I could understand how someone who hasn t seen any of the amazing musicals out there would be in love with this movie And if this movie inspires them to look those up and see what they are missing i ll be satisfied,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3688476/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2017,A leap into imagination,What a sweet film Like Birdman this is a very unique picture that offers something revolutionary to the eyes and ears It fits into the category of complete escapism like in the Golden Age of cinema If you are looking for a musical with political or social overtones you may be disappointed This is a very simple story about love and following your dreams in Hollywood It manages to avoid a lot of the cheesy parts and is not your average musical you see on Broadway The two leads are brilliant to watch and extremely likable And the production design is breathtakingly beautiful This movie will definitely win a lot of awards,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630200/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2018,"A notch above ""Just OK""",I see a lot of 10 star and 1 star reviews here I cannot see the justification for either One of the goals of cinema is spectacle Yes you have drama and comedy But another way to get to spectacle is the musical I neither love nor hate musicals but probably lean closer to not liking them than liking them So I am no expert about singing and dancing As far as I could tell the dancing and much of the singing in this movie was adequate Nothing blew me away and nothing made me cringe Emma Stone has a pleasant voice and she looked very nice in a girl next door sort of way Ryan Gosling though seems singularly non charismatic and his singing was meh In times past producers would dub better singers for the actors in certain musicals Everyone knows that Marnie Nixon provided the singing for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady I saw some of Hepburn s tape from when she was singing those songs She wasn t bad at all But she wasn t Marnie Nixon Maybe they should have done something like that for Gosling Overall I found the film a notch above Just OK,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4047551/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2017,Worst Musical Ever,Bad music bad lyrics horrible acting poor direction dismal writing There is not one good thing I can say about this dismal disaster other than the writer director should be banned from ever making another film for all time Not only is the acting horrendous but the singing is non existent And I speak as a gay man who loves a good musical and has appeared on stage professionally in quite a few It really shows the dismal state of Hollyweed that this would ever even have been nominated for any awards But then that is what it has come to Even the good musicals have been destroyed by making them into films i e Sweeney Todd Chicago ad nauseum The art of the musical is now officially dead and the participants here have killed it forever,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3766840/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2017,Most overrated movie of all time!,This has to be the most overrated movie of all time and it nowhere near deserves this attention and surely none of the hyped awards La La Land is a cute story mediocre movie and has some nice dance and music scenes but THAT IS ABOUT IT The singing of Emma Stone and Ryan Gossling is absolutely a joke and falls flat entirely It does not reach the quality of Moulin Rouge or other film musicals like Dream Girls Well maybe it isn t even a musical at all and they happen to just sing a bit I can not understand the hype and accolades this movie gets Most overrated and boring movie of all time,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626746/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,Dare to dream vs Reality,I admit it I had a preconceived perception that this film is overrated and hyped up Maybe I felt like this because it s a musical But the truth is that we are dealing with something exceptional First of all I ll divide the film into two separate parts The first is the one which could call the musical part It s what you expect to watch in a classic musical But there is a big difference here The difference is called Damien Chazelle Whiplash This extremely talented young auteur creates a directing masterpiece We should regard his work as a directing tutorial The frames the one take moments and of course the brilliant jazz music are working on a perfect way to create a wonderful nostalgic atmosphere which looks alike a hyped 60 s romance Think about all these elements you adore about musicals in addition with a superb directing Now the second part is what makes this movie substantial and differentiates it from other musicals I couldn t have thought even at the beginning that this story will be so powerful The script is the quintessence of motivation a hymn about dreams The leading couple Sebastian Ryan Gosling and Mia Emma Stone balance their romance on their dreams and goals They fall in love just because they inspire and motivate each other But can this love endure the reality Or more essentially can these utopian dreams overpower reality Each character has goals and aspirations but what does it really happen when reality strikes Damien Chazelle knows how to reflect the right principles about life La La Land is full of such principles and it turns into a big life lesson where Chazelle deciphers daily life and suggests that we dare to dream Of course the film won t be successful without the fiery leading duo I think Emma Stone is a big surprise here with a performance which can be finally considered as first class On the other hand Ryan Gosling is that kind of the actor who performs brilliantly at pretty much everything Their very chemistry ensures film s success La La Land is probably the best film of the year It is realistic and dreamlike at the same time It is a reflection of reality dressed up in a romantic artistic musical and theatrical outfit,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608131/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2017,Not Best Movie caliber,While I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in other movies I didn t think this one was all that it was hyped up to be I love musicals but this one didn t move me at all Best Supporting Actress C mon Best Movie nominee Don t think so Even the dance sequences were cheesy Not a repeater,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3840762/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2017,Worth the hype,There was so much hype surrounding La La Land before it even came out so I thought I d go and see if it was worth the hype The answer happily is yes La La Land is a modern musical that is also reminiscent of classics from the past It boasts two very good central performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and a story line that allows us an audience to root for both parties It s a musical so of course it s all about the songs And again there are some lovely ones Some leave you wanting to clap along while others can leave you close to tears If that s not what music is supposed to be like I don t know what is Yes there are some slower moments but on the whole this is a rare film that is worth the hype,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618432/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2016,Here's to the ones who dream!,Some days ago I travelled to a beautiful land called La la land La la land is not just a musical It s not just a love story or just a classic romance film with a happy couple at the end It s a movie about dreams and hope love and passion music and dance It s a masterpiece and we must all admit it After the success of Whiplash Demian Sazel produces La la land with Rian Gosling and Emma Stone being the protagonists as Seb and Mia Mia and Seb believe in the right of dreaming and they both want to make their dreams come true Mia wants to become an actress and Seb to open his own bar full of jazz music and chicken They fall in love with each other and together they try to deal with their difficulties and make their dreams come true La la land is a musical that will make the audience stand up and start dancing like crazy It s a film with unforgettable songs like City of stars or Audition that will make everyone to feel extraordinary happiness The songs fit perfectly with the scenes and make us either laugh out loud or burst in tears The structure of the film is based on the four seasons of the year This is a really clever move because when for example it was fall that meant that the couple will start to have fights and argue with each other The performances of the actors were awesome Emma Stone one of my favorite actresses was excellent and Ryan Gosling one of my favorite actors made me like jazz music La la land is a film that compares the happy side of life and the desire of dreaming with reality and shows the importance of love and hope It s the best musical I ve ever seen so far The final scene of the move which is probably the best one because it makes the movie special and heart breaking will make a lot of people cry and with the same way the other scenes that are full of music and dance will make a lot of people to dance like crazy La la land is a film that stays with you until it makes you wake up It s a movie that makes you laugh cry dance sing feel love and of course dream big As Emma Stone after winning the award of the best actress in the Golden Globe awards said This is a film for dreamers and I think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world and that s what this movie is about So to any creative person who s had a door slammed in their face or anybody that feels like giving up they must get up and keep moving forward La la land is the best movie of 2016 I have watched it three times in the cinema so far and I want to see the particular movie again and again until I become part of La la land the city full of love songs and dreams With great actors fantastic songs a beautiful background of L A and with a really thought provoking story La la land is clearly a land that all of us would like to visit,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3604527/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2017,"""La La Land""- A wildly charming and entertaining throwback to old-school Hollywood romances and musicals. Though it's a bit too in love with itself at times.",One of the year s lead contenders for awards season La La Land is a memorable and expertly crafted throwback to old school Hollywood musicals and romance boasting top notch direction thoughtful handling of characters and exquisite performances from all involved It truly is a remarkable film in many ways and it s never anything less that completely charming and entertaining It just might be one of my favorite films of the year and yet I really cannot in good conscience give it a top notch score because for everything it does right it does have one major flaw that just barely holds it back from perfection The film tells a classic tale of romance in the City of Angels Struggling actress Mia Emma Stone is yearning for her big break in show business and has a series of chance encounters with the gruff but well meaning Sebastian Ryan Gosling a man who is also a dreamer with big goals in life and a obsession with jazz As time passes a very tender and heartfelt romance blossoms between the two which may be threatened when they are both given opportunities to do great things but also things that will make them question their aspirations and their relationship with one another Written and directed by the phenomenal Damien Chazelle La La Land is a powerhouse when it comes to style production and performance The film is a sort of loving homage to the Hollywood of yesteryear and is filled with bright pastel colors and absolutely stunning musical numbers that capture the imagination in a way few films can nowadays From a mind blowing and bombastic single shot opening dance sequence on an Los Angeles highway through slow and contemplative sequences of dialog where characters muse about their goals and dreams Chazelle is always at the top of his game His sense of flow pacing and tone is just magical and viewing the film really takes you back to the feeling you used to get when you watched the old studio classics of the 30 s 40 s 50 s and 60 s His sense of character establishment and development is also something to behold and he crafts his story of romance with a keen feeling of grounded realism and sensitivity Phenomenal work The film s stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are just magical on screen together And they re a key part of the puzzle that makes the film so enjoyable Not only do they have an infectious and giddy chemistry together but both are also just darned good in their own ways Stone s wide eyed and innocent optimism is instantly identifiable to anyone whose ever had a dream to do something great and her emotional turmoil as she goes through the ups and downs of show business lets her stretch her chops wonderfully And Gosling nicely compliments and contrasts this as a character who wants to do great things but always seems to have to compromise He s a perfect foil to Stone and in a weird way they can almost be seen as the same type of character only having gone down different paths Unfortunately I can t help but feel there is one critical flaw that haunts the film and holds it just shy of being a masterpiece And that is the fact that the film is often in love with itself too much To the point it becomes a detriment I know that sounds silly but that s the only way I can describe it There s so much to love in La La Land but oftentimes the deeper concepts and themes that are brought up take a backseat to style and reference There will be a wonderful scene where two characters share a deep and meaningful moment only to be followed up with Gosling dumping a slew of references to famous jazz musicians or Stone having a doe eyed moment where she looks classic LA iconography And as a result well it becomes uninteresting and pretentious at a few key moments A film needs to be in love with itself and everyone involved should love the material But it goes a bit too far at times here That being said I can t help but admit this is probably one of the year s best films and this flaw doesn t detract the excellence of virtually every other aspect of the proceedings This is a work of cinematic art and is filled with love and passion from all involved And it s just a wonder to behold It just isn t quite perfect And so I give La La Land an excellent 9 out of 10 Definitely check this one out on the big screen It deserves to be seen in theaters,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631399/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2020,Most Emotional Movie,I was enchanted by this film musical films are not my favorite genre but this film struck me immediately I thought it was famous only for the presence of John Legend instead it has a secondary role I think the storytelling is perfect it keeps you attached to the screen for the duration of the film The songs and choreographies are simply gorgeous I think it s perfect from start to finish starting with an incredible long take and ending making you cry The photograph has goose bumps colors The direction and editing perfect This is a film that you can watch over and over again every time you you are surprised more and more after 5 minutes of viewing it has become an instant cult for me as soon as the 1st vision is over it has become my favorite film and every time vision is even more so Thanks to Damien Chazelle who after Whiplash and Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench gave us another extraordinary film and I hope it can continue like this,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5511332/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2016,A thoroughly captivating modern take on the traditional Hollywood musical,The struggling actress meets a determined jazz musician and they fling themselves around Los Angeles sights and scenes while slowly falling in love Ho hum But I found a lot of Ho and much to hum along to This film swept me up in a way I wasn t expecting and the effortless gliding between such a range and contrasts of styles situations and emotions worked a treat There is sentimentality quite a lot actually but also pathos doubts despair firmly grounded reality unexpected twists and over the top implausibility Los Angeles proves she has some fabulous settings and backdrops many dating back a long way which give the city more style substance and depth than the abundance of concrete freeways and glass office towers that generally appear It is a film of two leads Ryan Gosling as the jazz pianist Sebastian and Emma Stone as wannabe actress Mia There are no other characters of substance There is quite a lot of jazz mostly modern a little trad and some pleasant tuneful jazz pop musical style songs If either of the leads or modern jazz is a turn off for you then it mightn t be your cup of tea because there s a lot of all three Ryan Gosling gets my special mention award for playing his own piano and really well It s the next level up from performers like Geoffrey Rush as David Helfgott who can play and make a convincing show as a real pianist But Ryan s effort is the real deal The film is well structured and I suspect has many references to earlier classics most of which I failed to notice But the re creation of Walt Disney s dancing fairy in the Griffith Observatory was just wonderful I found it an effortlessly entertaining couple of hours with that feeling of How did it get to be that late when we emerged Damien Chazelle as writer and director in my view has scored a hat trick a home run a set to love or whatever your favourite sporting accolade is As an Aussie Rules follower it s probably kicking the winning goal after the siren,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3599710/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,Best freaking picture,of the year of course This movie is so mesmerizing Im totally sucked by the cinematography the lighting the color Itsjust so perfect The initial announcement at the oscars was never wrong I mean yes the meaning is just so alike to other movies but this picture is a song How the songs just blend into life of the lalaland world There s too much to say about it In short BEAUTIFUl,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5620306/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2017,Disappointing. What could it have been if Chazelle had given over the writing to someone else? One can only imagine.,Disappointing The story ending seemed like a compromise I wasn t impressed by the flashback to what their life could have been like It wasn t mimicking the ending of legendary musicals like Singing In The Rain or films like A Star Is Born about a couple whose stars are in opposing trajectories So what was it trying to achieve A muddled and unsatisfying finish was all I was left with They both get what they want in their careers but not each other Hmmm The music is weak overall mumbly and the dancing isn t remarkable apart from the opening number It s beautiful to look at and the production values keep the whole thing running to a point but you can only admire the beauty that David Wasco Austin Gorg and Sandy Reynolds Wasco created Production Design Art Direction and Set Decoration for so long I expected more from Damien Chazelle Maybe if he had stuck to directing and given the story over to someone else it might have made me like it more,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620946/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2017,The Motions,My sisters were naturally my babysitters growing up They watched endless musicals ad nauseum Years later I hear a melody and can practically see the dancers performing the routine associated with that melody After the Oscar nominations I could only imagine my sisters both bursting forth with are you kidding You see after watching your first dozen musicals the expertise of truly memorable dance flow becomes evident Going through the motions is normal flow Expressive rhythmic flowing motion can be performed by PROS flawlessly with every step though every step is not award worthy Many current Hollywood actors actresses could have performed the same motions as Gosling Stone Many would have done a better job The point is just flowing through the motions doesn t make any performance award worthy,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3641902/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,Not the masterpiece everyone is making it out to be,La La Land is above all an experiment in filmmaking just as The Artist was to see if modern audiences can accept a bygone style of movies in today s world It s exciting to see that it works based on the box office success of La La and the surge of Oscars for Artist There are no cheats there are no plot twists or modern devices to twist the audience s arm This is a musical that is unapologetically saccharine and delivers as a crowning achievement of the year even if it doesn t always live up to the insurmountable hype behind it This is Damien Chazelle s second major feature as writer director after his unbelievable debut with Whiplash winner of 3 Oscars and maybe the best movie I ve seen since beginning reviews for this website The buzz behind this film was undeniable and I know the pressure on Chazelle was great In an industry of remakes and reboots galore and despite my few issues with the film I still think he is a filmmaker above all else As Oliver Stone so perfectly described it I have seen the future of filmmaking and his name is Damien Chazelle La La Land is the romanticism of Los Angeles and Hollywood and the story is aptly simple Two people try to make a name for themselves amidst rejections galore Mia Emma Stone likens herself as a great actress and yet can t get out of her part time job as a barista Sebastian Ryan Gosling has a dream of opening a jazz club and reinvigorating the musical scene in the city Through fate and circumstance these two run into each other more often than one might expect and as luck would have it they fall in love As grand of a scope as the film is it s essentially about these two people and the connection they share SAG notably snubbed the movie of an ensemble nomination but thinking back on the story I can t even recall the side characters who occasionally dropped in Both Stone and Gosling carry the film with humor and charm a throwback to the simple storytelling of classic MGM musicals and they sing to boot live on set too Yes this is a musical Not a gritty reboot of the genre as Moulin Rouge was or one driven by sex and jazz like Chicago or an adaptation of Broadway like Les Mis This is a pure original story with original music in all its candy color CinemaScope shots and costumes I can t think of a movie quite like it so creative and risky to fund It s like Singin In The Rain or American in Paris and has the tone of those movies too The musical numbers themselves are each filmed in one long take a popular trend after movies like Birdman and are mesmerizing to watch The opening song has a moving camera across a busy highway complete with traffic How they filmed it I will never know Another song shows Mia and Sebastian tap dancing over a cityscape as the sun is about to set I would have to assume it s computer generated but would believe otherwise I m sure they had no more than 5 minutes to film the entire scene before losing light There are a lot of themes at work and a lot of the same ideas that Whiplash previously explored jazz dreams failure the two films as different to ally as they are work to compliment each other and are the beginnings of a repertoire that only could be described as Chazelle ian The movie isn t all fun and games and the final 20 minutes are full of deep melancholy and regret I admired the film all the more for its conclusion but still felt the ever present fact that in following the style of a classic MGM musical it s very predictable I loved Whiplash for its unique voice and style The style is still there but there s only so much a script can do that is bound by rules and guidelines The final exchange of glances between Mia and Sebastian and the last moments of the film are most certainly a reference to the finale of Casablanca Even if the ending isn t what we had hoped their look says it all We ll always have Paris Go see this film if only because there is nothing else like it I doubt anything will ever come out again like it Go for the filmmaking and admire the year s best cinematography a scene in a movie theater in which Emma Stone is illuminated by projection light is unquestionably beautiful and the recreations of the green silhouette from Vertigo is jaw dropping and unexpected If you are looking for the year s best movie I don t know if this is it Regardless it s damn good,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621352/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2017,Moonlighting Hollywood,Having 2 jobs because you re not sure if you can succeed in the one you are actually interested in is nothing out of the ordinary And our two main characters in this have issues with their dream And sometimes they sing and dance about them One of those moments is very early on when stuck in traffic suddenly everyone is joyously breaking out of their cars and start a dance number that does look like they actually trained for it All joking aside you have to have a heart for this type of movie otherwise this is nothing you will enjoy at all Having said all that there are different layers to this The drama works quite fine and there is quite a few different interpretations of certain things that happen It s all fun and games until certain decisions have to be made that can be life altering The leads are exceptional and you may have seen them before together on screen Maybe that helped their chemistry but what matters is that this works quite nicely,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3745593/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2017,"An alright film, but not a great musical",I enjoyed La La Land as a piece of innocuous colourful escapism The two leads are endearing and funny the cinematography is dynamic the sentimentality plucks rather than gurns and overall I found the dramatic conclusion to the two young dreamer s relationship emotionally fulfilling However the musical element of the film was lacking It s obvious that the spectacle of the old Hollywood sing along exists in La La Land to counter the real downturns and compromises that Mia and Sebastien are forced to make in their own relationship to achieve the success they crave Real life isn t like the movies basically The problem is that the songs themselves are rather dull and uninspiring notably the recurring music box esque piano theme which while tender and sweet in the right moments is very simplistic and even childish in structure sounding curiously unlike anything Sebastien a jazz pianist would ever really play The large ensemble dance numbers are only at the start of the film Again none of these are particularly special though the weaving camera work in the opening traffic jam number was impressive the songs didn t stay in my memory for very long and Mandy Moore s choreography is more of a set dressing than a feature to be wowed by The sporadic duets between Mia and Sebastien are also weak Their voices are thin lacking substance and their dancing is at best high school play material filler for the transitions These peter out by the film s last third to the point where I wondered why they even bothered making it a musical at all I would not be running to see this on stage in the West End That said as a movie experience I enjoyed La La Land It made me smile even giggle quite a few times but I do feel the whimsy and nostalgia for old Hollywood is clouding people s judgment of this as a deserving Oscar winner even though in the end it wasn t one The Artist this ain t,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3660190/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2019,Never expected to like this,I wasn t sure if I was to like this as I tend to duck the hyped titles from Hollowwood Well the first act of three parts was perky enough to keep me in the evolvement of the story then the second act dropped the ball with a less than gripping conflict build up as jazz ambition is swapped for easier cash To me this was the least musical part as it circled this uninteresting part in an attempt to have real conflict of interest Act three was a 15 minute montage that made a reprise of the developed story and the eternal question of what could have become if we down our path had the chance to choose over go into other direction and have a life that could have been the fulfilment we ought to have had I thought this part was genuinely moving But musicals are to be full of music yes No I was hoping a little for something closer to heart as I was swept by A Chorus Line and All That Jazz This was nostalgic and a little to bland,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4602941/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,Welcoming Back Musicals,Welcoming back Musicals with a clever modern approach Casting Stone and Goslin which aren t known for their vocals or music inclination was a chess like move and a definite check for the film They feel real and the flaws in their vocals are just beautiful to tell the story The opening scene was a little bit too long for me but it works The scene at the observatory was a bit too dreamy but It felt like watching Mary Poppins which I absolutely love and didn t care about the resemblance The ending was totally unexpected The audience gets to see an alternate final that may fulfill their desire for a different ending This film has opened a new gate for newcomers in the film industry and a second chance to explore the genre for already veterans in the industry,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5217506/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2022,It's a wonderful movie,This is the best original film musical in eons with of course some wonderful music This sublime romance between Stone and Gosling with their career aspirations getting in the way would be hard to improve on They are both fantastic in their roles but neither is quite as fantastic as Chazelle s awesome direction I just watched this and Moonlight for the first time since 2016 and I still don t know which one deserved that Oscar more though I probably would have voted for this but thankfully those voters got the director award right A beautiful piece of filmmaking and even better than I remembered,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8375761/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,A Once in a Lifetime Film,It s been over half a decade and I can honestly say that La La Land is my favourite film of all time This FILM yes FILM transports you into a version of Los Angeles that is vibrate with stunning colours and where the only limit is your imagination This MUSICAL has an abundant of catchy songs that would make anyone tap their foot and choreography that would cause a standing ovation on Broadway Director Damien Chazelle teams up with composer Justin Hurwitz to create the perfect score to accompany the story about the battle between LOVE and your DREAM Emma Stone gives an Oscar winning performance in a role she is wonderful in There is a scene in the beginning of the film where she truly shines even if the scene only lasted 2 minutes Ryan Gosling nominated for an Oscar gives a very grounded and charming performance as a Jazz pianist Gosling s true charm and gravitas truly adds to a real and often gutt wrenching performance This Truly might be one of the Greatest Musical Film we have ever seen and should be experienced and studied for many years to come,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8323755/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2018,Phenomenal (It is that great),The best musical in years And one of the best films Period A true modern masterpiece and a classic that will stand the test of time Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were incredible together The music was just magnificent And Damien Chazelle is easily one of the best new directors in Hollywood It s the best musical ever made No other musical has ever moved me as much as this It spoke to me it inspired me This has become one of my all time favorite films Here s to the fools who dream foolish as they may seem,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4085478/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2017,Yet another starving actress/musician = Terrible,This movie was terrible from the opening number dance sequence to the horribly nonsensical ending Full disclosure i really wanted to love this movie As it droned on i wanted to like it By the end i was hoping all involved never made a musical again In short the dancing was amateurish the acting was sub par and it literally had no memorable songs unless you count awful singing I wouldn t be that outraged if this movie wasn t being hailed as the musical to bring back musicals I was generous with the 2 rating because i actually enjoyed the jazz instrumentals If anyone would like a spoiler filled review i would be glad to share and prove my findings to be true,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3645554/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2017,I am baffled by this films awards performance,I feel Like John Galt standing alone in a throng of mindless sheep I watched the entire running This film is tripe stuffed with regurgitated everything I get the whole Stage dressing theater sets set atmosphere thing however it was so heavy handed that it lost its flavor and appears to be an overused budget tool After watching it I saw it as a collage of stereotypes from all the old musicals relaying heavily on a film model that was stale and even crusty at points That said I was amazed at Ryan Gosling s piano shots He was sublime on the keyboard shots and learning to play for this movie Nothing cheap or clich about talent Both he and Emma Stone did a great job of transitioning from their respective scenes into those musical numbers I found myself amazed that she could be carrying me through a scene just to have her leave me in disbelief that that it was but an intro to a campy song This movie is nothing but a tribute band to a bye gone era put together today in some kid s dorm room It is quaintly filled with Drag Queen esque songs and endless clich s The actors made this movie happen They earned their money,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3638878/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2017,ooo-lah-lah !!!,Friday is date night and tonight it was my turn to pick the picture To Mrs Shullivan s surprise I picked the musical La La Land Normally I would have picked a comedy or a good thriller but we both wanted to see why there were so many mixed reactions to this feature film It seemed to be a 50 50 split between loved it and hated it With us two Shullivan s we were not on the fence we both loved it Okay so neither star Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone can sing or dance very well but that was some of the charm emanating from La La Land and this will certainly be a memorable romantic musical film for decades to come I don t rely on determining the quality of a film based on how many Academy award nominations and or wins a film may be awarded because as far as the awards shows go most are just for the pompous farts who produce their own films and they do not like to share significant awards at all Thus we never see any comedies or action thrillers even receiving award nominations just some really big box office revenues So who needs awards shows when you have everyday critics like IMDb viewers who provide realistic feedback sometimes good sometimes bad What Mrs Shullivan and I liked most was the latter half of the film as jazz pianist Sebastian Ryan Gosling and wannabe actress Mia Emma Stone resolved their personal issues with each other and they bonded as live in partners in support of each others dreams Of course in any relationship there are highs and lows and Sebastian and Mia certainly had their share of ups and let downs We loved the bright rich diverse colors of all the actors and dancers costumes as well as the rich hue of the Hollywood California landscapes that writer director Damien Chazelle integrated into many of the song and dance numbers The cinematography was brilliant during the song and dance numbers performed by all of the cast especially Ryan and Emma s significant son g and dance number that is displayed as the film s cover art This scene takes place just after Sebastian and Mia leave a party together as they first get to know each other a little bit better than just as acquaintances As I said maybe Ryan and Emma are not classically trained singers dancers but how many of us normal couples fell in love while listening to great music and shaking the old hips ala one two three Isn t that what makes romance such a magical experience I do not want to give away the ending but I will say that this musical has some unexpected twists and turns that in my humble opinion make this what will be considered a classic musical romance in the following decades that hopeless romantics like Mrs Shullivan and I will want to see a couple of times in their lifetime maybe even with their teenage grandchildren who will also fall in love with La La Land for many generations to come This film covers Sebastian and Mia s relationship as it evolves over all four seasons and then some with new musical numbers that include songs by the world class musician John Legend some old style 1950 s big dance numbers with vibrant costumes and reminiscent of Martha and the Vandellas who would in 1983 sing they would be dancing in the streets literally There is no mixed feelings about this film for Mrs Shullivan and I we don t care how many Academy awards La La Land wins or loses All you really need to know is that we loved the film yes it will eventually be rated as a classic musical romance film and yes I am giving it a five star rating a perfect 10 for 10 score We simply just loved it from the beginning and especially through to the ending,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3632781/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,"An enchanting, joy-filled experience",I ve always assumed that referring to Los Angeles as La La Land was a put down a pejorative description of the city as the home of illusion and fantasy Damian Chazelle in his film titled La La Land however sees it as the home of a different sort of make believe an enchanting joy filled arena where singing and dancing about life is as authentic as living it Here Los Angeles plays itself with a mixture of fantasy and reality and a nod to films such as Jacques Demy s musicals of the French New Wave The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort Reinventing the genre for a new generation La La Land offers a delightful combo of jazz pop songs dance routines and two people in love dreaming under the stars It s enough to make you think that our current political scene may only reflect temporary insanity In the film Sebastian Ryan Gosling an aspiring jazz pianist and Mia Emma Stone a promising actress come to Hollywood to fulfill their dreams but find that dreamers are not always in vogue The now well known opening scene is shot on the L A Freeway but those who drive it every day probably wouldn t have noticed much difference in the volume of noise wall to wall cars and people acting out Here though the acting out is really acting though the commuters seem as agitated as always The fake traffic jam however is much more entertaining than the real one as a chorus bursts out with the song Another Day of Sun written by Justin Hurwitz with lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul and you forget that you will be very late for work The story itself is bittersweet though it always has an air of innocence Mia works behind the counter at the Warner Brothers studio lot but still makes time for auditions that may only last thirty seconds or less Seb dreams of owning his own jazz club but is forced to play Christmas music at a lounge by his boss J K Simmons a little less overbearing than in Whiplash but still ornery enough to fire him when he stops playing Jingle Bells Mia wants to meet the fired pianist after his doomed gig but he rudely brushes right past her no meet cute there Of course we all know they are going to be a couple eventually and when they do come together romantically they are a charming pair who exude chemistry as they make their way through some of Los Angeles notable tourist attractions such as Griffith Park Observatory where they fly halfway to the stars Though Gosling and Stone are no Ginger Rodgers and Fred Astaire they are good enough to elevate our spirits as they sing and dance to the strains of songs such as City of Stars a tune that you may even remember after you go home Although she is not a big fan of jazz Mia and Seb do have a love of music in common but their relationship becomes complicated when he joins a band led by John Legend and commits himself to going on tour Mia has put her hopes in performing a one woman play but it fails to attract an audience and she is back to square one Nonetheless La La Land works hard from beginning to end to make its point that if you stick to your guns work hard enough and don t give up things will eventually work out That however may be its most gravity defying trick of all,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625283/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2016,A musical lacking in character and good music. Stop the hype. This film is pretty good at best.,La La Land makes me upset because I feel like there is a great movie in this film It starts off great with a big sweeping musical number that s a lot of fun As it progresses the movie slowly falls apart The pace breaks down More songs become arbitrary The first song is arbitrary too but I ll let it go because it s just the opening number And there are many threads that don t go anywhere and lack any meaningful moments The couple getting married they showed up three or four times we don t care about them they have no character they are simply there to make Sebastian who we also don t care about sad The John Legend scenes although they progress the story are awkwardly paced and weird Oh Sebastian uses an electric keyboard now whoa Amazing It came across as awkwardly placed as the song scene in Birdemic What I m about to say is not criticism but thoughts on the characters Mia is a terrible character Sebastian is also despicable at points The character I related to most is the writer character at the party and he is trivial at best in the film Therefore the criticism is that there are no characters that one can get involved with and relate to in this mess of a film Other than the lacking characters clumsy plots lack of good music besides 2 3 songs awkward conversations that lead to nothing meaningful the movie is well done Damien Chazelle is a good director and has an eye for film Essentially people worship everything and value nothing and that is no truer than this film People worship the superficial of this movie Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone The beautiful shots The colors The sad music they play fifty million times And the fact it s different Critics love things that are different because they watch 100s of movies Thus La La Land is different and they freak out DON T BELIEVE THE HYPE The movie is way too long It could have cut out multiple scenes and wouldn t be missing anything That is the definition of terrible pacing I wanted to love this movie I wanted to feel everything at this movie I was told it was the best movie ever and will make you sob at the end All I have to say is all these 10 star reviewers are in La La Land I walked out of the theater and said really Overall this film is a solid 6 7,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3607332/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2017,"Yes, they can still make them like they used to!",My wife and I heard good things about this film and went to see it this evening We loved it Emma Stone sings dances and acts her part to perfection Ryan Gosling is brilliant and actually plays the piano in this film damn well especially if you consider he reportedly didn t play at all and practiced 2 hours a day 6 days a week to provide such a convincing performance The wonderful music and score the extensive use of primary colours the great romantic story all of them prove that they can make them like they used to La La Land doesn t get too soppy but it does get under your skin in a nice feel good kind of way We cannot recommend it high enough and hope it cleans up at the Oscars especially for the lead performances writing and best film I m looking forward to adding the Blu Ray release to my movie collection,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610346/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,Hollywood celebrates itself - in its own echo chamber. Totally over-hyped movie,The story is as thin as it is simple minded and totally banal The movie would likely be a total flop without the two main actors and without the giant hype and marketing campaign that has obviously been unleashed The soundtrack is largely uninspiring The dancing and singing of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is OK but far from exceptional or ground braking I have no idea how anyone could spot magic or authenticity in this highly superficial totally overrated movie The only really authentic about this over hyped piece is that it is a true reflection of today s Hollywood self absorbed totally superficial full of hypocrisy and unable to even consider any other view than that of their own echo chamber There are obviously and luckily some notable exceptions to this among the myriad Hollywood stars and starlets but they are far and few between It says a lot about the Golden Globes that they have been awarded in bulk to this movie Maybe the competition was even worse If this film gets Oscars as many predict it will simply be fitting After all a Hollywood in their castles and mansions being totally detached from reality from the life of ordinary people in this world from ground realities they will likely love what they see here Even though it is just praising and celebrating its own echo chamber This movie is Hollywood narcissism at its worst Oh and btw these are the same people who mock Trump for his narcissism Go figure,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621510/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,La La Land,Wonderful movie one of the best musical films I have seen in my life and not winning an Oscar was one of the biggest mistakes of the Academy in the past ten years the story of the film was very beautiful and very sad especially at the end The scene of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling s acting in the movie was amazing and she deserved an Emma Stone Academy Award for her performance in the film and Ryan Gosling s failure to win an Academy Award for his performance in the film was a huge mistake from the Academy Awesome the only two negative points about the movie are that after the starting scene the movie was relatively slow for the first 20 minutes and the movie could have been shorter running time but it s still a great movie and I m very high I recommend watching it and my review of the movie 9 5,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6881991/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2017,A Hollywood Romance,Why was La La Land nominated for 14 Oscars tying the most noms ever It invokes the fantasies and feelings of many past musicals and numerous film romances From its opening scene I found myself noticing the nods to other films because of story or style including Fame Dirty Dancing Moulin Rouge The Way We Were Invitation to the Dance An American in Paris Funny Face A Star is Born A Chorus Line and especially One From the Heart Coppola s musical in studio masterpiece of camera techniques It is easy to understand its popularity in Hollywood Its views on acting as a profession are very relatable for actors Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play the romantic leads and are credible singers and dancers Gosling even plays the keyboards for his part Mandy Moore So You Think You Can Dance provides the choreography including duets for the two stars that are reminiscent of Astaire s work Gosling plays a jazz musician so the film s soundtrack has a jazz infused sensibility that reminded me of Swing Out Sister s Breakout Two of the songs written by the Hurwitz Pasek Paul team are nominated for Oscars One won the Golden Globe though personally I prefer the other Will La La Land win all 14 nominations No but it has a shot at as many as 9 For those who love romantic films well made it is a joy to experience The ending of the film provides a surprise twist that expounds on the film s conception of life and love as cinematic experience,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3640075/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2017,"Singing and dancing and acting, oh my...",I initially really wanted to see this film on the big screen but as wide release got closer all the rave reviews put me off a bit was it all hype Were the Hollywood powers that be pushing the reviewers extra hard Well regardless of my doubts I went anyway and I was glad I did This film hearkened back to the song and dance musicals of days gone by But with the added twist of using real actors not professional singers and dancers I felt this added a great deal to the movie the characters were real people people that sang and danced well but not perfectly The producers could well have dubbed professional voices ala Marni Nixon for Natalie Wood in West Side Story but not doing so made this film so much more real Ryan Gosling is a very good actor After seeing his work in the film I d have to say he is better than good Has he made it to the pantheon of great actors I m not sure but his performance in La La Land was outstanding he ran the full gamut of emotions and he can do more with a sly glance than many actors with better pedigrees Gosling had the perfect partner in Emma Stone who at times appeared to be channeling Audrey Hepburn Her eyes can evoke more emotion than almost anyone In my opinion she was quite excellent The film is fun and quite emotional at times not a full box of tissues but a good handful would be nice to have But wait there s more This is somewhat of a musical after all and I found the score to be absolutely perfect Unlike most films where the music can be setting a background mood the music in La La Land is integral to the plot and the quality of the score raises the film to another level My suggestion would be to see this film now on the biggest screen you can find This is not a film for the home TV unless you happen to have a full size Hollywood screening room in the basement,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615404/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2017,Light piece of fluff (spoiler in last paragraph),SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3629704/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2017,I Can See Why This Won So Many Awards,I loved this movie This is not a spoiler but it didn t quite have the happy ending I would have liked However that didn t change my liking of this film Gosling and Stone were wonderful Had absolutely no idea Gosling was such a fantastic pianist But he most certainly is A natural And the music from this movie is wonderful When you come out of the theater humming the music it s good And I did Here s the thing instead of the raunchy movies with nothing but foul language in place of real dialogue why isn t Hollywood making more musicals It s obvious the public loves them That we will gladly spend money to see them over and over and happily buy them when they come out in DVD form We need more lovely movies like this,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3617716/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2019,Undoubtedly The MOST Disappointing Hyped Film I Have Ever Seen,I must confess I could not finish it and that is RARE for me I hated the CHOICES the director made the camera angles the dance moves the plot points the Ryan Gosling character jazz musician was pure phoniness Jazz musicians are not poet hermits they are in constant group interchanges and complex inter relationships It is the very essence of the authentic jazz scene What baffles me most is the energy people seem to get from this lead balloon of a movie,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4561822/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2017,A lively supercut of Classic musicals,It s been decades since a studio produced the kind of colorful musical fantasy that La La Land so affectionately salutes but writer director Damien Chazelle is the guy who done the job perfectly It is high concept pastiche filled with beautiful people beautiful movement and beautiful colors At its best La La Land probes the irony of its existence celebrating the greatness of a bygone era in the context of changing times As a drama this is less nourishing than the heritage it pays tribute to But for Chazelle the story is just a slight rib around which he builds a modern rhapsody So in spite of its flaws La La Land has moments of pleasure and satisfaction that are worth the price of admission It s not that it s a bad movie it s just not an outstanding entertainment the way great movies especially musicals should be I go with 3 5 5 for the musical drama by Damien Chazelle and I do think that it is the frontrunner for the Oscars,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3624021/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2017,Dazzling,An original Hollywood musical shot in Cinemascope and BRIGHT Tehnicolor Sebastian Ryan Gosling a failed jazz musician and Mia Emma Stone s failed actress meet cute and fall in love It follows their relationship over the course of a year It all leads to a happy if bittersweet ending that literally had me sobbing in my seat The film looks gorgeous the original score is great and the songs and dances are performed very energetically by the cast It looks just like a 1950s Hollywood musical right down to the cars and clothes There s also plenty of references to the old musicals sprinkled throughout However this just misses the mark of being a great musical for one thing I didn t really like the two main characters Sebastian is a bit of a jerk and very arrogant He s always talking about jazz which gets annoying Mia is sweet but always seems depressed and dour all the time I m not blaming the actors I blame the script The acting is great but the characters aren t I never warmed to them at all Still all was forgiven during the last 10 minutes which as I said had me crying out loud Also the individual music numbers throughout the picture are GREAT So it s a VERY good musical that I recommend Just bring plenty of tissues for the end,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3613564/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2016,A brilliant musical and a brilliant film. Best of 2016 so far,I had watched La La Land at TIFF 2016 and it was a definite highlight of the festival Having had seen director Damien Chazelle s previous film Whiplash and being utterly blown away by it I went into La La Land with very high expectations I m happy to say I was far from disappointed Tonally La La Land was very different from Whiplash one was an intense and dark psychological thriller whereas this was a brilliant comedic and emotional romance but Chazelle s style can still be seen in this film With two stellar films under his belt I m incredibly exited for Chazelle s next project Performances from Ryan Gosling and especially Emma Stone were absolutely astounding Both of the stars were able to authentically portray such a vast range of emotion as well as deliver great musical performances The chemistry between the two actors was great Gosling and Stone were able to believably play off of one another and it made for an entertaining and emotionally engaging relationship to watch unfold John Legend gave a good performance in his supporting role although he was outshone by the stars of the film The costume and set design were expertly done and well utilized in the story Where a lesser film may establish character through expository dialogue Chazelle tells the audience what there is to know about his characters by showing us details like the color of her dress the dustiness of his apartment or even the make of his car The mise en scene is employed to establish the tone of the movie For example there are multiple comedic scenes in which the comedy is derived from the clash between the costumes and setting A more dramatic tragic scene uses the lighting to communicate to us the emotions which the characters are trying to communicate to each other The lighting would often be used as a way to transport the film from the real world to a more dream like surreal timeless space In many scenes the hue of the lighting is used to represent emotion or even to represent a particular character The use of spotlights was also helpful to establish tone and mood The cinematography is stunning With a wide variety of beautiful shots La La Land is able to convey emotion A simple point of view shot can turn a stereo speaker into a symbol of longing or a stained ceiling into a symbol of desperation The production of some of the shots were impressive especially during the musical numbers These scenes employed a variety of long shots crane shots and dolly shots Another example of raw talent to be marveled at The editing was good Chazelle knew when to cut and when not to cut Cuts were strategically placed for the sake of comedy similarly other shots would linger for a decent length to emphasize the drama and tension of the scene This entire review can be spent discussing the film s soundtrack Not only did this film display what is perhaps this decade s greatest soundtrack yet but the score was so essential to the movie Whenever placed in the film the lyrics and tone of the music perfectly compliment the tone and plot Every single piece of music in this film is so expertly written and fits so superbly within the film There are plenty of clever double and triple entendres in songs like City of Stars which comment on the plot and the larger themes of the film all at once The musical performances by Gosling Stone and John Legend were all out of this world The soundtrack is the highlight of this film and it will without a doubt win La La Land at least one Oscar come February The story was simplistic yet admirably written Unlike many romantic films that will force in some contrived conflict between the two leads in order to push the film into the third act every plot point in La La Land feels natural and believable There are a couple of encounters and events towards the beginning of the film that feel a little too coincidental But as long as you can suspend your disbelief a little they won t be anything that will ruin the movie If I had to choose I would say that the plot is the weakest element of this film if not only because every other aspect was done so perfectly La La Land was an amazing alluring magnificent emotional roller coaster of a film I am excited to see it again when it opens next week and to see it win at the Oscars The opening scene alone is worthy of multiple Oscars so it wouldn t be surprising if this took home best picture This film is an anthem for all the fools who dream 9 10 Best film of 2016 so far,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3594861/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2017,Lala land and freedom,Lala land is one of the most awarded pictures of all times and it comes to us in a time when the world is in such state with religious political economical and social wars that contribute to the world crisis The movie is based on a young girl that wants to make it in the movie business Life in Hollywood with the constant chase for a major roll and to have a life changing experience and become famous All she needs is one chance to change her destiny As we watch the movie with all the colours and music we can appreciate what life is through jazz Its music takes us to another level where we try to fight for our survival to have our 5 seconds of solo fame and then to mingle with the other instruments that complement our purpouse in existence Life is about being in the world with all the kind of people that makes us hear they way we sound The parallelism in both lives the struggle the dreams the project and the talent shows us that anyone can do it But if we aren t willing to share the dream and make sacrifices then we may travel different That is what happens to the main characters they fell in love but didn t share any of their passions to make it work That s why we see two versions of their love life what you are willing to give to be successful The taste of freedom in this movie shows us the things we choose in the present affects the things to come in the future The happy ending is all about us here and now  pensarparaserfeliz wordpress com 2017 03 06 lala land and freedom,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3715951/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2017,Cheap and empty,These five stars go only to the actors themselves who were phenomenal and also genuinely touching as singers This film left me feeling like most Hollywood films do like eating several packages of skittles in one sitting After suffering through the unbelievably nauseating script which turns what could be a very beautiful and romantic story into probably the most boring uninspired relationship I ve ever seen I still couldn t get one thing out of my head What does any of this music have to do with jazz or musicals Everything I heard was thinly veiled pop music chords with trumpets or saxophones to disguise them There was no joy in any of the melodies nothing touching whatsoever about Emma Stones solo just purely banal lifeless chord progressions This film is not art the same way skittles are not food But at least skittles don t market themselves as a word class meal which is honest unlike this widely acclaimed masterpiece that betrays the aspirations of art entirely,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3703478/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2017,"'This is the dream! It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!'",Rhode Island born Damien Chazelle graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Visual and Environmental Studies He has captured the attention of audiences throughout the country with is own story which he also directed LA LA LAND and likely will become a Hollywood staple Perhaps the chaotic mess in which we find ourselves daily sinking into a dark hole created by our change in political face is the reason this little slight escape piece is finding such favor Or maybe we just want to remember the happy ever after ending to dreams that were abundant in early musical films that makes this film the talk of the Oscars and making so much money The film is about dreams their illusions consequences and rewards Mia Emma Stone an aspiring actress serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and Sebastian Ryan Gosling a jazz musician scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart Apart from Stone and Gosling dancing and singing their way through the endless colorscapes of Los Angeles and Hollywood there are few other actors involved JK Simmons Damon Gupton John Legend Tom Everett Scott and others to make the plot have any broad strokes But it is what it is and it is being applauded as the probable best picture of the year Go figure,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633436/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2017,"Very Old School, Not Racists(that is ridiculous!), Not for Those Who Don't Like the Feel of Old Movies or Do Not Like Watching Musicals or 1950's Films.",Thank you to all the blindly biased negative votes given because I speak the truth The unnecessary negative votes point as to why this review s point of view is a much needed one in a culture hellbent on insulting anyone whom does not share your viewpoint even when those attacking you are objectively wrong and hating those blindly whom disagree with your enlightened viewpoint that s what real bigotry is blind hatred if you hate my review or this movie for the reasons just stated that is the true bigotry and you need to get a reality check Get out of the cultural idiocy and stop being so biased and calling it inclusivity I call BS on those whom criticize this movie for being rascist when it is obviously objectively NOT I am glad I read the negative reviews because I think they actually made me like this movie more as most of the insults were ridiculous and missed the point The most ludicrous being that because it is led by attractive white people that it makes it racist In fact criticizing a film for not having enough of a certain race is actually racist as it is a biased based on skin color newsflash that s what racism is FYI people if I apply that to The Whiz The Color Purple or even Hamilton those would be racist because they exclude white people either altogether or have only have a few cast members that are white It goes both ways racism is not exclusive to a certain skin color BTW I like The Whiz Hamilton and The Color Purple despite their flaws However neither of those are racist and neither is Lala Land yes it does harken back to the golden age of musicals only with less musical numbers Lala Land has many black cast members and it lovingly dedicates a large portion of their film to Jazz which was started by black people and it lingers on jazz players which outside of the male protagonist are black and definitely puts them in a very very high regard My only caveat is definitely that it needed more musical numbers I read an interview with the composer and he said there were many left out of the film so if this gets transferred to Broadway as there are talks of we ll hear them but I do wish more of them were actually in the film One main theme runs through the films but if anyone is familiar with the older films which this pays homage to particularly 1950 s movies this is not uncommon I think of An Affair to Remember where the main song for that is played or sung at least 4 5 times throughout and is integral to the story as is the main theme that is played or sung throughout Lala Land it was fitting and appropriate especially because the main character is a Piano Player and a Songwriter This film very much pays homage to musicians and the musical process I write songs myself and also used to act a good deal and I felt portrayed what it is like to be a musician who is just trying to get by but also has a bigger dream and how that process plays out The acting side with the auditions very much captured those feelings of the highs and lows of auditions and why being an actor is not always fun and games unless you actually make it but it is hard work in the process and often degrading I have done numerous singing and acting auditions over the last 15yrs The singing was not at all bad Ryan Gosling sang very well within his range if you want bad singing go watch Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris in Camelot or Pierce Brosnon in Mamma Mia all phenomenal actors but terrible singers Ryan Gosling has limited range but he he used it very well Emma Stone s singing was very girly and pretty a bit too airy at times but I really enjoyed her solo song towards the end where she finally shows her real chops she has a very fine voice indeed No the dancing is not plentiful but it is well done While I wish there was more tap dancing I am also a tap dancer I enjoyed what they did have although I would have liked it if they were stronger dancers I just appreciate that it was well done enough and that they got actors who were fairly competent and at least had rhythm The Cinematography was beautiful the splashy colors were a lot of fun I loved the bright color palette which also hearkens back to the days of Technicolor very much like classic musicals such as Hello Dolly or Seven Brides for Seven Brothers or even Westside Story most pre 1970 s musicals actually There were many creative uses of the camera a lot of blurry shorts to make focal points clearer it was very creative While it is not perfect film as I said I wish there were more songs and dancing I truly felt it captured the lost feeling from the great musicals of the past and I really hope this does what Moulin Rouge should have done in 2001 fully reignite the modern movie musical as a monetary force When I left the theater I was humming the song and I still have the song that Ryan Gosling s character plays with the jazz band he joins and plays a few times it is a great song All of the songs were very beautiful and well written By the way I cannot think of many musicals I actually remember the songs to after only seeing it once if I never heard the songs before that didn t use pop songs as their score I can only think of one and that is On My Own from Les Mis I had never heard that song before and it stuck in my head but no other song from that 30 plus songbook did I remember that I had not already heard but they were still great songs I can say the same for and don t laugh Repo The Genetic Opera great cult film and has great music but not extremely catchy Not all music including musicals is extremely ingratiating the first time you hear it I don t remember any of the songs from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers or Hello Dolly the first time I heard them they took time to sink in I still feel really good from watching Lala Land the next day it made both me and my husband giddy after watching it and the whole theater clapped after it was over That may not be your experience it seems to be polarizing but it is not because it is bad film it is a great film it may just not be to your personal taste God Bless Amy,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3640355/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2017,They'd crossed each others life while chasing their dreams.,I am not a big fan of modern musical films So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst The film opened with a song that I was not happy because I did not like the verse or the music And again to say the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film The best part of the film was those song fades away as the film progresses But I kind of liked the drama story part and the climax track with the quick flashback kind of Till that scene I was considering it an average film but that one scene changed my stance So now I think it is a good film but winning 6 Oscars I don t know it deserved that Yes the director is known for making music and musical film but he has not made many He s young and so his career Yep I loved Whiplash One of my all time favourite If that film had won 10 Oscars I would have not surprised at all After that flick the people were anticipating to exceed that success in this film As it was received no doubt for those people it was a different flick but not for me Especially if you watch lots of Indian films By the way the film characters were nice and so the story but not the songs Gosling and Stone were performed well The chemistry between them was great The narration was going decently until the end which reminded me Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya ending that I was not happy about yet something different than usual Sometimes I am okay with clich than this kind of conclusion just to bring a change in storytelling Overall an enjoyable film most people would love it Some like me would say it is a decent flick but there s always a few who would never favour it Yet worth a watch 7 10,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3753850/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2017,"""La La Land"" Is The Supreme Full-Length Feature Film of 2016 & The Most Sublime Musical Movie of The Last Two Centuries",Whiplash winner of three Academy Awards one Golden Globe three BAFTAs among others was the shrewd introit of a filmmaker who categorically intended to shake superfluous and commercial Hollywood a gallant American with a transcendent and irreplaceable film intellect which has to be perpetuated praised and enjoyed in its entirety in these recession times he is Damien Chazelle It was the preliminary feature film of three of the most solemn festivals in cinema now Chazelle manufactures a modern masterpiece that is going to live on perpetually since not exclusively sketches the reviving of a relegated genre out but runs blindingly and naturally a romantic study aesthetically stunning tunefully stunning narratively stunning and functionally sublime La La Land is titled the third film led by the director this has stars Emma Stone Ryan Gosling and J K Simmons although with an unusual minor character among its ranks Several people have pigeonholed it as melodramatic thing with musical taps nevertheless the celluloid transcends its own confines splitting events course within four branches the four seasons which accentuates nature of every chapter in the story however although we are witnesses visibly of a narrative segmentation spectators will not take long to apprehend that it is distributed in three fields directed by different genres and themes what ultimately leads us to say that they are three independent stories correlated each other The story relates idealistic couple s adventures who lives in the district where professional disillusions of the planet settle Hollywood an arbitrary fable which will split up our divergent players She yearns to predominate intransigently in the city of dreams nonetheless her aspirations are crumbling and dying by the unsuccessful castings and his job as an assistant in a

series of individual troubles Although each of them obtained whom they loved the nature of the unexpected will be at risk and the intrinsic of their relationship will keep them to the edge of the cornice what in Hollywood would signify a death foretold It s irrefutable that Chazelle does not perform a neophyte exercise about actions which unfold with sections accompanied by singing and dancing since in his directional debut Guy and Madeleine on a Park Bench in addition to run notably his first steps within the matter also emerged victorious in emulsifying melodrama with dazzling spontaneities The initial section focuses on setting us in context within the dominant air through choreographic assemblies exuding pure vintage these performances are honest reminiscences from monumental MGM productions Top Hat Singin in the Rain The Umbrellas of Cherbourg An American in Paris and more were potential sources for revitalization of classic musicals The first take we detail a broad blue sky by CinemaScope going down gently amongst the congested and multitudinous vehicular traffic Each individual listens to dissimilar music styles an analogy will disperse into progressive musicality thereon Another Day of Sun is the attention epicenter and an ineffable and arduous choreographic display takes place along the vehicle bridge acts recorded in false long takes as if it were I rritu A frantic and exciting prelude which adjusts the environment where our main leads are going to get along In the second part grandiose dances ala Broadway drastically lessen and are replaced by sentimental treatment and what we cannot forget in a film by the director are the symphonic scores which are maintained potent nevertheless it provides gradually more preponderance on screen to jazz This is where the narrative arcs obtained greater strength and Stone s and Gosling s roles shine with profound and authentic performances After it moves through the crazy musical of the first part and the plausible dramatic affair of the second section Chazelle concludes with a final flourish with a sudden indefatigable agile and the cunning mechanism in the concomitant of the events which transmute narrative in films It makes you feel as if the tragicomedy would come to an end but indeed one twist more is coming Finally choreographic ensembles break out again but this time we have not seen them with the same dynamism and explosiveness dances are carefully chosen to express story grief He provided an inspirational greeting with Whiplash with La La Land consolidates himself as one of the major American filmmakers permitting Stone s and Gosling s performances and entire components of the celluloid to receive a guaranteed nomination at the Oscars for this love letter to Hollywood

16 September 2017,How can it be a great musical without good songs?,You don t need a great voice to carry a musical But you need to have an interesting voice A lot of the old time musicals pretty much had the likes of Gene Kelly and others have songs tailored to their limited range as singers Even the silly Mamma Mia which suffered from cringeworthy screenplay and Pierce Brosnan s earnest donkey braying benefited from the rich catalog of songs and performers immersing themselves into the songs no matter how bad they sounded Rocky Horror Picture Show made better use of the voices of non singers like Sarandon and even though Rocky Horror was never considered Oscar worthy it actually has much superior songs to more lauded movies like La La Land LaLaLand is just flat out lacking in even semi memorable songs with great melodies And even the non musical sequences are drab and stilted in the beginning of the movie which kind of makes you impatient right off the bat The first half hour there is only one semi compelling scene where Emma Stone is auditioning for a role So it puts you in a mood not to give this movie the patience it probably needs The first scene that grabs my attention is the pool scene with the 80s cover band by an overeager cheesy singer who entertained me more than the other singers in the movie Then the movie descends into mediocrity again where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have a duet where the song does their voices and our ears no favor Ryan Gosling s voice comes across as a bored half hearted rendition after someone just woke him up in this song At that point I just gave up on the movie and watched the rest of it as I did other stuff Emma Stone had a better mini musical with her funny SNL skit Les Jeunes de Paris set in a french coffee shop than what we saw here Ryan and Emma are both good actors and just wasted in a sloppily directed effort This movie somehow achieved what I thought was impossible make Emma Stone seem boring when she was having fun dancing I don t understand the cinematography wow factor here The imagery looks more akin to late 2000s HD cinematography with the lack of adequate vibrancy in the colors and contrast,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3807327/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2017,La la as well good,Ryan gosling and Emma stone worked together on crazy stupid love but that was five six years ago Here they dazzle the silver screen with energy and charisma as Mia and Sebastian in the new film musical la la land This movie from stArt to finish is one of the most entertaining escapist films of 2016 The actress Mia and the jazz pianist Sebastian are characters thAt we could try to love One of my favorite scenes is when Mia and Sebastian dive into dancing through the halls of the Griffith observatory Sebastian wants to get a jazz club going Mia wants to quit the coffee shop and write plays The ending is a dream sequence that s very well connected with the way they feel about each other La la land is a homage to all great movie musicals of hollywoods past but Damien chazelle chooses jazz as his theme I give la land A 10 out of 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642553/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2017,Superficial at best,First off I have to admit I am not a musical fan so that definitely is a factor I was told however this would appeal to everyone even the ones who do not usually enjoy musicals The opening of the movie already had me fearing the worst It is cheesy not very well sung and it carried on forever Oh well here come the main characters I found them to be shallow and extremely annoying Singing definitely is not their best quality the dancing not of this era The story is so superficial and Hollywood self indulgent half way through I had no choice but to walk out I do not understand this movie has been received so well There are other movies which are much more deserving of various awards this was a huge disappointment,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642776/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2016,"""La La Land"" Good movie, but could have been great.",Just saw La La Land yesterday in IMAX and am glad I did This movie is a visual experience that must be experienced in the biggest screen possible But while I think it s a good movie I m sorry to say it s not as great as many of the critics have said it is Don t get me wrong I love Musicals But it not in the same league as Musicals like Singin in the Rain my favorite Sound of Music My Fair Lady and Cabaret I even like modern Musicals like Moulin Rouge Though I know comparing one movie to another is wrong as each movie is different and unique but you tend to compare movies of the same genre Raging Bull vs Rocky Positives 1 The Direction is good 2 Performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are really good 3 Music is good 4 Cinematography is beautiful Feels like a Van Gogh painting come to life Negatives 1 Script is uneven First half is not engaging things improve post intermission but 2 I wouldn t call this a negative but takes too much inspiration from movies like American in Paris and a lot form French Musicals like The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort Wish it was a bit original though Final thoughts Watch it at least once just don t have high expectations and you won t be disappointed My rating is four out of five stars,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3597624/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,Nope,This movie has great reviews and has won big awards I don t much care for musicals so I gave this a pass when it came out Caught it streaming though and figured I d give it a look So boring The music was actually irritating to me and I should have just turned it off when it became apparent that jazz was going to be part of the story line It s not my favorite and by the end it was like a splinter under a fingernail just painful The characters weren t terribly likable or appealing And I never felt invested in their outcomes All in all it seems like something that was probably more fun to make than to watch,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8741567/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,Unexpected fan.,I didn t expect to like this film in fact I actually closed myself off to the idea It wore me down from the first second and by the tenth I was in for the long haul To be clear you have to be in the prepared to let down the barriers and let te cheese engulf you It s warm it s cold it s a copy and yet so original It s a nod to The Hollywood of old with an even bigger nod to today s audience Yeah Gosling is moody and Yes Stone is quirky but they have the depth of you read between the lines Don t expect this film to spell out everything for you You should see a Michael Bay film if you need that,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4104503/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2018,disappointingly overrated,Definitely not what I was expecting I love Emma and Ryan together but the storylines were a bit drawn out and disappointingly difficult to follow Some of the musical numbers dream sequences felt out of place and over the top sending the audience out of La La Land I did really like the jazz coming into a new generation and John Legend s music This movie was really good but not not great,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4026606/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2016,It is pure Art,To be frank you wouldn t waste your money I saw folks in Michigan standing and clapping at the end It s a marvel I didn t give 10 10 because some of the dance and emotional scenes lacked depth from Ryan Gosling who somehow covered it in the end by natural pain that he carries in his presence Emma Stone on the contrary carried the tempo throughout the film she just proved once again that how brilliant she is in acting and surprisingly singing She s all in for an Oscar this year Finally I think movie tried to encompass the entire story of one s regular youthful life which is only the life that seems to matter now a days I however wished that it may have covered short life span with probably more intensity In that regard I revered the movie Before Sunrise that magnificently captured charisma and magic within a night Finally in my understanding Indian cinema especially Bollywood has some incredible movies that captured musicals in an exceptional way Somehow the showmanship in that regard fallen a bit short Still it s magical much better than the artificially created poetry of Birdman or superficial picturesque of Revenant,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601739/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2017,A beautiful love letter to every foolish lovers and dreamers in the universe.,okay let s start from the beginning of the movie from the beginning it s already obvious what kind of movie that we re going to get a bunch of people dancing in the middle of traffic with colorful outfits they re singing a song from the soundtrack called Another Day of Sun which I would like you guys to check it out this opening really sets the tone of the movie a very colorful and hopeful movie i was shocked by how bright this movie is because i m so used to movies that s dark and gritty the opening sequence of this movie was filmed in a way so it seems like it was filmed in one take which in my opinion is just amazing i don t know how they did it but it works and it looks awesome the song combined with a great choreography and swift camera movement this combination is what makes La La Land so good not just that the performances are also really good Ryan Gosling Emma Stone all did a terrific job in this movie particularly Emma Stone the entire movie works because of her I think she did most of the jobs She sings dancing acting and does a lot of stuff that s just amazing I mean Ryan Gosling did bits too but you ll know why I think Emma Stone is the one who gave the best performance in this movie once you saw the movie yourself La La Land also use colors in a very interesting way as I said before this movie is very colorful although not as strong as Nicolas Winding Refn s usage of colors this movie also use color to elevate the emotion of a scene the most prominent color in this movie is Purple i don t know why but it works so well you ll see purple everywhere also the lighting works oh my god it reminds me to a lot of movies from back in the day fair to say this movie has one of the best visual works of the year as someone who have Jazz as his own name I can t appreciate this movie more if you re a big fan of music Jazz you ll have a blast Jazz is basically one of the strongest aspect of this movie throughout the entirety of the movie I always think of my dad he ll love this movie so much Ryan Gosling s character is in someway represent my dad he is so passionate about Jazz and he s sad cause no one can relate to him which brings us to the next point and the most important aspect of the movie what is this movie about lots of people are saying that this movie is a love letter to LA or even an homage to the golden age of Hollywood while it s not wrong either LA looks amazing in this movie the way it s shot it looks great and it s obvious as well that Damian Chazelle is trying to pay homage to the Golden Era by how this movie begins and ended but at its core this movie is about passionate people about the one who dreams about how it doesn t matter how foolish you seem you should go out there and go for your dream go for anything you want in life and it s also about the sacrifices that we have to make along the way that even though we might get what we want in life we still not going to get everything there s a price to everything and all of that told in a very beautiful touching and heartbreaking way much like life itself which is why i m also going to talk about the ending don t worry it s not a spoiler i was worried with how this movie is going to end cause i don t really want a clich d ending just to keep the good feeling but no guys the ending is amazing it s not clich at all it s amazing you ll loved it the ending was pretty much the same like the opening but more beautiful and unique by same I mean done with dancing and music and as a dreamer who s at times is an absolute fool i am in love with this movie and you ll probably think i m biased but if i say the otherwise then i ll be lying I love this movie and this movie is definitely going to be a movie that i ll watch again and again until i m dying Great great film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616035/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2017,Great musical that breathes life into the genre once again.,Honestly when I was first told about the premise of La La Land I was pretty uninterested I love musicals and films of any genre but this one didn t peak my interest It was only after it was nominated for 14 Oscars which is the same amount as my favorite film of all time Titanic that I really noticed it And boy was I glad I did This movie is refreshing It puts to rest all the things about complex plots inappropriate material and language that so many movies have today and lets us take a two hour trip into the fantasy world of the story and its characters The songs were enjoyable with Someone In the Crowd being the standout The duets were emotional and I felt the connection the bright colors and eccentric dances added to the nostalgic feel of the story It did an exceptional job blending timeless musicals with modern traditions I thought Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling did a great job at their parts with Stone being the standout Their characters felt real like someone you could really meet walking down the street Their chemistry was good and I loved that this movie highlights the ups and downs of relationships because not every relationship is as flawless as the fairy tales say I see some negative reviews about the singing and dancing being out of tune and not perfect but I think it adds to the story When the characters make a tiny wrong step or their voices shake it adds an extra element of realism that I don t think everyone sees I for one like the tiny mistakes that you can point out No one is truly flawless I think the only thing I didn t like was the pacing It was a bit slow but it s understandable considering you wouldn t add a car chase or some action sequence to a romance musical I also think it could ve used one more group song like the first two in the film But overall it s a clean movie that will give you a roller coaster of emotions and leave you with melodies and tunes playing in your head all night A must see for anyone who loves musicals,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3696681/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2017,Just wasted two hours of my life,If you re a fan of old musicals stay far far away from this movie It s just incredibly painful to watch It s not that I don t like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone it s just that they can t dance or sing Neither of them would ever even be considered to audition for any of our popular TV talent shows I tried to give this movie a chance but it just kept getting worse and worse From the horrible opening dance scene Some guy jumping his bicycle all over cars in a traffic jam really to every time Emma or Ryan opened their mouth to sing It was all so painful to watch and hear I would have been better off watching some sappy Hallmark movie,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3702678/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2019,Unexpected rollercoaster.,Not the sort of movie you d expect to be described as a rollercoaster but that s the best way to describe my emotions watching it Ryan and Emma are clearly talented actors but I m not sure they were so well cast for this Beautiful to see singers not doing the usual screech thing that they all do these days but still I didn t feel they were strong enough for this I must say talking of sound quality the sound on this production is awful Absolutely awful I own a top spec TV and no matter how I adjusted the settings parts of the dialogue are completely inaudible I almost went with subtitles Hollywood and everyone else please stop allowing actors to mumble their lines how can anyone think that s ever going to be good for the industry There were parts of this movie that forced me to love it I had no choice Especially where I was suprised with the ability of both actors Then suddenly I was cringing at other parts There were parts where I was glued to the screen others where I started nodding off Overall at the end of the rollercoaster I was confused Why Why was this movie made What was it for Was it retro Was it modern Was it comedy Was it drama Was it fantasy I m far from being an expert on musicals Moulin Rouge I enjoyed It was clear from the start what it was and it did it well A star is born Is that a musical I dunno but it was good it had a style it gripped me This La la I m just not sure what I ve just watched And I definitely have no clue what the people making it had in mind It changed direction and style so often it was as if different segments had different crew members making it It gets a 5 Something kept me going I just don t know what,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5215820/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2017,Be ready for feels,Apart from the obviousness of the drama and typical clich s that romantic movies tend to have La La Land has almost none Movie does amazing job by capturing true emotions known to us even when it s slightly exaggerated and sometimes goes into absurd feelings gained from it are on point And what s most important it s TRUE and I m sure those who had experienced close relationships with a literal meaning of close and not Well we sometimes understand each other will feel every second of it and also might have hard time stopping the tears,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3784894/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2017,This film stays with you.,This is a film that I will save up for viewing on those days or nights when I need to some color in my life or some sweetness but I don t want to search for those things I just want them to be delivered to me right up there on the screen or on my computer or DVD player First viewing I did not particularly like La La Land Watching people dance eh I ve seen better My attention wanders I m checking e mail I m thinking that Emma Stone is no great beauty I m wondering how it is that these two Stone and Gosling are going to carry this movie They do they make this movie work Emma Stone looks like and becomes a plucky film star wannabe Ryan Gosling looks like and becomes a musician He learned to perform the jazz pieces no need for faking it without amazingly starting out an accomplished pianist I don t think I appreciated how much promise there was for their powerful romance until they exchanged a certain glance This is a very very LUSH Umbrellas of Cherbourg type film in my opinion Can Los Angeles look any more beautiful La La Land does not match the romantic dramas of the 30s and 40s Emma Stone does not have the inner tenderness that peeks through the cool exterior of a Bette or a Joan She does convey something fresher though of a youthful actress today,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3685653/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2017,Did those people giving rave reviews was ch the same movie that I did??????,Positively one of the worst movies never mind musicals that I have ever watched in my entire life and I am now almost 64 I am not only amazed at the mediocrity of the movie but also by the response from those movie goers who see fit to rate this production as 10 star One reviewer suggested that it was the best movie they had seen since Star Wars when they were a kid What planet is this reviewer now living on He she could not possibly have seen the same movie that I endured just a few hours ago It lacked story line pace memorable songs It had one simplistic tune melody or whatever which was constantly repetitive The characters lacked depth and credibility And the actors were poor in the art of song and dance The backdrops and sfx were abominable and B movie like in execution If this movie succeeds at the Oscars it is further proof of how out of touch America is with the rest of the world in both politics and the arts The only saving grace is that neither can get much worse and that in the spirit of hope great things will arise from the ashes,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627596/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2017,A Fine Musical in Every Way Imagineable.,La La Land is an incredibly colourful refreshing and creative film in the otherwise disastrous year that was 2016 this movie makes you happy to be alive and take any given opportunity you have There s lessons to be learned here but it never forgets to be escapist fun at its core La La Land is a film about dreams and goals what it takes to achieve them and coming to terms with what comes out of personal circumstances This is a film for dreamers and those looking to have a good time at the cinema This rejuvenating musical is exactly this and more Damien Chazelle the writer director of Whiplash 2014 wrote and directed La La Land he takes the concept of music s importance in both films but tells completely different stories in each film The thing these two share in common is that it s about the desire of the protagonist s to pursue happiness Both films do this without feeling overly pretentious or sappy and that s a hard way to tell these kinds of stories it s personal in a way that the viewer has complete and synchronized empathy for the characters we ve been in their shoes before emotionally La La Land is a love letter re invention and resurrection of the classic Hollywood musical From An American in Paris to Singin in the Rain La La Land is a retro film set in the modern day but it has the high flying and gorgeously colourful spirit of 1950s musicals If you haven t seen this movie yet please do so It s a day brightener and will put a smile on your face for sure It s a movie you can relax to Enjoy the finest film of 2016,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627840/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2017,An amazing gem of a movie even for people who are not typically fans of musicals!,After years of Hollywood filth uninteresting and painful to watch movies I found this gem of a movie that has tugged at my heart like no other I took my wife to see this movie after seeing the trailer but had no idea it was a musical We both are not fans of musicals and during the first opening sequence she looked at me and jokingly said I m going to kill you and I just shrugged After another song we were both more drawn into the movie Finally Mia walks into the restaurant that Sebastian is working at playing one of the most moving sad and romantic pieces I have heard in a movie The soundtrack really helped to set the emotion of the movie La La Land is one of the most fun inspiring romantic and sad movies we had seen in years Ryan and Emma s chemistry on screen is undeniable and made the movie so believable It s been a couple of days since we have seen the movie and we are both still listening to the soundtrack and talking about the movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3638989/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2017,"La La Land lifts you higher and higher in this all singing, dancing and acting masterclass",Believe the hype with La La Land as this colourful creative and masterful musical deserves to sweep up at the upcoming Oscar season just as it has at the Golden Globes Despite such a simple story being told it features so much heart invigorated energy and euphoria that you simply cannot stop smiling with this film even when it all ends a little melancholy It s refreshing stunningly told visually captivating and heartfelt in its exploration of themes and ideas with two sensational performances at its core It s certainly sweet but with a little bitter bite too refusing to indulge too much in tripes and clich s and keeping the ball rolling even through the slower moments there is always something to enjoy I implore you to watch this if only to be able to tell the story to future generations about where you watched 2017 s Best Picture winner which is destined to become a classic in years to come It s a musical masterpiece a love letter to a Hollywood time gone by and everything I love about film just in a slightly different package and a reminder to let the dreamer inside of us all to dream FULL REVIEW goo gl Tvo4zE,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616385/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,"""Cute"", but ordinary",I m not a fan of musicals Obviously there are exceptions such as Singing in the Rain The Wizard of Oz and more recently the great Sing Street not the regular American musical where people seem to feel an uncontrollable urge to sing and dance in the middle of the street for no reason at all However even going against all my instincts and because of all the fuzz I decided to watch La La Land I arrived I sat down I settled down I waited The movie begins Suddenly people singing reproducing a choreography perfectly rehearsed almost mechanical an explosion of colors as if the world was painted in Technicolor in a long take practically perfect I could no longer stay put every position was already bothering me after 3 minutes Then we have the first glimpses of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling A bad start How shocking At first we are introduced to Mia Stone and later we become familiar with Seb Gosling In a third moment we finally have the two together and from there inseparable but not so much And here I must say the fact that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are extremely charismatic helped me a lot so I would not go into a catatonic mode and stop paying attention to the screening unfolding in front of me But not even the enormous charisma of the two was enough to make me enjoy La La Land I like Emma Stone she s a good actress She does not have much depth let s face it but she manages to do her job in a decent way I think Birdman was her less Emma Stone moment of all because I could see a little beyond the wide eyes and the half open mouth her trademarks Well neither Emma nor Ryan are singers much less dancers However it seems that all the reviews minimize these details especially due to the forced exuberance the director displays throughout the film and the chemistry between the protagonists The harsh reality is that Stone is no Debbie Reynolds let alone Gosling a Gene Kelly I could not minimize it It was strange it was uncomfortable The whole experience was uncomfortable Chazelle is a good director who has impressive technical skills But for me he tried to take a step way longer than his legs Perhaps he was overconfident because of what he achieved with Whiplash I don t know All I know is that it lacked humbleness La La Land is pretentious and at the same time ordinary it hides behind the right light and a good art direction Although the film is divided by seasons it gets a little tricky to realize this when its set is Los Angeles Apart from the captions on the screen indicating that we have passed from spring to summer and so on nothing else alludes to what seems to be something important for the narrative neither the set nor the cinematography So be it summer or fall all that hovers is the love between Mia and Seb in gaudy colors Not that the cinematography itself is bad Quite the opposite It s too beautiful As I said the lighting is right almost perfect Do you see the problem When I watch a movie photographed by Lubezki for example I do not need to be constantly reminded by light tricks that he is a master of cinematography But Linus Sandgren is not a Lubezki It is not innovative it is not exceptional And this leads us to the script girl meets boy girl falls in love with boy girl and boy live unforgettable moments problems happen I have to admit that here Chazelle even tried to skip the usual and lived happily ever after But it backfired I m not going to tell what happens at the end cause it would be unfair to those who have not yet watched it It is enough to say that even if he wanted to do something different it was nothing that we had never seen before As if it was not enough he decided to teach us about dreams expectations determination and reality Not necessary Too unnecessary I do not doubt that many people really liked La La Land It was made to be liked I just do not understand how more experienced eyes have been fooled giving a masterpiece status to such an ordinary movie The directing is almost convincing there are some interesting metaphors Jazz Hollywood Golden Age Even so La La Land is miles behind the great musicals ever made it s beneath its fuzz and beneath the expectations of someone who wanted from the bottom of the heart to have liked this film myself,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621074/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,Fun while it lasted,While there was some fanciful silly plotting I enjoyed La La Land while I was watching it probably to the level of a 9 or 10 rating It was fun and funny and romantic and beautiful and magical Emma and Ryan are talented and very appealing whether separately or together The fact that they are not especially gifted as singers and dancers didn t bother me at all in fact I found that to be charming The musical numbers were engaging and satisfactory if not particularly memorable It would be unfair to compare this movie to classic movie musicals because it s really a whole different animal However in reflecting on the movie afterwards I felt a bit cheated so I dropped my score a couple of notches and decided I had to write a rare for me review My experience was like fully relishing a whole tub of buttered popcorn and then coming to my senses afterward My first clue that something was off was how I felt at the end of the movie not thrilled not heartbroken just disappointed and a bit confused In reflecting on this feeling I realized that it wasn t that the characters didn t have sufficient chemistry for me to feel something rather the script plotting let them down The basic story is about two cute kids exploring their dreams in LA who meet and fall in love The audience s dream is that these two can make it as a couple despite inevitable setbacks along the way If a storyteller is going to dash that dream he or she needs a darn good explanation There isn t one here The two kids rather magically and in relatively short order from a real world perspective achieve their career goals presumably at the cost of their romance Are we really to believe that they had to choose one or the other and that if so these two dreamers would choose career achievement over love The two breakup scenes were both totally lacking in terms of convincing the audience that this pair might be ultimately incompatible or should not keep working on their relationship and enjoying one another So I was robbed of a satisfying resolution I was leaning toward a 7 rating but I think I ve talked myself into a 6,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619387/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2022,This might have been ...,an excellent film if it weren t a musical or a much better musical with leads that can actually sing and dance not just sort of carry a tune and move awkwardly to all but the simplest ballroom choreography When not singing or dancing Gosling and Stone are convincing and as appealing as a guy written as rather a jerk and a gal written without much depth can be While watching it I dismissed the music as forgettable tunes with lyrics crammed in too tightly However given that Hurwicz composed Start a Fire the one song worth a listen I imagine the others might have come off much better if sung with phrasing and breath control technique I love musicals but I truly don t understand the accolades given this film I found it extremely disappointing and overly long,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8583514/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,The worst film I've ever seen,Nothing to do wth musicals just a badly put together waste of space with badly chosen cast with no charisma or dancing talent unlike Hollywood of old Despite Hollywood having a reputation for ruining people s lives even a generation down the line because of the narcissism it created at least the actors were truly charismatic and talented for the most part in the past and this came across on screen Here on the other hand we have adolescent looking adults all looking the same with no bodies to speak of no passion no charisma so what s the point,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4730953/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2017,La La Land,A jazz pianist falls for an inspiring actress in Los Angeles There was a moment back in the 1970s when the image of people bursting into song and dancing in the middle of a motion picture wasn t simply cheesy it had come to be seen as downright strange But not anymore Our era is immersed in a retro musical culture Damien Chazelle wants to make a musical that celebrates the classic Hollywood vision of love as a spiritual perfection This is is really quite beautiful and as another Oscar season begins this time under a dark cloud of controversy movies like this one take their natural place escapist wonderment that reminds audiences and cinephiles like me why they bother staring at flickering images on a wall in the first place The heart and soul of this movie are rooted in the past and so are its characters Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is a romantic that almost feels chemically balanced to perfection These two belong together because of Gosling his malice dipped in honey and Stone her vivacity and pensive awareness creating a teasing romantic connection But mostly they belong together because they dance like this They are the new Gene Kelly and Shirley McLaine Their not so meet cute takes place on the freeway Indeed the film opens with one of the most extraordinary sequences in years a musical number set in the morning commuting and traffic jam along with a vast stretch of L A freeway The camera hurls with astonishing choreography intricacy among the passengers on their way to work Cinematically the sequence makes the impossible look easy It also serves as a setting for optimism and emotional expectations By staging this number Chazelle invites us to return and stay inside an enchanted romantic universe In my opinion Damien Chazelle s La La Land is the most audacious big screen musical in a long time An irony of ironies that is because it is the also the most traditional one Director pays an awe inspiring homage to the look mood and stylised trappings of the Hollywood musicals of the 40 s especially the 50 s with starry nights and streets lamps lighting up the innocence of soft shoe romance and two people who were meant for each other literally dancing on air The stroll scene is one of my favourites as Damien Chazelle stages a gorgeous scene over a view of L A s glittering carpet of lights that merges into pastel twilight They sit talk and start dancing just like actors did on sets in the 1950s Sooner she lays her eyes on him Across a crowded room A stranger playing the piano Except that the look on her face tells you that he is no stranger at all She is not just starring she is falling That is the sublimity of Old Hollywood where we believed that it could happen just like that Maybe only French cinephiles of a certain age will realise that the writer director s true inspiration here is not as much from vintage Hollywood musicals as from the late French director Jacques Demy s two landmark 1960s musicals with Michel Legrand The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort especially the latter which was far more dance and jazz oriented What I love about Damien Chazelle s movies is that he incorporates music in his movies he did that with Whiplash and he does that more than ever here The music becomes a character among all other characters Moreover L A has rarely looked this gorgeous in films a credit to the director s romantic imagination as well as to the technical expertise of Swedish cinematographer Linus Sandgren American Hustle Finally La La Land is the story of old school dreamers trapped in a world of entertainment commerce that is designed to crush the life out of you It is a reminder that the often self destructive act of dreaming is the very elixir of life This film is a love story to passionate people people who have a dream people who want to succeed in doing what they love Someone who is going to no matter what anyone says go ahead This film grabs the shoulders of anyone who is passionate out there shaking them until they get out there and follow their dreams Overall La La Land is an unapologetically romantic tribute to classic movie musicals splashing dream chasing optimism everywhere I was utterly absorbed by the film s simple storytelling and the terrific lead performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling who are both excellent particularly Emma Stone who has never been better They both carry Chazelle s musical numbers off with delicacy and charm,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618113/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,"Fantastic experience, a movie that defines artistic beauty",There is nothing else that could be said about it apart from what I m going to It is a movie of true profound beauty one that touches your soul and leaves you in silence and awe And all of this is because it deals with something we all face at some point what is right to choose in life when our dreams also require great compromises I truly recommend everyone to see La La Land especially in a movie theatre to discover with their own eyes the great talent of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and the chemistry they share on the big screen Surely without a pair such as this one the experience would have been much different it is a film that relies on their performances which are executed flawlessly from the first scene in which they appear to the very end all of their passions desires and conflicts are full of life You can see it in their eyes dance moves and gestures with each other The cinematography is fantastic and the musical score has been part of my playlist ever since watching the movie for the first time I couldn t resist going more than once The costume design is superb I hope I didn t understate the beauty of this film But in all seriousness if you can please go see La La Land It is a work of art,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3606548/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2016,An ol' fashioned Hollywood musical for the 21st century,La La Land 2016 release 128 min brings the story of Mia and Sebastian As the movie opens there is gridlock on the freeway and for no apparent reason we get the first song and dance by the ensemble cast brought in a single take lasting several minutes and ending with Sebastian and Mia having a mini road rage moment It s not long before we see Mia a barista dreaming of becoming an actress failing one audition after another Meanwhile Seb is an ol school jazz pianist When he refuses to stick to the Christmas music set list at the club where he works and instead goes on a dazzling improvisation he is promptly fired Mia happens to be walking by hears the piano improvisation and goes inside the club At this point we re 15 min into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience you ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out Couple of comments this is the latest film from writer director Damien Chazelle who last year came out of nowhere with is impressive debut film Whiplash For his sophomore release Chazelle sticks to the music world but this time in an all around ol fashioned Hollywood musical When the movie s opening titles announce Presented in CinemaScope you know this is going to be just like the good ol days and that certainly turns out to be the case The musical numbers are simply outstanding and just as important move the film s story line forward The movie benefits enormously from the obvious chemistry between the two leads Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling While the movie s overall story arc is quite familiar you simply enjoy the scenes for what they bring John Legend brings an important secondary performance as Keith the leader of a jazz R B band called The Messengers At one point Seb and Keith debate how authentic the jazz sound of the Messengers should be Keith observes You re holding on to the past but jazz is all about the future Speaking of the musical score if you are not into music by all means do yourself a favor and find another movie to see because in the end the music is the heart and soul of the film As was the case for Whiplash the music is courtesy of relative newcomer Justin Hurwitz Harvard classmate of Chazelle I read the other day Heavy on jazz but with plenty of pure orchestral moments as well the core is nothing short of brilliant La La Land is one of the year s most anticipated releases for me as I absolutely loved Whiplash Due to various year end scheduling conflicts and commitments I just now had a chance to see it The matin e screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely Much to my surprise I noticed a number of young 6 7 8 yr old kids in the audience I would ve loved to ask them afterwards what they thought of this movie I loved the movie period and will end up high on my year end list of best movies of 2016 La La Land is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3609410/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2016,A curate's egg of a film.,I am a great fan of musicals I own over 700 of them on DVD and lecture on the subject all over Israel I eagerly anticipated this film which arrived in Israel on December 16th I am disappointed In parts this film is good the opening sequence on the freeway superb but parts of the film were simply boringly slow The music and songs were good but not outstandingly memorable The hit song City of Stars was not allowed to be performed fully and the marvelous and colorful dance sequence towards the end was cut shamefully short The jazz sequences were terrific if you like jazz as the dialog points out Ryan Gosling is a revelation as a singer dancer and pianist but everyone else was average The constant panning of the camera was a distraction but the long continuous single takes work very well particularly Emma Stone s audition song The dance sequence between the two stars into the clouds was poor not even in the same class as as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton The film is described by some as a tribute to Fred and Ginger Hardly And I wonder how many of the current reviews from such limited distribution are from actors and luvvies from la la land Yes this is a good film one I might watch again but the advance hype is not supported by what I saw on screen The audience seemed to like it with the odd exception and maybe I am being too critical which is likely reflected in the likes for my review But this is not in my opinion a musical that will stand the test of time as a blockbuster,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601024/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2017,Here's to the Messes We Make,Whiplash was my favorite film of 2014 It showcased a filmmaker that could control audience emotions with brains tone and brilliant pacing So I was very much anticipating director Chazelle s return to the big screen with La La Land a decided change of pace that is getting almost universal acclaim and rightfully so Where Whiplash was an intense drama about ambition and loneliness within the jazz world La La Land is bright musical about ambition and loneliness within Hollywood Fully embracing the constructs of old fashioned Astaire Rogers pictures while floating them effortlessly into the 21st century it s a joyous song and dance rom com that dances far beyond its pretenses Gosling and Stone are phenomenal playing two wide eyed dreamers looking to make something of their artistic abilities With the lovely romantic melancholy of Once the dreamlike song numbers of Singin in the Rain and the character motivations of each the film wraps itself around our nostalgia before nudging us out of our familiar comfort The songs are lyrically moving and ready made for Broadway and the sets and dances accompanying them would be considered experimental if they weren t so charmingly classic If it seems like La La Land skates by on its charisma think again Playing effectively with the line between romance and reality both in relationships and in aspirations it asks us if one is inherently better than the other and is it truly possible to have both In our search for purpose must we apologize for every mistake or can we accept them even love them To quote one song directly Here s to the messes we make That s where true love is found That s where life is found,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618130/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2018,Fantastic and really philosophical at the same time.,The musical romantic comedy drama film was directed by Damien Chazelle and is set in sunny Los Angeles It is based on love and life s wishes The story centres on the relationship between Mia Dolan an aspiring actor and Sebastian Wilder a struggling jazz pianist The main characters are played by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone The film opens with the main character Mia who is disheartened from her subsequent acting audition That night Mia s roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills promising her that somebody in the crowd will start her film career but in the end she left this party in disappointment During a musical gig at a restaurant Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to only play songs from a traditional Christmas setlist While going home Mia overhears him playing She enters the restaurant but Sebastian is fired for his disobedience Mia attempts to compliment him but he brushes her off For many people the best thing about La La Land is the melodious music which is presented throughout the whole musical For me however the film succeeded because it has an important and strong message I can t see anything negative about the film I was absolutely delighted I would recommend La La Land it is so emotional if you like to reflect about life,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4051618/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2016,Best movie ever,Linus Sandgren is a true genius Thanks for a great movie Looking forward to meet u in London How is Betty and Lucy Please write back Go Linus Go Linus Great Hugs Bingo Please read this In his first film since Whiplash Damien Chazelle stages a lavish song and dance musical that dares to swoon the old fashioned way with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as L A dreamers There was a moment back in the 1970s sometime before Grease came out when the image of people bursting into song and dance in the middle of a motion picture wasn t simply corny and antiquated it had come to seem downright strange Not any more Our era is immersed in retro musical culture and it has been for a while from the visionary postmodern pop swoon of Moulin Rouge to the online resurgence of music video to the high camp a Capella sincerity of Glee and the Pitch Perfect films So what does it take to make a musical today look unabashedly exotic,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3555256/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2018,Best romantic musical ever!,Everything is perfect in this movie The first time I watched it I was really touched and I just felt that the director was drawing the scenes like painting The music talks to you The cinematography is absolutely fantastic The movie s perfect for those who believe in love and those kin of romantic stuff Briefly it s going to be really hard to get something negative from this movie I m still wondering why it wasn t selected the best motion picture in 89th annual academy awards,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4068000/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2017,I made an account just to rate this movie.,Absolutely one of the best movies I ve ever seen If you like jazz see it If you like romance see it If you like crying at the end of movies see it Just plain see it Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are fantastic the music is fantastic and I was never bored I even bought the soundtrack right after seeing which I ve done maybe two or three times in my life Fun fact Ryan learned piano just for this movie and all scenes of him playing are real Some people may find it moves slow at times the friend I saw it with said as much but personally I wasn t In addition the end seemed a little padded but was still fantastic Frankly more movies like this need to be made This is exactly the kind of thing Hollywood needs to revitalize cinema in our current world of remakes and uninspired reboots,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623839/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2017,"If this movie wins 'Best actor in Leading role', rather than a tribute it's gonna be a mockery to Gene Kelly and old Hollywood.",First of all I like musical films but this was supposed to be a tribute to the greatest musical performers in old Hollywood Gene Kelly Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers etc It was a lie because it was a clich love story of a young couple Sebastian and Mia The script s structure isn t great neither narrated by seasons The characters Mia Emma Stone an aspiring actress and Sebastian Ryan Gosling a man who wants to make Jazz popular again The rest of the characters are just there lost in the script doesn t matter if they exist And the end is like the supporting characters too is like those quickly ending scenes where the movie doesn t feel complete Now I ll be honest Emma does her best and gives an acceptable performance but Ryan can barely sing and is worse when he dances no coordination with Emma and graceless dance steps disguised by the sound department with tap sounds The musical numbers are forgettable too City of Stars is good but no great and the old Hollywood tribute is just a Casablanca s window Rebel Without a Cause some posters and dance steps good joke for publicize the movie Despite all these the good things in the movie the sound editing and mixing The art direction gives this film different places with urban atmosphere and the costume design and make up hairstyling department also contribute to make the story something that everyone can feel identified Maybe is for all this the success but can t match on to classics like Singing in the Rain An American in Paris Sound of Music and more For conclude if you like musicals you can enjoy the film if you want to revive the old Hollywood charm searchs other movie,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3624781/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2017,Nonsense,First review Because this movie is totally overrated I love musical movies but what on earth happened for it to be so praised Just had to watch a few sequences from My Fair Lady after to be sure my judgment was not wrong That is a great musical Not this Another Oscar winning movie who will appear in 10 years in the Movies that shouldn t have won list You don t make a good or great movie because you do it in the style of the great ones And even that should you have a good story And good songs Even in this area i could not remember one And you don t feel any connections with characters In short terms don t waste your time,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3717616/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,Great... when it's not a musical,But the movie it is a musical And even if a couple are fine and one is excellent City of Stars the true is that I just can t understand the fascination with these genre What is the interesting part of hearing music that you wouldn t ever in your entire life Music that is not necessarily even good Sung by actors that aren t close to professional singers musicians And with songs that need less harmony and rhyme so they can tell complex stories instead of being beautiful I just don t get it unless every song is at the level of City It s not the case Besides that fundamental flaw the rest of the movie is excellent even If clich The characters are fun and the actors gave them a bit of distinct personality to differentiate them from the archetypes they probably are without them Even Emma Stone is good on this one I don t think she s good but here she is Visually is excellent The director of photography catches the attention more than the director here with a gorgeous to look at movie The script again a bit clich but it s understandable given the genre that the movie couldn t get too complex anyway The music not musical set pieces and all that is related to it is great too Jazz In the end if you enjoy for some reason a musical then you would love this movie Because I barely can stand them I hated basically half the movie and loved the other half,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5477695/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2017,Banal and Superficial,La La Land what can I say about La La Land First off let me say that I love musicals I can t wait to see Sing I love music documentaries even if I don t like the artistes yes Oasis I m looking at YOU or even if I haven t heard of the band Anvil The Story of Anvil and I adore films that feature great tracks such as Sing Street or films that feature tracks by the Rolling Stones or The Boss But La La Land plummets to new depths of banality and superficiality In fact the title sums it up ideally The only time it perked up is towards the end Gosling and Stone do well in their roles but they can do better The singing and dancing is nothing special and should not be compared to the magical musicals starring the likes of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers etc I do not understand all the Oscar buzz in fact if this wins the Best Film Oscar I will scream my little head off Whiplash was wonderful but Damien Chazelle has not made a comparably decent follow up In fact the woefully underused J K Simmons should have thrown a cymbal at his head whilst screaming this is dragging 5 10,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3613334/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,Just one word: Fantastic!,Normally I did not even like romantic and musical films but La La Land deserves all the best feelings in deep of heart This wonderful and heart warming movie is the one that everyone can see and feel himself in it Both leading role actors are so good that you can not help yourself to keep your tears at the same time of the scenes that they cyr at least that happened to me As of a horror movie fan I watched it with tears honestly speaking I dont know what will happen to no other kind of movie fans You should definitely watch it do not hesitate,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4293432/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2017,"In which I overuse the word ""love""",I love magic And that s what I felt when I watch La La Land Enchanted There are a lot of complaints about this film I assume mostly due to the never ending positive buzz it s gotten There was even an SNL skit about how widely and overly loved it is But I can t help it I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling I love a musical and I love the classic style You can tell me all day long about how Stone is breathy Gosling looks at his feet when he dances I don t care I liked the way it made me feel and I left humming under my breath and dancing up the stairs I went into the theater for my first viewing in the throes of an existential crisis which come around every other week I was immediately invested in the characters and cried for a majority of the second half A few weeks later I went in for another show time because I was worried I wasn t in a stable mental state the first time around I cried slightly less in my second showing but it still felt as connected Flat out it was a beautifully shot exciting catchy frolic through every young dreamer s fantasy in LA 9 8 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3656141/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2017,They simply don't make movies like this!,I would like to begin this review by saying that I don t give anything away spoilers free review and all I say is in NO way hyping the film The film is just that good fellas It is difficult and quite honestly impossible for me to take a minute sit down and think what did I truly liked the most out of this film Let s start off by saying that ever since Sebastian Ryan Gosling takes the piano and plays it I felt so drawn by the sheer melody Here I am a day later and it is just implanted in my subconscious I find myself whistling City of Stars like I just heard it for the first time Without giving anything away Ryan Gosling s dedication for the role is of the utmost respect and its result is majestic Speaking of which the soundtrack of this film is undeniably addictive It is emotionally driven with the style of Jazz on its back Yes it is a musical the music plays a big role but it is unbelievable how the music in this film isn t its greatest achievement Before revealing the greatest achievement I would like to praise other key factors o the film the costumes the cinematography of the movie scenes which where incredibly satisfying for the eyesight the colors of the sets the choreography which was traditional and old school Everything surrounding the greatest achievement of the film gave that little extra boost needed for it to be one of the best movie experiences I ve ever had Without further ado the coup de gr ce was the final sequence The last 10 minutes of the film All throughout the film the character development was incredible and it lead to me being completely emotionally drawn to both of the characters by the end of the film At the end you can feel the atmosphere you can actually feel what they are meant to feel and how they react to it The movie itself is near perfect but it isn t until the last sequence that it reaches perfection For a movie to be so good and end in a perfect note It just doesn t get any better than that 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3622213/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,"Nice performances from the leads, and generally good fun.",I had a bit of a dilemma at the cinema last week go and see Felicity Jones get ill and die in A Monster Calls or go for some escapist nonsense instead It was a grey miserable January day so La La Land won It was pretty enjoyable too Ryan Gosling did a great job of being e Ryan Gosling pianist keyboard player which is pretty cool in itself and Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic as his love interest One of her audition scenes reminded me of the incredibly powerful audition Naomi Watts does in Mulholland Drive and that might not be a co incidence judging from La La Land s locations Ultimately a musical is going to stand or fall on the quality of its songs and I m not sure these will pass the test of time but the whole movie was well done and a good romantic night out unless you go along with someone you are not totally sure you want to spend the rest of your life with,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621833/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2017,Thoroughly enjoyable,I can t give the film higher marks as although I enjoyed it it was great to watch as a musical it didn t have the power of say Chicago The dance routines were mediocre Having recently watched Astaire and Powell dance to Begin the Beguine the routine by the two actors by the lampost was just well lacking Trying to be cool with hand in trouser pocket they didn t seem to me to be dancing just moving Maybe it s not a fair comparison but if dance routines are included they ve got to be good and memorable Anyway I thoroughly enjoyed the colour the locations and the story We weren t told what was going on in the story it just evolved The girl works in a cafe on a film production set we see her going to rehearsals and despite doing well fails to get parts Chance meetings with the Sebastian they talk about their aspirations etc etc I saw the film with four others and they all said what did you think of that This isn t their usual response and they weren t smiling I just enjoyed being entertained and watching the story unfold The singing wasn t great the songs not memorable and the dance routines OKish the opening dance at the traffic jam was er different I think this scene was telling us that all of those drivers had dreams of fame can t remember what the song was about though It was enjoyable but I didn t leave the cinema thinking I d watched a great film,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627188/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2017,Good movie,Greetings from Lithuania La La Land 2016 is a one good movie Performances by both lead were great and directing by a great Damien Chazelle was amazing Music was also good and this film could be seen even by those who don t like musical movies at all like it do Story here is not very simple actually its more then a love story It kinda shows you the realities of La La Land and how can someone go up and someone fail in this land Regarding best actresses win for Emma Stone she was very good in this movie and i really like her as an actress she is very natural but i still do think that Oscar should have been given to Isabelle Huppert her performance in Elle was outstanding All other wins were true regarding that year nominations Overall i really enjoyed La La Land At some points i could have easily gave this movie 10 10 but it didn t blow me away overall as i hoped it would do nevertheless this is a very good movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3766144/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2017,Dream inducing beauty all around.,La La Land has been met with great anticipation since everyone has been raving about how great it is Admittedly I went into La La Land with high expectations considering Damien Chazelle s previous addition Whiplash was one of the best films of 2014 Fortunately La La Land didn t disappoint in the slightest The film focuses on two young people living in L A trying to fulfill their dreams Both the jazz pianist and actress meet and develop a charming relationship throughout the picture First of all La La Land is a musical a perfectly made modern musical During a time where musicals have found appreciation only if they were released before the 80s La La Land recharges the genre that has been so prominent to the magic of cinema Everything about this film boasts love life passion and fun Pure and unapologetic movie magic that s just fun Anyone who adores the art of filmmaking can recommend this to anyone wondering Why are movies so great This is why No matter how hard someone may try to dislike this movie it s difficult to deny the wonder and pure movie magic this film has to offer Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone both create excellent chemistry on screen together and present some of the best performances of their careers Performances are quite excellent all across the board in fact which brings more life into the picture On another note Ryan Gosling s work in learning the piano for this role also shows remarkable talent considering all the singing dancing and instrument playing is completely genuine For those expecting stage numbers matching Singing in the Rain or The Music Man might potentially be disappointed This isn t a 50s musical it s a modern musical and correct expectations is important What s important to know about La La Land is it s a film specifically for film lovers real genuine film lovers Casual movie goers will also have a grand time if they let themselves but maybe the hype has doomed some film goers experience For anyone that ll have a good time with this joyful experience they re in for a magnificent and dreamworld delight of movie magic that s incredibly enjoyable and pieced together quite perfectly Really everyone should get around to seeing the joy that is La La Land,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3636981/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2017,La La Lamentable,This film is mercifully forgettable In fact I saw it just a couple of weeks ago and already almost all I remember is counting the ways I could have put my 11 quid to better use such as staying at home with a take away and re watching Chicago Moulin Rouge My Fair Lady or any other musical with actors who can actually sing and dance not to mention act lines which make you laugh songs worth listening to and characters not all of them bland yet obnoxious narcissists To be rigorously fair Emma Stone s performance despite the dreadful script does push the production up a notch i e to notch one together with quite good technical features But the nauseous aftertaste you are left with as you walk at last out of the cinema is of the triumph of packaging over content That so many people apparently loved this film is flabbergasting Has postmodernism finally broken free of its stuffy academic niche and convinced a generation that life is nothing more than a shallow pretence to be self referentially broadcast or could it be that few are willing to decry the absence of clothes on this appalling mediocrity of a film,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3654436/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2018,Pure Movie-Making,I m not a expert on musicals The only classic movie musical I ve seen is Singing in the rain I can t say i liked it very much It all seemed too simple too clean dare I say Too romantic It did satirize aspects of the film industry but that s it Where this movie wins me over is with it s layer of modern story telling it s messy It s complicated but at the same time it s pure film making in my mind There s no unnecessary baggage bringing the film down which is what I loved about Damien Chazelle s other film Whiplash It feels personal but not in a obsessive way It s joyous but not in a pretentious or oblivious way I m what you d call a cynic but this film brought a smile on my face But at the same time left me sad and melancholy In a good way Another thing is I really like the music in the film The songs and the score are just awesome to listen to if you re in a good mood and go perfectly with the film This film is not for everybody not everyone will enjoy this film or have the same experiences with the film as I had Specially if you didn t catch it in the theater My hope is that people just give it a Shot,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4158126/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2016,Let The Music Play,RATING out of 5 THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IN BRIEF An enchanting modern day love story set to music GRADE A SYNOPSIS Set in modern day LA two dreamers sing dance and fall in love JIM S REVIEW Who says they don t make movies like they use to Damien Chazelle s La La Land restores one s fate in the creative process and modern day filmmaking A daring and thrilling project the film is a simple boy meets girl tale set in Tinseltown that harks back to the kind of musical that MGM would churn out regularly in days of yore This homage to the old Hollywood musical is simply a class act all the way And boy do we need it now They meet cute these star crossed lovers caught in a traffic jam one that begins our story with such skill and exuberance This unexpected opening dance number efficiently sets the right tone for the film mixing realism with musical fantasy Special kudos to Mandy Moore s spellbinding choreography Her opening number Another Day of Sun is a stunner and the camera angles swoop and spin with such fluidity as do the dancers Jacques Demy s The Young Girls from Rochefort is its direct inspiration and there will be other musical salutes throughout the film Of course we know the two will eventually get together against all odds singing their way into your heart Mia Emma Stone an out of work actress and Sebastian Ryan Gosling a jazz pianist have destiny guiding their every move and fortunately Mr Chazelle doing the same The songs by Justin Hurwitz and lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are clever moving and highly memorable They bring with them the necessary range of emotion that advance the plot so effortlessly bittersweet moments love and heartbreak dreamy romance The haunting love theme City of Stars and Ms Stone s 11 o clock number The Audition The Fools Who Dream are two unforgettable highlights as is the closing number a pastiche that tips its hat to such films as An American in Paris Casablanca Roman Holiday and Singin in the Rain Yes this is a movie that will cause one to swoon The screenplay also by Mr Chazelle takes our two lovers on a journey that confronts life s on going question about love relationships and art It literally sweeps you off your feet and send you into space with a sense of giddy nostalgia and joyous surprise Yes the plot is paper thin Some of the musical numbers seem forced and do not blend with the reality surrounding our lovers Yet the overall effect is still captivating The core to the movies success or failure is firmly in control due to the performances of the two lead actors Both Ms Stone and Mr Gosling have shown that they have a strong chemistry together in other films but here it is so crucial to the film that we buy into their romance Some may not I did totally Call me a romantic While Ms Stone s and Mr Gosling s musical talents are limited and rarely come near the superior footwork of Astaire Rogers Charisse or Kelly the two actors are more than competent and quite charming in their roles They compensate with their strong dramatic acting choices that impress and emotionally involve the movie going audience Mr Chazelle stages his scenes with flair and style He transitions from dramatic scenes into musical numbers with ease The physical production dazzles with its Technicolor dreamscape of pulsating candy colored hues Linus Sandren s cinematography is gorgeous and the production design by David Waco uses the old time movie sets to create the artificial world of movie musicals I particularly loved A Lovely Night a tribute to the Dancing in the Dark sequence from The Bandwagon complete with lamppost La La Land honors the lavish Hollywood musicals of the past those rare breed of movies that became extinct as moviegoers tastes changed Let us hope this film brings about a renaissance of sorts La La Land is a film about love and made with love It is a exhilarating cinematic experience not to be missed,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3607615/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,Takes you to La La Land,La La Land Although im not a big fan of musicals at all this movie is one of my favourites The songs are reall catchy and nice One of my main problems with musicals is the time placement of the songs however the they were placed perfectly in this movie Both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling s acting is amazing and so is the chemistry between the two The character build up is done very nicely One thing is really liked in the movie is the cinematography and visuals which shift throughout the movie as the climax progresses The screenplay is wonderful The ending was pretty shocking for me and after years of watching the movie i still haven t decided if i like it or not Nonetheless the incredible film deserves all the Oscars they received Score 8 7 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8377123/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2017,It's not What you really think,It s not the kind of musical movies that you used which are full of dancing and good music Of course you are going to experience one of the best musical movies ever but that s not the main movie It s highly dramatic with highly realistic message Here s to the fools who dream Damien Chazelle had just nailed it in this movie after he nailed it in Whiplash which is one of my top favorite movies but actually I loved Whiplash more of course the cinematic view of La La Land is much much better but Whiplash was a really special case for me and I couldn t have that in La La Land He definitely deserves an academy award nomination at least this year Ryan Gosling Emma Stone were so so blended and I really loved them Emma stone was dramatically better than Gosling and did much better but overall they were both great If they will get any nomination I think only Emma Stone deserves it I hoped J K Simmons had a bigger role but he was just a guest that we love A Definitely great experience and I highly recommend watching My rating is 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3612897/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,Ugh,Just decided to dive into musicals a while ago and watched The Greatest Showman Then google suggested La La Land Looking at the fact that it was rated better than The Greatest Showman I decided to give it a try I thoroughly enjoyed TGS so maybe I went into watching this one with too many expectations but this one was merh The story was just too plain I feel like it could ve been cut down to one and a half hours and still be okay Unlike TGS only one song in this one pulled me in and that was the one Ryan Gosling whistled Ryan and Emma both are great actors It just feels that the production didn t give them much to work It took me two days to finish watching the full movie I m still dazzled that this movie is rated so highly and bagged 6 oscars The Greatest Showman is far better and has a plot good enough to not make you want to sleep,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7580021/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2017,Mediocre movie with mediocre dancing and singing,I have no clue what all the fuss is about I think it is Hollywood in love with itself All these awards nominations is about as realistic as Trump s 3 million illegal voters The dance scenes are terrible They have obviously learned a few moves for the movie but isn t much better than the contestants on Dancing with the Stars They wouldn t even have made it as supporting dancers for Fred and Ginger The singing is slightly better but not much The story line is trite and obvious I regretted spending the money to see it in a theater When my wife and I came out we looked at each other and said Why did people make such a big deal about this movie I will say the cinematography was excellent but that wasn t enough to save the movie,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626763/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2017,Gosling's film,Ryan Gosling proves to be one the most versatile actors working today with his performance in LA La Land Who knew that he could also sing and dance My previous favorite film of his is Lars and the Real Doll in which he plays an oddball who falls in love with a mail order doll and his family and friends to along with his illusions His partner here is Emma Stone as an aspiring actress who works as a waitress and struggles to survive Gosling is a jazz pianist and of course they fall in love as they pursue their dreams The music is good including John Legend as a singer and band leader who provides an established star for Gosling to work with I am not a fan of the musical genre especially actors singing lines at each other I find the format tedious I was able to overcome my previous prejudices and actually sit back and appreciate the story The ending in not a typically Hollywood one so La La Land is one of the best movies of 2016,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626696/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2016,A Mother of a Good Musical,I grew up on musicals My mother the pragmatic working professional that she is would often take the time to instill in me a love for good music good food and good movies I called her the night I saw La La Land I called her to tell her I loved her and thanked her for raising me La La Land is about as thematically distinct to my sentiments as you can get It s the seemingly simple story of two struggling neophytes turned lovers pursuing their dreams in the glimmering monolith that is Los Angeles Mia Stone is an aspiring actress whose constant auditions and casting calls have landed her a part time job at a studio coffee shop Sebastian Gosling on the other hand is a talented pianist who can t seem to keep regular gigs due to his insistence that his work has some semblance of purity They meet they fall in love and over the course of a year they conflict compromise excite motivate and adore each other for the messes they are Director Damien Chazelle initially studied to become a jazz drummer in his youth that s a biographical detail that makes a lot of sense when viewing his sophomore directorial effort Whiplash 2014 which was one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the last decade What translates to La La Land other than a love of jazz is a sense of timing The score the cinematography the choreography all simmer and pop with lively syncopation The visual references are quick to recall Young Girls of Rochefort 1967 but the timing the timing is pure delirious montage filmmaking As our two stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are an organic recreation of the quintessential Hollywood coupling They shared the screen only twice before making Crazy Stupid Love 2011 into the underrated romantic classic that it is and making Gangster Squad 2013 watchable Here however the story the characterizations indeed the very frames the film rests on are made lovingly for them Any boy do they ever runaway with this film Both ooze pure starlight from their pores and ally ever so perfectly with La La Land s master thesis And what is La La Land s master thesis Well in an interview with The Guardian Chazelle briefly spoke about the struggle of being an artist and reconciling your dreams with the need to be human Wanting to create something in he vogue of a golden age Hollywood musical Chazelle stated that he wanted something more grounded in reality It is that central tension that drives the plot in La La Land and does so in new and surprising ways with both Mia and Sebastian struggling to plug in the expectations of others into their artistic mission Both are motivated to compromise both are willing to commit and we as the audience cherish the idea they ll find their way in the end La La Land more than being a feast for the eye and a virtual smorgasbord of visual homages is a film for the heart A crowded theater cannot help but erupt in in laughter tears and applause when faced with a film spirited enough to be sincere It s all even more awe inspiring when you consider the camera stops and fauns over real singing real dancing and real piano playing on the part of Mr Gosling La La Land is a delight a wonder a superb and significant film that has the moxie to fill any heart with joy and the originality to make it all stick Much like my own mother La La Land is audacious in its ability to capture the imagination with a poise and class that simply cannot be matched It left me with a renewed sense of hope and a song in my heart and here s to hoping it does the same for you,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3599801/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2017,Even good actors might play not well in bad movies,I went to see this movie because I like Ryan Gosling as an actor I discovered him after I watched Blue Valentine and was very surprised that he is not just another pretty face but a really talented strong actor But if I saw La La Land first I would ve probably had completely different opinion about him Movie is bad it is not romantic at all the chemistry between Gosling and Stone non existent It is boring and not moving Ryan please don t play in something like that again,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3650757/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2017,"Excellent cinematography, soundtrack, and acting from Emma Stone",La La Land really knocks it out of the park as a modern musical that incorporates elements of the classics While its initial reception was overwhelmingly positive unfortunately it led to backlash from others many of whom cited reasons that suggest they are not fans of the genre in the first place Even the most cynical hater of La La Land and other movies with joy inspiring visuals and music think Disney films would agree that La La Land s cinematography is incredible It s not just the colors and artistic value of each shot but the long takes far exceeded my expectations So we all realized the movie had two six minute takes which were impressive in their own right There were actually many long takes that lasted several minutes in scenes with just conversations plot advancement Completely unnecessary but an example of the kind of work and attention to detail that went into this passion project The soundtrack has been a hit with millions of viewers around the world Not much else to say here as the music clearly was successful at evoking strong emotions within viewers many of whom bought the soundtrack and relived the movie over and over after leaving the theater Emma Stone is a brilliant actor and really showcases her talents in La La Land While there s nothing wrong with Gosling s performance his character isn t exactly written to be as emotional and expressive he s simply Sebastian the jazz obsessed musician who cares about little else for a good portion of the movie I ve seen this movie several times with people who otherwise wouldn t have watched it but did hear about its critical success Most teared up or cried after all the themes of love and pursuing your dreams are universal Overall La La Land is a wonderful work of art and succeeds when it comes to evoking strong emotions,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3771603/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2021,Modern and Stylish,The first half of the movie was boring and I feel like I m watching a teen movie but the second half became more interesting as it portrayed the challenges of their life The description and music choices in this movie were very nice and stylish Just one line I don t like Jazz is too impolite and disrespectful That line was too strong to accept it I was disappointed It was not a happy ending but it was not gloomy and full of hope Emma Stone has a talent for acting and is very expressive I think she is suited for the suspense and thriller genre than this kind of musical movie I was disappointed with the Disney movie Cruella because it was too similar to The Devil Wears Prada She couldn t bring out the best performance in this movie either I would like to see her play a more serious role,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7563896/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2017,Surely not as bad as (some) people are saying...,I think people expect too much of this film thanks to the slew of Oscars it has won I see it as a well made and expertly shot musical with great songs and many many references to films of a prior age Emma Stone is a much better singer than Ryan Gosling and his dancing is somewhat stiff but they are actors not professional musicians I wasn t expecting perfection from the man or a Fred Astaire impersonation And to his credit he nails the piano not so easy I know from experience If you want a good and very colourful film with excellent music and reasonable dancing this is it if you want an OK film with some REALLY excellent music and dancing watch Chicago,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3687706/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2020,The ending killed it.,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5963724/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2016,Arguably the best film of 2016,This is the dream It s conflict and it s compromise and it s very very exciting Sebastian Ryan Gosling Sebastian a jazz pianist with ambitions to start his own club in LA pretty much sums up the thematic heft of La La Land a contemporary musical that evokes the golden age of Hollywood Together with Mia Emma Stone who aspires to be an actress and playwright the two embody the dreams of young people then and now crystallized in Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers with Gene Kelly thrown in for good measure The opening musical number sets the joyous mood by breaking into song and dance during one of the monumental LA traffic delays on 405 It s choreographed with eye opening color and mirth an appropriate antidote to LA s notorious torture chamber However all is not sunny Hollywood for the dramatic arc takes us through the difficult times this radiant couple must endure while pursuing love in a loveless land This joy and sorrow is directed by Whiplash s brilliant director writer Damien Chazelle whose devotion to the spirit of 40 s and 50 s Hollywood dream factory is matched by his willingness to portray its vicissitudes and not end just the way you would have expected The integrity of this film lies in his showing the power of ambition and the unwavering sacrifice to fulfill it Besides Chazelle the success of this winner lies at the feet of Stone and Gosling whose song and dance are not perfect all the better but so romantic that it is hard to believe they are not professional musical actors and maybe more to the point not romantically involved Yes their chemistry is that good La La Land has already received wide acclaim and rightfully so It refreshes the musical genre of old Hollywood and it reminds us we are such stuff as dreams are made on,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3603862/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2017,"Charming, engaging and visually intriguing",I have now seen the film that WILL WIN the Oscar for Best Picture of 2016 LA LA LAND Did I mention it was a musical Directed by Damien Chazelle Whiplash LA LA LAND is a love letter to Los Angeles Hollywood and the Movie Musicals of the 40 s and early 50 s sprinkled in with a healthy dose of 2016 reality The images are lush and fantastical the music is emminently hummable the dance numbers are sharp and to the point and the performances of the two leads are charming and engaging Starring Emma Stone as Mia an aspiring actress she meets Jazz pianist Sebastian Ryan Gosling love fantasy songs and dance ensue There are times when you see a film and you think No one but this person could play this role Recent examples of this are JK Simmons in WHIPLASH Cate Blanchett in BLUE JASMINE and Javier Bardem in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN Such is the case with Emma Stone s portrayal as Mia Her aspiring actress is charming eager enthusiastic jaded naive and worldly often at the same time Her dancing is sharp and spot on while her singing is very good Fairing less well in the singing category is Gosling While his singing is better than other actor singers like Pierce Brosnan in MAMA MIA or Russell Crowe in LES MISERABLES I would rate Gosling s singing as passably agreeable Fortunately his character is a pianist so he spends more time on the keyboards and less time singing But when he gets up from behind the piano and interacts and dances with Stone the magic happens There is great chemistry between the two leads and that chemistry and charm radiates the screen and pours out into the audience Special notice needs to be made of the choreography from Mandy Moore Dancing with the Stars it is spectacular and perfect for the mood and feeling of this film At times when one sees a musical the dancing stops the story In LA LA LAND the choreography enhanced and furthered the story and I can t wait to see this film again just to see the musical numbers and the choreography Director Chazelle shares with us a vision The Cinematography and images portrayed are intriguing and beautiful and the story and acting moves along crisply for the most part The film was also written by Chazelle and it is clear that he had a clear idea in his head that he did not waver to put on film Is it a perfect film No The film drags abit at about the 2 3 mark and the ending isn t exactly what I was expecting but was appropos for what Director Chazelle set us up for I see multiple Academy Award nominations for this film and wouldn t be surprised to see multiple trophies carried home Costume Design Cinematography Score Song Director and especially Actress Stone and Film 9 out of 10 stars and you can take that to the Bank ofMarquis,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610568/?ref_=tt_urv

18 July 2017,Just NO,La la lend is one of the most boring and stupid movies i have ever seen in my life Im not big fan of musicals so maybe my bad rating is because of it I stopped watch it after half an hour I just didn t want to spend my time more on that movie Actors are bad too There is no chemistry between them u cant feel love between them just u can see only bad acting If u wanna my suggestion i will say better don t waist time on it There is so much better movies then these one And about Oscars i cant believe that these movie was nominated for Oscar these year its just unbelievably,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3757126/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,Excellent film,I had high expectations for this film because it won 7 golden globes and this film topped my expectations It was entertaining and completely unexpected in most scenes entirely different to most of the typical films out there now Ryan Gosling was an excellent actor and a great pianist and Emma Stone was a great actress and a good Actress in the film The film had an amazing soundtrack with songs that are still stuck in my head thanks to Justin Hurwitz who wrote every song on the soundtrack This is a proper film compared to any other film in the cinemas now or made within the last decade Great acting and not a bad scene that was boring everything was right,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619832/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2022,Baffled By The Positive Reviews,I am seriously baffled There is NO story to this I went to the cinema with great expectations and left after forcing myself to stay far longer than I would had it not had Oscar nominations It is dire I really wanted it to be good I like musicals I like both actors it was going to be a perfect storm But I waited and waited and waited for the story to begin or even any semblance of a story but to no avail Truly the most boring achingly dreadful film I ve had the displeasure of watching Of the fully packed cinema I counted 19 people before me leave and I left of the way through so it wasn t just me Oscars now hold no meaning for me If this rubbish had so many thrown at it those who decide must be a bunch of faux elitist arty types trying to pick the worst film in order to pretend they can see deeper meaning behind it or they chose it for a joke to see if the general public can be hoodwinked into loving a film simply because of its Oscars status Utter Rubbish,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8221206/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,Coming out Swinging,They don t make em like this anymore is the thing most people will say when they leave the theater as the credits roll on La La Land and they re right La La Land is a 1950 s movie musical made in 2016 It s an absolutely romantic experience in every sense of the word Romantic in it s visual scope blazing off of the silver screen in Technicolor Romantic in it s gushing devastating appreciation for the art of Jazz Romantic in the on screen chemistry between Gosling and Stone who make a sizzling hot couple for our times I got a Seldon Lockwood vibe for sure We ve all heard the hype this film has been getting and it s for a pretty good reason They don t make em like this anymore Damn right they don t La La Land resurrects an era of filmmaking that many have thought to be long dead It s reinvigorated a filmgoing spirit that once dominated the entire industry and by any luck might just dominate it once again You can thank Damien Chazelle who in one decade cemented his name into film legend and may almost certainly walk home with a shining Oscar this year So with all of this in perspective did the film blow me away Sadly I have to report that it just didn t give me that perfect experience that I wanted It s a great film without question but the problem is I ve seen this musical Singing in the Rain is my favorite musical of all time I ve had that lighter than air skip in my step heart singing feeling before and it s a once in a lifetime kind of thing Many people especially millennials will be feeling this for the first time with La La Land and that is something that I deeply respect It s remarkable that films can still do this to people in our jaded desensitized and often cruel world Perhaps this is what people needed after enduring the unusually dark and divisive year that was 2016 A film like this needed to come along and lift our spirits up and that s precisely what La La Land does It s a feel good romp and we get this right as the film opens with an absolutely swinging musical number on top of a disgustingly busy LA highway I loved loved loved the music It s absolutely the film s strength above all else I d give it two years time before La La Land ends up becoming a hit Broadway musical that gives Hamilton a run for it s money Oh yes it s that good,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608206/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,Terrific,Liked everything about it acting singing dancing direction screenplay etc and it all works Can t remember when I saw a more entertaining picture I am a big fan of movie musicals and strictly speaking La La Land is a musical with some tuneful original songs and a few dance numbers It starts off with a production number in a highway traffic jam right off the bat you say to yourself this will be a special picture Midway through it switches gears into a straight romantic drama leaving the singing and dancing behind By that time though you are thoroughly invested in the story and you hardly notice Gosling and Stone are not known as singers and dancers but they get through just fine he with a three day growth of beard and she with a Senor Wences hand puppet endearing face Writer Director Chazelle has put together a movie which will draw some Oscar noms come Academy Award time A rare picture with no apparent flaws Just saw it again and it was better the second time The No vote crowd will be very disappointed at AA time And apparently some No votes have gone to every single high rating and voted No What the point is I don t know but it s very coincidental and doesn t fool all the people to paraphrase a Republican president,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3606704/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,"We are in La La Land, until we aren't anymore",There is a beautiful quote When we are not children anymore we are already dead If you re not that young don t you miss those times when you were in La La Land Maybe not watching daily the balcony from Casablanca or flying among the stars in an LA Observatory or dancing in the night on the Hollywood boulevards and dreaming to be a famous actor actress still dreaming to be famous nonetheless but in your own way And then you weren t anymore You had a family kids and just recall La La Land from a name on a wall or a place from those times or an old story I felt it that way and I felt it so strongly that I got tears in my eyes at the end,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7781684/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2017,This is Cinema!,Jazz Let it die it had its time Well not on my watch For the majority of the movie buffs in India who barely know anything about Jazz music which includes me too that line wouldn t make much impact But embark on the 2 hour musical voyage of La La Land feel the time freezing around you while Sebastian presses the keys to his piano one by one in the end and you would seriously reconsider your stand on it Jazz would barge into your playlists and hearts with ease Like the bits and pieces that we carry from movies like Titanic Casablanca A Beautiful Mind The Pulp Fiction Dark Knight Rises or take any other all time classics for an instance there are a whole lot of elements in La La Land too that would win an eternal life in your memories It s a magical blend of the following concepts success that comes with a price the beauty and liberty in Jazz that the musicians are trying to rescue from extinction love that s governed by the universal laws drama that isn t so dramatic but sweet and unbelievably beautiful with insanely vivid shots the art of dreaming and the life through a musical kaleidoscope and so many It s pure magic Mia and Sebastian will make you stoned with their dreams music and love You might cry like a baby at the end of it not because of the story but for the perfect blend of something that the world of cinemas has long forgotten Two parallel but very different streams of realizing the dreams that starts at a common point but having no confluence and only a hard hitting end which is hard to digest About the two streams One reminds us of a line from the book The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho The miner was about to give it all up right at the point when if he were to examine just one more stone just one more he would find his emerald And the second is a story of success through sacrifice that s part and parcel of certain decisions they are the game changers but you can t actually judge if it s good and bad It s life the art and beauty of pain that makes for a melancholy Mia I never knew Emma Stone was so talented If Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar I think Mia in La La Land shouldn t even be challenged this time Hollywood has the firepower I have realized and I have madly fallen in love with Mia Futile I know Sebastian a gift from God that fell into Ryan Gosling s laps With his nonchalant yet musical expressions he will show you that this is the role he was born to do Well every shot is beautiful and even if it is irritatingly pink and candy at times you wouldn t care This is CINEMA without the privilege of RETAKES depending only on sheer talent and perfection through hard work and practice I don t think I have done justice to this write up and I seriously think language should give writers unprecedented liberty to come up with new words and phrases to expresses themselves when it comes to movies like this No other go I repeat this is Cinema,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626664/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,A modern masterpiece,I have always struggled with musicals they always seemed like cheesy and unnatural to me That was before today when i was presented to this masterpiece of a film From the very start when the iconic cinemascope logo pops up you know that the movie will be an ode to the art of cinema The cinematography is astonishing and reminds me of Hitchcock and the golden days of Hollywood The soundtrack by Justin Hurwitz is extremely well done and it fits the setting and the characters in a natural way with the musical scenes being natural and thoughtful Ryan Gosling s acting is close to perfect and his style of visual comedy is fitting the movie and Emma Stone can actually sing This movie convinced me that Hollywood is more than box office,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620602/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2016,Best Musical Ever?,OK I know The Sound of Music The King and I White Christmas I didn t really like any of those I recognize that they are great timeless films that many people love including family members and friends of mine but if I personally had to pick a least favorite genre of movie I d have to go with musical But my God this was great In fact it s my second favorite movie of the year after Hacksaw Ridge This is a colorful amazingly directed beautifully filmed movie that puts the music in musical without hitting you over the head with it In most musicals there is a song every five minutes and I m sitting there face palming myself Another one ALREADY However La La Land spaces out its musical acts so that you appreciate them more when they appear And while I wasn t crazy about all of the songs most of the music in the film is gorgeous It also has an amazing ending several moments of comedy and a generous dose of warmth and feeling without becoming too sappy The only complaints I can come up with are a lack of explanation for a certain plot point but the filmmakers probably wanted this aspect to be left open to interpretation and the fact that Gosling and Stone are not professional singers However this makes the characters more believable in a way and you are certainly invited to relate to them Much like The Magnificent Seven attempted to resurrect the Western earlier this year and I enjoyed that film greatly as well La La Land set out to bring the musical back from the grave and if they can make more that are this good I say go for it Once again these thoughts come from a cinephile that doesn t like musicals If you re like me I still highly recommend this film and if you do like musicals boy you re in for a REAL treat Move over Hamilton,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3602492/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2021,Cognitive Dissonance: The Movie,If you are unaware cognitive dissonance is trying to hold two opposing beliefs at the same time This movie is trying to be both an old school Hollywood musical romance and a modern more realistic story at the same time The problem is that these two styles do not play well together You can either have the beautiful yet unrealistic world of Singin in the Rain or Oklahoma or you can have the more realistic but less shiny Lost in Translation or My Best Friend s Wedding but trying to smash together Singin in the Rain and Lost in Translation is going to turn out to be a big mess I am a fan of old school musicals and I do enjoy a more realistic story as well To me this movie was not so much a you got your chocolate in my peanut butter moment as a you got your anchovy pizza in my strawberry cheesecake moment No matter what frame of mind I tried to view this movie in I was just annoyed I appear to be in the minority in my low opinion of this movie but I m used to not thinking like the crowd so I m used to it,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7428416/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2017,attractive dance and music,This movie is about a romance story between a man and a woman A man would like to own his bar which he can play jazz music as he likes He meets a woman who would like to be an actress in a jazz bar First they do not like each other but a closer relationship between them is brought by a common hobby I like a lot of dancing and singing scenes especially A lovely Night This scene has a singing part in the former half and a dancing part in the latter half They say you are not type for me and Our relationship never becomes a romance to each other so I can understand they do not like one another However I am fascinating of their harmonious tap dance as I do not feel they do not like each other I am impressed with the first scene that many people dance in a highway First I do not think this scene is related to the story but it is the important scene that the man and encounters the woman The song and dance are so attractive so I think it is a good introduction I can enjoy the process of developing their love and music and dance I cannot expect the ending but I like this movie as I bought a sound track CD,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3775429/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2021,It should've won the oscar,Don t get me wrong moonlight is a brilliant movie but La La Land is perfection Amazing songs actors direction cinematography and the bittersweet ending is the icing on the top Also i d like to say that musicals aren t for everyone but even if you don t like musicals you should definitely watch this one,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6612817/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2017,Solid musical slightly let down by the musical numbers,La La Land clearly wants to evoke classic movie musicals like Singing in the Rain or the Band Wagon but it s casting is closer to later star driven musicals like My Fair Lady The difference is that the former starred people known for their dancing or singing while the latter cast non musical stars likely to carry the movie with their star power In terms of star power La La Land does pretty well with a good performance by Ryan Gosling as a jerky musician and an amazing one by Emma Stone who is every bit as good as she was in Birdland The stars have good chemistry as the follow the traditional Holllywood trajectory from sniping to googly eyes In My Fair Lady Rex Harrison didn t try to sing he just talked through the numbers and Audrey Hepburn was redubbed but in La La Land the stars are singing and dancing as best they can and the movie bows to their weaknesses with songs that aren t difficult to sing and dance numbers that stay pretty simple Because of this there are no great musical numbers There are some cute ones with songs that are almost memorable and dance numbers that replace impressive performance with cute ideas but there is no Astaire dancing on the ceiling and there is no Minelli telling us that life is a cabaret The sort of performers whose singing or dancing could power an amazing number Gene Kelly Ann Powell Jennifer Hudson Donald O Conner Tommy Tune are in short supply nowadays The choreographer may also simply have lacked the adventuress spirit The first non star number is fun but non musical Malcolm X s one musical number was more memorable My girlfriend liked this slightly amateur hour approach and felt it was unfair to contrast the film with something like Singin in the Rain but I disagree because La La Land really goes out of its way to say look this is just like those old movies with a slightly more complex view of relationships I feel like La La Land really does want to have an amazing dance number but knows it doesn t have the stars to pull it off which may be why the film s most striking set piece which comes right at the end isn t a musical number at all even though it references a few I liked the movie It s fun escapist musical entertainment But I find the critical raves a little puzzling It is a good solid movie but it pales in comparison with truly great musicals like An America in Paris Cabaret Sweet Charity or West Side Story,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3674160/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2017,An Excellent Romance,This is one of the remarkable romance movies I ve ever watched It s a love story of a desperate couple who try to sustain their love while at the same time trying to pursue their career dreams Of course there will be a trade off Their love becomes a dream while their dreams become true The film has effective metaphors also the state of their relationship is perfectly illustrated as the four seasons of a year in an enjoyable and musical way Storytelling is perfect and events are crystal clear For the acting both Ryan and Emma are very good fits for their roles The ending might make the viewer a little bit sad but it is a delightful experience It s probably going to worth your time,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3781706/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2022,"Okay, but not great",A story about two horrible people falling in love with eachother but in the end mostly themselves But of course being two selfish people in a relationship isn t easy which is what then drives the story The format is a refreshing return to musicals which is much appreciated but none of the songs are memorable so it is mostly just for people loving the old musical format The acting is good direction excellent The only thing really dragging the story down is how a unrelatable the main characters are and b how bad people they are If find doing one of the other would have worked better,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8769486/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2017,10 10 Land,10 10 Land What is the perfect film and this can t be a 10 10 were two questions running through my head At the end of the film at the edge of my seat I confidently found two answers This and YES And here s the why La La Land is on the surface a love song to the heyday of Hollywood s musicals a story of struggle to stardom of romantic and heartbreak of the juxtaposition of floaty fantasy and harsh reality The devil in disguise however lies NOT solely in the master level of sound design or editing BUT the juxtaposition between the characters and the duality and the dynamic between sound and image between what s going on IN the film versus what s going IN our collective minds The film is very aware of its own medium which in turn demonstrates the perfect balance between audio and image The movie always suggests ideas which in turn emphasizes more than telling When you must explain a joke the joke is indeed not funny if you don t get at first But never once did the editing undermine itself enough to blatantly turn to words to clarify what the story implies or aims for This is a common mistake predominantly most and every movie makes these days and they can thank mediocre writing and poor understanding of what the medium is capable of Every scene every cut every line every sound cue has a rightful place in this one hundred and twenty eight minute film opus I am simply soaring in the sky after 10 years of devoted film study and more than plus 1 000 films legit rated on IMDb and have no proper way of concluding this review except this anecdote from my friend Now I must go home watch a crappy movie so I can get back down to earth,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3648063/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2017,A pleasant break from reality - just like during the Great Depression,Usually musicals are about a boy a girl a bunch of good songs and some dancing I am not a big fan of the genre but I definitely prefer any Astaire Rogers movie than later productions with loud long songs and too much dancing anything with Gene Kelly Therefore I enjoyed La La Land It has a very simple plot some pleasant songs among which the great City of stars and most of the dance numbers are not overdone apart from the first one of course The opening scene made me fear for the worst being a bombastic number with amazing acrobatics and many people involved But then boy and girl meet not so cute with some minor road rage and the show tones down a bit Gosling is Sebastian a would be jazz pianist and Stone is Mia a would be actress After the bumpy start they get together and support each other s dream until their professional success becomes the main problem Not a groundbreaking plot from poor and happy to rich and famous but not so happy anymore The slightly melancholic ending wraps up the story perfectly I usually do not like much Gosling but he was OK as Sebastian and Stone is lovely However in too many close ups of her face her eyes and lips look disproportionately huge Neither is a great singer but their imperfection is quite endearing They had enough chemistry and their songs and dances were fine My only negative remark is about some corny dialogue Both Sebastian and Mia encourage each other not to care about what people think but to do to what they like As performers they should care a lot about pleasing people Lots of artists are out there doing what they like with zero or very little following and very rightly so because they don t respect the public While integrity is appreciated self absorption not so much I left the cinema feeling better than when entered which lately happens quite rarely Maybe it is the hard times or the stress of life but this movie was definitely a pleasant break from reality,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3629165/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2021,My Favorite Film Ever,If there s no such thing as a perfect movie then La La Land simply doesn t exist There s so much right with it that I can t put into words how much I love it But I m going to try 1 The Opening Right out of the gate director Damien Chazelle lets us know what we re watching without a doubt it s a musical Another Day of Sun is an amazing musical number that shows us why people go to Los Angeles All told in one shot with no main or secondary characters being there It s one of the best ways a film could start and it s the best way this could 2 Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling This film doesn t have too many characters But it works it s able to tell Mia and Sebastian s story really well with pretty much just them and John Legend in the second half And Emma and Ryan are a joy to watch Their chemistry is impeccable but seeing as they ve been in three other films together that s not too suprising They both put on amazing performances especially Emma in her Audition towards the end Ryan s commitment is astounding and it really shows They can both sing and dance well something especially highlighted in A Lovely Night They re both really fun to watch and their relationship and it s problems are believable and they make it even more believable 3 Damien Chazelle He s amazing His style and writing feels unique and never boring this is especially shown in the film s song sequences He makes these characters relatable and likable From his long takes to quick back and forths between characters everything he does here makes this film look even more beautiful 4 The Music and Score I love it Easily the best score for any film I ve seen Yes I mean any I can t put into words just how much I love it Listening to it again it s just amazing Epilogue might be my favorite but that s not to say literally everything else here isn t perfect The only song I can think of that isn t Start a Fire is intentionally not as good as that s the point of the song But I d be lying if I said I didn t enjoy that either The music clearly took time and effort and it pays off because without it the film wouldn t be nearly as spectacular 5 The Epilogue This scene deserves it s own category It s such a gut punch but it s so beautiful I can t not cry from the ending while also being swept away by how beautiful it is The set the score the choreography it all paid off for this ten minute long scene that I can t possibly get sick of 6 Conclusion There s something about La La Land that I can t ignore It s gorgeous in every way possible There is only one perfect film and this is it I encourage everyone reading this who hasn t to sit down and watch this movie It s too good not to see,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6701123/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2016,Not an original story but a masterfully told one,I went to see this by myself today and boy did I cry like a baby Being a massive fan of Whiplash I had huge expectations for this film which were all somehow exceeded La La Land s tone contrasts strongly with Chazelle s previous masterpiece but it still has everything from beautiful cinematography solid script and of course error less directing The story has been told thousands of times before cant say more without spoiling it but it never once felt like a replication of anything What made it special for me however was how real it felt You might disagree since characters break out singing and dancing all the time which of course does not happen in real life The long takes combined with staging and lighting makes it feel a lot more like a musical performance than a movie But as do all great films this one brings out each viewer s own personal story and all of its raw emotions The acting is perfect This is the best I have seen from Emma Stone although at times I still think Ryan Gosling managed to outshine her a little bit Last but not least I cannot write this review without mentioning the scores From my humble experience with films from the last few years I would say no one understands music better than Chazelle Nothing is there without serving a purpose for the story And damn he has such good taste Can t wait to see what Damien Chazelle does next 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601618/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2017,Beautiful film but overpraised,I am going to be honest La La Land was getting into my nerves before I watched it after so much full on publicity I watched it just because it was recommended to me by a a friend who is not usually into this sort of films This is the story of the artistic and personal struggle of a couple of young artists who fall in love at the wrong time and struggle with the harshness of pursuing a dream not making it and having to find a way of life to pay their bills and keeping the relationship This is also a film about what would have happened if A Sliding Doors sort of reflection Indeed the best part of it or the one I enjoyed the most were the last 10 15 minutes of the film which kept me crying for about 15 minutes non stop Emma Stone really deserves the Oscar it is not that she dances OK and sings OK it is that her performance had a great coloratura she shows an incredible dramatic register and versatility in this film I liked Gosling as well and he is a great dancer he also sings OK and plays decently but his acting was a bit more monochromatic I know that the film has been praised as a musical but I think is just a decent musical not a good one It is just that they don t make musicals like in the old times any more and the first one that comes out is like wow Was it wow Well no The film mimics the style of the musicals of the 50s and 60s on which I fed for years but never gets to the level of mastery in the music dancing singing and production that those films had On the other hand I think this film has more value as a drama than most of those classic films and that is what I enjoyed the most the story and the acting beside the musical part All the musical numbers are enjoyable and well realized but I wasn t wowed by them Perhaps the thing that moved me the most was Emma Stone s singing at her final audition and watching Gosling dance with such great style and easiness One of the things I enjoyed the most about this musical is the ode to jazz embedded in the story The conversations about what Jazz is between Sebastian and Mia and between Sebastian and Keith are really wonderful The soundtrack is very good needless to say I enjoyed La La Land immensely but I don t think deserved so many Oscar nominations or such an insisting pedant heavy publicity and praise Good yes wow no,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3658947/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,emotional appeal infused with music,There may be many philosophical reasons to contradict the story of this movie and they are pretty accurate in their own right but that doesn t make this movie any less genius Hollywood movies are mostly dry of emotional appeal and love is pretty much objectified by stuffing sexuality in a well thought strategic point of the movie This movie is like a breath of fresh air in suffocating idea of romanticism movie is trying to depict love and passion in realistic and idealistic way at the same time another factor is its emotional appeal very few movies try to connect with the daily life of common people which is a good selling strategy for movies music have succeeded in communicating emotions to the audience Emma stone have been herself and was well suited for this movie but Ryan have done exceptional job i think this movie is very original and artistic as it shows every moment with the right level of intensity it deserves it is obvious that such romanticism isn t helpful in real life but if one could show various forms of romanticism i e with another human with career with music etc it would come out like this movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621666/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,Not an ordinary love story,I saw LA LA LAND last week after hearing the news that it won 7 Golden Globes The movie starts about an aspiring actress and a jazz musician falling in love with reality catching them The first half is the rosy phase of knowing and loving each other part whereas the second part is unexpectedly different with surprise ending The movie can have different interpretation to different people but is beautifully made Musical score is great especially the initial dance sequence Great acting by Ryan and Emma Emma kills this one with so much expressive acting Strong contender for Oscar musical category,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619282/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2017,What the end of cinema may look like,Saw this via HBO on demand 12 9 17 I found myself watching the clock after Emma Stone s first audition scene The word insipid could have been invented with this over praised movie in mind If La La Land contains any harvestable celluloid or even Mylar let it be recycled for ukulele picks at the earliest opportunity All of the no dance dance numbers the prole music songs the mediocre scene study acting add up to an excellent reason to stick with YouTube public library DVD collections and any remaining used book stores With their many improbable finds all of the latter are superior ways to find entertainment intellectual stimulation or simply the inducement of sleep Even sitting in a corner doing nothing is a less expensive way to waste two hours and eight minutes There is better production design and more imaginative cinematography to be found in your average halftime television commercial And yet Six 6 Oscars Emma Stone actress Damien Chazelle director as well as cinematography music song and production design Even more Golden Globes If La La Land is what it looks like these days to be in contention for a Best Motion Picture award the end of cinema is upon us,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4003020/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2021,it exists,Let s just say during the approximately thirty seconds we thought this had won Best Picture I was unhappy at the decision The setting and music are both good but the plot and acting were very bland,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6633178/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2021,Overhyped and never deserved all them awards.,This is one film which no way deserved all them accolades Maybe if there is award for a musical then maybe As a musical I set the standard at The greatest showman Which is a far superior movie,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7336577/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2017,The leads are okay to watch butt...,This is a film so painfully aware of itself it knows the exact number of wrinkles in its own anus At the same time it is inexplicably oblivious of its anus primary function controlling the egress of fecal matter Lots of pretty technical wonders are pooped onto the screen but they don t really serve any purpose except to drown out sounds of the film s bowel movements,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3808384/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2017,"I love it, yet I hate it, but I still love it... while hating it",They say a great work of art makes you feel something Still I m not convinced this is what they had in mind Because this movie this movie It s about Hollywood And it s about music And art And dreams And about chasing all of those It s set in the modern times oddly enough yet its style and way of talking way of experiencing is straight from the olden times It s Hollywood nostalgia at its finest From the big showstopper musical numbers to its characters and stereotypes and stories And I love it Both the main characters with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling giving career defining performances Their romance their differences their passions all of them exhilarating and you could spend decades strolling down the streets and boulevards singing songs in smoky clubs basking in the sun that shines just for them And I hate it For every musical piece of genius there s a number that makes me feel manipulated For every moment of such beauty that it makes me tremble and wish to be a better poet to express it properly there s a moment when you want to take the movie by the throat and demand what s wrong with it why is it they way it is Why does it insist on dragging itself down with its melancholy and forced realism On and on it goes and by the end I was left exhausted by conflicting emotions With such minor changes I could have had a movie that would have inspired me for years to come Yet what I hate about the film also makes it stronger Because what I hate are not flaws but differing ideals Because while this film is all about Hollywood nostalgia and dreams it s also about that which was always left outside when talking about those things And that s not something I can argue against So here s to the dreamers But also those that wake up in the morning Those that fail Those that don t achieve their dreams And here s to those that keep on dreaming,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3730484/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2023,Here's to the Fools who Dream,It s Damien Chazelle month Seeing this a year after my first watch I ve seen this film four or five times now but I just finished watching it and I can say that this is surely the most heart wrenching emotional intense engaging watch that I ve ever had I never wrote a review for my favourite film strange and I ve decided to really write my heart out and I couldn t do it on a better platform I m not going to write an analysis because this film doesn t need it surely not from me I just wanted to write about the power of this film of its director the power of music and cinema the power of love and all the themes that the film deals with I recently started therapy after years of not living and this journey has helped me realize things that I consider vital crucial things that made me who I am now In simple terms after watching Damien Chazelle s first two films precisely a year ago something changed in my brain La La Land stayed with me for months and did something to me That something was preventing me to develop a depressive disorder Like a drug it basically alleviated my symptoms For many people La La Land is about a love story crushed by the two s deepest dreams and lifetime aspirations strongly underlining the romantic aspect and not focusing on the enormous tide of other themes For me this film is about ambition the land of dreams Los Angeles that we aspiring filmmakers dream of every night hoping to one day go there and make our dream come true a portrayal of life through the romancitized lens of a camera that is our eye thus the romance between the characters and LA and the director himself about love with the best character dynamic ever created between Ryan and Emma that literally brought tears to me eyes tears is not enough waterfalls There is much more than this The music There s a reason why Damien is surely my favourite director Since I was a kid I enjoyed watching films in the theatre that had great scores in them Justin Hurwitz is the contemporary emblem of music in cinema orchestrated and non that comes also from the value and crucial narrative importance that Damien gives to music And I appreciate that so much I don t know what it was but today I felt this more than any other time I started weeping right after the first frame Learning that Damien Chazelle and this film basically saved my life add so much to the watching experience and to the attachment that I ll always have for it After it cut to black I was back to reality My friends on the screen disappeared and I felt alone but not scared anymore hopeful excited to live life to listen to jazz to write scripts to start shooting movies as I m doing to one day move to LA bringing forever with me deep in my heart the life lessons that this movie so gently taught me,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9252379/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2023,A Magical Movie,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9089003/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,SO GLAD I went for the rental!,I miss the days when Hollywood didn t have to throw their shoulder out of joint patting themselves on the back for being hip and clever because they actually WERE hip and clever This movie is nothing more than two hours of Tinseltown sniffing its own farts and trying to convince us that they smell like roses Never have I heard such bland and uninspired music accompanied by a horribly pedestrian excuse for dancing The blueprint for how to do the perfect musical was laid down 64 years earlier in a little movie called Singin in the Rain The filmmakers here seem to have learned nothing from that movie the characters are shrilling and annoying the plot barely existent and the chemistry between the two leads well it just falls flat I had high hopes for this movie but in this day and age of lowering the bar on just about everything I should have known it would be rated far higher than it deserved,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4265833/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2017,"Long movie, no plot, mediocre actors",This movie was the longest 2 hours of my life The songs are nice at best which don t make it up to the fact that nothing happens in this movie No plot just long boring done by with mediocre actors The entire plot of the movie could have fit into ten minutes The only good part of this movie was the music This was the most boring movie I have ever seen Total waste of time Do yourself a favor and go see something else,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3649924/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,Take along your smartphone in case you want to read during the dull parts,I went into this expecting a really fun movie and ended up alternating between watching it and reading a short story and I finished most of the story It had great potential but even allowing for the fantasy during the musical numbers which I personally enjoyed it simply wasn t developed well enough and the plot had a lot of holes If people don t like jazz these days how is he going to get them to come to a jazz club no matter how pure the music is Or especially if it is rarified Do people really show up at auditions with so little attention to their appearance If she doesn t like jazz why is she so struck by his jazz music The worst problem is that the singers all have weak voices which detracts tremendously from the songs I didn t find the music memorable but I enjoyed it at the time The stars aren t great dancers either I never came to care very much about them they didn t have a lot of chemistry and were only intermittently likable I would have liked most of the musical scenes except for the amateurish singing and dancing I don t see a lot of movies so I generally didn t get references if that is what the people who liked the movie were charmed by The romantic and professional angst scenes were too long and too many Isn t it o k if Gosling sells out his music until he can earn enough for his club How else does he expect to get the money if his preferred art form is dying That was when I started reading on my iPhone the ringer was turned off I thought that the final scene was very well done although it didn t tie into what went before too well It doesn t really connect to the decision point that preceded it I see by the reviews that some people hated what I loved and vice versa so good luck deciding whether or not to see it,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621724/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2016,"Unfortunate Title, Tremendous Movie",My review of La La Land no spoilers but perhaps a few too many semicolons run on sentences and parentheses ahead You should understand for starters that I don t like many critically acclaimed movies Odds are if it is nominated for Best Picture I ll probably find it pretentious and tedious I m not a man that loves mindless action but I do typically prefer my films a little more on the mainstream side of the aisle La La Land however walks a masterful line It is at once funny poignant novel retro gripping layered and very straightforward It is a movie that knows that as a full on song and dance musical it cannot be taken literally and yet while it winks and nods at the audience it manages to tell a serious and timeless tale I felt the weight and import of the decisions demanded of the protagonists and still could laugh out loud at the comedy And laugh I did Repeatedly Once I let go and immersed myself in the universe of the movie and this movie demands that you either check in or out immediately as in literally from the opening seconds of the film I found myself looking forward to the next inside joke and the perfect deadpan delivery by Emma Stone The film has an infectious innocent exuberance that carries you along on a wave of happiness even when the subject matter gets melancholy Or at least it does in the first half If I have complaint about this picture it is that somewhere in the final act a kind of moroseness sets in that is out of balance with the joviality of the first half I understand that the direction of the character development requires some tonal changes and I don t fault the movie for it Even factoring plot requirements into the equation though I felt that the movie changed character in its latter stages in a way that was unpleasantly jarring This was not an unpardonable infraction however in fact I think that the film managed to find itself in the waning minutes in a way that was powerful and sweet As the credits began their crawl I found myself in profound thought not sure whether to cry from joy or sadness Without spoiling any of the plot development this is not a film that makes conclusions for you it lets you reach your own decisions about its climax but it certainly requires you to ponder This should be obvious After all isn t that the goal of any story Yet most movies fail to so move me It seems that most storytellers including Chazelle himself in his previous oeuvre Whiplash either fail to give you enough stake in the story to warrant the effort to really search your soul or manipulate you into it through gimmick and misdirection La La Land manages to get you there without resorting to falsehood Any misdirection it uses in the final minutes is directly and openly atoned for as the conclusion is reached and the viewer is left with some honest questions to ask themselves The movie achieves this without forcing its morals upon you or foisting any political ideations into the debate In the end you are left with a pleasurable experience catchy music good laughs and some introspection about how Seb and Mia s shoes might fit you for a mile or so It is unfortunately named and suffers from a little too much jazz worship and ultimately I wonder how well it will hold up on second viewing but based solely on how much I enjoyed myself in the theater this is my pick for best movie of the year move aside Rogue One you had your week at the top and perhaps best since Lincoln another exception to the Best Picture rule Your mileage may vary Lastly actually penultimately I added something else below but don t want to edit the paragraph a word about the film from a parent s perspective I didn t really want to go see this film I only went because I wanted a date with my 9 year old and I don t feel comfortable with the violence in Rogue One and have no desire to see Sing This movie is PG 13 and after viewing I think 13 is a good minimum age This is not at all because of objectionable content in fact besides a barely audible f bomb and some other fairly innocuous profanity and a little immodesty there is nearly nothing to object to but because the film doesn t shy away from subjects that are deep and mature My daughter loved the singing and dancing and conviviality that often brightened the theater but she didn t understand the more existential questions of purpose fulfillment relationships and missed opportunities that are ultimately at the core of this film As such she walked away with a decidedly mixed reaction and a complaint that the movie was too long In the end I agree that it could use about 10 more minutes of excision mostly in the second hour but I believe her impression was less a fault of the movie and more a fault of her youth Don t hesitate to take your kids with you to see this film but don t be surprised if they don t really get it I ve only ever been on the front row for two films The first was Avatar in IMAX and now this No film should ever be seen from the front row but I chose two particularly bad films to so endure Avatar for obvious reasons and La La Land because much of the film is shot in single take roving camera sets and with shots that purposely put focus on both sides of the scene simultaneously for artistic and symbolic purpose Do yourself a favor if it is sold out wait for the next showing rather than taking that front row seat,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3605081/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,Weak and Lackluster,The cinematography is stunning The direction is great However the story is not There s no chemistry between the two leads Emma Stone can act very well but Ryan Gosling was so FLAT There isn t anything superior about this musical Maybe if you have a great attention span you will find this enjoyable There s nothing that compels you to finish watching this It s boring and not a good movie And the singing and sounding editing is horrible You can barely hear the singing Everybody is mumbling and sing with their chest voice,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5842955/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2016,A triumph of cinema.,Musicals are a rare breed in cinemaland these days Once every so often a big budget effort Chicago Les Mis Into the Woods comes along to remind us they do still exist but even these films don t do much to entice newcomers to the genre Now I don t know if La La Land will succeed where others have failed and prove to be the birth of a musical reconnaissance but if any movie can achieve it this is definitely the one Vibrant funny and superbly shot this tongue in cheek throwback to the upbeat musicals of Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire is a toe tapping delight from the ambitious highway set opening number all the way to the closing what could have been sequence Following up after the phenomenal Whiplash writer director Damien Chazelle has definitively announced his arrival into Hollywood the combination of flair and technical mastery in which he executes each diverse set piece is astounding The song and dance numbers continually build on the story a struggling actress and a budding Jazz pianist juggle life love and their lofty dreams whilst always bringing something fresh both visually and musically whether it s an 80s parody dance sequence or a soulful jazz interlude Director of photography Linus Sandgren must be given his due praise too the camera work is both enterprising and stylish the frequent unbroken tracking shots adding another level of pizazz to the proceedings Yet for all of the wonder and awe brought by Chazelle and his crew the film still requires a headlining duo capable of providing an emotional core that can match the song and dance fireworks Step up Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling In their third movie opposite each other after Crazy Stupid Love and Gangster Squad the ridiculously talented acting pair not only boast a sizzling chemistry on screen but also get to show off their dancing and singing skills that much to the normal person s ire are obviously brilliant More accessible to the average moviegoer than many previous modern musicals La La Land is a triumphant convergence of music dance and awe inspiring cinema,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3609588/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,Uplifting,It s not often that I see a musical especially the one with Ryan Gosling in it I was very impressed by the whole thing the color the music dancing and acting in my opinion were at a very high level This movie is truly original and leaves a good impression I watched it twice,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7783224/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2017,"Must see, for basically everyone ♥",If you haven t seen it yet or the hype hadn t convinced you just believe me now when I say You need to go to the cinema ASAP Just one warning though You won t be able to get the music out of your head IMDb sums up the movie in one sentence but there is so much more to it although I have to say A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles is the only way to describe the plot without giving away any of the important scenes So let s start shall we The movie begins with the most clich musical scene I ve encountered in a long time but it sets the mood for what s to come being everything else but clich Sure here we have a case of a kinda corny love story but it is full of surprise fraught with intelligent conversations and witty comebacks and most importantly has an open end to open up a whole new world for your imagination Our protagonists are Mia and Sebastian played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling the best movie couple they could have found for these characters The seem so harmonious together it s sad at the end of the movie you have to discover this isn t real life Also the music oh have I mentioned the music I ve never been a fan of Jazz in fact I d thought I didn t like it very much Turns out I ve just hadn t listened to the right stuff Another thing that convinced me is that the soundtrack doesn t only contain jazz but also beautiful piano tracks Sure one might argue they aren t the type for musicals but this one seems to be different in so many ways The whole arrangement of different styles within the movie makes it drop dead gorgeous to watch even if you don t like the story If you haven t figured it by now it s a 10 10 for me,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3749635/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2017,Worst movie of 2017 -,Here we are January 2017 barely one month is past and we already have the worst movie of the year Beside the sorry lack of continuity poor lighting and average acting La La Land will put to sleep in La La anyone who likes this genre except for the very loud progressive jazz The person who recommended this movie to me will suffer accordingly no promotion or raise for the foreseeable future and will be made to pay back the money I spent for the tickets my wife and another couple Do I have anything good to say about it Nahhh I just wonder how in heaven s earth this trash got even one Oscar nomination unless they have a category for boredom inducing relevant script on two hours of celluloid The producers must have had no budget for lighting equipment The movie is as dark as third rate horror trilogy Talk about a spoiler here is one I spoiled 2 hours trying to stay awake with some success And IMDb shows 8 3 rating Is this another case of alternate reality Save your money for a good movie,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628872/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2017,Disappointing,The film is impeccable the color processing developed for the occasion gives a remarkable result The soundtrack is sympathetic to who appreciates jazz Unfortunately this is not enough to make a good movie The scenario should be up to par This is not the case It s boring We leave with an impression of banality of d j vu The story is hollow the dialogues are hollow the lyrics of the songs are hollow A vaguely romantic tale on a colorful background It s not enough,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3726688/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,All this praise? You' ve got to be kidding!!!,I guess the power of advertising remains a marvelous and powerful medium that has but one goal To make more money And in my view La la land delivers the perfect example of this clever but unfortunate phenomenon Of course everyone will go to see it even I did after all It will undoubtedly make a bundle for its producers and investors and may quite possibly even win a few awards that increasingly appear to be handed out with the sole intention of increasing a film s profits even further How can this possibly happen Is it really all about money What did all of these people that saw the film see that I didn t Admittedly not much attention should be paid to Mr and Mrs Public who will continue to slavishly follow the opinions of others and are perfectly satisfied to have their minds dulled by average entertainment But what about the critics e g IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes among others and especially the ones who are actually paid to deliver a service and whom one hopes and trusts to be just a little objective Who can be trusted not to mislead the earnest movie lover these days I fully appreciate that taste differs but please please tell me what exactly separates this film from mere unabashed mediocrity In considering this just for a moment one is mindful of some of the musicals of the 50s Hit the Deck is just one that did not possess the money machine camera work and technological advantages that are readily available today It bears pointing out that La la land is a mere pale shadow of some of those films of so long ago More to the point In my view La la land is a mediocre effort not worthy of the actors talents nor of that of the Director who after all gave us the wonderful Whiplash I do have to say that Emma Stone does her absolute best against almost impossible odds and gives a great performance but Ryan Gosling is not only miscast but displays no visible energy for his co star He appears somewhat wooden stiff and almost disinterested in the movie and this describes his dancing and singing as well The film s editing furthermore leaves a lot to be desired and creates a disjointed feeling for the viewer It is almost as if some of the scenes were just thrown together haphazardly in a hurry in a boring and predictable script I really could go on and one may wonder why I have spent so much energy in criticizing this film but I simply cannot believe the accolades that it continues to receive and this upsets me greatly Finally after seeing La la land I was left feeling dissatisfied and somewhat angry at having sat through it Yogesh,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621654/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2017,Very overrated. The musical numbers aren't memorable in the slightest.,I loved Whiplash but this is a nauseating saccharine look at Hollywood from Damien Chazelle Nearly every scene socks you in the face with a bright over saturated colour palate of primary colours blues greens reds and yellows The music is completely forgettable with not one song and dance number standing out The plot is pretty generic and takes no unexpected turns Boy meets girl they fall in love they each succeed with their careers but this causes them to break up The End Seriously that is the whole plot of La La Land Beef that flimsy premise out to 2 hours of movie with plenty of boring songs and watch the Oscars come pouring in I did enjoy the chemistry and acting of the two leads which while not Oscar worthy was adequate Chazelle s a talented director no doubt about it and there are some nice camera moves and shot compositions on offer here But he is capable of much better than this,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3705104/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2017,"You might like it, and there's nothing wrong with that!",OK so this kind of movie really isn t my thing I m certainly not into musicals Although I appreciate great acting and great music However I do like jazz so that certainly helped me get something from it If you dislike musicals and jazz I d suggest you give this a wide berth The opening part on the freeway and some of the later scenes had me reaching for the sick bag and now a song for no reason staged backdrops and jumping around clich Why not make a movie with all the great music but have filmed stage performances and rehearsals instead of interjected and now a song moments I suppose it wouldn t be a musical but whatever It would never be my go to movie but for some people probably many wives and girlfriends it s a nice little comfort blanket escapism piece of enjoyable fluff that s sincere competent and harmless Excellently shot directed and acted,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3653277/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2017,Pure and beautiful,La La Land is one of the best movies I have ever seen I felt grateful for its existence while watching it The very first scene immediately brings joy and I haven t stopped paying attention since then Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have great on screen chemistry and are incredibly good at their job It is technologically very well done movie I enjoyed the long shots Maybe it looks kitschy at first sight but actually many techniques of art film are used there It is a nostalgic movie but on the other side it redefines the whole thing into modern age Creators managed to give both ends to viewers the wanted one and also the real right one Perfect,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621631/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2017,Uncomplicated joy,Here s a confession I am a somewhat nostalgic person When I hear a tune by Ella Fitzgerald or Frank Sinatra I think to myself what happened to this kind of uplifting well made wonderful music The same goes for musicals The pure uncomplicated joy expressed by the classic Hollywood musicals seems to be a thing of the past It was an expression of postwar optimism when people yearned for escapist entertainment In the cinema all they wanted to see and hear were nice sounding tunes dazzling choreographies colourful set designs and happily smiling characters Later on as society changed the social dramas the war movies and the psychological thrillers made the musicals look a bit silly The musical didn t really die but the happy go lucky feeling of those classic Hollywood musicals did Recreating it seemed impossible Until La La Land came along The film captures a spirit of carefree optimism that nobody expects in 2017 The title the cinematography the boy meets girl story the Tinseltown setting the references to classic films it all fits perfectly together In this sense La La Land is a wonderful movie On the other hand it is just that a modern day recreation of the classic Hollywood musical It s good really enjoyable and fun to watch but it s not monumental thought provoking or deeply emotional I enjoyed watching it but the hype in the media and the record number of award nominations are perhaps a bit overdone,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3632027/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2021,A Major Disappointment,I should know better than watching Academy Award movies as every time since the late 1970 s they have been a disappointment The trailers are better the movie normally but I should remember this before renting a movie I love musicals good ones especially the ones that the professional movie critics hate It seems we are getting quality musicals out of the Indian studios,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6564253/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,"Fresh, light, colorful - but a bit thin",Saw this yesterday Did not know what to expect Drama and romance well why not I m a bit bored of all those superhero space adventure remakes they push nowadays Surprise I was a bit scared when it became obvious it s a musical I don t like many musicals Well luckily it was not a typical American musical but just a song here and there Still some of the songs felt they were just plastered over the story What was American however was how it was filmed A lot of static camera with big faces on the screen Not very ambitious but at least they avoided unnecessary trickery A few exceptions and traditional cuts played nicely along the story I loved the colors The story is a bit thin I felt a there wasn t that much chemistry between the characters but perhaps that was exactly the point And it was light at the same time not very dramatic after all Refreshing Singing and music sounded real and not too perfect which was perfect after all Sadly there isn t any Jazz clubs in this town I d be sitting there very very often Perhaps I should set up one myself I can see they tried to copy the vibe of some classic movies but unfortunately fell a bit short Quite far at the same time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619537/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2018,Wonderful,I m doing a bit of catching up with some 2016 2017 titles and La La Land has been one of my most anticipated The film is absolutely brilliant from every standpoint Obviously it gets ton of credit for the cinematography score songs etc but it s all for nothing if it doesn t have emotion I haven t been this moved by a film in a long time the full of real life ending is where the film rises to the masterpiece category There s something bubbling under the happy go lucky cover and I kind of got similar nostalgic vibes from the story than what Boyhood 2014 offered Audition The Fools Who Dream is a fantastic song that tickles all the right senses Obviously every review has to also mention the opening scene done The two juggernauts of that year s awards season Moonlight and this are both something special but I d probably give the slight upper hand to La La Land A very rare four and a half stars out of five from me,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4415708/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,Should be called La La Lame,What is the big deal about this movie Did I miss something I know it s been out for the last 7 years but I saw it for the first time a couple days ago Trust me it s not a movie you re missing out on if you ve never seen it I wasn t expecting much and that s exactly what I got if not less Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are Sebastian could the writers have thought of a cornier name and Mia a jazz pianist and aspiring actress trying to make it big in Los Angeles I didn t see the film from the beginning so pardon me for that I think I watched for 10 minutes until I couldn t take it anymore She runs out of a restaurant where she s dining with a group of people and meets up with Sebastian at a movie theater She stands in front of the screen while Rebel Without a Cause is playing in the background right at the part where James Dean was about to kiss Natalie Wood Good grief I need Pepto Bismol I ve seen movies from the 1940s that were much less wishy washy than this junk I was so confused by the setting Was it supposed to be the 1930s 2016 or both The inconsistency of the time period is enough to give you a headache Being a person who loves classic black and white movies I thought the filmmakers failed miserably at capturing the magic and charm of Old Hollywood They could ve at least gotten a better looking actor and actress to play Sebastian and Mia That was the first time I had watched Emma Stone in a film and not to sound mean but I don t see where she s cute Same thing with Ryan Gosling The media touts him as being sexy but I don t see it I am the biggest fangirl for male celebrities and I never saw where he was handsome He s not ugly but not steaming hot either There s no story in this film besides 2 unattractive people goo goo eyeing each other Please don t waste your time with La La Land Highly overrated,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8811949/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2017,The Best Cinematic Experience of My Life.,I ve seen quite a few movies especially the ones that appear each year in award nominations so I feel like I have a decent perspective I remember Whiplash and loved it and when I saw that this film was from the same creator I got excited After I watched the trailer months ago I shared with probably everyone I waited months for it to finally make it to theaters I saw it right after Christmas and I had high expectations and was a little worried that wasn t going to meet them But forget that La La Land exceeded those far and away I m not a movie critic so I won t try to use the fancy and eloquent review style of writing I ll just tell it like it is This movie is the most beautiful thing I ve seen on screen and quite possibly the most beautiful piece of performance art I ve ever seen too It s beautifully shot the music is incredibly addictive and full of emotion the story is timeless and the acting especially from the leads is absolutely outstanding Thank God these two ended up in these roles because the chemistry and character of the two is simply perfect La La Land takes you on an incredible roller coaster that s beautiful in every way Technically the film is a musical but don t let that turn you off if that s not your thing It makes the story twice as good There aren t too many musical numbers and each of them is incredible as well as important to the story I love musicals so that probably helped but the point is you re going to love this one You fall in love with the characters with the music with the story and this movie will affect you Each of us can relate to La La Land and the film makes me want more out of life but at the same time it gives an incredible experience just watching it happen,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610940/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2023,So much hype so little substance,So as far as I can tell This is the story of 2 talented people who had a relationship that didn t work out but they still have a fondness for each other The best part of this movie is when the little girl Mia s daughter breaks the 4th wall to give a thunb s up to someone off camera That kind off sums up this movie it s not a comedy it s not a love story and it s not a musical You can say well this guy played a piano in it and they sang and did some dancing but what was the end dynamic Sometimes you have to give up on your happy ending to achieve your dreams wow What a feelgood takeaway not Also I would not have even watched this if it had not been mistakenly made famous by being announced as the winner of an award it did not actually win,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8860554/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2017,"Surprisingly uplifting, beautiful old school musical",I am not a musical fan to be honest and honestly saw this film cause Hidden Figures was sold out in UA Sheepshead bay BK However La La Land which has gotten a lot of hype after their Golden Globe dominance turns out to be a beautiful work about the pursuit of one s dreams and what can happen on the way LA is the city of angels broken dreams and full of haunting old symbols of the golden age like Griffith observatory the highways film lots etc The modern setting coupled with the music and cinemascope was brilliant and really established he film s mood Acting Emma and Ryan in my opinion were very good and their dynamic throughout this movie was astonishing The Oscars would be a fool to ignore Emma s performance which is brilliant in particular her breakdown after her one woman play goes poorly or her work near the end both of which should get her a nomination Reynolds is just as good and their chemistry lifts this movie through the good and in their argument scene where Reynolds really captures the pain and frustration of doing something he hates but helps him survive Now is the dancing like Kelly or Astaire No and its clear both are not singers but they did a good job in my view with that and the music while its not awe inspiring really hits you particularly City of Stars which is my pick for best original song Flaws I was confused why Simmons Legend and Dewitt did not really have more of a presence in the film to continue the storyline Chazelle as building about dreams vs reality This hurts the movie because at times Stone and Reynolds journey was odd without more people in their worlds pressuring them to give up and conform which would have added to the film s emotion Also the opening wasn t that great and in the middle the film did kind of lag a bit Overall though the movie was good and did feature some magical scenes like their dance in the planetarium and in the magic hour overlooking the city Chazelle really establishes himself as a director for his choices at capturing this city of hope broken dreams and melding it in a way Mia and Sebastian s journey symbolizes not just other creative people but everyone who takes a chance to pursue their loves and faces all the heartbreak frustration and joy that comes along the way Now the last hr of the film in particular the ending is brilliant This movie is not dialogue heavy and Stone s eyes really capture her emotion s as things begin to happen as does Reynolds body which droops when he s down or vice versa when he s up Those final scenes in particular the montage which reminded me of Pixar s UP is the correct ending in that our dreams take us down different paths and we dnt always stay close to those along the way we remember their efforts that helped us make our choices and fulfill the goals we desire La La Land to my surprise is one of 2016 s best films,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621982/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2023,"Smart and enjoyable, bringing the vibes of classics into the twenty-first century",Musicals as a genre require a level of willful suspension of disbelief equal to or sometimes exceeding even far flung fare like high fantasy This is more true in some instances more than others no matter what one thinks of each in turn the somber drama of The phantom of the opera or Evita are sometimes easier to lose ourselves in than the whimsical Technicolor reverie of Singin in the rain or Les demoiselles de Rochefort Damien Chazelle bless him tries to have it both ways on one hand the cold reality of trying to make a living in show business and a perfectly modern day setting on the other hand an affinity for vibrant hues light and fleet footed chords and playful song dance and expression far outside the bounds of real life It s safe to say that musicals are a niche genre for a relatively select audience and never more so than when they embrace the fancifulness that this does Him and haw about the particulars all one wants however while it s not wholly perfect I d just be lying if I said La La Land wasn t delightfully charming and terrifically well made I think this is great It s a little daring in my mind to bring the musical stylings of the 30s 40s and 50s into the twenty first century Jacques Demy was arguably pushing his luck even in his career albeit to incredible success I have to give Chazelle credit though for doing exactly that and moreover for whatever past or subsequent points of comparison one may drum up the skill intelligence and outright brilliance that shapes this marks it as a creation all its own Justin Hurwitz s original music is simply a joy a panoply of delicate yet flavorful themes and songs that precede the even spicier compositions he would bring us in Babylon I also appreciate the very subtle nods he gives to other titles from which this derives some influence Mandy Moore s choreography is just as vivid and dexterous not to mention delicious as she hearkens back to the musicals of yesteryear with the frivolity As if they haven t proven themselves time and again elsewhere it speaks so well to what outstanding actors Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are that they are so relentlessly charming and adept as the proceedings require and even more so that they accordingly developed new skill sets as part of the process in this production As we saw before in Whiplash Chazelle s direction and Tom Cross editing are both marked by extraordinary calculated precision that s at once deliberate and a tad forceful yet with a fluidity and expertise that makes it feel natural Where La La Land becomes a tad troubled is when we step back and see the forest and not just the trees It s not that this deficient in any especial way but I think in total it s a little imbalanced in a couple capacities One is that despite the obvious intent not to mention marketing the musical styling comes and goes more than one would think More than not Hurwitz s compositions form a sandwich in fact the genre affectations are heavily loaded into the front and back ends and while the middle is not bereft the respective disparity is noteworthy Second quite dovetailing into the first is that the picture struggles a bit with the severity of how its tone shifts I don t mean the mere fact of moving from more lighthearted story beats to more dramatic ones for most movies do that and I don t even mean the ultimate outcome of the story for there s successful precedence for this within narrative fiction generally and the genre specifically Rather the swing is so ponderous from the gentler romantic comedy to the solidly dramatic center before settling into a bittersweet mood for the last stretch that it almost feels like we suddenly shifted not to another tone but another film Considering the concurrent diminishing of the music s prominence and the turn that this shift also requires in the performances the result is jarring in a manner that comes off not as a satisfying well rounded storytelling but as a sudden sharp swerve that Chazelle had difficulty fully accounting for in the screenplay he had labored on so much That imbalance is unfortunate because setting it aside so much about this is incredibly well done I absolutely include the production design and art direction the costume design and the hair and makeup above all in early scenes and in the imaginative finale the color and splendor this bears at such moments is dazzling as is Linus Sandgren s cinematography The feature boasts strong production values all around as far as that goes And notable issues aside by and large Chazelle s screenplay and his vision are not just commendable but admirable The story in itself is smart and compelling and the scene writing of which it is comprised Mia and Sebastien are characters that feel very real with their complicated and conflicting thoughts feelings desires and personalities and the dialogue certainly echoes all this More broadly I appreciate Chazelle s willingness to take his tale in a direction that s less commonly seen in cinema pointedly bringing to mind another of Demy s classics also evoked as suggested in tinges of Hurwitz s score I also observe some cheeky instances herein where the dialogue becomes slightly meta and self referential above all in Sebastien s love for an art form that is not nearly so widely celebrated as it once was though unlike too many other cases where the indulgence is overbearing and tawdry I think the filmmaker weaves this facet in very smoothly And it bears repeating modern movie musicals rarely carry the same sensibilities about song dance and spectacle as those of decades past even if at length La La Land does so incompletely the parts of this title that viewers will remember most are those that recall like fare of at least several decades past Chazelle s union of past and present is imperfect but it speaks very well to his creativity and intelligence that he even tried let alone that it turned out as well as it did I feel like the success of La La Land upon release the awards it received the genre space it plays in and not least the gaffe at the Academy Awards in 2017 have all worked against it in the past several years The vibe I ve gathered up until now has been mocking in some measure not to mention tired disregard both in light of the genre that has faded in wide appeal and the perception not inaccurate that the arbiters of film awards tend to favor a very particular and narrow range of pictures to the detriment of countless others and that this 2016 picture benefited from that artistic prejudice All this is to say that despite how much I like everyone involved and all the high esteem in which this is mostly held my expectations have been mixed Now that I ve finally sat to watch for myself I understand the reservations that others have had for there are earnest critiques to make on ways in which the end result falls short Still more than not the praise is nonetheless well deserved indeed When this movie is firing on all cylinders it s outstanding case in point while City of stars won Best Original Song at the Oscars and reasonably so I personally think Audition The fools who dream is even better and more impactful When all is said and done I do quite enjoy La La Land and I happily give it a firm recommendation with the caveat that it s not flawless Especially for anyone who is receptive to what Chazelle is doing here however it s a splendid entertaining musical that s well worth checking out,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9257041/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2017,A Love Song About Bittersweet Happy Endings,After the ebullient opening scene of La La Land a musical number staged in an L A traffic jam and featuring a cast that celebrates the diversity of that city I thought I was going to adore La La Land But nothing else in the movie quite measures up to that opening scene I liked the film some of it quite a lot but it did not affect me the way it has so clearly affected others I m a bit surprised that people are talking about leaving the movie on a high or referring to its ending as happy La La Land doesn t exactly end unhappily but the happiness it does deliver to our principal characters is qualified The film both an homage to and a contemporary re calibration of the MGM musicals of Hollywood s golden age suggests that human lives have more than one possible happy ending and that by choosing one you necessarily have to pass over another Better be sure then that the one you choose is the one that will leave you with the fewest regrets about the ones you let pass by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have enough chemistry to light a fire Indeed they have so much that one is almost disappointed that they aren t a real life couple I don t know that the characters they play in this film take either actor that far out of his her comfort zone but both give terrifically charismatic performances Stone especially steals the film right out from under the feet of everyone else Gosling and kinetic director Damien Chazelle of Whiplash fame included I ve seen others refer to La La Land as a love letter to Los Angeles I don t know L A that well and what I ve seen of it I didn t care for so I might be biased But this film struck me as less a valentine to the City of Angels and more of an examination of the allure the world of fame exercises over dreamers and the determination that world demands of those who are going to make it there Grade A,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3611969/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2017,One of the best movies of the year for 2016. A classic old-school musical in a modern setting.,I was hopeful when I saw the early news about this film but didn t expect it to be as wonderful as it was From the opening sequence to the final credits you will be tapping your toes and dancing in your seats Great performances even if some of the vocals are a little understated which might just be a creative decision La La Land could have been set in almost in decade of the last 100 years but fits rather perfectly in the contemporary time setting Ryan Gosling learned to play piano for the film and does a great job with his performance Emma Stone gives a stellar performance where you feel that she is standing in the theater with you and giving you her heart and soul Do yourself a favor and go see it La La Land will put a smile on your face and a song in your heart,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621577/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2021,Not sure what the fuss was about,For a musical this film had no rhythm It s lacklustre plot took a good hour to become apparent and oscillated between passing quickly and ever so slowly I was clawing at my eyeballs Overall I found nothing to grab me It was turgid and very self aware It knew all the buttons to press for the Oscars nominations but for those not obsessed with their own industry there was little here to grab me,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6496719/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2017,It was so-so.,If i had just one word to describe the movie It would be just meh Definitely not an Oscar win for the actors I have to mention that Emma Stone really bothered me throughout the movie I don t know if it is her eyebrows or what but that was the biggest error Gosling was fine He pulled off those little comic reliefs If you watch the movie simply for entertainment I guarantee you will end up sleeping I watched it at the theaters and hell if I watched it anywhere else that s directly dreamland for sure And the music is nice So that encourages that even more There s nothing really special to the script and story line Just little heartbreaks and awes but nothing much I literally could expect what would happen and the parts where I am supposed to feel sentimental All this hype about this movie astounds me I guess we were really craving for a prevalent romance movie for a while Gotta say the visual of the overall screenplay is good The music is nice too Definitely not a fan of the boring story line and Stone,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3648267/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2017,Good,La Land In 21st Century Los Angeles a couple Mia Emma Stone an actress and Sebastian Ryan Gosling a pianist The two do not do very well in their respective careers First let s talk about the actors Ryan Gosling does well on his character as does Emma Stone But it was Ryan s job for his role in case Ryan Gosling did not have to learn all the songs that had the piano included And Emma Stone it only counts and does it very well The montage of the scenes are impeccable very good Especially in the scene of the bridge Damian Chazelle deserves the Oscar because he does these kinds of scenes But I do not think Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling do not think they deserve the Oscar 8 10 Good,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642411/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2018,"I wasn't as bowled over as most people purport to be, but it was much better than anticipated.",I ll be the first to admit that I m not in the target demographic for La La Land 2017 especially considering that I hold the musical as my least favourite and most cringe inducing genre by quite a wide margin but I ve always maintained that I will watch almost anything within reason and it s been hard to find anyone from critics and the academy to general audiences and even those who much like me are not typically enamoured by the genre not singing this nostalgically musical romantic comedy s praises at the top of their lungs So I gritted my teeth as I gave it a watch and I m glad that while I can safely say that I wasn t anywhere near as bowled over as most people purport to be it s actually much better than I was expecting thanks mainly to some superb directing and a mature layered screenplay It s clearly at its best when not overtly a musical the conceivably diegetic song and dance routines fit the material much better than the ones clearly abstracted from the predetermined reality made all the more jarring when overly fantastical elements such as flying are tossed into the fray as it tells a subversive story that slowly creeps away from its romanticised roots and ends on an aptly realistic note with a message that runs counter to most others in the genre Plus a couple of the songs are kind of catchy too 7 10,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4140053/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2016,An Imperfect Gem!,Damien Chazelle s La La Land is made with pure ambition genuine skill A Romantic Comedy Drama packaged as a Musical this recent Oscar Frontrunner is a dazzling watch However Despite its luscious beauty an extraordinary performance by Emma Stone the film is somehow fumbles in its later half that takes away its glory to some part But a small glitch doesn t shun away its undeniable merits La La Land Synopsis A jazz pianist Ryan Gosling falls for an aspiring actress Emma Stone at her best in Los Angeles La La Land is a love story that has some of the most beautifully choreographed musical numbers in years Each Every song is exquisite a treat for the eyes I was awed by the detailing the overall presentation Hats off to the team And Chazelle s world works even when its not being a musical Yes the love story between its leading characters is warm believable You watch later explore these two people in love how their dreams come their ways La La Land is a love story for sure but it also indulges in themes like life itself how dreams cannot be compromised even when they damage relationships at times Chazelle treats the narrative with realism all through the first hour And that s exactly why the second hour underwhelms The addition of a sub plot featuring John Legend who offers Gosling to play with him is clich d seems out of place for a film that so beautifully mounts itself on such magic in the first hour Chazelle s Screenplay takes risks adds extravagant musical numbers drama makes them come together but he seems to have given in to clich s a lackluster middle point I wasn t impressed by the sub plot nor by the difference of opinion the couple get into there after Chazelle s Screenplay picks up again the culmination is affecting How I wish he dared to add something more rather than adding a turn we ve experienced an umpteen number of times in such stories Chazelle s Direction is fantastic there s no doubt on that While his Writing lacks perfection his Direction is superior at all times La La Land is a visual spectacle with soul Chazelle s true skill as a storyteller comes to the front Surely some Oscar calling awaits him Linus Sandgren s Cinematography is top class Tom Cross s Editing is terrific Justin Hurwitz s Score is enchanting La La Land is a true musical ride as the songs here are chart busters Art Costume Design are marvelous Performance Wise Emma Stone owns La La Land with a career best performance Stone fearless relentless emerges a big winner here delivering a performance that comes straight from the heart She beautifully conveys her dreams of being an actress who sadly hasn t gotten a chance to shine how truly she falls for a man Stone is faultless may I say that she has never looked this gorgeous before Ryan Gosling on the other hand is nicely understated as the jazz musician who d never let his passion be bygone even though its nearly dead Gosling expresses with ease his approach to love is real Also the on screen chemistry between Stone Gosling is infectious A special mention for J K Simmons Rosemarie DeWitt who shine in brief roles On the whole La La Land doesn t utilize its potential entirely but its still a solid effort that shouldn t be missed Its definitely among the better films we ve seen this year this film deserves to be experienced in the cinemas I saw it at IMAX it only heightened the impact NO where else And I miss you Los Angeles See you soon,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3596091/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2021,What an awesome film!,I ve always believed La La Land to be a highly overrated film However having now seen it I fully agree with the acclaim La La Land is a love story but I found it more realistic than most romance films out there So often Hollywood mistakes lust for love and call it romantic However with La La Land they finally got it right Emma Stone stars as Mia a waitress who has dreams of becoming an actress Ryan Gosling stars as Sebastian who has dreams of becoming a jazz musician Mia hates jazz They seem like people who are not meant for each other but through subtle moments they grew fonder of each other until it finally developed into romance I enjoyed the way the romance started as a plutonic friendship and not wanting sex from the beginning This was far more romantic With bright and vibrant color in decor and costumes the film has a distinct 60 s feel Unlike many musicals out there the musical sequences were never over the top except for the opening sequence maybe For most parts it was toned down effective and beautiful There were some illogical moments here and there but for the sake of a musical it was all good fun Let s talk performances Wow Excellent Emma Stone especially was fantastic I felt every emotion she had I felt her joy her happiness her desires her sadness She was incredible I related so well to her character for many different reasons Ryan Gosling was also very good and relatable La La Land was also an unpredictable movie It has an interesting ending that makes you think What if Beautiful I loved this movie,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7241442/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2017,Nice musical that appeals to a more contemporary audience.,This is a pretty good musical about jazz pianist Sebastian Ryan Gosling who dreams of opening his own jazz club and in turn falls for aspiring actress Mia Emma Stone The opening number with motorists in colorful clothing dancing on the highway is nicely choreographed and set to toe tapping music is a good precursor to the main plot There isn t a whole lot of songs in the film but enough for you to enjoy both the music and the story about Sebastian and Mia at the same time The plot is not awfully fast paced and there are some filler scenes but overall it s easy to follow the main characters lives and drama and you get to see a good deal of character development between them There are also some humor mixed in as well that will give you some laugh out loud moments It s a good movie overall that blends in the classy style of old musicals and letting it appeal to a more contemporary audience Grade B,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3718142/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2023,Here's to the ones who dream,Needless to say it s a masterpiece The music costumes casting color palettes cinematography camera works and J K Simmons everything was perfect and beautiful It s not just modern Romeo and Juliet but plenty of ironies are hidden and I loved it For example Seb complains about endangered jazz and its audiences But in fact he s one of them bc he didn t see jazz players too In addition to that there s a magical number A lovely night But it seems cgi although it shoots real scenery And Emma Stone She s a real actor singer and dancer I ve never seen such a talented person expect her She sings well but not very well And I think that s the point of this story A normal person sings and dances it s what a musical movie is This is also the love letter to Damien Chazelle So Damien if you re reading this sorry my English isn t so good thank you for creating such a masterpiece It s already the movie of the decade Hope you have a wonderful day this is not just for Damien For everyone who reading this,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9024962/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,A fine tale of Shattered and Achieved Dreams but shows us how much do we owe and miss Classic Musicals of Old Hollywood.,La La Land 2016 Brief Review A fine tale of Shattered and Achieved Dreams but shows us how much do we owe and miss Classic Musicals of Old Hollywood In the first intentional meeting of hero heroine in La La Land the heroine gives a reference of Iconic film Casablanca 1942 and the very next moment i knew in my mind somewhere that this film is going to have a similar climax like Casablanca where the Hero will have no girl in his life and has to leave Heroine who have another guy in her life As expected it had the exact same thing but just the theme wasn t so iconic or timeless like Casablanca and the impact of course wasn t upto Casablanca i believe no film will ever match Casablanca level La La Land has positives to admire but it also has some issues to deal with The biggest problem of the film is it is known as a Musical but doesn t have enough Musicals to be called a Musical Second biggest fault is both the leading artists Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are below average singers and dancers hence all the Musical scenes look lukewarm It proves again that how much do we owe to Classic Musicals from Old Hollywood by Gene Kelly If you remember Singin In the Rain An American In Paris then certainly you are not among those audience who call this Mediocre La La Land a Great Musical I am out of the list La La Land fails as a musical and it was acceptable because of the modern techniques of filmmaking but it also failed to keep the narrative well versed I don t understand why that 5 6 minutes dramatic dreamy segment in the climax when the decision was made mutually by hero heroine both If it was mutual then of course there was no need to stretch thier shattered dreams through average visual portion It wasn t the first time when we see Hero heroine not ending up together because of their careers then why the hell make it look so international and effortless It was a simple idea and definitely acceptable and impactful too but just because of stretched and mild storytelling it has to lose points from its overall impact And talking about the opposite side of it the hero and heroine both confess that they will love each other forever then why there was not a single scene which shows the seriousness of their relationship Despite regular 2 hours runtime i had to see the runtime bar several times that shows how much the film dragged whereas i remember watching 3 hours long musicals without checking the runtime bar once Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both give honest performance and thier dedication in the scenes can be seen with their efforts Screenplay has many haults for no reason and so editing had to be more tight but both the things couldn t collaborate nicely to make it a solid team effort Director Damien Chazelle has made a good film overall but not subtle and detailed He missed many nuances and made many small small blur mistakes which technically pulls La La Land much down to make it stand much lower than Old Musicals made almost 5 6 decades ago Overall La La Land is a fine tale of dreams and it works on both the sides of coin shattered and achived but as a cinematic musical experience the final impact stays on Decent Level which is far lower than what some people have made it look i mean Great Somebody here in IMDB users reviews said Shame on Hollywood for endorsing this mediocre film as Great Musical i agree slightly and anyways i don t care much about Oscars RATING 6 10 By samthebestest,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213572/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2018,Lala indeed,The opening scene features a women singing to the camera whilst sitting in a traffic jam however it really looks as though she is miming which in a way is quite fitting because after all the film is called lala land and in many ways the makers of this one had carte blanche when it came to putting it together The best thing beside the walking baselines in the soundtrack are probably the references to the 1950s Hollywood cinema as the whole spectacle is very much a self addressed cinematic love letter The aesthetic is pleasing but this is all form and no substance if you want to see something truly unoriginal then you should give this a try Really this is like watching a computer game trailer for a classic movie,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4051652/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,Absolutely Breathtaking Film,La La Land is likely to go down in history for being one of the most memorable films of this generation It somehow finds a way to perfectly balance old timey themes which are hard to incorporate without seeming too clich with modern elements and did so without one single hiccup The music and visuals are absolutely breathtaking don t be surprised if you find yourself keeping each and every song on a never ending repeat during the days following your spectacular movie experience La La Land is guaranteed to make you feel almost every emotion possible throughout the film whether it be happiness nostalgia contentedness sadness or if you re like me all at the same time For those of you about to watch this one you re in for a real treat You won t see another one like this for a very long time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625114/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2017,Just a Stupid Musical,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3648431/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2017,Best Cinematic Experience,This movie was absolutely amazing in all aspects including cinematic story songs and visuals It connects with the viewers especially ones that have big dreams This film brought me to tears because I felt that I connected with Mia Emma Stone on such an emotional level I have never been this moved by a film before I feel the joy in my heart just hearing the songs and watching the film I saw it three times in theaters and each experience was as great as the first Gosling and Stone are magic on screen and their chemistry is electric,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3688577/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2016,"Charming and, yes, magical",Oh yeah the backlash is going to be huge with this one Especially when it s up against more important films like Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea I definitely had problems with the film I found its main themes and conflicts to be quite unoriginal I also thought the screenplay at times didn t know where to go and was only really at its strength when it was building moments and scenarios for the songs In that respect the film isn t unlike Whiplash which also had a screenplay that was its biggest weakness Unlike that film though I think the screenplay is definitely more than adequate enough for building this world around the characters I can imagine many people taking heat for preferring this film over many of the other Oscar contenders I can see criticisms of it being too basic and too simple On a pure filmmaking level the film is gorgeous and so brilliantly made but I also think the two leads do a great job of building that emotional connection Is the film complex Not particularly and that s going to be part of the backlash Does it need to be Not really no Only because it isn t complex doesn t mean that it s not a film worthy of praise for everything it accomplishes I think it s easy to look past how utterly charming and magical it honestly is I definitely had problems with it throughout but it wasn t until the last several minutes where all of my problems sort of dissipated concluding in the final minute that made me more emotional than all other films I ve seen this year aside from Moonlight s final scenes It was at this moment where I realized how much I enjoyed it and how much of a connection I formed with the characters I feel because of this because it s not about particularly thought provoking or cerebral themes and because it basically succeeds or fails on one s own personal experience watching it all films do but many of them don t highlight the personal subjectivity as much as this one it s going to receive a lot of backlash But what the film did make me appreciate and realize more is that we shouldn t take the little moments specific moments in our everyday lives for granted No other film this year has taught me to become more mindful of the moment and to enjoy the present In that respect it s escapism at its most effective For that the film should be celebrated and for that I deeply admire what it did Is it my favorite film of the year No Will I be as enamored with it in the future Perhaps not as much as now But what an experience it surely was But now having said all of that do I think it s a particularly great film Not really sure To now more specifically talk about the performances Emma Stone is just an incredibly charismatic and charming actress It s not a very dramatic role but it doesn t need to be I definitely do have a hard time seeing her win the Oscar though Ryan Gosling is good and also has some of the same charm but he suffers here from what I believe he has suffered in many of his films the last few years He has a certain too cool for school persona that gets infused into all of his performances It works for certain roles like Drive but I honestly can t help but feel what another actor could have brought to the table I think he s at his best playing alongside Stone but his individual performance Not really sure it should be up for any award nominations personally,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3604444/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2016,Most magical movie of the year,I ve got just one word for it MAGICAL 2016 has given us some amazing movies and this one is definitely in the top 5 With the most beautiful soundtrack and two of the best actors this movie just casts a spell on you Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have amazing chemistry and I ve loved their pairing since I ve seen Crazy Stupid Love The soundtrack is enchanting Justin Hurwitz delivers the most memorable tunes of the year City of stars being my personal favourite Mia and Sebastian s theme and The fools who dream vocals by Emma Stone standout After delivering Whiplash i certainly expected a lot out of Damien Chazelle and he doesn t disappoint one bit La La Land can be deemed as One of the greatest musical of this generation and the most Romantic movie of 2016 Go and give into the magic you won t be disappointed,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3602545/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,Beautiful...,La La Land is a Comedy Drama musical in which we watch the lives of a pianist and an actress falling in love in Los Angeles and continuing their lives together Their life has its ups and downs and they try to balance their lives with their careers I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazingly interesting plot that contained plenty of entertaining moments accompanied with beautiful music The direction which was made by Damien Chazelle who is also the writer of it he won the Academy Award for the Best Achievement in Directing it was very good and he presented very well his main characters their personalities their dreams and fears something that we could relate to The interpretations of both Emma Stone who played as Mia she won the Academy Award for the Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role and Ryan Gosling who played as Sebastian were outstanding and their combination created this beautiful result Lastly I have to say that La La Land is an amazing musical and I highly recommend everyone to watch it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7777247/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2017,For Love at Art,What better way to use my first review for this wonderful movie La La Land is the new project of Damien Chazelle director who followed when he showed a Hollywood of what was capable with his exciting Whiplash And it s that if we talk about Chazelle we talk about passion and the love he brings loaded on video every time he plays a camera We re facing one of the best cinematographic works of recent years inviting to dream love singing dancing And for this they put us in the context of the two protagonists Mia Dolan played by Emma Stone and Sebastian Wilder played by Ryan Gosling This endearing pair of artists have already worked seamlessly on previous tapes performing the roles of an aspiring actress and a jazz pianist who end up falling in love after being in various situations in the city of Los Angeles From the premise which we have heard of her a thousand times we can find in this story also miles of reasons to know that it is not the typical romantic comedy Shops that deal with a special musical from the outset in the that each melody fulfills both the sound perfection and the development of the characters We assimilate that the soundtrack shares from the beginning a ligature with each protagonist and that isn t in a euphoric moment of the jazz pianist the music creates more euphoria still Each scene is pristine bright pure and visually beautiful It has a classic tonality that honors the great tapes that made the history as Casablanca Michael Curtiz 1942 Singin in the Rain Gene Kelly Stanley Donen 1952 Rebel Without a Cause Nicholas Ray 1955 or The Young Girls of Rochefort Jacques Demy 1967 and many more which have a direct influence on this film For this the director proposes a photograph that also shines or degrades depending on the state of the characters with a use of bright and radiant color in much of the film in moments of happiness desire to succeed euphoria in the pursuit of dreams and some more mature dark in the conflicts between the protagonists in their cadences as artists or in a less ideal future than at the beginning Around this circle of genius left the music and photography we have two great Hollywood actors in the role of these artists who completely fill that gap we need We could no longer imagine another that wasn t Emma Stone in this role There is a great job behind all of this and yet once you don t destabilize by a good dance canteen I seem to be a positive point to the cause since you grant realism to every scene however ideal These are recurrent in the film since Chazelle wants to tell us the sacrifices in this case love that have to end up making our dreams come true The memories that only the characters have in them or use the melancholy with all the aforementioned resources makes this tape the transmission of love that sits in a way not tacky with versatility gives the same musicality to the dialogues This perfect couple with a relationship from outside totally normal is also complete inside as happens in reality The question can it destroy a relationship of personal ambition could define the film Life puts the obstacles that each person limits in one way or another until reaching the goal Taking everything said in the conclusion he found one of the finest worked finishes of the past times which he was lucky enough to enjoy several times on the big screen It s sweet and cloudy at the same time it is a smile and a tear A tribute to the cinema that only the political correctness has deprived him of the Oscar to the Best Picture,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3693344/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2017,Right kind of nostalgia,This movie has some fantastic shots in it and it manages to bring some of the amazement you can get from watching an actual musical live The songs are mostly not that memorable but they re always welcome when they come They re also spaced out in an interesting way fitting with the emotional flow of the movie The actors do a terrific job playing their parts Even though I can easily get caught in nostalgia I am also quite wary of it This movie delves in it but luckily it does in a way that feels thought through and in the end it seems like it comes to terms with the fact that the present ain t so bad either You can try to recreate the past or you can bring the positive aspects of the past with you as you head into the future To me the latter is the most appealing and it s how I felt this movie handled it All of that said the movie never excels It s a nice musical with great acting impressive shots and a nice setting and it deserves praise for all of those things The complete package works nicely but it it s no great loss to miss out on this movie,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3697331/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2017,"A Stellar, Very Original, Heartwarming Production,",La La Land is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast It is one of the most refreshing films to hit theaters in years the phenomenal Damien Chazelle harks back to the golden age of Hollywood musicals all the while bringing a fresh new take on the genre It is not merely reflecting on the classic musicals but updating it for today s world The musical numbers are also outstanding City of Stars being a particularly heartwarming song The final act did stumble a but for me It spends so much time developing Sebastian and Mia s relationship in great detail for the majority of the movie that in the end it is as if they felt under pressure to wrap things up fast The ending itself is a well executed one but I will admit I felt underwhelmed by it I was expecting something a lot bigger that could compete with what we had seen with the rest of the movie The highlight has o be the undeniable chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone They have worked together numerous times before that it seems almost effortless for them to perform with one another at this stage This is very effective for an audience watching two people simply enjoying being in each other s company They chronicle the numerous different phases of these characters relationship brilliantly portraying the emotions they are undergoing in each moment It is original but it does not try too hard to be it simply wants to tell a story about two people trying to conquer their dreams Heartwarming extravagant and well acted La La Land is a treat that any moviegoer should not want to miss Two people trying to follow their ambitious dreams fall for each other along the way Best Performance Ryan Gosling,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3632863/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2017,Subverting Expectations,La La Land is without a doubt one of the best technical films I ve ever seen There s so much going on minutiae you d miss after three or four viewings For instance notice how Emma Stone s character is pretty much without make up through the whole movie It s jarring given we ve seen her wearing make up heavily through much of her career Here we see her raw and clear until she becomes a movie star Then suddenly it s the Emma we know wearing makeup and more artificially beautiful because of it La La Land starts with a big happy musical number that doesn t fit in and I think is the weakest part of the whole film It sets the optimistic and glamorous tone but has no bearing on the story As it goes along through the first twenty or so minutes we see Mia Emma Stone living a fantasy life essentially doing everything she can to make it big in Hollywood while making coffee for the stars Everything is bright and colorful the music is reminiscent of the golden age of Hollywood musicals It s a fun time Cut to Sebastian Ryan Gosling and his mundane poor uninteresting life He s basically in the same boat as Mia They re both struggling to make it in Hollywood him in music she in acting But the colors of the film are more subdued here there s not a bright palette and the scenery isn t dreamlike and fake He lives in the real world It takes a little while before these two characters get together but when they do the film is wonderfully whimsical and almost satirical My favorite moment of the first half is when Emma Stone just happens to have tap dancing shoes in her bag for a big musical number The movie knows the tropes and does everything it can to either subvert them or make a joke of them The romance is wonderfully human with great chemistry between Gosling and Stone They re funny and likable awkward and sweet And then the movie begins to turn La La Land s final act is not forcibly depressing but it does bring the fantastical down to the human level again It goes from a tale of romance and chasing your dreams to how attaining your dreams mean giving up the things you love selling out The final montage a beautifully realized and extremely effective culmination of every emotion in the movie is a middle finger to convention as well as a reflection on all the choices we make in life that have left us in the predicaments we are in Everyone has wondered what their life would be like had they done A B C etc It s a touching finish because it subverts our expectations for this type of movie while also applying that subversion to our own lives Another piece of the film I loved was the jazz storyline how Sebastian was forced to sell out to the modern jazz he seems to have disdain for in order to make a living It s an interesting case of selling out that s handled extremely well Mia doesn t mind the music and I would go so far as to say that John Legend s song in the film a modern jazz tune is the best piece in the whole movie But while the movie is celebrating classic jazz it also celebrates the idea of metamorphosing jazz to fit with the modern day La La Land is actually my favorite movie of the year so far and I can t stop humming some of the music It sticks with you long after watching and is so packed with exceptional technical prowess that you can t help but be enchanted by the films spell The script the music the cinematography the sets the costume design the acting it all combines to create a movie that is both a throwback to classic Hollywood romance and musical films while subverting every expectation and bringing them to a human and realistic level It s an absolute masterpiece of a film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3803536/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,A New Refreshing Approach to Musical Dance,18 December 2016 La La Land 2016 In a way La La Land is its own movie genre a fusion of musical and drama that in just a few places doesn t seem to completely fuse well together as a smooth jazz duet The few discordant notes arise from its lack of a full range of musical variety as in Moulin Rouge 2001 Chicago 2002 Mama Mia 2008 or even West Side Story 1961 In one place the music almost becomes repetitively dull and monotonous In most other places however the music is amazingly Broadway of the highest sparkly quality dazzling in its choreographic display captivating sound and creative photography in Birdman 2014 style At a few other places in the movie the serious prolonged drama comes forth that threatens to crack the musical fantasy mood but holds together This bold and risky venture manages to reveal the refreshing potential of a newly minted theatrical approach to filmmaking Even the ending scenes even though unsettling offer up a much more mature realistic and surprisingly satisfying musical wrap up The dramatic romantic storyline is suggestive of the trials and tribulations from My Girlfriend s Boyfriend 2010 My Best Friend s Wedding 1997 If Only 2004 Days of Wine and Roses 1962 Roman Holiday 1952 Sliding Doors 1998 Bridges of Madison County 1995 A Man and A Woman 1966 and even Nanny Diaries 2007,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4576080/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2017,For fans of musicals,La La Land since its release has received a lot of praise and due from critics and award shows having earning several Oscar awards as well as other prestigious awards Just as with every film that received high praise from critics and wins a ton of awards there will be a lot of backlash and critics among casual movie goers alike For those whom don t like too much musicals may not enjoy this film as this film offers plenty in that area The story is well decent and the acting and visuals complete it La La Land is quite decent but the story is something in which we have seen before at times the film reminds of a musical version of the Notebook Was not much of a fan of some of the musicals they had as one found them to be not as interesting and forgettable Overall if you are not a fan of old fashion type musicals or predictable romance stories La Land Land may not be for you as one should not try to force the film to enjoy it,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3856512/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2016,An Exercise in Classical Hollywood Filmmaking,La La Land the wildly beloved Oscar frontrunner is just as mystifying as critics and audiences said it was The sweeping cinematography the perfect strategically placed lighting the performances the dance numbers it all makes La La Land exactly what people were NOT expecting out of 21st century musical This is a mystifying burst of classical Hollywood filmmaking To that effect there is nothing new rather just a new voice to an old dialog Directed by Damien Chazzelle La La Land is an analytical odyssey of the price of fame as told through the eyes of two big dreamers an aspiring actress Emma Stone and a struggling Jazz musician Ryan Gosling as they coast through life in Los Angeles Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are fantastic in this film Emma Stone gives a career best performance and seems to be riding the same prestigious wave she caught with 2014 s Birdman Gosling is equally great but we ve come to expect this type of performance from him The charismatic dreamer with a golden tongue fits Gosling a little too well at this point even if he does it better than any other working actor in Hollywood While the film is well acted and the choreography in the dance numbers are mesmerizing La La Land is still a hard film to recommend to anyone not already gung ho for musicals Despite being toted as the best film of the year La La Land is exceptionally underwritten Trading great storytelling for grand musical numbers that are expertly planned and executed Damien Chazzelle knows the film s strengths and weaknesses While he plays off of the film s strengths in an expert fashion he does very little to cover up the film s number one weakness its script However despite this being a weakness Chazzelle does a wonderful job at making us forget the problems and sinks us into enjoying the film for what its worth Overall La La Land is most certainly an ambitious yet flawed musical from Damien Chazzelle which proves that Whiplash was far from a fluke Featuring a career best performance from Emma Stone and brilliant camera work along with excellent choreography in its musical numbers La La Land is a film that will most certainly leave you feeling satisfied even if it doesn t hold the lasting power of Whiplash,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3590964/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2019,Go in accepting that it will not meet the hype and this isn't half bad.,I feel instinctively hostile to this movie I think there s something rather smug about its attempt to be an homage to the vintage musicals Now I love the vintage musicals and the idea of reviving them I really do but when it s done like this what I am inclined to call oscar bait I become very closed to it emotionally Certainly it s all very professional It even has the impressive feat of feeling at once cinematic and capturing that distinct sensation of viewing something live The musical and dance numbers are radiantly envisioned and realized and I m sure could be enjoyed again and again even if the music is mostly just adequate The story did not grab me at first There s something about the the idea of a musical about show biz that I find just redundant it s a hat on a hat It s already a MUSICAL so why did you base the plot on this I know it s a throw back but the plot just feels like a template to jam in those impressive numbers I didn t feel vivid characters I felt the same old meek female jaded guy pairing we ve seen a hundred times before without variation I liked the girls walking down the street to the party in their dresses red blue green yellow respectively it really works and I also felt the audition montage was impeccably pulled off I found the lecture on improvized music more annoying than anything It s like a joke if you have to explain why it s so clever it s not funny Similar principle for music I did however warm to the move and its characters about two thirds in when we start to see the more brutal reality behind the romantic front we want to see The ending may well have you in tears it s quite something,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5237801/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2017,High School Musical Meets West Side Story,Hmm that was something different This is kind of like two movies in one The first half was surprisingly amateurish with respect to the singing and dancing I give Ryan Gosling a pat on the back award for trying both of these skills but anyone who is expecting Fred Astaire or Gene Kelley will be sorely disappointed I get it I get the fact that the film inserts stylized re enactments of old Hollywood movie scenes That s nice but it didn t sell me on the film For the first half of the film you will see performances that can be matched by performances at your local high school What I don t get is Emma Stone Sure we all have our personal preferences but she seems completely unsuited for the role of Ryan Gosling s romantic obsessions However if they ever decide to film ET s Revenge she has my vote Just as I was ready to write this film off completely it turned around This happened it seems to me during the observatory dance scene That was creative Around this time the film begins to develop some angst and the relationship between the two characters suddenly becomes much more complex and intriguing Some will like the ending some won t but for me it did seem a little forced Still the second half of the film brought into focus more serious points about relationships and life in general to save it Should you see it Well watch the opening scene If you can take that you can survive the film Trust me it gets better Should it receive a best picture award Well it s at least something different reminiscent of the award winning The Artist Let s just say that if it wins I will grudgingly accept the Academy s verdict,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626149/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2017,"Likable, original movie that shouldn't be tied to one genre",Where to start with a review of the most talked about movie of the moment Well how about with what it is not Watching La La Land last night I fairly quickly decided that the film was not what the majority of critics had labelled it a homage piece to 1950s musicals With the exception of one or two of the opening scenes the film lacks the giant sound stage atmosphere of a studio musical and is instead rooted much more firmly in the LA of today It is perhaps better described as romance first love letter to LA and jazz second and homage to studio movies in general rather than just the musical variety third Indeed the film s many references both in dialogue and style to Casablanca signpost this wider homage That jazz features so prominently once again in Damien Chazelle s third movie is unsurprising after the success of Whiplash it will be more of a shock if it is a centrepiece of his next movie Neil Armstrong biopic First Man which may give us a better impression of whether he is capable of diversity as well as quality The direction in La La Land is very solid and gives the impression of a writer director who knows exactly how he wants his movie to unfold The pace of the movie is very easy and relaxing and I found myself enjoying each moment without concentrating on what might be coming next an all too rare experience and one of the most likable aspects of the film Perhaps one of the only real negatives of the film for me was the freedom given to cinematographer Linus Sandgren of American Hustle and Joy fame whose camera work was ostentatious at times and distracted from the more grounded feel that Chazelle and lead actors Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling brought to the film Centred as it is on the romance between the leads the movie simply wouldn t work without the excellent performances of Stone and Gosling Stone uses her expressiveness with great subtlety steering the film equally well through moments of emotional drama and romantic fantasy Gosling will be credited most for his musical talent which is coupled with the effortless pensive charm that has become his trademark I have read criticism of their singing and dancing but feel that this is misplaced Were the film the musical in the Gene Kelly style that many critics have dubbed it this might be a relevant criticism However the film that I saw suited the slightly understated musical performances which complemented its relaxed grounded feel My final thoughts are on the overall theme of the movie For a romantic fantasy the movie is surprisingly thought provoking and presents a nuanced stance on the conflicts between love and success which felt accessible despite its Hollywood glamour The achievement of this balance between fantasy and realism owes a great deal to Chazelle s witty yet believable dialogue and the performances of the two leads Approach this movie without the desire to shoe horn it into one genre or another and I think you will be pleased by how many sizes it fits,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626657/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,Not that memorable,The music was enjoyable but not memorable the professional dancers were were excellent The leads OK Gosling Stone did a good job as far as acting but singing dance are not their talent at least in this movie The story line was pretty routine nothing all that dramatic I had a hard time keeping awake for most of it The ending helped redeem it but not enough to give it more than 5 stars for me at least The dialog was a trite I still remember many of the songs from the old musicals I don t think I will remember much of anything from this If you are looking for a nice evening with a simple sappy story line and pleasant music you won t be disappointed Just don t go in with high expectations If you disagree and love it great You will be pleasantly surprised,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608294/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2023,"Romance, and thus Musical, is of all times",In an interview director Damien Chazelle told that with respect to La La Land 2016 he was inspired by the city documentaries of the 20 s like Berlin die Sinfonie der Grosstadt 1927 Walther Ruttmann and Menschen am Sonntag 1930 Robert Siodmak Edgar Ulmer and Rochus Gliese The film visits many locations in Los Angelos worth seeing but in my opinion it is very clear that La La Land is in the first place a musical A musical romantic and escapist as the genre is seems a risky choice in these cynical times In 2011 however The artist Michel Hazanavicius had already made clear that romance and escapism is of all times Being a musical the question is if it is of the Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers type of the 30 s or the Gene Kelly Cyd Charisse type of the 50 s I think it has elements of both The screw ball like dialogues from the first and the real storyline from the last mentioned The use of bright colors can be compared specifically with Singin in the rain 1952 Stanley Donen The storyline is about the love affair between Sebastian Ryan Gosling and Mia Emma Stone When their love affair begins their careers have stalled or more precisely never got off the ground During the film they both gain success Mia in the financial sense of the word and Sebastian artistically Will their romance withstand this difference,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9348591/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2017,"Arrogant, selfish, myopic and stubborn.What an most disgusting movie ever!",I love musicals but I must have missed the stand in the theater where they were handing our the cool aid for this one Sorry but I grew up musicals entertaining life and work but this is corns None of the stars are the expected style or quality The story is grotesquely poor and without logic Gosling is pathetic I was left with the desire of someone who closes the keyboard cover in their hands the voice of the stones allow you to pray for a good dose of pharyngitis In short singing or even dancing the promotional machine Hollywood continues to tell us how great it is and people believe it In short I lost 2 hours 7 minutes and 3 seconds of my life For our summer trips to Australia it is almost as bad as the passengers I think it must be an exercise in navel gazing as the awards bodies see themselves in these two characters Haven t they all struggled to get auditions Haven t they all had screen tests Haven t they all tried to make it in Hollywood of course they have The awards givers like looking at themselves in the mirror Personally I do not like what they see Don t bother wasting your energy or you will quit halfway through as I did 0 out of 10,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3668748/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,Old fashioned Hollywood style but with a twist!,La la land is a spectacular piece of cinema In fact I would go as far as to say that it is not a film but more of an emotional journey that both the characters and audience go through The acting and dance choreography is very impressive and has clearly taken along time to perfect but it is definitely time well spent as the finished product is dazzling to watch Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have an excellent screen presence that really draws you in and makes you look that ever bit closer at every frame The cinematography of the movie is beautiful and the shots in the film are like paintings The vibrant colours and camera movement are everything that s good about the film industry that somehow went missing From watching the film it is clear that director Damien Chazelle had a strong vision that he and his cast and crew brought to life The music of La la land is hypnotic and makes you feel nostalgic It is strange how it works its way into your mind I have a feeling that I will be humming along to the tune of La la Land for awhile The ending of the film is very refreshing and I am tremendously glad that the film ended in the way that it did I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a passion for cinema or who simply just loves to watch a good film On paper I could see how this film could be a gamble from the perspective of a producer but I am happy that the gamble was taken and I have no doubt the La la Land will go down as a classic Overall I would give La la Land 8 out of 10 as it is one of the best films I have watched in a long time,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619450/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2017,Mesmerising,This film is sublime The way it s shot the acting the score the dancing the plot It s a classic film in the mould of Singin in the rain but set in the present day with the same concerns It s a love story with a realistic ending The message you come away with is follow your dreams without it feeling too saccharine I have not been that affected by a film in years which is why I chose to write a review as I never write on here This film has been given a lot of hype and is bound to win several awards but in this case they are very much deserved It s a such a well made film on every front Can t fault it Don t listen to some of miserable reviewers like the one on the main page,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631878/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,Boring and formulaic musical,I do not understand the nice reviews This is just a formulaic standard musical with almost no story Cringe choreographies and boring Perhaps if you are fascinated by Hollywood you will find some substance The only good thing in this movie is Emma Stone,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7762292/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2019,Not half bad,La La Land was not too bad The strengths of this film are the acting performances Gosling and Emma Stone hit it out of the park and bring a very simple story to life It is nice to see a musical like this in the 21st century The 50 s and 60 s saw a whole bunch of successful musicals released and then there was a decrease This musical cannot obviously be compared to powerhouses like My Fair Lady or Mary Poppins but it is somewhat decent Arguably Chazelle s best work to date his films have not been particularly good He is a mediocre film maker So this marks a big improvement What I also liked was how this was not a silly romance but something different 7 5 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4551841/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2016,Even Van Gogh would love it,One of the best cinematic experience of the decade What makes a great movie great is a team and its packaging screenplay cinematographer music choreographer dress hair stylist director and producer La la Land is one of the such movies that has complete package Every frames and scene and screenplay remind of work of purist who finds the lost dream The scene of dancing among stars or singing during sunset or climax scene the Damien Chazelle s work is art will be a landmark cinema in itself If you re jazz fan do watch it If you re not a jazz fan you do not miss it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3593246/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2017,"Wonderful, Excellent, Gorgeous, etc.",THIS This right here is what I love about movies This film right here is why I put myself through going pretty much every weekend to see the latest critically acclaimed masterpiece that turns out to flop in the hopes that one day this will happen La La Land is beautiful soaring fun uplifting dramatic gorgeous and basically everything that makes us smile I was grinning throughout the entire first act This is an original live action musical something we don t get to see too often in movies today Could it have been a bit of a missed opportunity to cast two white actors in a movie about jazz Yes it could have been but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling shone On their own they are both bright stars but put them together and they light up the world Chemistry which is such a big missed ball in Hollywood these days is undeniable between the two of them It just WORKED I cannot praise the soundtrack enough The songs are brilliant and catchy and bright I m still listening to it months after seeing the film Also the choreography and costumes and the aesthetic of it all The musical scenes are filmed with such fluidity it is magnificent The movie is given a retro feeling but takes place in modern times The color palette of bright primary colors for Stone s character and more muted browns and blues for Gosling worked perfectly with the themes and their relationship The ending as abrupt as it may be was certainly beautiful and no one can say it was unsatisfactory,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642793/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,"Splashy throwback musical is lush, vivid, fun, but hardly a classic",Bright vivid and lavishly produced modern day musical about a struggling LA musican Ryan Gosling and actress Emma Stone is a charming throwback musical love story Camera costumes and photography do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to the musical dance sequence elements making up for the stars limited abilities but Gosling and Stone give the film a whole lot of heart and soul They present fully fleshed out characters as compared to most movie musicals where characters are less developed and are more or less simply character archetypes The old fashioned Gershwin like score and songs are terrific and Emma Stone has a surprisingly good breathy singing voice Even if Gosling is less talented in the singing department he makes up for it with a fine performance Although La La Land does bring some welcome realism to it s story not typically seen in musicals it does not go nearly as dark or subversive as Jacques Demy s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg or Martin Scorsese s New York New York which were more a deconstruction of the musical as a genre Overall La La Land is a charming throwback for fans of old fashioned movie musicals even if it s more of a novelty than a true classic Still I have to admit I prefer Peyton Reed s homage to Rock Hudson and Doris Day films with his Down with Love which although wasn t really a musical outside of the one closing number but it s throwback feel was far more nostalgic for me,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7545246/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2017,A very pleasant surprise,There has been a lot of hype about La La Land A modern take on the old style Hollywood musical dancing singing and romance with everybody living happily ever after This kind of movie doesn t normally float my boat but Damien Chazelle the director made the brilliant 2014 hit Whiplash so I thought I d give it a try I had a smile on my face through most of the movie the songs while not greatly memorable fit the scenes well I m more Fred Ward than Astaire so my knowledge of choreography is zip but the dancing seemed fine to me There is a good chemistry between the lead actors played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and I think the cinematography is superb the use of colour is fantastic Overall not being a lover of musicals I was very surprised by how much I liked it A solid 7 10,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3622972/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2017,This is going to be a classic,I have very wide tastes in cinema but I generally avoid two genres musicals and horror However I was always going to make an exception for La La Land following the vibes from the festivals and indeed by the time I caught up with the movie it had already been nominated for no less than 14 Academy Awards putting it up there with other record holders All About Eve 1950 and Titantic 1997 Among massive support the film has had its critics OK the plot and characterisation are slight but essentially this is a homage to the old fashioned Hollywood musical and we don t need a complicated narrative or lots of back story Instead we have gorgeous colours and wonderfully zooming and swirling cinematography with uplifting dance sequences and a memorable soundtrack composed by Justin Hurwitz OK I ve heard better singing and I ve seen better dancing but Ryan Gosling as Seb and Emma Stone as Mia are playing a jazz pianist and an actress respectively and their singing and dancing is much more than adequate These are two glorious performances Writer and director Damien Chazelle has given us a movie such a contrast in tone and style from his previous Whiplash which is destined to be a classic and become a long running stage show it is structured into five acts based on the seasons The vibrant sequence before the title reminiscent of a scene from Fame is shown is worth the price of admission alone musical numbers seemingly shot in a single take hold the attention and bring a smile to the face a scene where the two leads first hold hands in a cinema is pure romance the dance sequence in the Griffith Observatory is absolute magic and the bitter sweet ending not what I expected but a realistic conclusion to a work that urges us to strive for our dreams whatever the cost I just loved this movie and I m sure I ll see it again and again Meanwhile I went straight out of the cinema and bought the soundtrack,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627955/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2017,"Something new, not really comparable to the classic American musicals",Aside from being one of the most genuinely enjoyable movies I ve seen in years La La Land is a very interesting film without any direct peers although I suppose in a way it is Whiplash After Anger Management it will be interesting to see if Damien Chazelle has another story in him As others have pointed out it s more like Jacques Demy s musicals than anything else but it s really not much like those either and nobody under around 50 aside from dedicated musical freaks and faithful attendees at repertory movie houses has seen Demy anyway You can t compare La La Land to any previous American musical romance not directly the few people I ve talked to who say they didn t enjoy the film insist on doing exactly that What Chazelle has done is tweak just about every element of the classic formula for the modern audience then integrate those elements into a very modern very emotional storytelling form In doing this he s actually created something entirely new It doesn t matter at all that his leads aren t particularly great singers or dancers and it doesn t matter at all that the score is a little thin it s the total package that has made this movie such a stunning success with audiences It s modern cinematic alchemy which draws on the past glories of the American musical without actually copying them As a film it completely avoids nostalgia even as its lead characters drown in it at times That s quite a trick to pull off just as it s a real achievement to employ magical elements like dancing in the stars with a modern audience and not get laughs where you don t want them By current standards virtually all classic American movie musicals are defined by their episodic structure About a month before I saw La La Land I saw the TCM revival of Singin in the Rain which is probably the consensus choice as the most enjoyable musical of the classic era It s also one of the very best written but it s still a collection of outstanding production numbers linked by a plot that is almost incidental That s perfectly fine and it s what we expect from the classic musicals it s part of what makes them so much fun La La Land is a different kind of fun It s all about its own structure it has a story driven flow to it and is far more dependent on strong acting than the old musicals ever were It s not just a matter of removing mid century corn from the script it s built around a very modern form of storytelling that was just starting to emerge around the time musicals went out of fashion It is much more emotional than it is technical in its music and dance as much as in its words and it wouldn t work at all without top flight acting something you definitely can t say about even the greatest classic musicals Since it s unlikely we are on the cusp of a glorious new age of musicals La La Land will likely stand as a singular achievement maybe the most emotionally realistic musical ever while still a total escapist fantasy I find that very often the best films are the ones that had the least chance of getting made it s a perfect example of one,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3661208/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2017,Chazelle is getting his due applause one film late,Damien Chazelle is very talented The bouquets he is getting for this film ought to have come instead for his previous work Whiplash a far superior work La la land will appeal to those who have worked hard to achieve their dreams Whiplash was more complex with darkness and light Chazelle s forte utilized to the hilt In La la land it was replaced by lush color often helped by the clothes worn It s mushy the actors look good always The music appeals to you but is it all that great No This is mere escapism Whiplash on the other hand was real and deserved better,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3629135/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2017,La La Crap,I m a movie buff and I ve seen seven movies this year and I love musicals However for the first time ever I walked out half way through a movie as did my friend and half the audience La La Land was the slowest most boring movie I have ever seen I cannot believe that Emma Stone got an Academy Award for best actress It was a shocker The story would have been best left as a nicely told romance Instead his effort at playing miming jazz piano was abysmal their attempt at the Fred and Ginger dancing would have been knocked out in the first round of Dancing With The Stars Emma s up the nostril close ups and very very limited singing ability were not attractive But above all the songwriting repetitive uninspiring motifs and transparent unimaginative scoring was the biggest disappointment At last there was an opportunity for an original composed and scored movie musical and they came up with this drivel I apologise to those who enjoyed it I m sure there was merit if you weren t distracted by a critical eye,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3654775/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,La La Land Has Just Become One Of My Favorite Musical Film,From the guy who made the greatest movie of all time Whiplash comes La La Land an imaginary stylish and beautiful musical film that fills with some of the best musical choreography and performances by both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling i m a big musical fan not so big on Jazz but hey both Whiplash and La La Land are about Jazz and i love it and i already expected no better than this La La Land is phenomenal Stone and Gosling chemistry was perfect them as a movie couple is definitely one of the best in movie history La La Land is iconic already the music and like i mention before the choreography was not only great but Damien Chazelle choose these beautiful and fascinating lighting background cinematography location even there is this whole sequence with a beautiful painting as a background it just fascinating technically well done and story wise it is another great love story it s all about the chemistry at in the end if the movie couples work then the story work overall La La Land has just become one of my favorite musical film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8748704/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2017,Classic musicals are a state of mind not a state of being,The perfect amalgamation of Hollywood past and present The slow transition from the wistful allure of dreams to the tangible pop of reality The music and the songs are instant classic by the second viewing it felt like coming home they fit so snugly and felt so right What s equally amazing is the character work the re molding of archetypes How neither is an answer so much as a piece of a bigger puzzle Seb s passion and devotion are his own undoing He gets what he wants but he also is let down in nearly every other facet of his life He doesn t save jazz John Legend s Keith saves jazz or at least starts to and gets the best speech in the film when he tells Seb that he s too traditional and that jazz is about the future But that s because Seb is selfish and he only cares about what he wants at least insofar as it pertains to his dreams He changes for Mia but also realizes he has to let her go Ironically this unselfish act leaves him alone His passion which we normally prize so much in films like this doesn t make him big or famous but instead leaves him small and alone His type the classic bold and passionate man with a dream who can t be stopped type isn t real But as an example to others it does much like a good musical on our lives more on that in a bit Mia in her empathy grace and selflessness attains her dream and makes a family Yet she doesn t have the person who helped her achieve all this She tells Seb that his passion will become other people s if he believes in it enough but it s his passion for pursuing A dream that affects her and causes her to write her play and sing a song and nail her audition Her sensitivity is what makes her strong a conduit for passions on screen and off What this movie could be suggesting much like Whiplash s carefully constructed ideology about the costs and sacrifices of pursuing a dream is that everyone needs a push A push in the direction that you may not be capable of on your own Mia developing a backbone believing in herself because Seb does Seb dropping his stubbornness and pride so that he can make money playing for a real gig so that he can open his club later And that this is in effect the true beauty and romance of our lives What the epilogue suggests is not what could have been so much as what could never be Life is a beautiful breathtaking musical of love and passion and romance and adventure even if it doesn t end up how you think and doesn t follow a tightly scripted path If you spend too much time worrying about why your life isn t a Hollywood fairy tale romance you will miss out on the musicality and the truth of the present Classic musicals are a state of mind not a state of being,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631110/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,"Here's Looking at a Classic, Kid.",It s shot in CinemaScope it s big on pizazz it s packed with bold color schemes the stage lights appear straight out of a dream it s big one minute and quiet the next and every song and tune will replay in your head days after it s all over No you re not in the 1950s and no you re not in Kansas anymore This is the present day reality So forget about those loud action movies with no respect for the stage La La Land proves what can and should be done with the long lost art that is the moving picture The joyful musical genre has been in the Hollywood cemetery for too long now but even rarer now is a musical with entirely original music in an entirely original story which director Damien Chazelle Whiplash achieves with expert choreography While he may give Southern California a bit too overly glamorous of a view with no dark edge he still recaptures the same zest of West Side Story while cranking the spectacle up a notch It s always a challenge for any serious director to stage a film where everyone breaks out into song without it oozing Disney Channel cheese but Damien Chazelle has done it Within Chazelle s cinematic recreation of Southern California he fastens our seat belts through the bumpy relationship between two artists over the course of four long seasons starting at the heat of Christmas One is a ruby red aspiring actress who cannot land an audition and thus must serve coffee under a careless manager to make ends meet The other is a Fred Astaire Dooley Wilson mash up whose fast fingers command jazz on the piano no matter what his boss wants him to play After they first meet over road rage at rush hour these distracted minds find that destiny has forced them together with coincidental run ins day after day Everything after that is as pure and classic as dancing under a full moon Once we learn about what these two have in common boy is it the beginning of a beautiful friendship He wants to revive Jazz as a modern art form but she cannot stand listening to it and this subject alone stems all the other conflicts that these two share over the course of a year It is a pleasure to see the ups and downs of their romance even if the other people in their lives are treated by the screenwriter as if they don t even matter Yet it s not the supporting cast who helps us to understand their relationship but the numbers that project their thoughts onto the moment On their first formal meeting she hears his piano playing as lit by a single spotlight as if she s glancing into his own little world On second formal meeting they tap dance in front of a skyline at twilight On the first date they are swept off their feet literally to a dance against the stars in a planetarium On the tenth date they sing an Oscar worthy duet As time goes by the dream of making it to the top of the world in Paris quickly diminishes Her tears swell up along with the audiences I ll even admit I choked up as well and I m a man This wide variety of tone in music is plentiful yet wisely spare celebrating the history of cinema magic while wishing the best for its future Yet also like the oldies it writes its love to there are one too many white players in the production There are two African Americans cast but as dancers on the pier who say not a word just as blacks were stereotyped in that golden age of Hollywood If this production was less focused on making a musical spectacular and more focused on showing care and attention to today s media frenzied audience then there would have been a better likelihood for this to surpass those repetitive comic book movies at the box office I sincerely hope for the day when people return to their senses and offer their money to movies because of their cinematic quality other than their branding Considering how much music is now taking over our culture we could use that reminder of how much music raises our self esteem when times are hard After seeing what La La Land can do with both old and new styles of filmmaking I can absolutely assess that I love musicals all over again Therefore I encourage everyone to go see this magical delight to raise the spirits for 2017 After all tomorrow is another day,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3603453/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,Worth A Watch,La La Land s magic comes in it s ending It s a sad ending but one about moving on and coming to terms with the person you are It corrects the rights and punishes the wrong People hardly know better The movie is a love story about a struggling musician and a struggling actress While the actress eventually attains fame and fortune the musician ends up somewhat successful but single and without the actress In between is a bunch of musical numbers and depictions of the LA lifestyle It s a good movie It s well done It does get boring and you get sick of the dancing and music The ending brings it together The actors are all fine and dandy I didn t see too much magic in the movie though I wouldn t watch it more than twice 7 stars,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5251865/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2017,Adequate as far as musicals go.,I m a huge musicals fan and I went into this film expecting something quite special There was so much build up So much hype The opening sequence was incredible despite my not being able to understand the lyrics most of the time The dance sequence was a joy to watch So I sat back and was ready to be impressed It didn t happen Basically a romance the story was passable Ryan Gosling s character being a jazz zealot ass wipe made him difficult to like It fell into a massive hole about two thirds in where the audience drifted off The ending Well it was just awful The singing was very average Neither Gosling or Stone have great singing voices The music which let s face it is quite important in a musical was a major disappointment I loved the dancing the locations the use of vivid colors and many other things but these weren t enough to offset the lackluster music and singing The people watched this film may not have seen the classic musicals from decades ago Perhaps that s why the IMDb score is so high I hope that La La Land starts a resurgence in the musical genre If it does they will have to be much better than this effort,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3685193/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2023,Not worth the hype - MAC Reviews,ves Direction of the film has been done in a really good manner Film is beautifully shot Acting performances makes this musical special Music and background music of the movie is good ves The plot of the film was too basic like a boy meets a girl girl meets a boy they fell in love but because of their respective careers they had to go in their own direction There was nothing new in it Screenplay of the movie was really bad They should have made it a short film instead It felt too dragged at times which would definitely make you feel bore No relatability to characters could be felt while watching this film Overall the movie is not worth its hype If you want to watch a good romantic movie skip this one and try 500 Days of Summer instead However if you re someone who is a die heart fan of Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone then you could give it a try BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9262912/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2017,"Catchy songs, great characters, beautifully shot and expertly performed",La La Land is a musical that tells the story of three different loves stories Mia Stone and Sebastian Gosling developing a romantic relationship set in Hollywood The other two love stories revolve around Mia and Sebastian s love for their respective career choices Mia with acting and Sebastian with jazz music Both of them are struggling to make it in the world but as they gain momentum their romantic relationship starts to disintegrate This is a story that has been done before Sebastian wants to own his own jazz club but is struggling to make money because the world around him wants him to compromise his taste of music with popular current music Mia wants to make it as an actress but cannot take rejection after rejection after rejection La La Land however subverts the musical genre and gives the characters some great songs and great characterization Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are great in the roles especially Emma Stone they still have great chemistry even after 2 movies Gangster Squad and Crazy Stupid Love and for people who have never really sung before they do an great job but they are not the real stars of the movie the real star is setting Hollywood Hollywood is beautifully shot in the movie the direction and cinematography are immaculate Stellar use of long takes and moving cameras and used to show the beauty of the city The city is really able to become its own character it does almost become the antagonist of the story for both Mia and Sebastian not only for their dreams and aspirations but also for their relationship It is almost hypnotizing how the film almost draws you into the scene not only with the setting but also the songs The songs are well done they give off an aura of old time classic 1950 s music but also sound modern enough for young people to enjoy However the use of music sometimes overstays its welcome La La Land is around two hours long but honestly it doesn t need to be there are some scenes that just feel like they were included because they look pleasing to the eye and they do however it does not justify its means of existing The scenes where Mia and Sebastian are falling in love last around ten to fifteen minutes but feel like thirty and contain no dialogue so it can actually be done in around five minutes of screen time There are a myriad of dance breaks which are supposed to show the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian but there are at least three scenes that already do that before they finally spark a connection Also as for other flaws some of the lip singing done by supporting members of the cast for example Mia s roommates or the people singing Another Day of Sun are pretty transparent and while I do think the ending was poignant and sticks true to the overall message of the film I could do without the final montage Overall La La Land is a very enjoyable time at the movies if you love musicals you will have a blast with this one if you don t like musicals you will probably hate this but you could enjoy it for the beautiful shots scenery and acting Out of the two movies directed by Damien Chazelle I do prefer Whiplash but the movie is still very engaging I never found my self escaping to my very own La La Land,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3716972/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2017,Let your self wander into the world of LA LA LAND. A Must Watch. A Masterpiece.,Remember the name Damien Chazelle Writer and Director aged 32 without a doubt he is upstaging those in the industry for decades If he builds on this momentum his reach will certainly be endless He is 2 for 2 with WHIPLASH and LA LA LAND Its way too soon to stack him up there with the Allens and Scoreceses But without a doubt Chazelle is now noteworthy This original screenplay and direction is as inspirational as its beautiful Its mellow yet potent its tranquil and flamboyant it s a motion picture but theatrical in its essence The simplest of stories unfolded in the most enchanting of ways The theatrical approach the balance between the new and revolutionary whilst preserving a semblance of tradition The last I recall being this engrossed in a movie of this genre is with MOULIN ROUGE Nominated for 14 Academy Awards tying the record of TITANIC and ALL ABOUT EVE LA LA LAND is story of love A Jazz pianist Ryan Gosling and an actress Emma Stone find their lives intertwined in a struggle of finding themselves and love Gosling isn t new at toying with emotions he does so with a strange aura of simplicity surrounding his performance Its ethereal Stone is almost as good as she was in her role in BIRDMAN Both characters are built blandly from ground which makes it a challenge for the actors Its magical what Gosling and Stone do with it Appreciating LA LA LAND is a test Losing interest isn t arduous Musicals are not for everyone Considering the initial half hour of the movie and its slow start this title necessitates patience Further it s a work of art holistically The mesmerizing soundtrack the vibrant set the acute direction and the impeccable acting eventually makes it all worth you while Verdict Let your self wander into the world of LA LA LAND A Must Watch A Masterpiece TITLE LA LA LAND DIRECTED BY DAMIEN CHAZELLE STARRING RYAN GOSLING EMMA STONE RATED PG13 RATING 09 10 RUNTIME 120 MINUTES,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3641076/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2017,"One of the best musicals of the last years, Damien Chazelle is a very promising director",La La Land is for many the Oscar winner 2017 if it is the best I do not know the film is very good it is the photography is incredible it has beautiful scenes the night combines with the film the The film is very good the initial scene of the film is very good and well choreographed the direction of the young Damien Chazelle is very good is only 32 years old and already has Whiplash and La La Land in the curriculum a director with a bright future The cast is competent Emma Stone is incredible and without doubt is a strong competitor for Oscar for best actress Ryan Gosling is well more sincerely I do not see him winning the Oscar I think Casey Affleck will win and has Still the JK Simmons John Legend and etc the script is good but not quite as original and the soundtrack is excellent La La Land is undoubtedly one of the best musicals of the last years and is a strong candidate For the Oscar 2017 Note 8 5,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628324/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2021,Good things come to those who wait,For the first 30 minutes I was worried that it would turn out to be another cheesy corny and non sense musicals Music and choreography don t seem to fit in the movie at the beginning However after Sebastian and Mia starts the relationship things turn out more natural and realistic Musical films tend to be idealistic and fairy tale like just like the music presented in the movie However La La Land is special because it narrates dream love struggle failure and break up so realistically while it brings in the fairy tale components through movie s setting The scene starting from theater to two protagonists first kiss blurs the distinction of reality and the movie within the movie Same place they see in the movie and flying to the sky into the stars are all fantasy Just as we live ordinary life but dreams to be an actress in the movie or princess in a picturesque place The directing is creative and trendy such as spotlighting the narrator using green blue color in both when the couple is most romantic and when they conflict and some music video like scenes Very modern and new The melody of City of Stars is very distinctive and is presented throughout the movie at some of the most important events giving the sense of continuity La La Land is in the line between reality and fantasy between authenticity and pretentiousness between boring and captivating,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6559684/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2017,Amusing but not great..,A lot of reviews on IMDb thought that this movie deserved a 1 10 and more considered it a great one And while it seems that this movie is having an undeserved rating I wouldn t consider it really a bad one In fact I had fun watching it and though it is a bit long for its content it is nevertheless amusing Yes movies are subjective but still one can judge a movie for what it has got to offer especially for movie lovers a set of artistic principles can be laid I ll be quick on its positive aspects The music not the dancing and singing is good The plot is entertaining some of the scenes especially between Stones and Gosling are innovative and others attempted to revive the classics Chazelle also put a great deal of effort with the camera work Well for the negative side the singing and dancing were not so good and for a musical this is really important Some said that it was better that the singing was modest for it appeals more to the characters But really a musical should introduce something beautiful for the viewer to get emotionally attached and it won t seem abnormal it is a musical after all Look at West Side Story 1961 or Singin in the Rain 1952 every song is memorable well and that is another issue with La La Land I forgot the songs the minute the movie ended The characters also seemed a bit shallow Gosling s character was a bit deeper than Stone s but his acting was bad Emma made a good effort in acting to enhance her character The script also seemed of little depth So it is about following your dreams an idea now overused and the conflicts one may encounter with the person he she loves and while there is nothing indeed special about this I have to say that the execution makes it somehow dull The dialogue is bluntly thrown at us with nothing to take hold of At some point in the movie I remembered In the Mood for Love 2000 a drama romance movie that I found much deeper and better executed I won t say anything about the movie s last 15 or 20 minutes that would spoil the movie for you but I d like to point out that it is really inconsistent with the rest of the movie I think many had the same feeling and the way the movie neglected some of the details was not helpful at all All in all La La Land is a descent movie and a fun to watch,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625829/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2021,"Utterly mediocre, overrated, and soporific",Unfortunately I have to agree with the other reviewers who were not impressed with this movie I remember thinking it was enjoyable enough when I saw it in the movie theater in 2016 It s colorful it s a ride and it s a love letter to L A But after seeing it again recently I realized just how utterly mediocre and overrated it is Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are likable actors but neither one of them can sing or dance well enough to be starring in a musical and it doesn t really matter if Ryan Gosling sang and danced when he was a kid because that was a long long time ago Frankly it was painful for me to listen to their thin breathy and barely audible and in Emma Stone s case very raspy singing voices As for the dancing their dancing wasn t anything special or difficult I wasn t expecting to see dancing on the level of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers or Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse but I was underwhelmed and fell asleep It appears that most of the rabid fans of this movie are fans of Ryan Gosling and or Emma Stone and or people who have not seen proper musicals with better singing or dancing I admire Hollywood s attempt to revive the big colorful musicals of Hollywood s Golden Age For that reason I give it 1 star,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7389445/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2017,"Amazingly directed and acted film, with a well written script and good songs",La La Land is about two people one an aspiring actor the other one a jazz enthusiast who both fall for each other and whose story gets told via the manner of a musical Damien Chazelle returns to create his second movie also music centered His previous film Whiplash was one of the better films of 2014 In that movie he showed his talent but in this one he even surpassed his previous achievements Chazelle used incredibly long beautiful shot takes often accompanied with a good song more on the songs later These scenes are seamlessly cut together whereby sometimes they make it seem that the scene was shot in one take but actually had some cleverly hidden edits in them Often these were hidden behind quick camera movements The movie by the way begins in such a fashion as I just described That scene was done fantastic and set up high expectations for the rest of the film What Damien Chazelle also did was to use vibrant colors throughout the whole film Green purple yellow red all return multiple times in the film each end everyone having a meaning to them which made the film more interesting The songs were written with care and added to the film They each told a story that had something to do with the scene or the story and weren t just useless songs there to fill up the moment or to be there and later to sell a soundtrack to double their earnings No they are there because they have a meaning The songs were beautifully written and performed and I really understand why the Oscars have picked out two of the songs which I also found to be two of the best songs in the film There were of course some songs that were lesser good but even those I found to be amusing to listen to Not only the songs sung by the cast were good but also the instrumentals in the background were fantastic to listen to Those also added to the scenes that they were setting up I do have one problem with how some of the songs were presented but that problem mostly lies with me and not with the movie This problem is that at times it feels kind of forced how they start some songs At times they just burst out of songs which was unfitting to me But that s the nature of a musical so what did I expect But at times those scenes where handled very well I liked how the lights drained out only focusing on the one who s going to sing and at times the singing also happened naturally and didn t feel forced so it s kind of a double edged sword I want to come back to the directing of Damien Chazelle because I want to say a couple of things on his visual directing That looked absolutely gorgeous Like I ve said he used vibrant colors which really made the scenes stand out more The use of vibrant colors is also something that you don t see that often anymore in films which is a shame because look at the result La La land got The framing was good and the camera movements to were fantastic Chazelle used shadow and lightning brilliantly to created good looking shots and he also masters the use of focus Enough about that let s move on to the acting Ryan Gosling once again shows that he is a diverse actor and can play a whole host of characters In this movie he gives a fantastic performance and it s no surprise that he has gotten that Oscar nomination Emma Stone too gives a fantastic performance at first I was a bit skeptical with her but after the first thirty minutes or so she persuaded me into enjoying her performance The both of them had great on screen chemistry whereby their relationship only became more believable and realistic The script was very good and the characters stood out to me the most The story itself was straightforward and easy to follow Nonetheless it was a good story It was realistic and grounded just like the characters and that s why I liked them so much Most of the times you get to see unrealistic characters but here that wasn t the case In La La Land you can see two relatable people fighting to reach their dreams accompanied with the struggle that fight brings them Because these characters are so realistic and relatable you also start to care for them What I also liked about the film is that it made me appreciate jazz more because of one particular scene in which Ryan Gosling is enthusiastic about it trying to convince Emma Stone how good jazz can be The scene was wonderfully written and in that scene he didn t only convince Emma Stone but also me The ending was weird at first but when I realized what was going on I started to appreciate it more and more until the movie ended with it satisfying yet heartbreaking conclusion The film really plays with your emotions and can make you feel sad and happy again in a spit second but at the end it all felt like a feel good movie created for people who have dreams and have trouble reaching them what I very much appreciated La La Land was a very good musical and this comes from someone who generally doesn t like musicals The songs were good and so was the acting Damien Chazelle created one of the most well directed films of the year and that s why I am giving this one a 9 2 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3629213/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2018,Emotional,This movie is an emotional roller coaster it knows how to play with your emotions Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling give an amazing performance in showing how one can follow their dream while also falling in love But the movie would be nothing if it wasn t for the amazing song lyrics produced by Pasek and Paul Every little detail from the colour of clothing and lighting is all used to show emotion and development of characters can really be appreciated by all the thought put into the movie and just one last praise on the unexpected elegance of Emma Stones singing voice,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4020690/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2017,Astounding. The title says it all.,I ve come to realize that current award season paranoia is more detrimental to the film industry than beneficial Whether lobby riddled or tailor made the very release calendar is designed to make the biggest splash for award recognition rather than allowing every film every topic and every discussion to have room to exist and grow Or not La La Land is one such example of a film that gathered momentum from its early premiere and rapturous reviews in Venice until a disproportionate attention worldwide not undeserving it is every bit justified but because the attention was given for all the wrong reasons Musicals are not an easy sell by definition progressivists may consider it is way past its sell by date and purists may consider the latest outings as travesties or lacking the charm of the classics News flash La La Land proves exactly the opposite It is an unambitious unpretentious anachronistic love letter to old musicals jazz Los Angeles and love stories It is a hard sell and specially not a product for everyone Just because marketing momentum rubs a film in your face it doesn t mean it is for you An essential characteristic of being a film lover is understanding that every film finds its audience and not the other way around and while some films appeal to a wider audience it doesn t mean that every film that sweeps individual award recognition amounting to a considerable number has to appeal to all La La Land is a film that haters love to hate not and for years to come For those who don t deliberately walk into it with either cynical or preconceived disposition to destroy it you ll find a heartwarming ode to a dying art musicals or jazz alike never mind thinly plotted or with a sparsely uneven pace that will pull you to a carefree make belief alternate world Isn t it the point of the genre anyway,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627833/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,Finally an original love store. Breathtaking photography and excellent script,I am not really the love story kind of guy but I decided to watch this movie with my girlfriend 4 years after the release date and oh boy wish I watched it before The relationship between Sebastian and Mia is challenging because main characters needs to face their different aspirations and which priorities hit and the final decision is not easy at all So forget about the classic perfect love story where there are no flaws This musical describe in a more realistic way how a relationship may or may not work compared to many film of this genre The photography is stunning dreamy and reminds a lot a fairy tale dances are good songs are very catchy and I personally think that La La Land reinvented the musical genre adding something new and original It is a really nice movie that you can watch basically with anyone and you will spend for sure a couple of good hours,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5780506/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2017,La La Land was absolutely delightful,As big and daunting as Los Angeles is it s also a relatively small town especially if you re trying to get into show business Mia Emma Stone is one of those many hopefuls She s working at a coffee shop on the Warner Brothers studio lot giving the actors who are doing what she longs to do their caffeine fix Sebastian Ryan Gosling is another hopeful also currently scraping the bottom of the barrel To keep the roof over his head in his dumpy apartment and to pay what bills he can which isn t many he plays jazz at any club that will have him Mia and Sebastian first meet in the notorious LA traffic She is holding up traffic going over lines for an audition he is stuck behind her He passes her with a glare she responds with another unfriendly but definitely Los Angelan gesture Their paths cross again later that evening after a party that Mia s roommates encourage her to attend after a bad audition She leaves on her own walking home after her car was towed and hears Sebastian playing at a club she passes She walks in just in time to see him get fired for not sticking to the Christmas set list She tries to compliment him but he brushes right by her Months later at an 80s party Mia gets some revenge as Sebastian is performing with an 80s tribute band They end up leaving together in search of their cars and start a wonderful song and dance duet a la Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers After a number of close calls and missed opportunities in La La Land both professionally and personally Sebastian encourages Mia to write her own show She agrees though terrified of failure and writes a one woman show she will also perform All Sebastian wants is to own his own jazz club but he doesn t have the money so he reluctantly takes a gig with a fellow musician The group is very successful but it s not the type of jazz Sebastian wants to play and it s keeping him apart from Mia With glimpses of romance with each other and opportunities for success in the dog eat dog world of entertainment the two must make some tough decisions about what they really want out of life Ultimately they both decide what is most important to each of them and they live happily ever after though not quite how you might assume La La Land was written and directed by Damien Chazelle who recently shot into the spotlight with his critically acclaimed writing and directing achievement with Whiplash While both deal with music La La Land is completely different than his dark and torturous Whiplash If Bing Crosby Danny Kaye Gene Kelly Debbie Reynolds Judy Garland or Fred Astaire were still making musicals today La La Land would be their product They don t make movies like this anymore but hopefully the will after this We ve seen episodes of How I Met Your Mother Psych Scrubs Family Guy and even South Park pay homage to the art of yesterdecade We ve also seen musicals revitalized with Mama Mia Moulin Rouge Rock of Ages and Jersey Boys But a musical set today with the feel of the 50 s is long overdue and it s been worth the wait as La La Land combines traditional old school movie sets mixed with some of the modern movie special effects that they couldn t even imagine in Singin in the Rain or Grease Gosling and Stone lit up the screen in the preview coming across as the perfect kids you re rooting for both in their pursuits of their passions and in their blooming romance They delivered as did La La Land If you like any of the movies I ve named just watching the preview probably made you smile with anticipation It just cleaned up at the Golden Globes with wins for Best Actor Best Actress Best Musical or Comedy Best Director Best Original Score and Best Screenplay I gave La La Land a very hopeful 4 Star prediction but I m boosting it up to 4 5 Stars It was nearly perfect Gosling and Stone are a perfect match in their wit comedic timing sincerity romance singing and dancing If this is the first of many more modern day musicals to come then we are in for a real treat If this doesn t spark more of its kind it would be a shame but we were blessed with this rare gem and I ll be adding it to my collection for sure marksmoviemind blogspot com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618181/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2017,Nope,I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie I expected the best but only got some songs and the worst ending ever I liked the cast but the movie just wasn t good enough for me Personally I like happy endings this was nothing like it I don t recommend,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3712128/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,gem,This is a Gem I ve nothing profound to say here Just that this kind of movie only gets made once or twice in a decade It s the rare case when dance song and story work together along with talent to make us smile and take us away I can t imagine how a movie like this gets made in this day and age So much has to come together This is the kind of movie I shall wait a few years before seeing again I want it to fade from view so I can enjoy it all over again One thing see it in the theater if you still can If this came back to the movie theater I would definitely go back If you cannot see it in the theater watch it loud and dim the lights,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619920/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2017,So bad that I had to watch Singing in the Rain again to remind myself what a good Hollywood movie should be like.,What an over hyped musical I love musicals from stage to screen but this one is really one of the worst I have ever seen Apart from the camera work I can t find any redeeming qualities in this movie Bad cast bad music bad storyline NOTHING to hold my interest I just kept forwarding the movie for the more interesting parts and then found myself forwarding again after one minute or two Honestly I haven t seen a Hollywood movie in ages but I thought I d give this one a chance after hearing so many positive reviews Turned out they were all hype all outright lies I am done with the media and sheeple society,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655369/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2017,A perfect balance between art and life,Everything in this movie is just perfect Starting for the idea that unlike most of the musicals are based on the fact that almost all the movie is singed with no purpose this film have the particularity that the characters only sing when they are feeling so great emotions that cant be expressed with only talking so they start to sing and dance As i said and as you could see they are not the best voices in this movie because the movie doesn t focus really on that as most of the musicals this movie shows a very human story which the one you can fill identified Art music image and the complement of all this elements is just out of this world,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630398/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2017,Not a review of Moonlight. Ha!,This film was a lovely and delightful riff on classic Hollywood musical romances Was it the best picture of the year Of course not But nobody walking into this movie cold no reviews no context could not smile My only complaint was that I wanted more of Gosling and Stone just talking Not dancing Not singing Just bantering Those were the moments when I was most charmed and amused and they were a bit too few and far between,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4014634/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2023,did not want the movie to be finished while watching it,LALALAND is a cinematic masterpiece that swept me off my feet and into a world where dreams and reality seamlessly dance together The acting prowess of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is nothing short of enchanting bringing to life characters whose aspirations resonate with the audience The film editing is a symphony of visual poetry effortlessly transitioning between the vibrant hues of fantasy and the subtle tones of reality The music a soul stirring composition is the beating heart of the film orchestrating emotions with each note The strength of LALALAND lies in its timeless message about the pursuit of passion love and the sacrifices we make to chase our dreams The cinematography paints a love letter to Los Angeles capturing its pulsating energy and the magic of the City of Stars With an 8 10 rating LALALAND is a spellbinding celebration of life love and the pursuit of the extraordinary,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9349978/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2017,"Inspiring, Romantic, Fun, Visually Beautiful, Wistful",I teared up often during the show At the end I got the same feeling I did with other Oscar Best Pictures this show will win it this year It s that good Aspiring actress Mia comes across as more normal than many of her contemporaries which also makes her less likely to succeed as she fails many auditions while working as a barista Sebastian or Seb is a jazz loving pianist who wants to help the genre succeed but has to compromise by taking on paying gigs that don t inspire him As they meet initial clashes give way to chemistry and they inspire each other to pursue their dreams but to what ending remains unclear There are many levels to the movie with homages to old and new movie musicals Dancing and choreography are great but don t expect Astaire and Rogers Bright primary colors grace the screen throughout particularly on the wonderful costumes About the only thing I didn t like was the excessive motion and swirling of the hand held cameras While our couple are the stars the music is what holds it all together and makes it the greatest You will leave feeling inspired and wistful,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630299/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,Replete with film references,Hollywood loves Hollywood so I understand why the Academy went wild over La La Land Every single scene references a classic film from the opening West Side Story sequence to the ending which harks back to Casablanca Is this a musical No It is everything from the history of film all rolled into one production The story is fine and probably resonates with lots of people in the industry as well The cinematography is my favorite part of this creation which is not as compelling as Whiplash but still worth watching,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6382036/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2017,"Highly enjoyable, not your average rom-com",I always wish I saw movies without expectations but we live in a world measured by time so we don t waste it with titles that are sub par Nonetheless I came into the theatre expecting an above average rom com I was completely satisfied in many regards I don t even like musicals but this movie changed my mind The choreography was not strained the songs both told an important story and more important sounded good and the chemistry in Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters was absolutely terrific It makes it hard to digest that these two are not together in real life as I might even dare to say that the chemistry between these two exceeds even the chemistry found between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in The Notebook,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614276/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2017,I loved it!,Hollywood makes a film about itself from time to time This is one of these kind of films and I loved it I am not sure was the La La Land portrayed well in this film for I never went there It seems it was not according to other reviewers but it was not that important What was important was to make a film about the La La Land so people understand how actually it is difficult to make it there I think this film makes a good case about all of that Dancing and singing not in the rain but on the Californian sunshine is excellent and anyone who wants to see a musical should like this film It was like watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers again in some futuristic remake So for the sake of relaxation and good mood go and see this film,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618087/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2017,It gets better every time,I loved this movie for so many reasons but ultimately I love how much more I can gain from the depth and thought put into the movie every time I watch it From the block colours of all the outfits and set to the symbolic use of every song Each individual musical piece isn t just placed there like a Disney princess movie does it always has a purpose to portray a feeling or moment that can t be captured in just words and I loved that about the film even the smaller more insignificant songs actually hold so much meaning when they get incorporated in the big finale song Solid 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3832814/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2017,California Dreaming,The first time I saw this movie was before my resolution to write reviews on all theater movies but I just saw it for a second time which was a very good choice Being able to watch and enjoy twice added because I was able to not only appreciate the story but see a lot of the technical side too This movie is a perfect romance The story of not just two people falling in love but two people falling in love with their craft Ryan Gosling loves jazz and wants to open a jazz bar and Emma Stone loves acting and aspires to be an actress The movie follows them through the changing seasons of a year as their relationship develops and they strive for their goals Oh and there is singing I think what changed for me upon second viewing was that I did not enjoy Emma as much as the first time She is a fine actor but some of her mannerisms threw me especially her singing Goslings singing wasn t fantastic either but I like that both of them are just being real with their voices and aren t some famous singer like the cameos by John Legend that I still didn t like even on the first viewing What changed in a good way was that again the technical aspect was amazing The camera work and coloring along with the directing and cinematography were all spot on I found myself many times marveling at a certain shot or way that the camera follows people around a busy highway or crowded room As with before my favorite part is the ending flashback of what could have been that is so clever and enjoyable I would be fine just watching that part There is one final glare that I would like to address and that is the theme of this movie It has already won massive awards including all seven of it s nominations at the golden globes and will no doubt be represented at the Oscars This is a movie by Hollywood for Hollywood about Hollywood and I don t like that at all To me it feels like a cop out Any film maker knows that if they make a good movie about Hollywood that Hollywood will eat it up and give it every accolade that it can give and La La Land is no exception It angers me because in a year with movies like Arrival Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea I have a bad feeling that La La Land will dominate Oscars as well just because it is a movie about Hollywood and the voters are all Hollywood Hopefully I am wrong but throughout the entire movie there is that lingering wink towards Hollywood and actors and actresses that this movie is for them which is unnecessary because every movie they make is for them they don t need extra praise,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642848/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2017,HO HUM !! SING ME to sleep,I liked it but thought it pretentious and all things American It was light on plot but I did like the chemistry between Emma stone and lead guy I really would not take my friends to see it as it is too over the top Great performances but not worth all the Oscar buzz Modern day musical and great screen sets Where is the plot I mean there is one but too thinly veiled to make it Oscar nominations I saw Lion now that film deserves the awards La La land is a good title for it is mediocre and full of itself But not all bad I went on my own and think I enjoyed it because we Aussies would be embarrassed to see this and have discussions on the deep and meaningful thoughts of this movie So go for it it either a like it or hate it,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626680/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,A Better Musical,Plot particular different to other musicals I warn you that I watched few musicals though that ended in a non predictable way Really enjoyable Actress and Actors Acting quite a good work from both of the main characters In particular I did not like so much Ryan Gosling his expressions did not reach his own eyes so I felt it like it is fake and ruined the movie I mean that if you watch a movie with an actor that do not transmits to you any emotion you ll feel nothing right This was too bad for me Soundtrack amazing Conclusions a really enjoyable and particular musical with a tip of drama,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6527437/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2016,Fun plot with great songs unfortunately performed by a pair of amateur singers and dancers,Sorry folks but for me a musical absolutely requires professional level singing and dancing And although Gosling and Stone are great actors and do an excellent job with a fun script neither one either dances or sings like a professional Not even close The result comes across like one of those rather embarrassing and painful high school musicals that you sit through because your child is in it The costumes and set design were great and I really liked the music I think the movie would have been much better if they had just done voice overs for the songs Then we would only have needed to overlook the amateur dancing The plot is a modified RomCom plot but since this isn t a spoiler review you will have to see it to find out how it deviates from the standard line I saw this movie with my daughter who is an aficionado of movie musicals She was annoyed at the rampant borrowing from classics such as The Umbrellas of Cherbourg An American in Paris and Singing in the Rain Although this point is worth mentioning I think many if not most viewers will not notice We just watched Singing in the Rain last night in honor of Debbie Reynolds If you want to see what a great musical actually looks and sounds like you can rent it from Amazon Then make your own comparison,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608540/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2017,Disappointed,I m disappointed because the whole time I was waiting for the scene everyone told me about where Ryan Gosling s character admits to Emma Stone s character that he got pregnant in the butt by John Legend s character and then he gets really stiff with his arms to his side and shoots off like a rocket with flames coming out of his feet and then that s the end of the movie What gives,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3727119/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2017,La Land- Enchanting generations,During the year I go on average 20 times to the movies and I leave a happy I0 an accomplished 5 and I enchanted but in love I never go out well everything has a first time Behold the story of Sebastian Ryan Gosling who is a musician who dreams of reclaiming the soul of jazz and opening his own club and Mia Emma Stone who is a diner clerk who dreams of becoming a successful actress Historia may be simple and clich it s the kind of things we re already tired of seeing in the movies but we ve never seen it that way you can believe it s been many years since we ve seen something with such flawless direction when la land It starts simple it s usually simple but at one point it completely flushes out of the clich comes to life drives enchants and surprises and not in the most dangerous of moments the ending it disappoints its conclusion is perfect beautiful and memorable It is very clich to make a movie about love novelty is always the way to treat this love and here we see something completely different we have a message that goes against all the standard of Hollywood we have a moral where it says love Is not always above everything we can give it up to pursue our dreams but that does not mean that we will stop loving for even renegade impossible and depreciated love never dies with time Technically La Land is perfect it would be a complete exaggeration to say that it is the best photograph of the cinema but it was the best I saw on the cinema screen its lighting is out of series the way light is thrown from one side To symbolize loneliness love anger and fear even to highlight the unique moment of a character or to reflect the green of hope in Emma Stone s face in the dining room we can understand the whole movie only by Its lighting all its counter planes are brilliant and all the scenes in sequences plans they are not few they are perfect and completely enthralling worth a highlight for the first scene of the movie after watching this scene you will make a point of paying another Ticket I ll leave here my thanks to the cinematographer of this film linus sandgren Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are completely out of character given to roles and with an impressive chemistry the couple loves everyone not only with their dances and kisses but in their ways of looking behaving mania and malice was very well deserved His nominations to Oscar and Damien Chazelle is already next to Denis Villeneuve as the names of the new generation of directors even try only 3 movies in his cinematography Damien surprises and shocks everyone again before with whiplash now with La la land his films are exciting dark cheerful and simply sensational La La Land is worth it it s a different musical from everything you ve ever seen even if you do not like the genre please take a chance after all competing in I3 Oscar categories it s not for anyone,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626419/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2018,Average romance musical,Lots of people have been asking if I ve seen La La Land so I thought I had better give it a chance even though musicals aren t my thing better late than never right I always list the four most prominent actors when I do a review but I truly struggled to think of anyone else to fill the 3rd 4th slots since this film has two stars and at least one of them is on screen the entire time with little time dedicated to anything anyone else Maybe not a bad thing but it does mean the film gets a bit monotonous Sebastian Gosling and Mia Stone are easy to watch and are good in this but I don t think either of them is a particularly good singer or dancer My main problem with musicals is why If a scene s not interesting enough to sustain momentum without having song and dance then cut it At least in animated films they seem to find ways to weave songs in organically and they re catchy Here I didn t find any of the songs very catchy or interesting most are kind of mopey Otherwise it s all quite predictable they fall in love they chase their dreams the end The ending is semi interesting but every time I started to get pulled into the film when there s a stretch with no singing it suddenly appears again always out of context and pushes me back out It s definitely not a bad film I just felt like nothing really happened sure there s some romance and they re good actors but there s no real story or humour to be found,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4020883/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2023,Jazz and Musicals Strike Back!,Coming off what is my favorite film of the decade Damien Chazelle once again showcases his directing prowess this time with the romantic musical La La Land This 2016 gem pleases its audience a variety of ways From the well choreographed musical numbers that never feels dragging to Chazelle s trademark jazz inspired screenplay La La Land is brimming with peak filmmaking authenticity It is as well fantastically written as any with its love story drenched with the struggle of chasing dreams melodrama inspired from Chazelle s personal experience in his hay days in Hollywood Its visual flavor is also noteworthy with cinematography and production design that highlights the vibrance of LA bright color pallets perfectly in tune with its messages of never giving up dreams Through sheer brilliance passion to deliver his subject matter then Chazelle revives the musical genre with a grounded relatable storyline further bolstering the film s appeal Genius On the acting piece Emma Stone once again wowed cementing herself as one of this generation s finer actresses The Oscar win definitely well deserved Ryan Gosling on the other hand was on and off In his best scenes he conveys his character s passion towards traditional jazz he hopes to revive In his worst however he banks on stellar chemistry with Stone and muted volumes to mask his lackluster musical chops Nevertheless La La Land remains a well acted outstanding piece of cinema Its hefty storyline that shares the struggles of those creatively drawn perseverance are absolutely inspiring It entertains with its musical roots crafted exceptionally well by Chazelle and his cohorts As the credits roll I for one have learned to appreciate two things more opportunities jazz And to that i say Cheers and Thanks Damien,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9071459/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2020,OKay At Times,And thats being fairly generous I like singing and dancing and prancing and bouncing off the walls and other moving objects like any other sensible nutjob But this movie was a bit torturous I wonder if it would have worked to slingshot the careers of these two actors 20 years back though whats his face was already a well known actor but was still transitioning from that weird moody phase of his was he dark haired back then or always blonde Do I care The film was enjoyable for some really good music and the ideas of people just having to put up or shut up and do what needs to be done was real talk Growing up can be hard everyones gotta do it though Yet for the two characters to just rub each other the wrong way so often and the needless drama I really have to wonder if thats because producers thought this is just what chicks dig or I dont know what other reason for it all Yes Emma Stone has grown up well and is very funny interesting and pretty So along with the cool sequences that are dream like a little the film was not a total loss That ending though 6 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5751440/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,"Great leads, as actors, not singers and dancers",I was struggling to engage each time it showed it was a musical Gosling and Stone are very talented actors but not born singers or dancers especially Gosling bless his heart To make a musical thrive and not feel awkward you have to fully commit and have talent Neither happened in La La Land Take out the song and dance numbers and the story just isn t strong enough to make up for it I ll add 1 star for Stone s effort when singing she was clearly trying her best and the result was ok 6 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7930136/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2017,Did La La Land pay off the critics..?,If you have a 30 million dollar budget I hope you get some things right The cinematography and aesthetic quality of the film were pretty great and it had its emotional moments Emma Stone Ryan Gosling respectively breathed life into their inherently boring unoriginal roles The story itself kinda makes me want to vomit in my mouth though it did seem like they were going for a rather corny set up so I won t let personal bias get in the way of that Bottom line you don t really care about either of these characters Their love is nothing gripping its not forbidden or difficult for that matter and he doesn t even have to try and woo her just keeps running into her and eventually he must think alright might as well give it a try this is the 5th time i ve seen her cannot believe that this has a 99 rating on sites I usually rely on must be a candidate for the most over hyped movie of all time and to the critics that gave it 10 stars shame on you for diluting the quality Hollywood should be able to achieve If you want an award winning movie that delivers on raw truthful emotion and the human experience see what Moonlight did for 1 20th yes check me the budget,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3694022/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2017,Hollywood Narcism,I went all in to to film despite the Oscar buzz not because of them Director Damien Chazelle had wowed me with his story of a jazz drummer student striving for greatness in Whiplash It was both parts brutal and honest in its projection of musicians in training La La Lan is completely a fictional Hollywood tale made for the movies Different movie but same love of Jazz character unable to commit to a girl So here we let the excursion begin into a TV commercial on a parking lot that we only discover is L A at the end of the scene Context missing and I was lost The genre demands instant suspense of disbelief once the music starts and that opening scene was as memorable as all of the other afternoon traffic jams we experience albeit with folks certainly outside the ages range of 24 32 year old dancers preening for their 15 seconds of screen time Ad agencies sell washing machines yogurt oranges and dish washers this way No matter what the stars the plots the choreography the MUSIC has to be the star in a musical Every top musical has numbers you leave the theater with some new love of song I say the song you say the movie Maria Consider Yourself Cell Block Tango Aquarius off the top of my head And these are not the classics that were being paid homage to That out of the way I really fell for the Emma Stone character I didn t need for Mia to be singing American Idol style which you d expect in a Hollywood Musical Her face alone gave way to multiple emotion like her audition called for Emma was wonderful to watch Ryan Goslings Sebastian is a bit stiff and his Bogart doesn t inspire a lot of emotional suspension of disbelief required to enjoy the lark of the adventure The Hollywood Actress wannabe story line maybe clich but we like this story and even have come to expect the predictability of it It is The American Dream and somewhat universal just s needs memorable tunes and for the male counterpart to figure out and buy into his character arc a bit more I couldn t buy into his jazz isn t dead I have a dream I m supporting my girl miss mash So my experience wasn t all that I was hoping for but much like Los Angeles itself there s something to visit but I wouldn t want to invest too much of my entertainment time there,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3723217/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2021,Blew me away,I put this movie on my to watch list a couple weeks ago I put it on there because it has good reviews and Dunkey likes is so I kinda had to check it out I thought I wasn t going to like it as I m usually not a fan of musicals or romantic movies so I constantly postponed watching it until it was the last thing on the list But oh boy was I glad I watched this It s the best movie I watched in a good while As for the plot it isn t the most original or unique but it s a plot that has been proven to work Girl meets guy they don t like each other at first then fall in love some kinda breakup and finally they either fall in love again or break up Pretty standard stuff What I ve said now doesn t sound very good yet But you ve never seen this story told in this way This movie nails everything the music is breathtaking the choreos are great the sets are wonderfully designed with the perfect amount of contrasting colors The acting is genuinely amazing and many times all of the story is being told through facial expressions and body language I can not give the actors enough credit I m not gonna spoil it any further just watch it it s great,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6660838/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2017,"""a love letter to Los Angeles""",I have the fortune misfortune of my best friend living in the USA so she sees everything before me and often says You must go and see this I had to go and see this Aside from the fact that the Gosling Stone combo is golden and individually they are brilliant I had the recommendation from Stateside I am biased in that I very much admire Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone and I love all things Los Angeles and oldy worldy Hollywood but someone told me before I went that LLL isn t set in the Golden Age of Hollywood the 1940s its set in modern day Hollyweird Shocker What did this mean From the opening scene I had a stupid grin on my face and it only left when I was crying Such is the emotional roller coaster of this film It is the golden years of Hollywood because it transports you to another world where singing and dancing are normal and love is forever and two people are star crossed to be together and it s sunny and people wear bright colours and pretty dresses and proper suits still It s a Hollywood where Gosling and Stone shine and are playing characters that seem so natural to them the fact that Ryan had to learn to play piano like that for the film defies belief It s a beautiful film a love song to Los Angeles but also a stark portrait of Hollywood as well the competition the broken dreams the fakery the traffic jams and the disappointment Two wannabes Stone an aspiring actress and Gosling an aspiring jazz musician meet by chance and are wildly unsuitable for each other But it works Both are smitten and motivated to chase the other and each pushes the other with their dreams It is beautiful endearing but also gut wrenchingly sad and challenging These people knew exactly what they wanted from life and they bared all figuratively and went for it What is in my life that is like that What dreams do I have did I have I thought about it for days afterwards that and the beautiful and haunting musical refrain The music is wonderful John Legend is a Legend and seeing him in the film was icing on the cake and Gosling s piano playing is just beautiful The sets and locations whether the back lot at Universal or whichever Studio it was The Griffith Observatory or out on the road were all perfect and costume and Direction all the ducks were lined up in a row to be brilliant So many homages to past Hollywood films little in jokes which I didn t get but read about so much depth and twists for once a Hollywood film without a Hollywood ending but it was more Hollywood because of that I loved it I get why some people didn t those without the childlike suspension of disbelief and inability to see fantasy and imagine another world or see metaphor seems you either adore it or say Meh I m not sure it is worthy of all the Oscar nods if I m being honest Yes it was dancing and singing and fantasy and real life and Hollywood and period and modern and all things to all Los Angeles but it wasn t taxing or a stretch for these actors But perhaps it was the nod to things past the feelings it engendered the emotional roller coaster what films are meant to be about the story within the story within the film the film as story and as narration which makes it more than the sum of its parts and the bareness and frankness of the characters I think it is one of those films that will be studied to peel back the onion layers of Director Damien Chazelle s vision Go see for yourself,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642173/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2017,Twizard Rating: 100,I ve always said Ryan Gosling was meant to do comedy I think very highly of the guy but I hold the unpopular opinion that he s not necessarily the best dramatic actor in the world In La La Land he gets a chance to utilize some dramatic acting skills but strays away from his usual angst filled characters as he showcases his humor chops It helps that he and Emma Stone have such great chemistry With their third feature together Crazy Stupid Love and Gangster Squad the pair demonstrate why they may be our generation s Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers two actors that are paid homage to in this film La La Land is about a struggling actress Mia Stone who is constantly being rejected at every audition she has and a mercurial jazz pianist Sebastian Gosling who dreams of opening his own jazz club He is a talented musician but often finds himself going against his own integrity playing pop music and simple lounge standards The two meet in a way that would make any classic cinephile proud and over time develop a relationship each dealing with his and her own floundering careers is the process The film acts as a love letter to Los Angeles It s not necessarily a nice letter but it s not a breakup letter either More like a letter to an abusive partner who you keep coming back to for some inexplicable reason only for them to spit on you and tell you you re worthless It pokes fun at the city constantly saying out loud the things most of us would be tried for treason for ever thinking But they ve all been actual thoughts lingering in our minds at one point or another It s a quixotical view of what LA is supposed to be or used to be The two characters are old souls adamantly romanticizing what they view their ideal careers to be only to realize that they view this city in an antiquated way that no longer really exists in today s world Things such as technology and loss of nostalgia are ruining it and they struggle to find the balance between the new and the old without wanting to compromise much The film on the other hand compromises the new and the old very well in its every moment The songs don t feel modern but they don t feel dated either They re not necessarily poppy and affable at first fitting well into the film s jazz theme Gosling and Stone are not fantastic singers but they re not bad either which makes their performances all the more appealing they re one of us Much like a non New Yorker can empathize with a film that pays homage or lack thereof to New York one doesn t have to be from Los Angeles to get what the film is trying to say Viewers can see where the movie comes from LA is everywhere We experience it in almost every movie we watch in one way or another La La Land isn t just for Los Angeleans It s for dreamers and people with big visions For people who have been rejected over and over and over again told they re not good enough and still for some reason keep going back at it But like anything we love it takes a lot of work La La Land makes you believe in your dreams again Twizard Rating 100,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627250/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2023,Great romantic musical film about the true American Dream :),I sincerely liked this fine American musical The actors and musicians in this elaborate Hollywood production made this into a masterpiece At the 89th Academy Awards La La Land received a leading six awards namely Best Director Best Actress Best Cinematography Best Original Score Best Original Song City of Stars and Best Production Design The film received a record total of 14 nominations being a testament that America not only has a great need for light hearted musicals but also a need to envision and resonate with the American Dream on a surrealistic artistic and romantic level regardless how elusive that American Dream may be After all as long as we Americans have our music laughter and dreams and our celebrities who embody these dreams with fame money and cool attitudes we ll be all right By this I m not suggesting that America s pursuit for happiness is shallow and vain but what I am saying is that America must make a greater effort to manifest Peace and Equality for ALL People in the International Community It should also be noted that Joe Biden s two state solution is sheer delusion since Israel rejects it Hence the US must advocate Universal Suffrage In Israel Palestine On that note as the Acting President of the United States I praise all our fine American activists and troops who uphold goodness decency and Human Rights in the International Community Furthermore we are calling on Israel to stop killing Gaza s women and babies The first step for Peace in Israel Palestine is to implement Universal Suffrage That is the only feasible way for Peace and to end the crime of apartheid in Israel Palestine and the occupation of Gaza by Benjamin Netanyahu In short it all hinges on Compromise Democracy Equality and Due Process which must be implemented Love and Light God Bless Mark UNITED NATIONS THE CROWN POTUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9432262/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2021,Don't watch,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6871455/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2017,OK just,slow and drab dancing was terrible in both technique and choreography Only one tune was good and that played throughout the whole movie On a positive note it was a far more realistic portrayal which I liked compared to the usual American artificial stuff But it was not a powerful awesome story that deserves such high rating it reminded me of another Ryan Gosling movie that had awesome reviews called Drive It was so slow and the dialogue was so slow I laughed during an emotional stare between the 2 in love as no words came out perhaps this is a Ryan thing that he gets away with as he is kinda cute and lovable so you cannot help but like him so my only conclusion is slow movies must be arty hence get the ratings Whereas I like a movie to entertain me and this and La la land did not,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3637529/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,A love letter to Classic Hollywood.,La La Land is written directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Rosemarie DeWitt and J K Simmons A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles Who said Hollywood s Golden Age died back in the 1960s In Damien Chazelle s remarkable La La Land it s back in full force with all the glitz glamour and fun energy that made the classics so enjoyable Our two wonderful leads Ryan Gosling Sebastian and Emma Stone Mia are an absolute treat to watch as they pursue their dreams taking us through the colourful city of Los Angeles around them Presented gloriously in CinemaScope and featuring a stellar soundtrack La La Land is a triumph in filmmaking only to be experienced in cinemas The technical skill on show is undeniably careful and gracious acting as the perfect supplement to the aforementioned leads As the screen opens and the CinemaScope logo appears we pan down from the pale blue sky over the city and straight into the first musical number which may need some time to settle but nevertheless kickstarts the film with joy At first glance you ll notice and appreciate the presence of a soft and subtle film grain created only when shot on celluloid Natural lighting is used for most scenes in the film as well as real locations all over the city of Los Angeles securing a sense of realism in the story and characters Once the rocky first quarter comes to an end the real magic begins With some fine trimming La La Land could be a perfect masterpiece but the duration of the film or rather the time management is my only complaint Chazelle s writing is spectacular and reminiscent of his previous project Whiplash which also saw major success and received high approval from critics and filmgoers alike A small cameo from J K Simmons branches the gap between this film and Chazelle s last with Simmons playing a similar character to that in Whiplash The soundtrack composed by Justin Hurwitz is pumping with life carrying on his funky jazz style accompanied by Stone and Gosling s strong vocals The numbers are entertaining and skilfully performed with vivid visuals to aid the original score also composed by Hurwitz In preparing for their roles Stone and Gosling were required to learn to dance and move to specific cues during the lengthy one shot takes Gosling also decided to learn the piano in order to dismiss the need for CGI doubling further showcasing his talents as we watch in admiration La La Land is a work of art a true love letter to Hollywood s Golden Age Although taking place in the modern world with smartphones and social network tools Chazelle takes a unique approach and combines old and new There are vibrant sets and exciting sequences that seem as if they ve been pulled directly from the 50s 60s alongside modern vehicles and coffee shops providing a marvellous backdrop for our characters to interact with Each and every individual involved in this project have done a remarkable job in creating a world everyone can get happily lost in Awards season is underway and La La Land has already made Golden Globes history with its impressive 7 wins further attracting filmgoers and selling out show after show around the world This is simply fine work and all involved should be greatly proud of this superb accomplishment Here s to the ones who dream Verdict Lights camera action Classic Hollywood is back with Damien Chazelle s hugely entertaining and dazzling La La Land La La Land 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621877/?ref_=tt_urv

21 May 2018,I wish I would've liked La La Land,It was artistically very well made but not much else It doesn t go anywhere or have any memorable songs It s about two people who first hate each other on the freeway and later like each other after bumping into one another but for no reason They have no chemistry and it s repetitive that she s getting auditions and he wants a singing career but what do they have together,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4173040/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,"Well known masterpiece, yet still underrated",Words can t really describe how good this movie is To start the craft that goes into it is all time the cinematography may be the best of any film ever and the music from Justin Hurwitz is absolutely beautiful The acting from Stone and Gosling is also absolutely amazing handling more than just a basic love story The choreography is extraordinarily impressive lively and just amazing But holy crap the writing it is perfect it balances extraordinarily realistic conversations motivations acting as a love letter to jazz and filmmaking and believable conflicts all in a musical that has the main couple flying through the galaxy Nothing feels jarring nothing feels forced it is beauty and brilliance you will freak out over every damn shot your jaw will be on the floor with the skill required to pull off the amount of long one takes You will fall in love with the characters and the movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8615265/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2017,Not for everyone. Great musical score. A movie with movement and a beating heart,Not a movie for everyone that is for sure However having already seen Whisplash I had a very good feeling about that movie not to mention that the entire cast was already promising But the direction is what I was mostly looking for And as it turned out this is yet another masterpiece at least for the distinguished crowd and the ppl who are looking for something light but meaningful romantic but real to the core Actually the first scene is more than enough and is a great opening that is as impressive as the many other visual scenes that would follow And between all the music the swift and sophisticated moves the tap dancing the colors the smiles and the stages you end up noticing the moments of silence the moments of truth this tiny instant between two records or notes when everything seems to be some kind of a distant vision a trip to a future that could have been but that won t necessarily happen One vision out of many others one possibility out of a multitude Never going with one perspective but covering all of them Hers His and theirs together Definitely a must see for the experience of seeing something unique for once cheesy at times but a different kind of cheesy nonetheless albeit the good and refined kind,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3613448/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2017,"A well made, well interpreted and enjoyable musical",If you are looking for a classical well packaged musical La La land is ready to satisfy your search and even if you are not a great fan of musicals La La land may appeal to you too The story is the classical story of a boy and a girl looking for artistic success and falling in love with all the difficulties that the opposition between success and love bring about and with a finale which is not that predictable What is appealing indeed is not the story in itself but the way it is shot and performed Shooting is flawless music is entertaining but never obtrusive or boring dances and songs are enjoyable and charming the overall atmosphere is full of charm and soul And the two protagonists make a difference Ryan Gosling does a truly excellent job offering a thorough performance playing the piano singing and dancing very well and showing a very good and convincing chemistry with Emma Stone who offers a talented performance too The final result is that of a solid charming and well made musical a perfect execution by the young Chazelle who proves to be a very promising director,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631408/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2020,Very good musical,I am not a musical fan at all The story was pretty basic But this was so well done Great acting nice pace good songs and choreography Might have given a 9 or 10 if it was my cup of tea,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5908988/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,Basic girl-meets-boy movie with a bittersweet ending,This is up for 14 nominations and is bound to walk away with the lion s share of Oscars It was a pleasant movie but did not reach the level of greatness for me that it has for others here It is a basic girl meets boy movie with a bittersweet ending There is not a song from the movie that I came out humming or singing If Emma Stone wins for Best Actress in this movie it would only show me how weak this the category may be this year But I haven t seen Arrival or Elle so I don t know about these movies As I watched this movie I did think about Les parapluies de Cherbourg 1964 but that movie was a modern opera and La La Land 2016 comes no where near that great Michel Legrand work of yesteryear,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3635030/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2017,As charming and delightful as it sounds. Near perfection,As charming as can be as creative as can be nearly perfect as can be La La Land if musical films are of any interest to you will demand to be watched from start to finish Right from the start the highway music number is an incredible watch From production to performance it is an absolute delight to and is simply the beginning for what La La Land delivers for two hours Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone take what is a two character performance and runs with it The film rarely feels dull or boring as one or both of these two are on the screen no matter a spoken performance or musical number The charisma and charm bleeds out of these two with every passing moment with a chemistry that is through the roof Damien Chazelle shows his love of music and specifically Jazz with yet another brilliant music oriented film First he delivered us Whiplash which remains to be one of my favorite films and now we have La La Land a film I did not expect to love AS much as I did due to it being a musical but Damien is simply a brilliant mind when it comes to these films I am excited to see what he will continue to deliver to the public in the future A special note to the true meaning to the film That you never stop working for your dreams No matter how many times you fail or are told No Here s to the fools who dream foolish as they may seem La La Land is an incredible piece of film As I said before I gained interest simply because I loved Whiplash and what Damien Chazelle does with his films but I never expected to love a musical film as much as I did With a phenomenal performance by the duo of Gosling and Stone as well as simply a near perfect production background La La Land deserves every award it gets as it faces off with film titans in each of its respective categories with the coming award shows,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616830/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,"Fun, Deep, and Classic",The story of two struggling artists trying to accomplish their dreams set to music The movie is surprisingly fun engaging and emotionally impactful It delves into issues of what it means to sacrifice for your dreams and what they are worth to you and the people you love The movie can be cheesy at times but it leans heavily into the genre of classic musicals from the 50s 60s and 70s on purpose It simply feels fun If your not already into musicals you may not enjoy the movie But those who love musicals will be pleasantly pleased,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7154122/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2022,Fabulous!!,La La Land 2016 was one good movie of that year Performances by both lead were great and direction by Damien Chazelle was amazing The story was perfectly basic something you seen many times before which was used to enhanced the beauty of how the story was told For a very basic overview La La Land tells the story of two young people trying to make a go of it in Los Angeles Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a jazz musician with a dream of opening his own club Mia Emma Stone is an aspiring actress who never seems to have any luck in her auditions After a few chance meetings however they discover that it may take their beliefs in each other to make those individual dreams come true La La Land is a film about dreams and goals what it takes to achieve them and coming to terms with what comes out of personal circumstances The beauty of the movie is its music and its incredibly colorful and refreshing tone,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7897834/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2017,Already a classic that will live forever,This movie is a dream come true and I know it sound weird but it is true at least for me The screenplay is just the perfect combination of romance comedy and drama The whole idea of dreams chasing them admiring the ones who have already achieve them is really inspirational Also the dancing most of the time is was tap but even a waltz comes near which was a perfect touch I love musicals and this one is not an exception it is one of the best I have ever seen Chazelle is a genius And also his work as a director was outstanding from beginning to end Talking about beginning the introduction of this film was amazing The songs are really good also the dancing The performances made by the two leading roles Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were incredible really really good Especially Stone s one How both of them have their own history and passion The custom design were classic and pretty but at the same time very modern The cinematography is just perfect for the motion picture and film editing made me want to cry because it is excellent I love movies I love musicals this movie is just perfection to me Here s to the ones who dream,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631407/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2018,Forgettable,As a big big musical fan and movie lover I was so ready and excited for this Especially after all the rave reviews But what a disappointment I found it extremely forgettable I struggled to watch it and stay focused because it was so dull I couldn t even tell you straight after watching it what it was really about because my attention dipped out so much Such a shame because a great cast let down by rubbish songs and a mediocre script,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4115763/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2017,My Best Picture of 2017,I saw this film a few weeks ago and I m catching up on my reviews THIS IS Best Picture NOT Moonlight there I said it Sue me Okay the film is basically about an failed actress named Mia played by Oscar winner Emma Stone Oh yeah she earned that award Anyway she goes to all these auditions in Holllywood and she gets a whole world of no until one day she meets Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling who is a jazz musician and wants to own his own jazz club but Hollywood is full of what s in now and doesn t care about what s real So Mia and Sebastian keep missing each other until one day she hears him playing at a party and they start to date All this stuff happens in between which I can t say because you need to see it It s really good I loved it Basically the film is don t give up on your dreams Oh yeah the film is a musical Please don t dismiss this film because it s a musical it s really good The songs are catchy and you ll be singing those tunes the moment you leave the theater or watch it on blu ray Some of the songs you ll have in your head I m sure will be Someone in the Crowd City of Stars Star A Fire and Another Day of Sun Okay let s get this out of the open right now I love La La Land and I thought Moonlight was crap I wrote a review for that film as well It s on my page you can read it if you wish The Oscars flub that was heard around the world had it wrong Moonlight is NOT the Best Picture La La Land was and is in my book at least and I m sure in many others Should you watch this film That s up to you You watch it because you want to watch it Don t let some critic tell you what to watch I m no critic I m just saying what I like You might not like it but that s life isn t it If you are having doubts about a movie rent it from Redbox and view it first and make your choice It s only a few bucks and if you don t like it you re not out of a lot of money Or wait for it to be on TV which is silly if you ask me I mean why would you wait 2 or 3 years for cable to play a movie when you can rent it for 2 bucks,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3653880/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2017,Exquisite,From watching the trailer it gives off a very enthusiastic and fun mood however that may be slightly deceiving as the movie goes through a range of emotions Some will be unexpected and that is what makes this film so great A must watch till the end even though the beginning half may be a bit slow it is worth it If they had cut out some details or made the beginning half a little shorter then it would have been perfect The musical numbers are plenty and all very well executed I absolutely love the soundtrack Here is a movie based entirely around the musical element and it is phenomenal As I write this now I m listening to the soundtrack As all or most I presume of the songs are original they are able to create the song to suit each character Not only that but choreography throughout is simply amazing Those like the beginning scene is simply to initiate the audience as to what they are getting into Others like the tap dancing scene with Gosling and Stone are infused with feeling and flirtation The cast is perfect Gosling and Stone complement each other so well they were previously paired in Crazy Stupid Love Gosling is such a versatile actor just looking at his IMDb history is so impressive He can encompass a range of personas and is great at portraying characters with a lot of passion Stone is also quite a versatile actress and it is hard not to like her I heard from my friend that there area also quite a lot of distinguished dancers in the movie and that doesn t surprise me It is a musical after all and that requires great dancers not just great actors and actresses So overall everyone did their parts extremely well and was able to bring a lot of energy to the story What makes this such a classic is that it pays homage to many eras in the Hollywood film industry There is a bit of film noir quite a few scenes depicting the silent era there is of course the sound era and the introduction of technicolor and what makes it so classical is the fact that it mimics the style of Singin in the Rain What with the musical numbers and also the self reflective aspect of the story While in Singin the characters were actually making a movie in La La Land they show some behind the scenes of how Hollywood is like There is also quite a few instances where characters break the fourth wall and this is done so smoothly that it doesn t really affect the diegesis The ending scene as well is very much like the one in Singin though produces a different effect Overall this film is definitely a new classic and I thoroughly enjoyed it Everyone I knew was saying how good it was and I can t agree more,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3644323/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2016,I Don't Even Like Musicals and I Liked It,This is a normal review from a normal average viewer of movies I say this is non biased because I don t rant and rave over musicals nor do I actually enjoy them on a regular basis I went with my wife to see this movie on a date night The opening scene was a traditional break into dance sequence that was kind of a turn off but after that the movie got better The acting was great as Gosling and Stone are always good in their roles Not to mention their chemistry on screen was fantastic as always They are just really believable as a couple The director couldn t have picked two better actors to portray the roles on screen There was quite a bit of singing and some dancing on screen but hearing it from Stone and Gosling made it believable The music and score were enjoyable and the story itself was hard to beat So if you re someone who enjoys good acting and a great story I would highly recommend it And if you re someone who doesn t typically enjoy musicals I would still encourage you to check it out especially if you re a guy looking to take your wife gf to a nice flick You d be silly not to take them to this movie because it s a great story and has Ryan Gosling she will be smiling for days I predict it will definitely win some awards come Oscar season,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3602073/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2017,7/10 Homage to Hollywood ...city of stars,It s easy to see why this so popular with Hollywood it about The Hollywood dream What better way to express that than in a musical I ll be honest I love the genre musicals dominate my top ten films of all time They encompass pure escapism romance and put a smile on your face throughout and maybe the odd tear too Best of all you can watch them over and over again How did this this perform as a musical Poorly to be honest yes there s romance yes there s escapism but the smiles were sadly missing Undoubtedly you ll fall in love with Emma Stone Ryan Gosling s performance however was substandard in comparison you never really felt his character had true I would die for you passion for Mia I loved the homage to Hollywood however particularly the mash up of Ricks bar in Casablanca throughout The whole premise of a musical is mad people don t generally break into song and dance in the street but when they do in this movie they re able to do it tongue in cheek and with humour recognising how bizarre their actions are I loved the use of spotlighting in musical sequences just wish there were more musical numbers and maybe a few full cast dance numbers the opening sequence gave you a feeling you were in for a traditional musical with a touch of Mamma Mia popularity but it never transpired On the negative side the movie did try and tick too many boxes and could have benefited from better script editing and adhering to a true romantic story line but perhaps that was its aim like the breakaway from traditional jazz there s an attempt to break away from the traditional musical The overall theme was that fantasy is better than reality and this was enhanced by the closing scene Life is so much better in La La Land There were a couple of musical numbers you won t be able to get out of your head I liked the film just wish I could have loved it I ought to want to see it again but I m not bothered and that s where it failed on the whole Here s to those who dream Pad A,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3617946/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2017,The Clash Between Love,La La Land is a spectacular musical focused on two aspiring stars living in Los Angeles The story focuses on Sebastian an aspiring jazz pianist and Mia an aspiring actress and their struggle to get their start in LA I decided to watch this movie after learning that it tied for most Oscar nominations and I am most certainly glad that I gave this movie a shot I fell in love with everything about the movie 20 minutes in I believe the director put a much deeper meaning in La La Land in terms of whether to follow your dreams or follow love At first I wasn t expecting this movie to be something like that but it unravels throughout the last half of the movie The movie s score is amazing and Justin Horowitz did an amazing job with everything Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have amazing chemistry just like they did in Crazy Stupid Love I highly recommend everyone watch La La Land based solely on the score of the movie THIS MOVIE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633821/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2019,A mood-board with no drama,This is one of those films that consist of dialogue scenes that the actors improvise to get into the mood for the real script Actors love that cheezy ranting around kind of dialogue because they love to swim in scenes packed with drama and deep emotional thoughts They dont care about functionality and contribution to the real story And what about that real story No idea I really have no idea what this story is about Two artists are trying to make it in Hollywood while struggling in a relationship OK That is not a story Thats a mood board What did I like then The production design Color is very consistent and secluded locations etc add to the alienation as metafor for the inner of the pffff I love Lynch to do that brilliantly in Mullholland Drive understatement The actors Gosling gives exactly what he just has a kind of vague notion of who am I sort of expression But Stone she is the talent she is under casted in this one She may not yet use 10 from her reserves Music A joke What idiot ever thought of using a jazz musician as a maincharacter for a musical without jazz music Anyone What a dysfunctional cluster of styles rithmes paste s and colours No I don t understand the high rankings It is just a mood board without drama,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5315074/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2017,A Solid Entry In The Dangerous Territory of Musicals,There are good news and bad news The good news is that if you know nothing about musicals then La La Land is going to tell you all about the creme de la creme Top Hat An American In Paris Mary Poppins Singin In The Rain both in very specific references and the most obvious influence of all especially in terms of characters and narrative The Umbrellas of Cherbourg Not only is the essential history of musicals part of this film but everything s also impeccably executed Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both remarkably subtle as well and for once in a colorful Hollywood romance none of the main characters steps over the other Note that there s a Woody Allen sleeping in Gosling s character a very traditional artist who refuses to open up to other people s tastes and opinions not sure if mentioning Mr Allen is a compliment or not But seriously even the most skeptics of you about musicals will have a good time The bad news is that this is one long long long movie that ends a million consecutive times Don t you hate it when you re watching a movie and you get the feeling that it ends a first time then it ends again then again and again and again to the extent that you no longer know if it s ever going to end at all The director Damien Chazelle is also developing his gimmicks that he might be unfortunately mistaking for trademark fast consecutive inserts referencing anecdotes about great musicians building sonic climax and breaking it abruptly Also if you re expecting to find some of the tension remaining from Chazelle s previous coup de ma tre Whiplash you won t because he has moved on to a more contemplative more harmonious and less scientific place about music and he wants everybody to know it To sum up the major difference between Whiplash and La La Land in terms of experience as a spectator you eat Whiplash and you sip La La Land By the way you can thank the producers for approving of a not so happy after all ending for an A list Hollywood movie HALLELUJAH You might get bored here and there However you should be convinced by the likability of the cast the delicious 40 s three color strip referencing cinematography and the shockingly impressive Steadicam work La La Land will also manage to steal a few good laughs from you,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614842/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2019,A story about life,I loved the colors they caught some beautiful pictures with their cameras some songs in this were catchy and memorable also some scenes hit me emotionally It has Musical parts in it but it s not always Musical Overall I d say it is a movie worth seeing there s definitely something about it I can see why some people don t love it though but also why some people do Make up your own mind I think it had good parts in it that definitely convinced me but maybe it s not as big as it could ve been,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4570024/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2023,I'm in love with this after the second viewing.,La La Land While navigating their careers in Los Angeles a pianist and an actress fall in love while attempting to reconcile their aspirations for the future I believe that Damien Chazelle is just a Jazz lover and all what he s trying to do is making us Jazz lovers too and he actually did La La Land is a musical in which there s an actual plot a story that is served with the music and that s what I loved the most because the story is interesting the music is wonderful and it was visually pleasing to see I m really in love with this masterpiece I literally can watch Ryan Gosling playing piano for the rest of my life I can watch them dance in that sunset scene for the rest my life I actually can watch them dance for the rest of my life so I really can watch La La Land for the rest of my life The weirdest thing about it is that I wasn t expecting it to be this great considering that I ve watched it 6 years ago this was one of the best cinematic experiences I ve ever had that s what we love about cinema making our nights in the most beautiful of ways,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9271093/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2019,A story about two mentally ill people,In short this movie is another Hollywood echo chamber It s saturated with self references and channeling itself So out of touch with reality and narcissistic Quite symptomatic really Thank God they gave us a clue in the name of their movie for us to have a grasp what this movie is about just by looking at its name The only reason these two mentally ill dissociated characters fell in love with each other in the first place is because they realized this is what they had in common mental illness and dissociation So why the hell not be like this together Better than to go through life alone with such misery anyway Other than that these two characters are stripped of any personality To be fair many classics of musicals this movie was trying hard to channel are guilty of that Just like in many musicals romantic comedies Hollywood tropes these two people were thrown out at each other artificially Let me get this straight I don t know any woman who would memorize a guy like Sebastian and believe they re meant to be together despite the fact that all she knows about him is that once he showed her middle finger and was shaking his head at her in a car and later he shoved her aside while she was trying to compliment his piano play It just doesn t work like that It was good at mechanistically channeling musicals and Hollywood but it was doing so unenthusiastically I know that musical movies tend to have lack of good singing because they usually take famous actors with little to no musical background to play But in this case maybe the film could benefit from better singing and dancing if the script and idea were so bad And no Sebastian you re not playing jazz You re just playing one mediocre pop song that is styled as vintage Big theme of this movie is follow your dreams which almost always happens to be a dream of making it in the entertainment industry for some reason As if people who watch this can t dream of something other than that It s interesting that many Hollywood and Disney movies have been having this clich theme throughout decades Big question why I kind of get it why many people received this movie well and believed all the hype and that it deserved Oscars One of the reasons is of course because they just eat whatever is being fed to them by Hollywood and mainstream all the time Another one is that large portion of society lives in this la la land In our capitalist society people are alienated from reality and they live in a fantasy major corporations create for them to escape They also dream about mythical love and having a dream like career Even their dreams are not something they created I m saying all that because I recommend you to read Zizek s review of La La Land,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4887668/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2017,"A dazzling, dizzying, exhilarating experience",SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625402/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2017,Over Rated or Over Hyped?,La La Land sent the cinematic world into a frenzy and I can t quite say I understand the hype A musical in 2017 is bound to send people into a frenzy of excitement anticipation and nostalgia However I think it was a bit over done The beautiful dance scene after the party was a scene well though out enough to get all of our 1950s musical senses tingling however didn t the iPhone ring just ruin it I can see what the filmmakers are trying to do here but isn t it a bit overbearing and too ironic Irony is best served subtly Although the songs were captivating and both actors delivered beautiful performances and I won t forget about it any time soon Worth seeing even if it is to just be a bit confused by the concept,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3640274/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2022,An ode to old Hollywood,There is just something about La la Land This is on a surface level a generic go for the gold story but the way it tells it s story it s characters it s production All coming together to create a marvelous and beautiful movie Two artist find each other and most navigate ups and downs in their carriers in Hollywood The weakest part to me for this movie is it s see through script Too many times I can just hear the writer tell me what he thinks about the industry and art Not the characters but the writer There are too many I think this lines and they can at times be a bit too pretentious Sure we can all think highly of art and see it as more than work but come on it s not that black or white Emma Stones performance is great in this movie Her singing alone always moves me and she is incredibly charming in the role This is an ode to old Hollywood musicals in so many ways The production design is incredible The different sets really stick out and they fell build in a charming and old way The different colors and uses of them how everything pops how incredible the choreography is how it s both real and dreamlike at the same time The production is just incredible and a love letter to the old Hollywood traditions The music is so good as well as the songs The great use of jazz and therefore horns and piano creates great music at all times And the songs are all memorable and so catchy You ll walk around humming any of the songs days after This is a great musical The visual storytelling is also incredible So many feelings are shown purely visually and through great means of color and fantasy The music also helps The ending sequence is still incredible and combines everything the movie does great into one amazing ending It s a story about art and integrity How art can fell hollow how hard it is to live of passion how you can fell like art is being misused and how great ideas can be forgotten by something in I don t agree with everything the movie says but I think it s message is beautiful and executed well La la Land is a delight and so well done It s a technical and production marvel and so well done The story is good and believable Overall you are gonna walk away laughing crying cheering and hoping after watching,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8761573/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,"Nothing you'd expect, but also nothing you've ever seen",So a few hours before I had been brought by Damien Chazelle on an unforgettable musical adventure I had been searching through IMDb like I do for hours every day and found this poll about the top directors under 40 years of age But this poll took me by surprise like no other previously has You know why I was scrolling through for about five minutes wondering Wondering why Why wasn t Damien Chanzelle even given the respect he deserves Because can you believe it This man is only 31 31 And look what he s done He s terrific So this poll took me by great surprise to the reason being Damien wasn t even on the list He wasn t even respected enough to on the list Damien needs to be recognized to a full He certainly came into the the film industry full of great ideas and proving his future value with his fantastic film debut of Whiplash Anyway so moving on it s very obvious that this man loves his music Though this unforgettable glory of La La Land Damien takes you on a trip you never thought you d undertake He s mixed the late musicals not to mention his outstanding camera work going back to the traditional no cut sequences and the romantic flicks of near after And he s done a terrific job at it I had never expected what I would see once I stepped into the cinema and sat in the slightly comfortable but not all too thrilling red seats This film was spectacular in every way It brought terrific camera work I say terrific It can t get better than Damien Chazelles camera work His directing is exquisite it s original it s breath taking it s eye catching it s not to be missed I literally did not blink throughout the whole film that s how unmissable this soon to be classic is Damien Chazelle is soon to be a film making legend He s got an entertaining future ahead of himself and I m sure he s not going to let anyone forget that Just wait My rating 9 6 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3606247/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2017,A Lovely Dream,La Land is a film that was made by the passion for movies and evokes the same love to the public Damien Chazelle s dream project is replete with gender references all perfectly incorporated ranging from a narrative structure to a simple touch on a post Here is the heart who leads the story The direction of Chazelle is creative and daring giving preference to long plans the mise en scene is vivid and the camera is active always looking to float around the scene and characters and the dance and music scenes are impeccable But the soul of the film is in Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Gosling has an extremely dedicated work including the piano He injects different layers to the character transiting very well between drama comedy romance and sarcasm and that leaves the public fallen in love with Sebastian And Stone probably the most wonderful thing in this lovely movie creates a vibrant Mia A performance with explosions of feelings and that exceeds the limits of the screen and reaches the heart of the viewer in full leaving us with each new frame more and more in love with it The rest of the cast acts correctly but without individual highlights The technical part is perfect The cinematography is inventive and printing Technicolor s dream colors and presented in Cinemascope makes the film an event The vast costumes and the detailed production design help create an intense fluid and euphoric world And the soundtrack and the songs which could be more are incredible they are remarkable compositions that help to punctuate the emotions of the scenes and that help to extract excellent moments of the protagonists The few problems of the film like the abandonment of some elements that were interesting and abrupt changes of feelings do not change the fact that La Tierra is a masterpiece A masterful harmonious exciting brave and daring film with captures the essence of what it truly is to fall in love with the movies A movie for a lifetime,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3634675/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2017,Reviving old styles with modern fashion,Is just incredible how a 32 years old director can bring altogether cinema from the 40s 50s and 60s to create something fresh and unique From the opening shot you can already identify a thing that looks like a try of copying something old but that actually you wanna keep watching it This are some of the things i love in this movie Emma Stone How many actress can play the role of an actress Emma performance was marvelous to me she was meant for this character end of discussion Ryan Gosling I gotta say first that i love Ryan no homo but i didn t know what to except from him in a movie like this since i was more used to his mysterious not so talkative characters BUT MAN it fitted just perfectly not the Ryan from The Notebook the Ryan from La La Land and it was right on point Color Damien used to the maximum the good things from our century and one of them was the way he worked the colors Vivid fresh and meaningful the whole film Soundtrack It s funny because although this is a musical it doesn t restrict itself with the expected whole scenario singing and dancing through the whole movie The fact that one of the main characters is a jazz player lover makes up that half of the movie soundtrack is jazz and it ends up working pretty well Cinematography You will be having flashbacks all the movie it recreates a hell lot of old types of shots and framing but it still feels fresh because it s done with modern fashion It s splendid to watch your eyes doesn t want to leave the screen Overall what i think makes this movie so great is that it brings dead cinema to life making the best usage of modern cinema techniques and equipment and without any flaws There s some much you can breakdown in this film and so little bad to point out in my opinion In think we could define this movie as neo musical,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3683852/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,"Musical doesn't interest me, But the Love Story is worth watching.",At first glance this looked like a musical throwback to the Golden Era of Hollywood where artists come with dreams in their eyes and love for the art But it became an amazing Love Story Their dreams brought them together and those dreams pushed them away but what remained were the memories the innocence the what ifs and the love Emma Stone is outstanding and direction of Damien Chazelle is praiseworthy a worthy follow up to the electric Whiplash Do watch this one,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5582602/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,Excellent movie,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3607967/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2017,The Best Picture Winner (for 30 seconds),La La Land is exactly what its whimsical and upbeat title would entail a masterfully directed wonderfully delightful visually vibrant and painstakingly realistic musical The film s tremendous success and acclaim may leave some disappointed that are expecting the next great genre film Although this film is not excellent it certainly sings a catchy memorable tune This is one of the few films I have seen that made me wish people could just randomly break out into a synchronized song and dance The music is perfect for the magical vibrancy of the dance sequences The director Damien Chazelle was definitely Oscar worthy especially by mimicking Alejandro Gonz lez I rritu s tracking shots in Birdman and The Revenant tracking shots done right are always deserving of an Oscar Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone together create a convincing romance full of humor hope charm and blistering sadness The most surprising thing about La La Land is its handling of themes such as dreams vs reality and how much it takes to chase those dreams The filmmakers were not afraid to take risks with the story Those risks paid off because the movie was bitterly realistic when it could have easily been clich The only problem with the film is that it took awhile for any kind of conflict drama to emerge resulting in a semi dragged out narrative For me La La Land was as good as a musical could have been musicals are my least favorite genre I enjoyed it for what it was and it was definitely deserving of those fourteen Oscar nominations and six wins It s really the only film that actually made me want to start singing and dancing at the end of it Too bad it got Steve Harvey d,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3651281/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2017,Never expected to love a MUSICAL this much,When I first heard about La La Land a musical film directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling well the first impression was mixed Although Damien Chazelle convinced me with Whiplash It an was excellent film about jazz what I m not big fan of It was truly a thrilling experience and my arms and body were shaking at the final act and JK Simmons performance was just well as good as everyone says it is But now La La Land If I have to choose my least favorite genre of movies that would be musicals by far When all the praise and hype met my ears I even at that moment was ready to judge the film to be again an overrated Oscar bait film that is not that great at all But it was directed by Chazelle and it stars two actors who I like I decided to give it a shot I went to see it in 15th of January hoping the best and fearing the worst And it crushed my careful expectations to little pieces Ryan Gosling is now becoming for a little by little one of my favorite actors He is not that type who s just sticking the same role from a movie to movie He can sing for an normal actor he can act he can do believable performances in romantic flicks like this and in for example dark crime movies like Drive He nailed it as a jazz pianist But true star is Emma Stone Her character is not an original Not even close But Stone blows so much fresh air to a very typical young woman who is dreaming being actress but the auditions are not going very well She makes her character likable and more than that she translates her to almost real life person with you can sympathize Gosling does great job but Stone is the true star with her Oscar worthy work in this film Kind afunny that there was only two true characters to follow The others were just side characters who were there just to push the main two s stories forward Cinematocraphy is one of the best I ve ever seen There were plenty of scenes that left me just wondering how could the do that It follows the characters and leaves free space to them letting them express their feelings patiently Chazelle droves Los Angeles a picture of true colorful dreamworld that takes you to the 2 hour unforgettable experience I loved the whole movie The opening was nicely shot songs were memorable and ending is not a typical one All editing sound etc were top notch Films story is pretty much typical but in my opinion this film is not about the story It is for the ones who dream It deserves all that praise and is joining club of my favorite movies And I don t like musicals at all I can t force you to like this film but I recommend it to everyone Give it a shot I gave and I am so happy about that 10 10 Sorry for my English not my mother tongue,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625679/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,La La Land Review,While following their dreams in Los Angeles an aspiring actress and jazz club owner fall in love I do not have a whole lot of experience with musicals most of what I ve seen have been animated That being said I do enjoy what I ve seen and this film was extremely well done Damien Chazelle is an incredible director and this film shows why The movie does an incredible job of making a modern musical that pays homage to classic cinema The visuals are phenomenal and have some amazing dream like musical scenes Emma Stone gives easily her best performance and Ryan Gosling does an amazing job as well The two have extremely good chemistry that really make you buy into their characters and their relationship My favourite part about this film is the message This is definitely a love story and a musical but those elements are not necessarily the focus This film is about following your dreams and what can happen when you don t give up on them It shows that you ll have to go through some rough patches and have to endure some struggles but in the end you ll be glad you didn t give up I ve really been trying to think of gripes and I honestly can t think of any this movie incredible Amazing script incredible acting and phenomenal direction makes for an awesome movie A 9 5 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8157456/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2018,Amazed,Being a working class hairy bottomed meat eating and somewhat a stereotypical male Neanderthal I was blown away by this film I was encouraged forced to watch by my daughter and from the get go was fascinated by the use of colour and although this film is contemporary it has the feel of the great musicals of yesteryear I loved the use of cars from several decades mixed with clothing and film studio backgrounds scenery to give the impression that the film is set in one of several decades The acting is superb and dispite my cynicism the music is well crafted and again crosses the decades in composition and feel Can t say anything negative about this film and for all those like myself who would rather nail a leg to a church pew on Easter Sunday than watch a chick flick Musical Just watch it and between the soundtrack visuals and Emma Stone s hypnotic beauty you ll be sold you may not want to admit it but you ll be humming that tune for weeks The best thing I ve seen in years with a superb ending I m off to take a flower arranging course as I am now in touch with my Feminine side,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4206347/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2017,sparkle,La La Land is pure entertainment I am not a fan of musicals is a mantra of mine and while I did not exactly have a Damascene conversion here I was drawn in by the sincerity of the mission the scale of the production and most of all by Emma Stone s moving complex performance Her comedy is spot on in the auditions where she is given some wonderfully awful line readings But the next moment she is brittle and vulnerable and the switch and range is quite brilliant Gosling struggles to match her achieving pass marks rather than a gold star performance The ending is a masterclass in visual storytelling an extended sequence that plays out without dialogue and will resonate with anyone who has wondered about two diverging paths in a forest and what lay down the one we chose not to take La La Land is escapism Hollywood fairy tale at its best The clue is in the title of course Give yourself over to it and you will not be disappointed,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3664588/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,Nowhere near as bad as you might think,In the interest of not exposing the spoilers this review will only focus on the existentialism of what it means to be a musical Hollywood loves Hollywood And I never want you to talk to me again I mean it dude La La Land is not a whiplash but we do get to see J K Simmons pushing his Oscar This is a musical albeit a minor one because neither of the leads can really sing or dance Then again acting Emma Stone is so cute and adorable she makes you want to shrink her up and swallow her up in a gelcap Ryan Gosling peace be with you consistently struggles to appear absent of his psychopathic tendencies A musical should be musical I love jazz And this movie is about hating jazz If you want to learn jazz explore jazz appreciate jazz try Round Midnight instead Dexter Gordon will see you through My mom once said Never EVER talk to me again I wonder whether that should have had three exclamation points I hope that La La Land never EVER pretends again to be what it is not a great movie It s a fine film Nothing more and nothing less If you find solace in this melange and pastiche I have a dictionary just waiting for you,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619011/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2023,Enjoyable,I don t have the OMG Reaction to this film which it seems that many did but I do enjoy it I appreciate the aspirations and dedication of the central characters even though I have none of them I unlike most people I meet am a second generation native Californian and have never thought of my lovely state as the escalator to fame and fortune it s just a place where people live I know with certainty that most residents just want a job which will let them support their families and a chance to have some fun on the weekend They have no show biz ambitions We can be thankful that Stone and Gosling DID have those ambitions as they are truly excellent entertainers I m not as familiar with him as her but I think they re very well matched in this film I love good actors who also can dance,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9409098/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2018,Worst movie ever!!!!,I don t understand why this movie got so many awards This was one of the worst musicals in the history of worst musicals The music was terrible and the plot was confusing I had a headache after the first 2 songs I will never be watching this movie again,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4141563/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2018,"Overrated ""Musical""",What can I say about this film that hasn t already been said This was advertised as a musical but just comes off as dry There are only a few good musical parts like the dance scene between Gosling and Stone It starts out strong with the freeway song and dance but only goes down from there The plot well there really doesn t seem to be much of a plot It s a love story but ultimately ends up not being about the love story It really is all over the place Plus how many times do I have to hear one song throughout the film It s like watching Grease but they play Grease lightening five times City of stars yeah we got it I hate trash this movie because I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone but what a disappointment of a film,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4179963/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2018,A love letter to Los Angeles,These movie has been reviewed from a dozen angles but I want to highlight the Los Angeles aspect New York has had a number of movies made about it that have the city as a central character but while LA of course has had many movies set in it few of those are love letters movies that revel in the appearance of the city and want to display it to best effect Till now my favorite example of the genre has been LA Story but La La Land is an even more beautiful version of the same idea an on going attempt to highlight different parts of LA and to show them all under the most gorgeous possible conditions If you live in the city it s a treat to try to figure out each location So that s my recommendation If you want to see a movie that does LA proud that shows how lovely the city can be watch this The only shame is that there so many additional locations that could have been added but weren t,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4201255/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2017,Gateway musical for teens and up,WHAT S LA LA LAND ABOUT An aspiring actress and a struggling jazz musician fall in love and inspire each other artistically IS IT ANY GOOD GRADE A Featuring truly dazzling film making and strong performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling La La Land is an enchanting blend of modern and retro Taking place in present day Los Angeles but made in the style of classic Hollywood musicals it s a delight The leads are merely passable as vocalists but strong as actors and dancers Their undeniable chemistry combined with the sensibilities of writer director Damien Chazelle who places one foot in bittersweet reality and the other in whimsical fantasy make for an unforgettable cinematic experience The songs choreography wardrobe production design editing and cinematography are top shelf It could use a bit tighter pacing and the ending may divide some audiences I thought it was beautiful but this unconventional love story is a must see IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS La La Land is rated PG 13 It has one f word and a few moderate profanities along with two vulgar hand gestures Swimsuits and dresses reveal legs abdomens and mild cleavage frankly it s no more revealing than what s shown in old Gene Kelly movies if you go back and re watch them There s some drinking at Hollywood parties Some couples dance sensually in the background but it s not raunchy or explicit A man and woman kiss and live together we see them cuddling fully clothed in bed There is no sexuality ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES Be grateful for the people who inspire you Pursue your dreams with tenacity and integrity The direction your life takes hinges on the decisions you make choose wisely Surround yourself with people who believe in you but also hold you accountable,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631876/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,To the Foolish Dreamers,It s surprising how Damien Chazelle was able to present two completely opposite movies about dream chasers Whiplash La La Land A product with strong saturation and personal style substantial and resonating characters adds on to a heartwarming story of two foolish dreamers Most importantly all the songs and jazz elements in the movie makes it even more unique than other romantic films References to musicals from 1940 combined with the buildings of LA creates dreamlike dances failures of the two protagonists and the collapse of their relationship career presents the edge of reality s coldness La La Land was able to handle all its components and take balance which makes the scandal of Oscar s Best Picture understandable,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7060945/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2017,just feel Hollywood,La La Land reignites a fire that has been lost from a Hollywood that is so focused on relaunches and reboots It s refreshing to see a totally unique film especially one that grasps the nature of Hollywood and Los Angeles in such an unconventional way The singing the dancing and cinematography move in perfect concert to give the appearance of something larger than life The long musical sequences often border on the surreal taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers in the clouds and in the stars Yet at times the pacing of the film seems to trail off to a point of being boring this is quickly remedied but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing Watching La La Land is like being awake during a wondrous dream there is something unique and magical about the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian as well as the visuals of Los Angeles that surround them As he sits at his piano Sebastian sweetly and softly sings Mia a love song a powerful couple of lines that represent love art and life City of Stars are you shining just for me City of Stars there so much that I can see Who knows is this the start of something wonderful and new Or one more dream that I cannot make true With La La Land a dream has come true and made its way onto the big screen,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3776099/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,Magic that only celluloid could deliver,La La Land is a pinch of heart touching reality draped in a croissant of sweet fantasy with a flavor of jazz and the 60s The film reaches deep as it explores the intensity and authenticity of one s pursuit of dreams etching them in a technicolorish yet surrealistic canvas However it blurts out a squeeze of reality that chasing one s dreams no matter how authentic they seem may not be the perfect path to happiness Dreams after all are visions of what we haven t yet achieved they rarely take us places where we already are blessed The film surrounds an idyllic relationship between a Jazz Pianist and a wannabe Actress which derives fuel from the individual passions of one another Gosling is great in his typical shy away from lens yet intense Scorpio ish style but Emma is stupendous Her charm and vividness is the heart and soul of this film The chemistry is bang on and exudes undercurrents of bleak and innocent adolescence The cinematographer has exploited the moods of viewers with exuberant use of colors The hilltop dance sequence vividly reminds of Singin in the Rain and shall definitely be remembered as a classic in the years to come Some realists may find it a tad too frivolous with frills ribbons and unicorns but dreamers prepare for a beautiful ride The best of 2016 period P S JK Simmons still scares the crap outta me please keep him away from musical things,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616512/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2017,very ordinary movie,The movie was very normal i don t know why there was so much propaganda about it I was completely shocked when Emma Stone won that Oscar her acting can t even get her a plastic award Ryan Gosling was good Emma was good but not an Oscar come on are they blind or something I wasn t really excited when i was watching the movie,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3709481/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,Beautifully executed musical.,I think I liked this film more than I did whiplash I normally don t like musicals either But this film is the exception It is gorgeous to look at It is a story of young love and how a couple realistically can fall in love Ryan Gosling plays a keyboardist musician who falls in love with an up and coming actress played by Emma Stone What follows is alot of miscommunication which affects their personal relationships as they struggle through the ups and downs of life Beautiful sad and bittersweet I wanted to see more when it ended,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6695541/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2018,"It was supposed to have great music but, it falls a little short",Since this movie won two Academy Awards and two Golden Globes for the music I expected to be devastated by the musical score Musically it has some nice songs but it did not come close to The Holiday Rocky Secretariat Superman Wonder Woman and I could name many more It was more on the order of Moulin Rouge but even there musically it still fell very far short Story wise it left more than a lot to be desired First the ending is more like a David Lynch movie and leaves one wondering where the dream ends and the reality is That is not a major negative but it is a little annoying Then of course there is a lot of the story left out near the end so it again leaves one wondering if this is reality how did we get here I wanted to see the rest of the story that was left out near the end Then of course the ending is not motivational rather it is more realistic and the movie sets us up for something magical that we were hoping to be wonderful In other words the ending is a let down from the direction the movie was heading,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4123372/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2018,most overrated movie of all time !!,I heard about this movie from many people and friends a mix of positive and negative thoughts so I decided to watch it and make my own judgement after I saw it I was really shocked I think this movie deserves only 3 stars for only 3 thing nothing more 1 Ryan Gosling act was perfect I think he was so comfortable with good voice unlike Emma Stone she had the most annoying act 2 the camera work and the colors was so good 3 the music was good although I am not a big fan of jazz but i like the whole music scene but the rest of it was so boring to death nothing new nothing convinced me that this movie deserve 6 oscar and I believe Emma stone she must win a razzie award for her performance and for her terrible voice overrated 3 10,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4276104/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2019,Good story,I will be up front about the fact that I watched this for Emma Stone I m not a musical or jazz fan so I can t comment onthat However the story is fine In fact it s good I don t see why people have an issue with the ending It s a realistic ending I m sure that this kind of situation is not uncommon in reality and the main characters seemed to be mature enough to be positive about it Ending aside the course of the story is engaging enough the various ongoings as the characters take different positions on the pursuit of career as time evolves I don t get why people have a problem with the story or the ending,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4712187/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2017,A good mix of classic and modern cinema,Good music good cinematography good choreography good acting What can I say that hasn t been said already I think this is one of the better modern musicals and I m not a big fan of the genre The way this movie is done is what really makes it good There are many excellent long scenes Someone will start dancing and the entire lighting of the set will change and the camera will move into close up to medium to panorama and to close up again in the same take That s pretty impressive I enjoyed the visuals The blue and purple night skies are stunning and they did a good job with the timing so you could get those nice skies in the background One of the best things about it is how the characters describe Jazz music That was very well written You understand perfectly why Jazz can mean so much to someone There s a portion in the movie that drags a bit and loses some pace And there were some moments I thought were repetitive But otherwise I had a good time with it There s good comedy here too and I thought the mix of classic and modern cinema made this movie pretty great I get why this has gotten so many awards and it will deserve some of them But I do think Silence could have gotten at least one more nomination,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3632442/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2017,My Kind of Musical,Im not the biggest musical fan but this movie absolutely blew me away So i have 4 major reasons why i absolutely loved this to its core 1 this movie looks so visually flawless the cinematographer and director obviously understood each other perfectly in the making of this film Each scene was breath taking to my eyes and even to the point of goosebumps for me the vision of the city during the night time was incredible and something i noticed which may be wrong but the constant slight nudges of stars throughout the whole movie was pretty awesome to me visually breath taking 2 The characters were so well written that from the moment we are introduced to them i was curious and my curiosities were all satisfied within the limits of this film i felt myself growing with them and could even relate to them in many parts from ryan goslings obsession over his favorite thing in life to emma stones dreams of being an actress very relatable and extremely well acted by both gosling and stone 3 I supported everything this movie stood for which was a love encouragement letter to any dreamer in the world that are having a tough time making there dreams a reality and finally 4 the ending of this movie was absolutely PERFECT in every way though i say it is not exactly original it is exactly the ending that this movie needed to seal the deal I love this movie cause it was perfect to me The movie itself had more impact on me then the musicality to it although I am also obsessed with the music currently Any movie goer even if you do not like musicals should check this out because even you don t like the music the story is so brilliantly told and you will fall in love with the characters just go see it NOW,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3619321/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2020,I love movie musicals but HATED this,I was sooo excited for this to movie to finally hit Netflix and even paused the movie after the opening number just to tell my boyfriend that I was sure I was going to love it Maybe my expectations were set too high but overall the movie was huge disappointment The dancing is very stiff which I first thought was endearing and part of their characters until I noticed there was no positive progression The Sebastian storyline with Jazz references was not so much offensive at least not to me but just not believable The musical numbers didn t add much to the storyline I didn t get invested into the character s background or development The only thing I liked was that the story seemed to be about young lovers letting each other go in order to fulfill their individual dreams but that could have been portrayed better I m honestly not sure why his movie is rated this high except for one catchy song,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5887794/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2017,Painfully and shamefully average,Having waited a year since its original release before I finally saw it meant that I could watch it without the typical Oscars hype that surrounded it And frankly I just don t get what the hype was all about The story is a somewhat muddled tale of a struggling actress and a jazz musician who fall in love though they struggle to keep things together as they chase their dreams Now a plain story like this can usually be dressed up in a musical with flashy singing and dancing neither of which are present here The songs are repetitive as it turns out that listening to the exact same chord progression repeated for two hours can become a bit tedious and Stone and Gosling s singing in the shower warbles certainly didn t dazzle this viewer In fact their restrained musical performances are an embarrassment to the resplendent costumes and sets that surround them What s worst however is that its potential did shine through There are two or three dramatic scenes between Stone and Gosling that are so well written and brilliantly acted they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest It s not a bad film by any standards just very painfully and shamefully average Finally I watch enough Strictly Come Dancing to be irked by the poor shaping of Emma Stone s hands during her final musical number with Ryan Gosling But that s being quite picky isn t it,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3873793/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2021,An Excellent Musical,Typically I m not that big of a fan of musicals The issue I tend to have with them is that there are too many songs and too little character and story development I m aware that a lot of that development tends to come through the songs but when it doesn t it can leave a lot of musicals to feel undercooked in my opinion Thankfully this film completely fixes that issue and then some with fantastically written lead characters and songs that brilliantly further their motivations Not only are the songs great on their own but they re also fantastic within the context of the scenes they are in The lead performances are both strong perhaps not quite Oscar worthy but still really good and both of the characters feel relatable in their own way As with all good romantic films I could understand where each of them were coming from during their arguments throughout the film and it makes the dialogue a lot more interesting Chazelle is still phenomenal behind the camera the visuals here are just fantastic and really help to craft the vibrant world of the film The musical score is great the ending is outstanding the only issue I had was that sometimes I had trouble hearing all of the lyrics of the songs over the instrumentals particularly for the first two songs As for the La La Land vs Moonlight debate whilst Moonlight might be the better made film if you had to ask me to rewatch either this or Moonlight tonight I would choose this Overall this is a fantastic musical and another excellent addition into Damien Chazelle s filmography,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6653605/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2017,Colors and music,By no means is a movie people will talk for a long time I couldn t see immediately so I have already heard too much Several awards but people saying to be a little disappointed So I went with less expectations and therefore I enjoyed it It seems like a simple line but at the same time underneath is the human comedy and tragedy The cinematography is beautiful like entering in other world colors and wardrobe are fantastic I love Jazz therefore I did enjoyed the music is extraordinary and luring I read critics against the musical capability of actors but I found it authentic In some numbers is just gorgeous I am not sure how to judge acting but I guess it convinced me once you accept the premises of the film so fair enough for me Emma is not the most beautiful actress but is so attractive particularly her smile Not spoilers but I expected a different finale but perhaps this way of twisting is what make the movie even more controversial Go with no expectations and judge it yourself,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3644753/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2017,A Nice Feel Good Film,Wasn t quit sure what to make of it when I saw the trailer but I have say it s a film that actually pleasantly surprised me Basically it s nice feel good film which had the feel of a Hollywood musical from the 1950s didn t have the same impact but I guess they were trying to give it modern day look which didn t quite work but for me is still a decent film that has your foot tapping at times during the musical numbers Started off well with a grand opening but I felt a bit flat in the middle but ended on a high although the ending felt a bit bittersweet Normally not that keen on Ryan Gosling but he actually surprised me in this film he does have some acting talent after all Emma Stone as usual just seems to light up the screen with her presence and played off well against Gosling If you wanting a film that offers you an alternative to bloods guts guns and swearing this is for you Will have you singing to yourself as you leave the cinema I am a sucker for a musical,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3622876/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2017,The only movie that brought me into it in 2016,La La Land is just on show in China today I heard that it is a movie about romantic love and music so I decided to go for it with my girlfriend Beyond my imagination it comes to an sad ending so sad that made me cry In LA the city full of dream is not just like everyone dreamed Many people lose themselves forgive their original intention I have seen lots of movies in 2016 it is a truth that Hollywood is getting worse La La Land is the only film that bring me in I could get the feeling of Mia when she cries I cry When she smiles I smile Music and Dance are really great things in the world The movie also reminds me that I should do what I really like If you love music then just do it If you like movies then just go for it Don t think too much about the final result Even you are a successful man with an unhappy job it won t make you feel any sense of achievement Following myself would be the most charming part of me I also read love from the movie The two persons just like having special chemical reaction with each other They are getting better and better while staying with each other This is exactly the kind of love that I want to have And I wish the love I have is the very kind of love I don t love her rich or success but her full passion and enthusiasm about life There are many versions of our life any single tiny decision could lead to a total different one and this is called Butterfly Effect I hope my love and I could go through the obstacles together one by one stronger and stronger during which we are getting better and better selves as well Happy Valentine s Day at last to you my love,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3639715/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2018,City of Dreamers,A love letter to L A I just now realized the title pun yep that vilified city where half its population are sure they ll make it and often get ridiculed for it The tagline Here s to the fools who dream can t get any clearer L A might or might not be a city of dreams but it s most definitely a city of dreamers La La Land makes sure all the landmarks shine bright The Griggith Observatory the Watts Towers Long Beach Hermosa Beach Vine Street all the cafes the boulevards the jazz clubs the convertible cars the movie sets all of this places and the highway are memorable even for someone like me who has never set foot in any of them The city is more than just a setting but it obviously needs a couple of dreamers because after all it wouldn t be anything without its fools We have a jazz revivalist and an aspiring actress working as a waitress which has to be the oldest clich in the book It makes sense tough revitalizing an old fashioned character is a statement on how the simple story isn t only enough it s everything Dreamers dream their dreams today as they did a hundred years ago and the world getting worryingly cynical give all the more reason for romantic spirits to speak up La La Land doesn t just speak up it shouts at full lung its passion for the oldie golden days it s a burst of unstoppable romantic emotion that leaves you shaken stunned flurried It s loud very loud like 2001 s Moulin Rouge on colorful steroids It commands its audience to be taken higher and higher and although it has the confidence and power to make such demands I personally felt exhausted and kind of relieved it was finally over I m a fool for this kind of thing and I appreciate the nostalgic yearning for simpler times for soulful music dressed up men and women in summer dresses I can smile at two hands touching for the first time and I can admire the technical prowess of light color music editing and costumes I can also cringe at some musical numbers over staged apartments preposterous coincidences try hard manipulations and worn out clich s I appreciate the light but without getting blinded by it,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4036190/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2017,One of the greatest films I have ever seen!!!!,La La Land is a joy to watch from beginning to end I mean it is truly a love story to old school Hollywood and theater musicals From the singing to the dancing and to the love story that goes throughout it The film was really so much fun to see play out on the big screen I am really glad I got see this movie La La Land stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling who both have dreams they wish to accomplish in life One wants to own a jazz club and the other desires to be a Hollywood actress They each push one another with all there might to help the other succeed at making there dreams come true While also finding solace in one another as well The film combines the modern day idea of dreaming with the older style of it in a very well done way Showing both the realities of being Los Angeles and the more glamorized version of Los Angeles as well This makes for a more enjoyable experience when you come out the theater Overall La La Land is a film I would highly recommend people check out There is a lot of great fun here and a lot of enjoyment in it as well,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618727/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2017,"Watchable, if you can sit through the first half",This is only the third Hollywood musical I have seen after High School Musical and Les Miserables While the former was crap the latter was a masterpiece but the commonality between the two movies was that they were coherent within themselves That s what was missing in La La Land for the first half at least It s a good movie overall with beyond brilliant second half but only if you are able to survive the first half Story 7 10 Two people keep bumping into each other on various occasions and eventually fall for each other only to realize that their professional success will come at the cost of their love life Incidentally none of them are dishonest but the circumstances bring them at a juncture where they have to pick one The story is written on a very strong plot but as it gets into the details it starts falling apart LA was a near perfect location to base this story with Ryan Gosling portraying a struggling musician a Jazz enthusiast and Emma Stone projecting an aspiring actress with a day job at a coffee shop The build up of their love affair is totally unconvincing As far as the first half goes the scenes do not have much connect between them and the music pieces are abrupt Just because you have a musical doesn t mean you need to have a song every 2 minutes This movie would have been much better without the musical piece However it is the second half where the movie gets far better The scenes are well thought and the music pieces especially City of Stars and The Fools Who Dream are very profound and apt to the situation Acting 8 10 Ryan Gosling might have squeezed every little drop of his charm into this movie but he came across as a far stronger actor than his counterpart Emma Stone While the roles weren t so challenging the two have been good enough individually However for me the chemistry was somewhat missing between the two actors I could totally see Jennifer Lawrence in Mia s role instead Apart from these two none of the other actors have received much screen time to create any impact Music 8 10 The film rides on quite a strong music and lyrics It looks a little unnecessary and too much in the first half except for Another Day of Sun which was quite perfect to set the tone of the movie as well as get the audience into an LA mood However some of the songs like City of Stars Epilogue and The Fools Who Dream are so good that you can listen to them on repeat mode Direction 7 10 Damien Chazelle probably took a little too much into his plate with story writing direction as well as lyrics While I love the way he steered the movie in the second half it is the first half where the movie is all over the place and very confusing The build up of the story is pretty vague The scenes are very much incoherent and an unconvincing However the later part of the movie is good I loved the choice of climax especially the last scene with a rewind sequence which was very unconventional Full marks to the director for that Overall 7 10 Overall it s a watchable movie if you can sit through the first half,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3612337/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2017,This is LA.,I really like LA which is the stage of this movie but I m not satisfied with the way to end the story actually However we can also say that it s a typical love story through musical To put it simply it also shows us our real issues of what we have to think about what our important and valuable thing is I think this is the most difficult issue which everyone faces The jazz music in it is especially comfortable to listen to It makes me play the saxophone or the piano again since I was a junior high school student Also it s private but I d been in LA for a year until last summer and I like Los Angeles very much as I mentioned above So I really feel nostalgic Griffith Observatory and even the traffic in this movie I guess anyone who watches it will want to go to LA It s a very nice city,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3776537/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2017,"Solid movie-making, excellent performances, and ""real"" music!",Opening scene stalled traffic A Los Angeles freeway at the dreaded standstill Every car blasting a different aural vibe What next Road rage Coughing fits Valium popping Instead you get the voice of one driver smooth as honey singing loud and clear She climbs out of her car and starts to dance Soon everyone is out of their cars singing dancing skateboarding on the Jersey barrier In other words once traffic starts again you re in for a different kind of movie ride That s a joyful suspension of disbelief moment there true to the conventions of the movie musical West Side Story is the only movie I ve ever seen multiple times in the theater each time wishing hoping praying that when Chino appears at the end with his gun he d bring along some different outcome I recall a youthful knucklehead dismissing the film as unrealistic Yeah right You either go with it you don t In the case of La La Land I did and hope you will Writer director Damien Chazelle has put together a film in which each musical number grows organically from the action on screen The music is more than just pleasant with some memorable tunes Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are excellent in the leads roles and effective songsters for the style of their numbers The dancing seems mostly theirs too And they really sell it Two strivers want to make it in tinseltown he as a jazz pianist she as an actress Will they reach their dreams Will their relationship survive the journey It may be a ride you ve taken before but it s a smooth one And according to Variety s Owen Gleiberman it s a filmmaking trifecta it hooks the heart the eye and the mind that he says is even better when viewed the second time around,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3612565/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2019,"La La La La La La La La Land means, I love you?",From the director that gave us in my opinion 2015 s Best Picture winner Whiplash comes another movie about music and trying to make it to the big league What happens when a struggling jazz pianist keeps bumping into a struggling actress around LA You get La La Land A musical that heavily borrows from it s predecessors will always render two questions first will it be reminiscent of how musicals were done back in the day and second does it measure up to the classics The answer to the first one is yes from the singing to the dancing the costumes the lighting etc As for the next question only time will tell The movie s strongest point is Ryan Gosling He skipped playing the Beast in the live adaptation of Beauty and the Beast for this coincidentally enough Emma Watson chose to play Belle instead of playing Emma Stone s character He s a singer and dancer thanks to the Mickey Mouse club and a very good actor I ve also seen the Notebook and in both movies he serves up that Gosling charm many find irresistible On the other hand I remember watching Birdman where I said Emma Stone will go places once she gets more serious roles Fast forward to today and her first Best Actress Oscar award She s good when she s on but sometimes her acting can still boil down to Easy A level Her best scene was the surprise dinner date and her weakest was that improvisation between her and Gosling when the latter was asking her to try auditioning again As for the direction it feels the movie wasn t handled as meticulously as Whiplash but minus the minor lapses the nomination of Damien Chazelle is well deserved,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5168544/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2018,Hugely disappointing,I only got half way through this film so I can t give an overall opinion however what I saw was very dull I never turn off halfway through I wasn t overly fussed about watching in the first place but due to the hype and reviews I decided to give it a go The songs were not catchy at all you can barely understand the lyrics The beginning was also very drawn out and had a very bland storyline so much so I could not put myself through it anymore and didn t care about how it ended How this gets more than the greatest showman is beyond me,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4328166/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2018,La La Land of Extremes,I liked La La Land A throwback to movies about people relationships and the serendipity that leads to relationships As I read the reviews of others though it seems like people either were enraptured with love or possessed of hate towards it I see this in may other reviews on the site This was not the best movie I ve ever seen but I like to see a movie like this once in a while that takes us back to an earlier time Sentimental yes But I like how the movie lifted the viewer into this fantasy where the shallow world of Hollywood meets the simple sweetness of two people in love The music and dance added to the overall sense of fun and helped portray the ups and downs of a blossoming relationship Wait for the right mood be open and ready for a sweet story and you ll like La La Land,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4141806/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,Extraordinary.. a milestone achievement in Hollywood,La la land craziness overloaded with music mesmerising us till end THE DIRECTOR gave a love story letter via Ryan and Emma through their amazing and marvellous unforgettable memory of love with an ending that gave u a warm feel and woth a few drops shedding in that letterand he succeeded in wat he was going to say An another milestone in Daniel chazelle career after giving such a effective Whiplash all of a sudden a new way of movie that too a musical romantic and sure the jazz worked too good for oscars and no matter u can still wonder it got 6 oscars actually i wish extra 1 or 2 might be good Emma gave us too good performance and Ryan also killed it and wish he was too close to oscar but as a whole its fine bcz Ryan is more than precious for award The way director narrated the story each and every line and in scene he killed it to extreme amazingly the music the main pillar of this musical romantic movie as we can cay its a new way of playing the love From the 1st scene how they met how they fall in love to the last the dreaming about jazz love and actually wat happend but what the audience as well the lovers thought were clearly described The last 15 mins of the movie nearly made shed tears out the eye with a worthy heart robbing experience,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5904292/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,A future classic.,My aunt used to live in Paris I remember when she used to come home and tell us these stories about being abroad And I remember she told us once that she jumped into the river once Barefoot She smiled 90 100 Probably the thing that made me want to revisit this film resided in the fact that I took my leave of it as soon as I finished watching it for the first time Unhesitatingly of course this picture s great me and my 2016 self share the feeling but I wanted to deepen this fondness even more What I found The exact same feeling but this time around I can actually express it What I think makes this picture work so dynamically might surprise some but that subtle camp like feeling that displays the purpose of paying a certain tribute to the golden age musicals made me forget about the usual nonsense a film like this conducts I regrettably found some tiny decisions in its screenplay editing and overall cinematography that I didn t enjoy as much this time around For example and this actually might just show my own pettiness but the aspect ratio of the film in several scenes didn t attain the story s potential It felt like the perfect moment for Chazelle to experiment a little with some shots and scenes Things like these might seem unnecessary and even a faintly exasperating to point out but for me the film would ve worked MILES better if these were even taken into consideration Even with some of the drawbacks I felt with it I can t deny that the stament some people have made that being the feeling of having this film to be the only musical from this century to feel comparable to the all time classics feels even more resonant these days A movie that might just get even better with its future remasters and special editions which fingers crossed might actually fix its own flemishes,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7507660/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2017,True they can't sing or dance - but does that has to be the soul of a musical?,La La Land I was seriously in suspicion about it I m not very much into Musicals apart from The Sound of Music and Singing in the Rain but both Emma and Ryan stole the picture The movie isn t about dancing or singing well It is about the land of dreams wich could be L A or your neighborhood it just puts more pressure into them since it is L A To me this movie is about two young people still very attached to their childhood dream and struggling to keep it afloat while everyone asks them to grow up What s beautiful to me heart clinging beautiful is that they believe in each other so much They help the other get there but it is a lonely road out there Its tribute to jazz and is also touching so both characters have really solid dreams and both are being dragged away from them for failure and background noise pressure Though none of them can sing or dance so well I don t think that was the point It wasn t supposed to be flawless I believe this movie wants to keep it real You may feel like you re walking on clouds but you re not such a good dancer and there s some tenderness in being kind of clumsy I believe it is intentional The love between Mia and Sebastian is easy to believe it is respectful and tender and inspiring Either romantically or not everyone should have a Mia or a Sebastian in his life to help us and motivate us when doors slam on our face I absolutely loved the ending which in my opinion consolidates it as a modern day love story,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3622699/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2016,"""Here's to the fools who dream....""",When I was finished watching the first song of the movie I know I am going to like it La La Land made me smile all the way till the end It is well written well scored well directed or should I say choreographed It was like that Damien Chazelle succeeded to do exactly what he had in mind I laughed and I sighed like a 14 year old schoolgirl I am still hearing those songs as I am writing this 2 hours after I watched it The performers have done a great job I like Emma Stone but was not a fan of Ryan Gosling Now I definitely am Both of them gave a phenomenal performance Everything in this film it just fits But what will sweep you off your feet are the songs 2 songs in particular City of Stars and Fools who dream For me these two are going to be the top two songs in the playlist I will recommend it to all of them who liked Whiplash those who love musicals and even those who would want to watch just a romantic flick,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3599169/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2017,Lots of emotions with a real smooth camera movement where you feel inside the movie,The first minute of the movie you feel that the camera is moving like it does in a normal horror movies final destination but astonishingly the movement of the camera continues to be so smooth until the end of the movie simply you get the feeling that you are a part of the movie as if you are inside the Story As for the music I really can t explain the amount of emotions you get during the different moments of the characters The flashback that was used in different occasions was very subtle especially the last scene of the movie where we see the unexpected reunion between the two main characters I say reunion only from the abstract point of view as Sebastian started recalling all the main incidents that happened between him and Mia but the flashback was very different for this scene as he started thinking about the what if this was a real more than heartbreaking moment and a perfect ending for this movie In fact this last flashback wasn t only going in Sebastian s mind but also inside Mia s mind In a nutshell the movie is full of emotions acting skills and nice music for the real lovers of Jazz For me the camera was the main character of this movie When you go to the Cinema just try to relax and leave yourself to the story line and you will enjoy a lot,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628177/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2017,What is all the fuss about?,I don t understand what all the fuss is about this film Maybe it appeals to a generation that has never seen a decent musical before It has one good song the one that keeps playing on the radio here and that s it Emma Stone is not a particularly strong singer and Ryan Gosling is in the same league as Rex Harrison Although they can both dance pretty well every extra on the screen dances better The choreography is mundane and the transitions into song and dance often feel completely forced However if this marks the start of a new golden age of musicals with a new generation of stars who can actually sing and dance then bring it on,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3636487/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2017,"I really, really wanted to like this",I loved the leads but was sadly disappointed in the film The songs were just okay nothing to write home about The dancing was just okay The singing was awful The whole time I kept thinking this will pick up and get better in a little while It never did It was 2 hours and 8 minutes That s way too long for a musical with such a weak script and mediocre songs The film was about two people who want to be in the entertainment business who meet and have a connection after about three tries I was looking so forward to seeing this and maybe I built it up too much in my mind and by ALL the hype at awards time I just felt let down in the end and thought that s 2 08 hours of my life I ll never get back If you want to see it rent it at Redbox I realize this was not supposed to be a musical done by professional singers and dancers but I go to the movies to be WOWED not put to sleep I guess this movie really meant something to people in the industry and about their struggles in making it big but I am not one of those people I go to the movies to escape reality not be a part of it Hollywood should stop making movies about itself It s only interesting to those IN the industry not outside it,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3694052/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2017,Not a Love Letter to Hollywood. One to Reality,I guess I should say I didn t like Whiplash at all Or to be more precise it was a pretty interesting watch for anyone who s into music in general and jazz in particular But on the whole in my view a really thin piece of cinema But this one Didn t expect it from Chazelle but it s simply beautiful Not only is it a virtually perfect movie which carries you along all the way through while surprising at every turn to totally carry away at the end it s the most beautiful moving and genuine work I ve seen in some really serious while And as far as I m concerned somewhat misunderstood on the both sides of the barricade That is it has little to do with writing a love letter to Hollywood for which Hollywood seems to like it so much and so many other people seem to just as seriously hate it or to modern Hollywood at any rate while old Hollywood here should rather be read as a metaphor Nor is it supplemented with a forced or artsy finale another reason for this hate because it s not just a romantic story As far as I can see this movie is about so many other things as well It s about chance and fate personal happiness and personal integrity following signs and making your own choices freedom and responsibility It s about cause and effect dreams and reality About whether this reality is benignly indifferent or can be on your side About what it ultimately is And what it takes to find and walk your own path through it It s impeccably written immaculately executed and perfectly structured in dramatic terms The intonation is flawless no wrong notes Always organically dramatic never melodramatic Good performances especially Stone Don t quite remember the last time I saw such meaningful cuts Eisenstein would be proud And the last note does last when the show was through I somehow couldn t get away from the theater and roamed for hours in circles in the vicinity Then got back for no reason and just sat there in the lobby until they had to drive me out at night So the stuff stays with you to say the least Anyways if you haven t yet go and see it It s there It s cinema Not sure about Fellini s aerodromes but it looks like some of his random planes are still in the air Hooah And a piece of advice watch the credits up to the very end,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630137/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2017,Magical and Enchanting - Modern Day Musical,It s been a long time since I ve felt so invested in a movie I can go through romance films and like them sure but this one immerses you and makes you feel almost like you are part of it feeling all the emotions I really can t pinpoint what it is exactly but this movie tinkered with my feelings hardcore There s something magical about this movie I can also attest to say that I don t usually like musicals but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and like all the songs Admist the theatrical and creative style that carries this film this movie is real What I mean to say is that it resonates even though it may do things that escape the realm of reality I think that s why I love it so much You can relate to all the little feelings and actions these characters do I think they did a good job of setting the tone for this movie by introducing the characters and what they re passionate about This makes us understand them and root for them It s the driving force for the entire film We care about this movie because they re so passionate about something and it shows them pursue it despite the odds It s truly a beautiful admirable and difficult thing to do I think at the end of this film you learn some lessons that are open to interpretation but no matter what it is you do take away something from it I ve seen it twice in theaters already and plan on buying it when it comes out on DVD,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621436/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2023,Goofy love plot,Sorry but this just didn t get me excited The love plot had a cringe vibe from the get go and it elaborate into the worst throughout the movie Watched the film at home with my wifey and teenage daughter I think they found it amusing at some points for instance at one point my daughter said Dad dad you can t go get beer now this is the best scene in the movie which indicated she d seen it before Anyways I m an old rag and I can t get excited by a typical love musical like this is even though some of the scenery was neat LA style of course Also needless to say Emma Stone did a brilliant role and truly deserve the Oscar she was given in my humble opinion that is,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9186631/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2016,La La Land - review: Vibrant & Poignant,Damien Chazelle is a fantastic writer and director Chazelle has made two major movies that I know about Whiplash and La La Land both of these movies are absolutely fantastic and I ll definitely be looking forward to what Damien Chazelle does next La La Land is a good film but I won t be adding it to my favorite 2016 movies list However I would watch this thing again because I liked it I enjoyed a lot of what this movie had to offer but I just felt like some things fell short and it didn t reach its full potential La La Land Pros Cons Pros Ryan Gosling s performance was good Emma Stone s performance was good Ryan Gosling s Emma Stone s on screen chemistry was sensational The movie was charming The directing was masterfully crafted The color scheme was vibrant I enjoyed the old school film vibe and I thought it blended well with its modern setting The dance numbers were spectacularly choreographed A majority of the songs were pleasant touching and poignant Audition The Fools Who Dream The ending were the most poignant moments in the film Another Day of Sun Audition The Fools Who Dream and The Ending were my favorite dance numbers and scenes Life is difficult it s not easy to accomplish your goals and it s particularly difficult to accomplish things when the people around you are mostly intransigent Cons There were one too many coincidences throughout the film I felt like some scenes were just set up to bring certain circumstances into play Certain direction or execution of scene choices felt clich d There wasn t an exfoliating emphasis on the two main characters I knew what was to be expected before the film ended Particular moments during certain scenes felt obligatory Overall I really enjoyed La La Land for what it was It s a musical but it s also about never giving up on yourself We all have dreams and goals sometimes are dreams can seem overwhelming but it s important to never lose sight of what we truly want for ourselves and it s good to have someone that believes in you Final Grade B,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3600753/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2017,This is EVERYTHING!,And yes I really do mean EVERYTHING I have never been so influenced by any movie before It s a true masterpiece not only on acting level but on all levels I don t even know how to begin describing what I ve just seen and felt This really does have everything flawless acting brilliant script incredible cinematography For me it was its idea that grabbed me It is about dreams about life itself It shows how a single choice you make can change your whole life one wrong move and you will end up leading a life you actually hate One wrong choice and all you have ever dreamed of will stay just a dream And the other way around La La Land portrays the way dreams influence your life if you dare to follow them It simply shows how magically it feels to realize your dreams This movie makes you part of the dream of the magic the happiness the sadness everything You empathize with the characters every second of the 128 minutes Gradually you get more and more involved in this bliss and you don t want it to end Not only does this masterpiece inspire you but it also makes you think Rarely are there movies that are both meaningful and beautiful usually it s only one of these things It has inspired me to dream really dream and not be afraid of how big or unachievable the dream seems to be at first because this could prevent me from turning it into reality which is one of the best feelings in the world To sum up if you want to feel the magic of a true cinematic masterpiece GO SEE La La Land Go see Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling s brilliant acting the genius screenplay and the beautiful work of everyone involved in this movie Every second of it is sheer pleasure Personally I would be happy if one day I can say that I am a part of the La La Land generation the dreamers who follow their dreams at all cost and aren t afraid of failure I sincerely thank everyone involved in this movie for giving it to us Pure perfection,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625694/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2020,"Hollywood is Great, Isn't It?",If I could sum up this film briefly it would be that it is a modern recreation of what would be considered a classic Hollywood film stylistically All of the things that seem like cliches in this film are callbacks to the way those older films were made and it s mixed with modern techniques including long uninterrupted shots which help give this film an impressive visual flair that isn t paralleled very often La La Land even has the saturated look that technicolor films had back in the day It s a seamless blend of old and new and every technical aspect of La La Land is brilliantly executed The only downside to all of this is that the callbacks to old Hollywood and the nostalgic charm that it has can become a little annoying and distract from what s happening Of course it should be noted that this is a musical and I don t really have a taste for musicals so take that criticism with a grain of salt This is one of those rare occasions where both the leads match each other s charm and play off each other extremely well Ryan Gosling in particular is really good at portraying charming down to earth characters and that shines though magnificently here I still have trouble over the obsession with old jazz music though Sebastian s obsession with jazz is nothing I ve ever seen in a musician before where the only music that matters is a particular era of jazz music and jazz musicians and it comes off as incredibly silly and a little lazy as far as writing goes Also I don t believe there is much of a jazz scene in Los Angeles as there would be in New Orleans or New York so the obsession with jazz and it s non believability is compounded by the fact that he s in the wrong part of the country for that It s probably a small thing but it s the defining character trait for Sebastian for a good chunk of the film s run time and it hasn t stopped feeling out of place La La Land is a really good film and deserves its high praise For me the thing that bothers me about it the most is its self congratulatory attitude towards Los Angeles and Hollywood that comes off as being Oscar Bait and indeed it ended up being just that For me that s what hurts the film the most That said it s really good and extremely well executed It s a double edged sword but it s worth watching and re watching,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5800832/?ref_=tt_urv

A treat to the eyes and soul.,I m not really one for musicals but the story completely overpowered the genre of the film The trailer didn t excite me much but I was curious to know why it won SO many Golden Globes and besides it was directed and written by Damien Chazelle the same man who made Whiplash another film I was awed by I still have first screening frenzy but I ll try to look at this as clearly as I can This was not just a musical It is an honest and heartfelt film about dreamers a subject which is very relatable to us all Emma and Ryan are so cute and charismatic and it s lovely to see how their ambitions unfold and how one makes the other push forward and become someone more I don t think it s a love story but a story about the honesty and drive with which the characters dream However you do root for the two of them and the love story is beautiful to watch at parallel I was left speechless choked up by the end Wonderful writing music choreography cinematography that one take opening O O acting and direction Maybe I can t justify all the Oscars but it s definitely delightful refreshing and emotionally driven cinema Please go see it in a good theatre before it s gone,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3764610/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2016,"Yeah, more like Blah Blah Land amirite?",It s actually a bit shocking to see Damien Chazelle produce this masterpiece after having directed Whiplash which is arguably the best film of 2014 At this point I wouldn t be surprised if most audiences having watched La La Land feel that Gazelle s latest work is once again the best of the year It s perhaps redundant to say so but like Whiplash La La Land is musically intensive the difference being that while Whiplash was a grounded real world narrative centered around music La La Land is more so a musical in the classic sense Scenes taking place in a grounded narrative transition seamlessly into elaborately choreographed song and dance numbers which are a far cry from the intense jazz drama of Whiplash though jazz is prevalent in the score for this film The great thing about this film being so dramatically and stylistically different from Whiplash is that Chazelle takes full advantage of the format to elevate his musical far above its peers From the opening shot it s evident that every song and dance number has been carefully blocked and rehearsed resulting in the camera effortlessly navigating the halls and roadways of every scene and allowing the audience to fully soak in the talent on screen To speak of the talent on screen it s needless to say that all performances meet the standard of excellence that Chazelle set for himself and his actors during Whiplash Though the bouncy and fast paced tone doesn t always allow for the most profound character depth the emotions and nuances of those characters are on full display with each song dance and montage As far as those songs dances and montages are concerned that is perhaps where objectivity gets muddled for me While I enjoyed the music in this film greatly and appreciate the subtle variations on what seems to be the main theme I am fairly ignorant where music theory is concerned I honestly love the music in this film and would say that it s great but someone who is better versed in the field may have a different perspective The point is that if you don t like the music or don t think it s good then I m not sure what to say I think it s great but maybe it would be more appropriate to say that I really liked it The reason I liked the music beyond it being pleasurable to listen to is that it was utilized perfectly to emphasize the tone of every scene and give context to the emotional state of the characters The main theme is repeated several times to the point where some might be irritated with it s prevalence in the film That theme however changes subtly for each appearance creates different meanings for the characters and their relationships depending on those subtle changes This film is an absolute masterpiece and arguably surpasses Whiplash Hopefully in the near future Chazelle returns with yet another masterpiece to rival his latest,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3604152/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2021,Golden Age Cinema Set in the Modern Day,Scene Mia is out for dinner and bored she hears a familiar song glances meaningfully at the restaurant s TV then suddenly has an epiphany she d rather be at the theater with the blustering guy who introduced her to the tune The camera swirls and pans up to reveal her running into a beautiful moonlit tree arched street as the song hits its climax signaling the wonder and excitement of their coming date I ve watched La La Land a few times and could write paragraphs about why I love it But that scene to me encapsulates just how cinematic La La Land is the movie has perfect execution in layering music with beautiful cinematography This layering is then used to an extra dimension to each scene s interactions and emotions which is why the characters and their relationships feel so full despite the movie having very little dialogue and the characters themselves remaining mostly unnamed The experience is almost like watching a golden age movie like Spellbound with a modern day setting,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7477798/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2017,We left the movies after 31 minutes and 12 seconds....,OK we re not so down with the movies but we expected to see a combination of Marry Poppins and the Diary after seeing all the reviews and Oscar nominations but what the hell was that Do they think in Hollywood that we re brain dead zombies and we re gonna fall for this crap Don t spend a dime and time for this better look at your ceiling for 2 hours its more productive IMDb metric system isn t trustworthy after this for sure,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3788304/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,Great Film that Needs an Editor,Hollywood always loves a good story about itself whether it s the fall from graces mystery of Sunset Boulevard the tongue in cheek satire in Singin in the Rain or the sophisticated translation of The Artist La La Land follow this tradition It s a wonderful film that needed an editor hence why I gave it a 7 even though I think there is so much to love The film stars two young dreamers in Sebastian Wilder Ryan Gosling and Mia Dolan Emma Stone Wilder is a struggling musician who is a rarity in the City of Angels A native Angelino He drives a older convertible which fits his persona he was born in the wrong decade He sneers as he sees his city gentrify and much of the older culture vanish He dreams of owning a jazz club as he himself looks for any opportunity to make a quick buck whether that s playing Christmas standards as a lounge player assisting an 80s cover band at parties or touring with a pop band that stands for everything he s against Dolan on the other hand is like many in the city from elsewhere A native of a small town in Nevada Dolan drops out of school to become a barista aka actress while frequenting auditions that go nowhere Naive and hopeful she s the counterbalance to Wilder s cynicism and pessimism They immediately connect on one particular thing pursuing their dreams I think that Gosling and Stone have excellent chemistry I see some people complaining about that and I have no idea what movie they were watching as I thought their romance was genuine and real unlike most we see in film television I loved the magic the film had reminding us of what great cinema can do in taking us to another world Appearances by J K Simmons John Legend and others provide great additional support to the film The music is beautiful and will stay with you for a long long time from the high energy opening number which sets up perfectly for someone coming to L A for the first time to City of Stars that encapsulates what we think of when we think of Hollywood Another thing I see people complaining about are the numerous party scenes As someone who lived in L A for a while as a starving artist I can attest that yes this film captured them perfectly Most of them are insufficient and very rarely does anything happen at them that causes anything important That s why I think the film does a great job at making them seem unimportant they pretty much are yet artists in the city go to them with the hopes that maybe it ll be the one that ll change everything I have one major beef with the film but it s a big one The editing was bad There are scenes that point to future scenes but sometimes these scenes lead to nothing which makes me wonder why they were still in the film Also I think cutting about 30 minutes off of the film would have made it better It got long in certain parts and I think you could have made it about 90 minutes and it still would have been an excellent film La La Land gives me hope like those of new citizens of L A hoping to make it in acting or directing or writing or music or comedy etc Damien Chazelle is a very talented and young filmmaker who has given us now three excellent films Maybe he can lead a new revolution for film in Hollywood similar to what happened in the 90s when filmmakers like Fincher Payne Tarantino Lee Singleton Ritchie gave us really creative and groundbreaking original work It s desperately needed in superhero sequel reboot obsessed Hollywood I recommend La La Land and call it a 9 10 star movie trapped in a 7 star film that needs an editor and some polish,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616262/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2020,Such a bore,I hate these types of movies it s so boring all the singing and dancing and it got 11 Oscar nominations thank gosh it did not win all those and I love the La la land Oscar wining mess up I hate this movie even if I was so Bored and I could do but watch it I would not,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5712020/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,"Visually Appealing, but Boring",Let s start off with all the absolutely incredible things about La La Land It s probably one of the ten most visually appealing movies of all time Every camera angle every carefully planned twist and turn is just beautiful And duh the music is 10 10 spectacular The ending is also just out of this world superb Unfortunately La La Land just takes too long to actually get decent Emma Stone s character is so static and boring Ryan Gosling is great and a version with just him could have been different But ultimately their romance is bland and cliche I see what all the initial appeal was about but now it just seems like La La Land will he forgotten in time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4721721/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2017,Good acting but a weak script,A major disappointment considering all the hype and Golden Globes Damien s script failed to deliver showing that most new artists don t have the chops Looks like the previous generation didn t get the apprenticeship they needed so the great ideas and tricks of the trade could be passed on Native talent doesn t get the job done There is a reason everyone must pay their dues I hope he doesn t buy the fake news and awards because those people haven t seen a real musical and failed to realize what was missing See it if you want but I bet you will not leave humming the tunes or remember how bad the opening number was at least 25 of the dancers were out of sync,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618586/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2017,"Should be titled after the hit song ""City Of Stars"" since that's all they played.",Don t get me wrong I really liked this movie but it s not as brilliant as it s been hyped I m not a big fan of musicals Just wanted to see the results from Ryan Gosling teaching himself to play improvisational jazz piano and I wasn t disappointed He was brilliant So brilliant that they didn t give him enough material to do his skills justice I mean how many times can you play City Of Stars Jeez Louise give it a rest will ya I was getting sick of hearing it and I love that song I didn t care to compare this to 60 year old musicals but I do remember them having more than one hit song like Singing In The Rain and West Side Story Even Camelot has a treasure trove of memorable songs if not hits Oh and don t forget The Sound Of Music Did I say I wasn t a big fan of musicals OK I kinda miss their innocent charm set design ambiance and poetic improvisational expressionism through dance and song La La Land touches upon these attributes with gorgeous photography but it becomes pretty obvious the filmmakers were paying homage to musicals of decades past that it seemed to overshadow the motivation of the actors in how they were telling a more modernized story about following one s dreams no matter the cost Pretty clich d plot but that s what most musicals were built on anyway Keep it simple I did like the naturally relaxed delivery of Ryan and Emma s dancing and singing Frankly Emma s facial emoting on screen was more believable and gut wrenching than Barbara Streisand s Funny Girl or any other actor in a musical for that matter And Emma can really belt it out with the best of them And Ryan s singing style reminded me of the Velvet Fog Mel Torme Just wanted to hear more of his jazz improvisational piano that shines in the Christmas holiday scene in the restaurant It was amazing,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3641052/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2017,This is sad. Very sad only.,I had high hopes for this movie based on word of mouth from other movie goers but the only decent parts were the occasional older jazz tunes fleetingly heard throughout a dreadfully long and puffed up souffl that had no memorable music of its own to offer the listener How many times can you play the same simple semi classical jazz tune over and over and over and still have it leave no trace of memory after the movie is finished Beginning with the over extended opening musical sequence leading up to Emma Stone giving the finger to Ryan Gosling once a massive traffic jam on the freeway finally begins moving again all I could figuratively hear was some inept director in the background saying Faster faster More energy Keep smiling dammit and where casting apparently had a call where every driver stuck in traffic couldn t be over 25 preferably not over 20 As the skimpy plot slowly wound its way through the seasons to give us some time frame for reference as to the length of this tripe I kept expecting Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst to make a cameo appearance from their Spiderman 3 jazz bar sequence to at least bring some life to the turgid pace of this dog The entire movie seemed like a two hour riff on that five minute clip And the last season actually takes place five years later like a bad coda to an awful movie Ryan Gosling can t sing although neither could jazz artist Chet Baker so I didn t hold that against him But he certainly can t act either Emma Stone s own singing paled in comparison to Kirsten Dunst s feeble warbling in Spider Man 3 and makes Nicole Kidman s singing in Moulin Rouge seem like an artistic triumph Ms Stone appeared to be trying her hardest to bring some much needed acting relief to the screen but often came across as chewing the scenery opposite the sheer blandness of Ryan Gosling Walter Matthau had more chemistry with Barbra Streisand in Hello Dolly and I always thought they had zero chemistry Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have less as he seems to keep sucking it away from her The writing directing editing special effects and even sound were awful Characters just became different dancer s feet were cut off in several sequences swirling the camera back and forth and back and forth took the place of cuts possible close ups were often ignored segues were choppy the dream sequences were usually laughable with the final one the most ridiculous of all and volume blared up and down throughout Watching a two hour game of badminton would have been more interesting,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3695383/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2017,Charm and guts,I saw LaLa Land in a real movie theater with a huge screen it grabbed me from the first scene That freeway dancing singing opening scene is pure magic To all the naysayers who did not find meat in this movie and complain about the lack of dancing skills from Gosling and Stone I say expert dancing and singing are irrelevant to the tale here The relevance here is good music and a smart script and let them dance and sing it The movie brought to my mind not Ginger and Fred and Gene and Cyd this was clearly not the director s intention but a French movie called The Young Girls of Rochefort 1967 director Jacques Demy where an older Gene Kelly makes a small but glorious appearance and everyone else in the cast dances no better than you and me but what a crazy delight it is Just like in LaLa Land the viewer is grabbed by lyrical tunes and invited to take a swirl into fantasy while grounded in reality,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3730852/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,The best musical I've seen,Where do I even begin Let me say first of all I m not a big fan of musicals Musicals just really aren t my thing but La La Land worked for me It s not just that it worked it s that it worked very VERY well I think part of this is that the musical numbers in this film are very dreamy most of the time they re meant to be in la la land this perfect version of our reality The film showcases this excellently with the opening scene I really enjoyed the music in the film and thought it was all done really well The film is basically about passion and ambition as we focus on two young characters trying to get into some of the most luck based industries on the planet an actress and a jazz pianist The dialogue and characters are phenomenal they are completely believable and this is helped by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who give fantastic performances The film s themes really resonated with me but it still stayed realistic enough with how it tackled success At the end of the day there would be no need for the musical numbers in this film if the characters got everything they wanted and that just works so well in my opinion This is an absolutely beautiful film with stunning cinematography set design costume design and editing Honestly I can t think of a single issue I had with this film La La Land gets a 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6986822/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2017,Good film that was completely clouded by prejudice,This film was really enjoyable in many aspects and took a great opportunity to revive an older and forgotten genre but in the process of modernising completely neglected to remove any racist overtones of the past To create a film centred around a white man saving jazz a genre so deeply rooted in African American culture seems so blindly ignorant that I am shocked it was created in 2016 While the spotlight focuses in on the white leads they are surrounded by black people that are being turned into furniture in the background of their own culture While John Legend performed well in a large role he was cast as the one ruining jazz by turning it into pop music while Ryan Gosling is the hero that must maintain the rich traditions That is not to mention the fact that Emma Stone s talent in the film pales into insignificance a mere afterthought while the entire story line is centred around Gosling s own interests The film was engaging and managed to strike the difficult balance between drama and music well but it missed a wonderful opportunity to genuinely modernise a lost genre Instead I was so distracted by the gross ignorance involved that I could not really enjoy it,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627562/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2021,How Beautiful Movie it is..........,La La Land Review We live in a cynical world and Damien Chazelle s mesmerising romantic musical hailed as the front runner for this year s Academy Awards is just what you need to light up the dark days Set in contemporary times beaming with optimism and soaked in nostalgia the old fashioned romance tugs at your heartstrings with its relevance and simplicity It reminds you who you were before failures made you practical Chazelle s riveting storytelling and Stone Gosling s terrific performances make you relive the nervous excitement of first love and the devastating emotions of shattered dreams This lyrical masterpiece brings every dreamer s fantasy and fears to life It recreates Hollywood movie magic right from the spectacular single take opening song Another Day of Sun where motorists sing and dance atop their cars on a clogged LA freeway Winter Spring Summer and Fall Though the film is hopelessly romantic it s equally relatable You can see yourself through the eyes of its vulnerable protagonists making their tale your own Interestingly Justin Hurwitz s soulful music is an extension of the characters state of mind Sung by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone City of Stars is a classic melancholy tune that s bound to melt your heart My Rating 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6620945/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2017,One for the Romantics,We went and saw La La Land as a baby step on the long road to recovery following the Incident A journey starts with a single step Unless you are driving Although most folk walk to a car But what if that initial walk is away from your destination I don t know I don t care Just put it in for the pedants The movie is about a struggling jazz musician No surprises there Is there any other kind The only surprise is that he doesn t seem to be a smack freak He plays Christmas music in a place where he has to give himself tips He is unhappy Fortunately the Gozza has a permanent preternaturally bleak look about him There is also a struggling actress played by the Stoner who is good at crying and this is fortunate because her life as a struggling actress is as potholed as a Port Moresby road Mebbe they ve improved Dunno The movie starts off with a big production number that is reminiscent of a Pepsi max ad with bucket loads of young wild yet oddly responsible young people dancing and singing and generally making the best of a bad situation In my experience both as an observer and an historical actual young person this just doesn t happen without alcohol and drugs and almost always ends badly with one vomit filled shoe bruises and no underwear I hate Pepsi Max ads and their ilk Anyway they meet and there are production numbers and jazz concerts and auditions and successes and failures before they both became wildly successful Most of the music was unfamiliar to me I did recognise A Ha and Flock of Seagulls but they were peripheral I am not proud of this They fall in love Those who wish to see MacGuffies will be disappointed There are lot of flash backs and these had me for one confused presenting alternate endings and suchlike If you nod off you ll go insane with an absolute hydra of possibility But we did enjoy the music and had I been a toe tapper these mini digits would ve been tapping out a machine gun beat There is dancing too but Fred n Ginger expectations will be dashed against the rocks of despair Still they are better n me although I have a hip flexor injury and am off the turps We walked out thinking that it hadn t been a waste of a seniors discount The in laws were sitting next to us and they liked it too I think Not the best movie we have seen But far fromma worst One for the romantics You know who you are,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3636797/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2023,"""La La Land"": A Disappointing Experience Despite a Standout Performance from Ryan Gosling",La La Land had some bright moments but unfortunately they were outweighed by its weaknesses The music while catchy felt forced and contrived The film s attempts at creating grand musical numbers fell flat and the singing was often mediocre at best The romance between the two leads was also underwhelming and lacked real depth and emotion The chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone was not as strong as I had hoped and their relationship felt more like a Hollywood fairy tale than a real life love story Furthermore the film s direction and cinematography while visually appealing felt repetitive and lacked creativity The film relied heavily on the same types of shots and transitions which became tiring after a while In conclusion while I appreciate Ryan Gosling s performance I was left disappointed by La La Land As someone who is not a fan of musicals the film failed to win me over and I cannot recommend it to others who share my dislike for the genre,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8855407/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2020,LA LA LAND REVIEW FROM A GUY WHO HATES MUSICAL,I usually mostly hate musicals Somehow somewhere this film changed it I only gave it a chance since I loved Damien Chazzelle s other film First Man And probably because I do love me some old classical films I get the hype now This film epitomizes old classical Hollywood And that includes musicals of course Not just that but that whole falling in love and out of it and relationship Damn it Makes you feel like you want to fall in love for the first time again And the whole chase your dreams thing So good that it makes me dreams again and rethink my life And as guy who always always think himself as one who s living in the wrong decade I have to say that Iove it And kinda fall in love with the film itself Damn it Now I m gonna need to watch old classical musicals too aren t I Thank you for nothing Damien Chazzelle Now I need to add a few more films into my watchlist all because of you And also thanks for sparking a new interest in me I guess 5 out of 5,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5786224/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2017,First time in a long time I wanted to walk out before the end,I had very high expectations for Lalaland but what a disappointment This should have been a Broadway show not a movie I felt that the story linen was thin and very chaotic To me this was Bollywood meets Hollywood and it did not work at all Why can t we just allow Bollywood to make their great movies at least they are authentic The only positive thing about this movie was the acting I thought the actors did their best with the material they were given Also the music was good but did not manage to carry through Probably just better to buy the soundtrack Do not recommend this movie but if you do go do so with low expectations that way you might get some enjoyment out of it,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628788/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2017,Low Stakes Escapism,In the years of the Great Depression the average American went to damnable lengths just to pay bills or scare up food for their family And yet Hollywood was still able to pull off successful numbers at the box office The reason escapism The late 1930 s brought movies of pure joy and carefree lifestyles Films like My Man Godfrey Top Hat Chaplin and Marx Brother comedies were a tonic to forget hardship La La Land is a film in this vein 2016 is coming to a close and has yet to pump its breaks as a freight train of ugliness La La Land will have one of two effects on viewers the desired effect of escapism or one of jaded cynicism It was a telling experience that I fell firmly into the second category I will begin with how this movie succeeds and it does so spectacularly La La Land is a beautiful engaging and technical feat of production Long choreographed takes and sparkling settings compliment music and dance that act as an ode to Hollywood classics that could sweep you away The opening song and dance number sets the mood for how dutiful the production will be for the rest of the film Hundreds of dancers jump and glide over car hoods on the interstate in perfect step in a single take The shot pulls back and the line of cars and dancers go on for miles Here we meet our stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are Sebastian and Mia classic dreamers Mia is a part time barista and even more part time actress Sebastian is a talented pianist that is willing to spin his wheels to the grave rather than sacrifice his integrity as an artist They have a modern meet cute a middle finger on the interstate Like any classic musical their relationship develops through a series of musical numbers rather than dialogue They start as flirty enemies who dance at one another When the romance picks up they dance with one another We follow their romance as they court us through this new Hollywood that isn t so unlike the old Sebastian lives and breathes Jazz perfecting pieces off of garbled records that were pressed before he was born Mia auditions for any tired clich that will have her all while going to sleep with a 9 foot Ingrid Bergman banner on her wall La La Land certainly follows a formula but it does so while celebrating it Now for the cynics When you have a year like 2016 cute cat videos and puff stories on the news just can t quell the acidity of what s going wrong La La Land takes place in a world void of these struggles Consequently it s hard to see these beautiful people and think of their struggles as anything but trivial I found my smile frequently turning to an eye roll when prompted to care about the conflict Based on the overwhelming praise coming from countless other sources I count myself as unfortunate for falling victim to this dissonance If there is anything imperfect about the musical arc of the film it s that it plays more like a score than soundtrack The songs are as grandiose as any great Broadway number but not as memorability They may not be meant to be but the songs don t exactly stay with you This is a true romance featuring actors with perfect chemistry You root for them to a point but when things get hard their worst case scenario is still a dreamy existence in La La Land,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3686089/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2021,"La la land, the movie for the one's who dream.",La La Land 2016 directed by Damien Chazelle 99 100 La La Land is a movie that with an helping hand from music tells us the story of Mia an aspiring actress who works in a coffee shop in LA serving movie stars and Sebastian a jazz musician who wants to keep jazz as alive as possible I really can t tell how much i enjoyed this movie Today i had a Maths Final Exam so i decided the night before to watch something heart warming and wow incredible choice should have seen it way sooner This is a story for the ones who dream for the ones who close their eyes and see a beautiful path on their way This is a movie for creative minds who have to let it be for everyone who wants to show their best to the world Here s to the fools who dream Mia The acting is magnificent and i got to admit a part of my heart was stolen by Emma definitly the best role of her career Ryan was also incredible and they both portrayed the La Dreamer role brilliantly The scene were nobody shows up at Mia s play and we can see the profund saddness in her face is just incredibly moving The chemistry between them was incredible The opening scene is amazing and it s the perfect introduction for a movie that takes place in the City of Dreams where everything seems possible even dancing and singing in the middle of the L A winter traffic The pacing of the movie is perfect and it s fully charged of amazing jazzy scenes The way the dream world sometimes fuses with the real world is also genius and it s there to show us how sometimes we get so caught up in the fantasy world that we get lost Unlike many i really don t see this movie as a love letter to L A It feels more like an actual critique of the modern L A city The way everyone looks rude the fact that people interrupt you while crying in a casting for a tv show the way there is cleary a social ladder that destinguishes the dreamers from the actual celebrities The score is just fantastic and it emphasizes every feeling Everything Justin Hurwitz does is amazing Trully amazing and moving score and it s fantastic to see how Damien Chazelle uses music in his movies The old hollywood references paired with the beautiful cinematography just make this movie feel like something so fresh yet so nostalgic I really enjoyed this movie and Damien Chazelle has trully find his way into my mind This dude is a genius Definitely one of the best directors working today can t wait for Babyllon to come out Overall I feel like this movie is a masterpiece and has one of the best if not the best ending off all time in hollywood This is for us for the young dreamers Thanks Damien Thanks Emma Thanks Ryan Thanks Justin,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7316272/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2017,A breath-taking modern masterpiece,Here s to the ones who dream Foolish as they may seem Here s to the hearts that ache Here s to the mess we make Spring Summer Fall and finally Winter all these painted the beauty of La La land from the opening scene to the very ending minute by minute A breath taking modern masterpiece Great cinematography Great acting from both Ryan and Emma but specially Emma who controlled all my feelings and emotions Whiplash s ending stuck in my mind a while after watching the movie this ending will also stuck in my mind for god knows how long Damien Chazelle is very talented I love him i want to see more of him now,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3613379/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,A masterpiece that will be remembered for years,Finally I got to see La La Land and finally I understood what all the fuss was about I m not much into romantic films and so I had my doubts about it I couldn t be more wrong I don t know if it s the best film of 2016 I still have a lot to watch but it certainly is one of the most amazing and memorable cinematic experiences of the year La La Land written and directed by Damien Chazelle follows Mia Emma Stone and Sebastian Ryan Gosling as they re both trying to fulfill their ambitious dreams in the city of Los Angeles Mia currently working in a coffee shop wants to become a famous actress while Sebastian dreams of revitalizing the jazz scene by creating his own jazz club They fall in love with each other and together try to achieve their goals For a while everything seems perfect but the challenges they face test their faith in both their relationship and their visions The film has won a record breaking 7 Golden Globe Awards and received a record tying 14 Academy Awards nominations Surely you can t always trust the Academy on deciding which is the best picture of the year but this many accolades cannot be overlooked So what is it that makes La La Land so special Well first of all it is technically flawless Cinematography editing costumes and acting are top notch Emma Stone is one of my favourite actresses and she is absolutely dazzling However two other things are what make the film stand out The first is the music The score of Justin Hurwitz who also composed the music for Damien Chazelle s two previous features is utterly enchanting Hurwitz also wrote most of the songs with two of those being nominated for an Oscar It really felt that the songs were woven together like every song was just another verse of a bigger song The second thing was its thought provoking ending I m not going to spoil it I just want to say that I spend days trying to figure out what it meant and what message was the film trying to transmit to the audience It came out unexpectedly to distinguish the film from the average romance film that satisfying as it may be for teenage girls lacks any significant substance For these reasons I believe La La Land will be remembered for years and years to come and I wouldn t be surprised if it broke the Academy Awards record Overall an unforgettable masterpiece More reviews on  reflectingoncinemablog wordpress com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3634964/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,Jazz is full of contrasts and surprises like this movie,I regard myself as a musical sceptic I have never understood the old school Hollywood musicals In the wonderful opening sequence on the jammed highway I first thought that I am really going to hate this no no no please stay inside the cars like the normal people And then magic The movie totally won me over To be honest there were slow moments and the quick changes between styles got me a bit confused in the beginning I had time to think that maybe they should have hired Justin Timberlake because he can sing and dance and why Ryan Gosling s hair is greasy But don t worry Ryan Gosling is perfect for the role In the end you will agree I loved the careful details such as the huge poster of Ingrid Bergman and the references to Casablanca the greatest and saddest love story of all time Music score was absolutely great What makes this movie greater than a basic feel good movie is that the love story and the main characters development and ambitions are more important than their immediate feelings Young people were happy and laughing when the movie ended whereas I cried melancholic but sweet tears This was a beautiful and surprising movie that had one of the greatest endings since Casablanca I warmly recommend the movie for all movie lovers including notorious musical sceptics,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3624994/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2021,I think that this is the best musical I've ever seen,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7615700/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2020,Just what I expected,I envisioned a feel good musical with excellent lighting and music and I got what I expected There are all the elements that account for the hype the catchy music obviously the modern classic dance scene and the beautiful color scheme However that is it for La La Land The plot is simple at best and character arcs are cliche too It feels like a Wong ka wai movie it makes you feel good but does not actually tell anything,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6102641/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2017,A naive homage to the musicals of yesteryear,If you ve seen classics that clearly inspired multiple facets of this film like An American in Paris Singin in the Rain A Star is Born and lesser films like Xanadu and Fame you may find La La Land less than inspiring despite its decent songs Emma Stone was very good but Gosling nearly ruined the film with his saturnine presence there are many actors who could have done a better job Overall it presents a heavily romanticized version of L A giving the impression that the city is largely defined by Pasadena Griffith Park the Santa Monica Pier and the Hollywood Hills These and other script elements certainly betray director writer Chazelle s youth and lack of real life experience Most actors in L A never get paid work in films or TV and the small percentage who do mostly get work in commercials and as non union extras Most would gladly eat out of dumpsters for months for the chance to get a SAG card Given that jazz clubs are few in L A and regularly feature established artists of the genre with a lot more experience than Gosling s character has some of his character s actions and attitudes are largely preposterous In short a derivative diversion with some good songs and a luminous performance from Emma Stone It lacks the zest and joie de vivre to make a strong impression on the big screen It may play better on video,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616549/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,"Fresh, funny, fizzy...but not the classic everyone is making out",You would think considering the almost hysterically positive reviews that the new Citizen Kane had been released with La La Land I very much liked this film a toe tapping sun drenched thoroughly entertaining ode to the musicals of yesteryear with a modern twist in the inventive dance numbers and slyly adult song lyrics Ryan Gosling and particularly Emma Stone are on ripe breezy fun form and clearly relish playing opposite each other The photography and lighting are stunning showing off the varied colour schemes throughout I just felt a better more subtle marriage of the light musical and heavy dramatic moments was needed to meld all the wonderful elements together,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620697/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2017,"I kept waiting for it to ""click""",1st review Keeping it simple I watch a TON of movies and grew up on musicals including theater I just can t give this a big thumbs up I WANTED to love it I really did I d love to see a modern version of the old school musicals I learned yes learned to love It s not Singing in the Rain and such I love Gosling as far as his talent I wanted it to work Truly I did not come in being critical It just never clicked for me The singing was blah I get the concept of being regular folks The story well I just kept waiting for it to be a big splash Instead it seemed to end quickly and simply bland I really did want to love it and understand the love for it Sorry it s my first review but I ve seriously watched a ton of quality movies from IMAX to my home theater and this is the first time I felt I HAD TO SAY MY QUALMS It s a fine movie for what it is However throw in the hype and it just let me down Sure I could get more specific and such but I am just throwing it out there that it was a fail for me overall I WANTED to love it It just never go going for me Do a good old school musical where it s the norm characters as they make them out to be then BOOM suddenly it rocks no not the genre of music I just think they let it drop where they could have taken it to another level Love the actors I am sure I will see tons of great works to come This just did not take it to the level I had hoped Perhaps too much hype,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626480/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2017,Dreamers in a World of Classic Spectacle,La La Land s opening musical number is perhaps its most incredible moment being so catchy and beautifully filmed so as to immediately impress and engage any viewer who doesn t outright despise musicals The amusing thing is that this scene could be cut from the film and have absolutely no impact on the story it is purely for show but what a show it is This element of showiness is true for much of the film which is certainly no insult given how impressive such a classical spectacle is in our current cinematic landscape that is almost completely devoid of such things It s rare to see a musical released to the silver screen that isn t animated a parody a remake or an adaptation And that alone makes this film noteworthy The fact that it is put together with tremendous talent and care also helps Almost every aspect of this film is executed with great flair and confidence The cinematography is beautiful The singing and dancing are fun well choreographed and varied in style The music in and of itself is enjoyable and a perfect fit for the story and tone The overall aesthetic is evocative of a colorful quasi fairy tale world The characters are developed thoroughly and compellingly The acting of the two leads is great Romantic clich s you d expect are present but the strength of the overall product makes them forgivable And the story itself is a well crafted vehicle for all of these things to work in tandem directed with great confidence and stylish precision the lynchpin for it all being the classic simple theme of pursuing one s dreams Though admittedly if you re the type of person who is cynical about the film industry then the constant bright eyed Hollywood worship may get pretty grating for you The ending is where the movie either makes its mark or misses it depending on your interpretation Without going into much detail it involves a beautifully clever musical sequence juxtaposing fantasy and reality which I think most will agree is a highlight of the film However following this sequence the film ends very abruptly which is jarring It felt to me like it lacked the last ounce of closure needed to bring everything home instead leaving a hollow indecisive feeling in its wake Perhaps this was precisely the intention but it seemed out of place in a story that was otherwise mostly light fun and easy to digest That said by breaking away from expectations the film is likely to make a more lasting impression on the viewer In a way this actually elevates the material from an objective film making perspective as opposed to being predictable and derivative though whether it works for you or not will largely depend on whether you come into La La Land looking for fantastical reality or realistic fantasy,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3727310/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2019,Enjoyable but Slow,This film gets off to a relative poor start with an extremely obnoxious dance number that goes on for what seems like an eternity thus placing the audience in a poor mood to watch the film So let me start by saying that I did enjoy the film and would watch it again after fast forwarding the first scene I think that it is a film that has a simple romance story that is very reminiscent of 500 Days of Summer however it fails to accomplish the themes that 500 Days of Summer exceeds in As a result of that I am only giving it a 7 10 also known as a C for average,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5283710/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2021,"I actually don't like musicals, however...",I am not really a huge fan of musicals but this film however was an enjoyment The reason why this musical separated itself to me from other musicals is that this film was a story first before it was a musical it told me a story about two people navigating love their careers and desires within Hollywood and the trials and tribulations it comes with The story was told without forcing random bursts of sing and dance every 5mins where they don t belong It was more story then it was musical and that made it a pleasing experience despite the films lack of diversity,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7638973/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2017,Why I'm Not Gaga About La La,Yes I know the title of my review and the fact that I ve given this film an eight rating seems to be sending contradictory thoughts on how good I thought this film was but I can explain my reasoning and thoughts on this rating process I m going to be brutally honest with my opinions on this if I m judging this purely on film credentials qualities I ve got some significant issues primarily the pacing it really does lag between sections of the film and this is going to sound bizarre so hear me out but is the films predictable story structure of young love too comfortable Or is that the intention of the film given in essence it s a love letter to classic Hollywood films of the studio era where audiences pretty much knew what they were going to get going in I ll leave that one up for debate I suppose On a completely different note I must comment upon Ryan Gosling s singing it s not particularly bad it s just kind of underwhelming given all that is surrounding it The most significant question I have to ask in regards to this film however is at what point does nostalgia for films past equal critical acclaim Is the film self congratulatory I kind of thought so in certain moments there s a particular piece of dialogue that is so glaringly so I did an unintentional eye roll The reason why I think this is a relevant question is that in recent years we ve experienced films that go beyond a nod and a wink to films past and just outright try to recreate and remake extremely popular films of previous years that have been given from my point of view too good critical receptions as simply repackaging these qualities to give to a new modern age audience is not a sign of greatness surely it s a sign of lack of creativity The only thing I will say in this films defence to this point is that the films director writer Damien Chazelle I truly do believe has made this film with immense love for the genre of film that has been and earnestly wanted to bring it to the new audience with none of the cynicism I clearly have however where it in my opinion falls down is the predictable and flat storytelling in between the outstanding song and dance numbers that the films soul lives off which is actually a shock as his previous film Whiplash is one of my favourite films in the last few years that I constantly tell people to watch as it has brilliant storytelling at the heart of it It really sounds like I didn t enjoy this film doesn t it however let s go on to the positives when it s on song it is truly exceptional as an event piece of cinema and certainly worth the price of admission alone three segments in particular are of testament to this the Gosling Stone bench choreographed number the Emma Stone final audition song reminded be heavily of Anne Hatheway in Les Miserables and the what if reversal of time jazz club finale that was an astonishing spectacle to behold I d be amazed if the score doesn t sweep every awards gong going as it was truly magnificent the songs were generally infectiously fun but what wins you over more then anything for me was the dance numbers and not because they were a nostalgic nod to Hollywood s yesteryear but because they were wonderfully entertaining and skilfully put together in their own right with two superb performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling at the centre of them putting their heart and soul into something that would have been an enormous challenge in fact the story between the song and dance numbers almost does a disservice to these moments because the dance numbers themselves tell a much better story through that medium Emma Stone is sublime and she most certainly can sing and her joyfully exuberance performance is the base for the joyful feel of the film This is event cinema it has to be seen at the cinema there is no doubt about that as it s the sort of film that won t be seen very often on our screens I can certainly see why is has garnered the industries critical acclaim and respect however my own personal take on the film is that not of utter adulation but one of just great respect as a film of flawed brilliance,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625526/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2017,"I liked the film better when when it was called ""(500) Days of Summer.""",This review has SPOILERS This will be a short review of La La Land To be blunt La La Land is basically 500 Days of Summer which came out in 2009 with more song and dance numbers I read one review about La La Land along with hearing all the buzz about how great of a film it is So I saw a late showing of it on New Year s Eve I was the first in the theater and I thought that I would be the only one but about ten random people walked in I thought that the retro intro of the film such as the CinemaScope graphic was cool But as the film started I felt like Why does this movie seem so familiar Then it hit me 500 Days of Summer I then was able to predict what was going to happen in the film Here are SOME of the similarities of both films Both films have the theme of boy meets girl boy gets girl boy loses girl Both films have the change in seasons La La Land has Angels Flight and 500 Days of Summer has Angels Knoll In 500 Days of Summer Tom and Summer see an older film In La La Land the same thing happens 500 Days of Summer has Expectations vs Reality and La La Land has a dream sequence scene at Sebastian s jazz club Seb s where the characters imagine what their lives would have been like if they had stayed together But 500 Days of Summer wasn t the only film that La La Land will remind you of As I watched some of the other scenes I kept thinking why does that look so familiar The film is basically an homage to musicals such as Singin in the Rain and an American in Paris The scene that is so obvious is towards the end with the boy and the giant red balloon which was a blatant homage to The Red Balloon which teachers at my elementary school seemed to have enjoyed screening for us I read a review after watching the film and it had still comparisons of dance numbers from the plethora of films it pays homage to including Sleeping Beauty One of the homages to 500 Days of Summer is when Sebastian and Mia are riding Angel s Flight in downtown Los Angeles Although Tom Joseph Gordon Levitt and Summer Zooey Deschanel didn t actually go on Angels Flight they sat on one of the benches next door at Angels Knoll How many homages can a current film have in it from films decades old along with a super similar story line to a more current film from 2009 before it stops being an homage and starts being something else like a best of compilation piece Do I think that La La Land is a GOOD film Yes Do I think that it is a great film NO Do I think that it is an overrated film Yes Do I think that it will receive countless awards and nominations Yes Hollywood loves films with song and dance numbers especially if the actors aren t known for those talents This would have been a much better film if Joseph Gordon Levitt had portrayed the character of Sebastian instead of Ryan Gosling Gordon Levitt can show more emotions on screen than one look Gosling and has a better singing voice along with dancing talent 500 Days of Summer was original and felt more real because of the characters and the non clich happy ending and the real places in LA that the average person could visit that aren t normally scene in films that are made in LA La La Land is definitely a fun date film and likable but when you realize as I did that this is a lesser version of 500 Days of Summer with more song and dance numbers along with a boatload of homages it doesn t seem as creative as the current Hollywood buzz hype portrays it to be,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3611742/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,An absolute masterpiece.,La La Land is without a doubt one of the best musicals ever made Not being much of fan of this genre it blew me away When I saw the original trailer for this film in theaters and learned Damien Chazelle was directing director of Whiplash I had to see it and boy did it deliver Told in the forms of seasons the film s seamless editing and cinematography is a marvel to observe Lengthy complicated and choreographed takes show off the talent Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have Stone giving in my opinion the best performance of here career Goslings performance is second only to Drive or perhaps The Nice Guys The score by Justin Hurwitz is once again astonishing Chazelle s love for jazz holds true in this film It s interesting that the two films I ve seen by him both mention jazz as a dying art an art he is helping keep alive with his brilliant film making The Whiplash nods were wonderful with the double time swing followed by a bass player and the talk of Charlie Parker as the bird The J K Simmons cameo had the crowd grinning nicely as well still playing a hard ass persona In conclusion La La Land is one of the best made performed and creative films of the year It is an inspiring work of art that begs its viewers to seize the day and follow their dreams Get out and see this one,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3607835/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2017,"A musical that doesn't need to be a musical, but nonetheless is a good start to bringing back the movie musical.",As a film La La Land does a lot of things right but as a musical it does a lot of things not so right The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is undeniable and the story that is told between the two is very well done The jazz score of this movie is absolutely fantastic and does the movie a great service Ryan Gosling s piano playing bits are honestly amazing and his character is fleshed out very well as is Emma Stone s However Emma Stone s singing sometimes leaves something to be desired and sometimes the direction of some of the dialogue leads to an occasional drop in the pace of the film I really wish that some unknown true musical theatre actors were chosen for this film rather than famous pretty faces but that s probably just me I truly believe that if you stack this film up against other movie musicals like West Side Story for instance it would fall flat on its face If this film came out say 20 years ago it would not be the critical success that it is now The traditional film elements that La La Land undertakes are generally very well done but as a musical it often fails 8 2 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3672641/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2017,One of my most favourite cinema experiences,This movie is not some glitzy re humanization of being rich during The Depression It s actually almost the opposite a musical centered on the little people striving to succeed while enduring the ups and downs of relationships and two branches of the entertainment business one an actress the other a jazz pianist Damien Chazelle has dazzled me before Most musicals I can t wait for the songs to be over to hear the dialogue Each piece had character great choreography Something else that helps is my love of jazz music and I found most pieces to be jazzy so that earned itself some points This movie so deftly navigates all sorts of truth about so many elusive things that it s not worth picking a few Just go see it even if you don t like musicals It will win you over,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626602/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2016,A Lovely Musical About Pursing Your Dreams Hollywood Style,There was something about Old Hollywood that was wonderfully inspirational Film stars back then were true stars They were part of the studio system that made them stars They seemed to have good breeding and manners They weren t blue bloods and most of them didn t come from old money They came from working class American families They had dreams They wanted to be somebody And so why not be a star This is so fundamentally and almost uniquely American The belief that you can come from nowhere today and be a star tomorrow still strongly echoes in the American psyche Television shows like The Voice American Idol and America s Got Talent easily attest to that However these days we ve carried it way too far Today there are too many people who believe that in order to be relevant or whole they must be on television or they must be a star It s really sad That road is fraught with peril and pitfalls But I digress La La Land is a throwback to old Hollywood musicals You know those big Busby Berkeley type films where the characters break into song and dance every ten minutes or so There s always a production number right around the corner or in the next scene Fred and Ginger While La La Land isn t as intricate as Berkeley it does borrow some of his tricks and clich s Director Damien Chazelle was clearly influenced by old Hollywood films at some point in his life And fortunately for him and La La Land it has paid off quite well La La Land is a delightful film about dreams It s about the importance of dreaming and fantasizing about your life as you d like it to be In this case it centers on characters beautifully played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling Their characters want to be happy and meaningful They live in Los Angeles and they re both reaching for relevance in their respective venues Throw in a little romance some song and dance some Technicolor with a pinch of nostalgia and jazz and you ve got the film pegged As a nation and world we totally need this film right now We re in a dark period Things feel bleak We need to be reminded that life doesn t always have to be about strife and struggle and conflict although the characters in this film clearly deal with these issues La La Land reminds us that a life lived without pursuing your dream isn t much of a life at all It also teaches us that perhaps the greatest love of all is the selflessness that allows us to give flight to someone else s dream If you truly love someone you ll release them so they can become who they re meant to be Yes I ve already said too much La La Land is a must see film for creative types who are prone to apathy depression or indecision Do yourself a favor and go see it It reminds us that success is not the destination It s part of the journey I promise you after seeing this film you ll leave the movie theater ready to take flight and become one with the stars After all you ARE a star Michael K Corbin ArtBookGuy com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3605429/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2022,Dreamland or fake paradise?,La La Land is a movie that owes its relative success not to the technical quality of the film editing script director etc but instead people s longing for nostalgia manipulating the audience emotionally keeping a light of hope alive until the last minute and of course the leading actors who are loved by both opposite genders The fact that it left tears and smiles on the audience s face at the end explains why he is so identified with the audience However if there is one thing to remember it is the difference between successful and quality film In addition success is subjective quality technical objective data It would be more rational to compare from this point of view Whether la la land is a dreamland as depicted in the movie or just a fake paradise the decision is yours I only respect the ones which touches my brain not necessarily or only my heart,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8569059/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2017,"Not my type of movie, is now",Damien Chazelle s Whiplash was a fantastic movie so I was excited to see what he did next and La La Land is probably my favourite musical ever Musicals are not my type of movie and this movie of course has the scenes of people getting up singing and dancing their hearts out but in no scene does it without progressing the story in some way which I loved Not only is the non stop use of music actually good but also never feels like it was forced into the movie Damien Chazelle is a genius and his obvious love for jazz seeped through the screen throughout the movie and contains one of the most underrated scenes in this movie where Ryan Gosling talks about jazz and his love for it and this theme is probably my favourite of the film The only downside to this movie is the inevitable lack of people being interested in a musical as they may not believe they will see a great story as well which is definitely evident here This addition to Damien Chazelle s collection is very welcome and one of the best musicals in recent memory We can only hope that Chazelle expands his work outside of movies about music so he can be appreciated by a wider audience With La La Land he has proved that he is capable,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3827664/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,The perfection of music and light and shadow,Watching this film can be said to have participated in a dream like journey This film has won many Oscar awards ranging from the detailed clothing to the overall setting lighting video music etc Apart from the plot it is definitely a visual feast In the interview the director revealed his creative idea and his theme creation made me very admire you can say with me And contrary to most other directors he advocates to imagine in thinking first without considering any other material factors when imagining and whether it can solve the problem of shooting on the spot He believes that the effect of doing so is perfect Of course this is the ideal state for a filmmaker but we have limited our thinking due to one reason or another Let us have to consider the objective reality factor first I really admire such a bold idea I can say that I like all the soundtracks of this film very much The arrangement is smooth and comfortable and the combination of beautiful pictures is really appreciating a piece of art What impressed me most is the scene of traffic jam at the beginning of the film I can believe that this is definitely a scene that the director once dreamed of In this work the audience felt very shocked Of course the difficulty of shooting is also conceivable This is a very long group of one shot scenes involving the performance of many actors Everyone must fully fit all the music and dance movements which is very different from the last evaluation of 1917 1917 is only a matter of shooting cost but this film involves the rhythm It is very difficult for hundreds of people to unify the rhythm The clothing design of this film is very detailed If it is not for Oscar s reminder it is hard to pay attention to this point The color matching of clothing looks very simple but when it is matched with the background the overall setting effect is dazzling and the clothing design can not be ignored In addition to these of course there is the control of light and color All the pictures are the ideal type we think Of course we also need to mention the biggest weakness of the film that is the plot of the film Compared with the overall situation the plot is a little bad The plot is simple and the narrative and deep meaning are very few If we improve the plot the film will be perfect,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8819710/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,A True Modern Classic!,La La Land mesmerized me of how visually good it is You can just lay back in the cinema and admire the grandeur of the intensive art direction of it Viewing this reminds me of my first time viewing Cinema Paradiso in a London theater it was beautiful Damien Chazelle shocked me of how phenomenal his directing is You can tell from this picture and Whiplash that he is truly an admirer of classic art and of theater Definitely will be researching and studying his material much more The premise of La La Land is of pro nostalgia My friend came up with an interesting argument about the contrast of ideas between La La Land and Midnight In Paris So Woody Allen s Midnight in Paris based itself on the premise of anti nostalgia delineating the proposition that nostalgia is ultimately denial denial of the present and a clinging and ruminating onto the past Hence Midnight in Paris is a critique of nostalgia and an antithesis to La La Land In contrast La La Land sets out both sides of the argument one is Sebastian who s passion resides with the past whereas his friend Keith argues for revolutionary jazz a fusion between the classics and modernism In a way you can see that Keith is correct and he started singing this recast version of jazz using traditional instrument accompanying with synthesizer You can read this film in a Hegelian dimension a thesis an antithesis and the synthesis The thesis is Sebastian s argument for classic jazz the antithesis is Keith s counterargument for contemporary sound Finally the synthesis is the metamorphosis of the two premises However the metamorphosis or synthesis in this case is Sebastian s realization of what he wants to do with his passion and talent Whether he d be content in a modernist environment where we can tell he doesn t fit in but only doing so to feel relevant Or pursue his roots which is classical jazz And ultimately the synthesis of Sebastian s arc is that he preserves classical art and like Mia said people will listen to him because they d see how passionate he is And from there they ll begin to see the beauty of jazz Another dimension of the film is the romance between Sebastian and Mia They both have their own insecurities with their ambitions Sebastian with a jazz musician career and Mia with an acting career And they both try to complement each other s insecurities and build each other up The beauty of their relationship is at the end where Sebastian dwells on this montage of possibilities where their love could have been only if they overcame their insecurities So their romance underscores the concept of music in this film Why Because to me La La Land is a concept it s a land where language is music And the fun and beauty of life from the mediocre to the majestic is spoken and celebrated through music It s almost like our concept of America being the land of freedom opportunities However just like with America there is a darker truth to it in La La Land Sebastian imagines this world where him and Mia had fallen in love and complement each other s dreams through a musical odyssey Then immediately it cuts back to the reality that their relationship is broken they have both moved on and they could never lived up to the ideas of what La La Land is supposed to be about Oh and one more aspect of this film is that Damien Chazelle never said classical art is better than contemporary art Like one of those I was born in the wrong generation and I m smart because I listen to 50s jazz and you don t kinda situation It never serves to moralize the audience trying to preach this preference towards the past But rather I feel like he s saying these type of music will never die and that no matter what classical jazz will live on forever and contemporary jazz can never replace it That s just a way for me to read this film Anyway by and large this beautiful picture makes me say proudly now THAT S what I call modern classics,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6383435/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2017,A Modern Musical,La La Land is the latest film from Whiplash director Damien Chazzelle starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling La La Land is a musical that follows Mia Emma Watson who is a struggling actress whose path keeps crossing with Sebastien Ryan Gosling who is an aspiring jazz musician who wants to open his own jazz club And through the course of the film we see their romance flourish To say the least this film is phenomenal from the acting to the music this film is amazing At a certain point in the movie I realized that I didn t dislike a single thing in the film One of the best things I can say about this movie is the music as soon as it started I was entranced from the lyrics to the rhythm it is masterful As soon as the movie was over I wanted to keep listening to the music Also the characters are fantastic Emma stone gives the best performance of her career as Mia and Ryan Gosling as Sebastian was also one of his best which is saying a lot You can feel all of their emotion is on the screen when Gosling talks about jazz or Mia breaks down because she doesn t think she s good enough These two are at the top of their game Now let s talk about the Director Damien Chazzelle This man knows how to direct a film he uses such great camera movement vibrant colors incorporates great music and directs Stone and Gosling incredibly He uses a lot of tracking shots which I personally loved and incorporated good humor which seemed natural and not out of know where like other movies I don t have any flaws with the movie except of the last ten minutes or so it s not that I didn t like it It s just that the movie ended in a way that I would have liked to see go a different way It wasn t a bad ending I just personally would have wanted it to go a different direction Other than the last ten or so minutes no complaints here the movie was nearly flawless It had great characters songs choreography colors direction and acting I walked out of the theater with a smile on my face and humming the music And would highly recommend seeing this movie as soon as possible and I would give La La Land an A,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614810/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2019,Upon second watch......,I saw this film a few months after it came out and really enjoyed it Just caught it again on TV tonight and I really think it s a great film Yes it s to quote other reviews cheesy in plenty of places schmaltzy in others but it is for all the right reasons There s a for the love of Hollywood cinema about the story and where it is set It is unashamed in that regard and that works for me To have too many films of the same theme or take on cinema that this has would quickly run out of steam but as it sits alone and is unique enough makes it all the more of a gem The criticism in the IMDB reviews is often a little too harsh each to their own but this film does require you to want to believe in it and get swept along to really get the most from it Great film that can even be watched again and again in the future,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4682513/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2021,"""La La Land"" Review",As indicated by the title La La Land is the first big screen musical to arrive in quite some time The story centers on the meeting of aspiring actress Mia Emma Stone and jazz pianist Sebastian Ryan Gosling as they both struggle to pursue their dreams of becoming big shots in Los Angeles and become romantically involved Once they arrive there however they both face obstacles that hinder their individual pathways to success and put their delicate love affair at risk As they reach their triumphs Sebastian and Mia must choose between what is more important in their lives fame and success or romantic aspirations This picture written and directed by Damien Chazelle Whiplash carries the traditional aspects of many of the classic movie musicals and puts a fresh spin on them from the classic boy meets girl love story and elaborate choreography to the pastel colored costumes and evocative lighting At the same time however the film keeps itself up to date by reflecting on the realistic struggles Sebastian and Mia go through in their careers with the former s traditional jazz sensibilities clashing with the sounds of modernity and the latter attending audition after audition Easily the standout sequences include a Griffith Observatory montage and the splendid finale brimming with color and reminiscent of Singin in the Rain and An American in Paris The songs and score composed by Justin Hurwitz evoke memories of Hollywood s Golden Age and its memorable musical numbers by Rodgers Hart and Comden Green The opening number Another Day of Sun preceded by the 50s CinemaScope logo gives the audience a clear idea of what they re in for by transporting them back to the days of Gene Kelly when song and dance routines were routine even in the middle of a traffic jam All of these significant features and more add to the power of what great musical cinema can convey Gosling and Stone have a natural chemistry on par with that of Fred and Ginger especially during their dance numbers They also have such beautiful singing voices and this is most prominent in the recurring musical motif City of Stars John Legend Rosemarie DeWitt and J K Simmons deliver effective supporting performances but it is Stone and Gosling who are truly front and center Even their dialogue feels succinctly believable despite or rather because of their song and dance tendencies Stone in particular has an especially distinguishable screen presence that puts her in the same league as Judy Garland while Gosling seems like the modern day reincarnation of many of our favorite song and dance men from the Golden Age In what has been a tumultuous year La La Land serves as both a bright spot and a fantastic tribute to the movie musicals of days gone by,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7364433/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2017,La La land: Singing in the Gosylingstone rain,If you were into films around 2016 you would have heard of La La land even if you were just a causal movie goer you would have at least heard the name People were still are in love with this film so much so in fact that there was popular backlash to La La land during the time leading up and after the Oscars Only now has this backlash appeared to have vanished This was partly the reason why I someone who loves musicals did not see La La Land sooner I wanted to wait until things had cooled down La La Land tells the tale of a struggling actress Mia Emma Stone and wannabe Jazz musician Sebastian Ryan Gosling crossing paths and falling in love in the back drop of Hollywood and trying to keep themselves together as professional ambition threatens to drive the two apart I love musicals always have done One of my favorite movies is Singing in the Rain and La La Land is a clear inspiration spiritual successor to the 1952 classic That if anything was one of the biggest selling points for La La Land and I think it does it very well From the opening song and dance number to Sebastian and Mia tap dancing against a sun setting bathed hill breathes Singing in the rain that has just enough identity of its own so it does not rip off the inspiration but respect and honor it There is not one musical number that feels out of place or does not add to the movie in some form which I do think is an improvement to Singing in the rain which did suffer from some dance numbers that felt like padding Looking at you Broadway Melody La La Land s plot might not be the most complex plot in the world but it is compelling and is well paced The music numbers do not feel out of place and do not derail the plot in any way as well as being spaced out enough so both can exist without diminishing the other Mia And Sebastian are interesting and likeable Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone give it their all in terms of performances the romance not only feels believable but also goes to different places then Singing in the rain took it s romance in a ending that is bittersweet and poignant The ending helps the movie stand apart from its inspiration and give it its own identity I love it Unfortunately as a true successor to Singing in the rain La La land falls short by one key factor The dancing the dance choreography is weak and stilted in comparison to other musicals especially to Singing in the rain which as most would know was well known for its ground breaking dance numbers Another reason why most the dancing is weak would be because none of the main stars were professional dancers Ryan Gosling did take dancing lessons for this movie not sure about Emma Stone so the dancing would be very simple and a little out of step with the music which is almost always upbeat and cheerful the choreography could have been better if it was going to be a real successor to Singing in the rain But without the comparison it is fine not the best but works well enough La La Land is a great musical I would not say that it is one of the best movie musicals but it is one hell of an enjoyable watch A must see for any musical fan,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4015008/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2017,I regret buying a ticket to this turkey -- and I went to a matinée,The production is slick Supporting roles are strong casting John Legend as a musician takes money I guess but it s an easy win But making a musical requires leads who can sing and dance Gosling can t sing at all well and Emma Stone simply can t produce pleasant sounds Neither can dance at all well and in at least one scene Stone not only danced badly but repeated her moves a failed trick in Flashdance and no better here The movie lasts too long given its weak themes and then when it could be stopped and the audience blessedly released it generates an alternate ending no visible reason for this dodge that makes it another 20 minutes or so long If I were at home I would have turned it off but my significant other had a very large bucket of popcorn to finish so I had to sit through it,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3764870/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2017,Boring.,I waited for the DVD and now I want to sell it This musical was so boring It is not a cinematic treasure or sun drenched masterpiece It is boring The story is not a story really just boring Besides the lack of a story the characters are boring I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in other roles but they were clearly out of their element in this musical Simple fact they cannot sing or dance WTF Plus the dance scenes are so pitiful so short and so few it is a wonder they were featured in commercials Did the two even try to learn to dance and sing I long for the days of the musical film Chicago with Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger Catherine is a singer and dancer but Renee wasn t but she learned and she did a good job Even Richard Gere was a great pick for that film Hollywood needs to find that casting director and hire them for the next musical,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3731210/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2017,A love letter to Hollywood with a modern twist,The first half and last scene of this film are simply outrageously gorgeous Amazing music clap your hands with delight dancing with quite the cast It brings tears to your eyes goosebumps to the back of your neck and a nostalgia even this 26 year old can appreciate The middle third half of the film brings the modern twist to this film it shows the audience that the optimism of youth sometimes has to give way to practicalities of life that sometimes means that you might have to cash in to fulfil the dreams of your younger self This I think is a great narrative to live by especially for the generations after mine who seek fame for fame s sake rather than attempting to be the best at something first Now I know some people say that there is a lot of mansplaining in this film that s for other people to decide Since I m a white male I can t really comment on that Another criticism that I had was the opening scene as brilliant as it was needed more WOW factor it s the opening of a musical you can ramp up the volume make things brighter and happier Whilst it is amazing and awe inspiring you were straining to hear what was being said and after the hype of this scene you felt a bit meh Another criticism has been the last scene personally I loved it It s a classic what could have been that everyone feels at some point in their life The idealised view that life could have been happier and racier However they have gotten to where they want to be and would they have managed that whilst being together Who knows As the title says this movie is a love song to classic Hollywood whilst poking fun at itself and having a liberal sprinkling of modern touches I loved it though I do acknowledge the criticisms some of which I accept some I don t quite buy,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623368/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,The most cliche story ever made told in the most interesting way possible,La La Land has moments of greatness such as the finale but if you remove the musical elements there isn t a compelling story The story of two people falling in love with each other is extremely clich as is but here it is the absolute bare bones of that outline Can great actors performances and a great soundtrack make up for that To some degree The film also has lots of character and its worth watching just for the 3rd act alone,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7845270/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2017,College amateur production about being a jerk,The moral of the La La Land story is you can t have your cake and it if you are a jerk No wonder this film was so popular in Hollywood where so many jerks abound who can feel reassured that their messed up lives are fate not because of their own idiocy Yes you can have the love of your life and pursue the passion of your life if you re not a jerk about it And have contrived ego laden dinner conversations that you storm away from with the emotion maturity of a 12 year old The very first sequence sets the two protagonists up as couple of self absorbed jerks And the final sequence pivots on what could have been if Sebastian hadn t been a jerk from the outset But other than that the film had all the hesitant dance steps plot transparency wooden acting except Emma Stone off key singing and simplistic 2 chord tune drilled into the ground of a college amateur production,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3860995/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2023,Tangible Sensationalism,La La Land turns complex ideas of wonder and wishes into a spectacular film that never falls short of beautiful The use of color and music throughout this whole movie shows the love of film as a medium as held by the entire creative team La La Land has some of the quirkiest niche content but it s done with such passion and skill that I couldn t help the smile that plagued my face for the bulk of the watch Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone light a fire with the tools of choreography and impeccable writing that burns from the first frames With a story that passes up utopian silliness for a regrettable reality my only problem is that I didn t watch it sooner,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8888671/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2016,La La Land: Ode to all Artists,La La Land This film is a gem I can t express enough how much I love this film As a person that s not so much Into musicals I can finally say that I Loved a musical La La Land is an ode to jazz but not just jazz It s an ode to all the artists From musicians to actors and actresses The struggle of those who want to achieve better things to those who have dreams I can truly say that this film is by far my favorite and the best film of 2016 Both actors Emma Stone who plays an aspiring actress and Ryan Gosling who plays a musician that plays jazz on the piano Bot characters were fleshed out and both performances delivered This film is not only about music but the romance is very strong in this film Both actors have played and worked together in other films before But as of now nothing beats the performance they showed in this film This film is being played in limited cinemas and the reason being is because the studio wanted this film to be a contender for the Oscar s For those that want to wait it will have a wide release in January I would not be surprised if Emma Stone get a nomination for best lead actress She is phenomenal And I wouldn t be surprised if Ryan Gosling gets a nomination as well plus the film for best screenplay and for best motion picture I can t express enough how good Emma Stone is in this Picture She truly shines and stands out in this picture I highly recommend this film you will not take away from the movie and you will definitely love the music that the film revolves around My only problem with the film was the ending It s nothing bad of sort it s still amazing and wonderful but it messed with my heart and my feelings were hurt It messes with concept of what if once people get see this movie they will understand But regardless if you like musicals mixed with heavy romance and comedy This film is must see La La Land 9 8 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3602358/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2017,Amazing and Powerful Movie Making,So I finally went out and saw LaLa Land before it was no longer in theaters I was expecting a dance tastic TV commercial type deal where a bunch of people continuously come out of nowhere and dancing to the camera and actually this is exactly how it begins After 10 minutes I was ready to make my move for a refund but i decided to give it more time and wow was I rewarded for sticking to it I powered through some additional dancing and singing and eased into the plot which really focuses on two people who are working hard to improve their financial lives I ll avoid any spoilers so this won t go into much detail about the movie specifics Several times throughout the film they pointed to how the co stars each had big dreams and wanted to make their dreams come true They lived uncomfortable lives and several scenes such as a long stare into a old dried up roof leak on the ceiling silently illustrated how the great entrepreneur creator unsatisfaction helped drive them to make their dreams come true So instead of the typical Hollywood underlying theme of trying to break social molds the movie really focuses on the American Dream and the difficulties and heart ache that comes from pursuing your dreams The two characters push each other to continue even after having constant disappointments Each star is faced with hardship when wanting to do things their own way and each had to make decisions that might cause them to lose their dreams The reason the movie was such a great movie is that each of us face the same dilemma along with the search to do our dreams with someone we respect and care for So I highly recommend this movie and will forewarn you that you have to power through the cotton candy beginning to get into the fine dining that develops midway through and launches you into a fantastic and powerful ending All I will say about the ending is that a mesmerizing stare and a few notes on a piano get expanded into amazing and powerful movie making Congrats to everyone who made the movie possible,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3643097/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2022,Ended Strong,I really loved the ending of this movie and the way that it built itself up was effective The obvious use of lighting held the film together really well and I think there s a lot of good stuff here As long as you finish the movie I can say that I think you ll enjoy the experience The beginning of the movie though I did not like at all The first scene felt weak to me most of that feeling probably comes from how I feel about musicals in general but that opening scene also felt like it had no purpose since there were no characters behind it so it felt pointless to me I think the stylistic choices enhanced the film though specifically the lighting which made the scenes more personalized and isolating and the montages especially in the final scene were wonderful But I still think there was a lot of waste in this film throughout I really held onto that feeling until the final act and I suspect I d be less forgiving about it on second watch but the ending really makes the movie And the moral of the story if you can call it that that the timing doesn t always work out and that s okay is a good one A good watch,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8172461/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2017,Dear Hollywood: Please Stop Praising Mediocrity,Firstly I want to clarify that La La Land isn t a bad film It s fun has great production value and has some good acting along with some catchy songs The story is clear and to the point with a message you d want your kids to understand It d be great for a mindless movie night where you re too busy with the snacks and your mates to fully concentrate on artistic concepts or deep explorations of human nature But I was angry after watching it because it is not a great film or even a good one it s a passable film Passable films aren t deserving of 6 Oscars I m not normally a musical person although I fully appreciate why people enjoy them but watched it due to the hype expecting some kind of revolutionary masterpiece that would become one of the few musicals I actually like But yet again I was disappointed For a start the plot was bland and uninspiring with extremely little depth I know musicals generally don t go to much depth but if you re going to be the film of the year do something original The penniless artist trope has been done many times before and even here they made the characters flat and romanticised The film seemed to jump violently between a story about real people a homage to the classics and a pantomime Due to this I couldn t get immersed in the story at all nor get to know the characters By the end of it I realised I didn t care about them at all nor could I take any of it seriously A film should know what it is especially one that did so well The Moulin Rouge knew what it was so well that it had a giant metaphor for itself sitting in the middle of it but that comparative rant is for another day This film did nothing new It had the same approach as musicals made 50 years ago There was no modern spin placing it in the 21st century does nothing if the bones of it are the same And that would all be fine if it wasn t hailed as a masterpiece Filmmaking is an art and art needs to change and evolve Praising this is stunting the growth of a genre that could potentially be so much more Hollywood is spending so much time saying Look how great we are and Look how great we used to be that it s forgetting what makes film great originality and growth Hollywood needs to learn to embrace the new and daring although something tells me they never will Great films are being made these days but they don t have the visibility they deserve This film wont be remembered in the history books stop acting like it will,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3773812/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,Never say you have failed until you have reached your last attempt - and never say it's your last attempt until you have succeeded.,This is now the second time I watched La La Land and I do not hesitate in giving it 10 10 This movie has every satisfying element possible it is beyond magnificent and perfect The actors their performance directing production the script and soundtrack everything is so perfect It reminds me of the legendary musical Singin in the Rain from 1952 and I believe that in the future La La Land will be listed within the top echelon of musical films of all time This movie has moved me so much because I once was one of the people who resided in Hollywood it reminds me of the time I decided to continue my studies there Hollywood is where every talent who dreams of becoming successful actor performer singer and musician goes I have a group of close friends in Hollywood which I met when I was only 16 17 years old Everyone of them had a beautiful dream of becoming something but when time goes by each person had their own path and destiny it also depends on how much effort patience and luck each one of us is granted I was also dreaming of becoming a DJ and sound designer so I decided to continue my studies and would like to work in Hollywood after I graduated But in the end nothing turned out to be what I had dreamed In the end there s always two paths for us to choose to walk along following your dream tirelessly or flow along the stream in order to feed yourself Watching this movie is such a fresh start to the new year It s so good to see a legendary well made film with an inspiring story about someone who persistently follow their dreams in La La Land This award winning movie deserves every praise that it has received I strongly recommend anyone to see this movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621036/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2017,Overrated,While this movie has won many awards I can not see why The story line is decent but jumpy the ending is a disaster and the acting is a little over done To call this a musical is close but not quite songs were not catchy or necessary at times I really wanted to like this movie but I just couldn t come to like it Had to pause every 30 minutes or so to walk away because it dragged in many parts,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3697051/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2017,LaLa Review,The film La la Land is a story that is carried more by color and music than plot or characters That is not to say that the plot or characters take away from the film By nature musicals tend to compromise character traits and logical scenes for visuals and song People do not just randomly break into songs or dance to choreographed music It is difficult to create a musical because the songs should further the plot fit the characters and not feel too out of place This film does a decent job of matching the character s songs to their personalities but I believe that the focus of this movie lies with the colors The colors in this movie are widely varied both in locations and outfits Mia the main character wears several different dresses throughout the film These dresses vary wildly in color and appearance The purpose of the dresses appears to be mostly aesthetic giving Mia an outfit that would compliment the rest of the scene and make her stand out La la Land is a film that focuses heavily on aesthetics These dresses are used in conjunction with several scenes where the lighting changes to emphasize a specific color This is used to convey emotion as well as pull the viewer s attention to Mia and her actions during these scenes Scenes with dramatic lighting like this often end up showing more emotional aspects of the story As a musical how a character moves and looks is incredibly meaningful to the story Some of the most striking examples of the use of color include when Mia and Sebastian meet at the moment Sebastian is fired and when Mia and Sebastian argue over his dreams There are also several scenes that use color together with a low lighting such as when Mia enters the bathroom walks home or sings for her recital These scenes all take advantage of color to highlight both the characters and the atmosphere Another aspect that this film takes advantage of is the movement of the characters and camera It is not just the dancing that is eye catching although that is one of the main uses of movement utilized by the film When Mia and Sebastian first enter the observatory the camera spins around displaying the room This eventually leads to a dance in the star filled observatory itself where the characters appear to be dancing among the stars I am sure that this is a reference to something although I am not sure what This film is very much a product of it s time It is full of references to other movies both through the parody of specific scenes and the characters directly mentioning other movies of the time I believe that a portion of what endears this movie to people is the nostalgia of remembering great movies of the past This is not inherently a bad thing but younger members of the audience who may not remember such movies will not be able to receive the full experience the film was designed to provide The plot of this movie is relatively simple The main characters fall in love and decide to follow their dreams end up failing and break up only to seize the chance to follow their dreams again One interesting feature of the film is that while both characters are able to realize their dreams these dreams cause them to part ways effectively ending the romantic plot as they each go to live their own lives There is a happy ending but it can be seen that they compromised their relationship for the sake of their dreams It is possible that they could have made everything work out perfectly but I think such an ending would be much less satisfactory and that their ability to each pursue their own dream to fruition is what makes them such likable characters,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3817503/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2017,More a Jazz Standard than a Cinema Classic,Now the awards season is here the hype is a soprano A on this movie musical However the first half hits some flat notes before rising to a soaring crescendo and this was the problem for me in viewing La La Land I wanted to praise this movie so much more than I did I love the previous work of all involved and whilst they are all sublime yet again the first half seemed all a little too conceptual and made it hard to invest in the narrative However it is in the last 30 minutes this film is bang on perfect and the chemistry between the two leads really lands Part of what spoiled the movie for me were the previews Too many of the dazzling scenes were revealed and I wasn t surprised enough by the story or execution as I would have been if they had played their cards a little closer to their chests La La Land may well sweep the award season and I wouldn t begrudge the film if it does so I just so wanted it to be the classic many others purport it to be,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610934/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2017,"Very Good Movie, But Beware of the Hype",First and foremost don t get me wrong I really liked this movie I just didn t love it as much as many other people I went to a special event of this movie because I wanted to see it as soon as I could I heard the most wonderful things about it And it didn t really live up to the hype for me The movie is about two dreamers living in LA chasing their career dreams Emma Stone s character Mia wants to become an actress and Ryan Goslings character Sebastian wants to open his own jazz bar Soon they fall in love I have to say the movie looks breathtaking You can really feel that they live in LA the spirit of the city of angels is tangible Every part of this film is colorful and bright and sunny Every shot is like a well composed painting The costumes and make up is wonderful makes the movie feel a bit retro At first I thought the movie was set in the 50 s but it s present day But I didn t really mind because the characters themselves are quite nostalgic The acting was amazing I loved the characters Their chemistry felt really natural However I didn t really like their vocal talents actually Apart from John Legend s of course The music was fine though not as great as I hoped it would be Some of the songs bored me a little bit after a while The opening song was fantastic The story was a bit up and down for me I loved the first part it also had the best songs and dance routines The second halve of the movie lagged a bit for me It was also somewhat predictable The characters didn t seem to develop much further I really relate to the theme of the movie I myself am an aspiring artist I m a drawer and I m trying to find my way in visual development and storyboarding for movies So I know what it s like to hope for your big break and getting the door slammed in your face Therefore at some points I wished they focused more on that and less on the romantic plot Not because I don t like romantic movies I do but because the romantic plot wasn t really something new I have seen that movie many times The other storyline about young artist chasing their dreams in LA was much more refreshing The ending didn t really do it for me it was as if they were doubting themselves As if they weren t sure how to end it So yes like anyone will tell you this movie is great But don t expect too much like I did I thought this was going to be the best movie of the year for me and it wasn t If I hadn t heard about all the hype before I would have been pleasantly surprised but as it is it was just a good film Go see it,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3617652/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2017,La La Land – A Real Classic of this Generation,La La Land produced by Marc Platt Fred Berger and Jordan Horowitz and expertly written as well as masterfully directed by relative newcomer Damien Chazelle simply put truly is a masterpiece and is surely destined to go down as one of the classics of this generation of filmmaking This is a prime example of one of those rare films in which on every level it seems to succeed where all elements of the film including performances story writing direction and soundtrack come together in such a way that such a sweet ensemble of filmmaking is produced of the very highest standard Here Chazelle following his equally commendable outing as writer and director of the critically acclaimed Whiplash manages to perfectly encapsulate the magic that really made classic musicals such as 1952 s Singin in the Rain sparkle and resonate in such a magnificent sort of way Not only does Chazelle accomplish this with La La Land he goes a step further in bringing a much needed freshness to the film as well as the genre as a whole making both La La Land and the musical genre relevant in the world of today The brilliantly vibrant La La Land never disappoints with a dull scene sequence or even a dull shot for that matter and instead constantly amazes and impresses delivering a rich tapestry of colourful scenes sequences and shots all dripping with technical and artistic nuances as well as creative flair You really can tell how much love and just how much hard work went into every scene of this project and how painstakingly it has been put together through with great editing and fine attention to detail being paid throughout Linus Sandgren American Hustle heads the outrageously good cinematography bringing his use of frantic yet controlled camera work to Damien Chazelle s artistic vision During the impressive music sequences that look as though most are shot as whole one shot sequences unless there is some equally impressive editing going on it is as though the camera is playing a cat and mouse kind of game constantly on the move always one step behind but always right there with the action that needs to be shot The camera and lighting almost become dancers within the musical themselves spinning darting and dancing from shot to shot punching in between characters with expert precision creating noticeably compelling and emotional storytelling Transitions into musical numbers often combine the camera moving in towards the character as a subtle lighting effect of some type illuminates the character as if this were a musical being performed on stage Enough praise cannot be given to the outstanding music used within the musical packed full of such musical delights as the quietly hopeful yet melancholy City of Stars and Mia and Seb s Theme as well as the more energetic and upbeat opening song Another Day in Sun and the following Someone in the Crowd The musical performances of the two leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone can also not go without praise Neither are professional singers dancers or musicians but neither are their characters both are believable in all of their entertaining musical performances displaying impressive vocals and particularly impressive piano playing on the part of Mr Gosling As stated above Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling head the spot on casting of the film playing the roles of smart headstrong aspiring actress Mia and sarcastic down on his luck jazz musician and enthusiast Sebastian respectively Both performances are very thought out and believable and the chemistry between the two actors this being their third film together is so great and just adds to the overall believability of the relationship the two characters share At the start of their stories we find both characters at a point in their lives that they didn t expect to find themselves in expecting or at least hoping to have been living the more glamorous life of having made it by now They are both irked with the clich s of todays Hollywood life and fed up of being told they are not good enough constantly finding themselves on the cusp of making it but unfortunately never succeeding More fortunately though they end up finding each other along the way when a chance encounter occurs between the two characters sparks eventually fly and a romance blossoms through the shared exasperation of their own lives The following love affair plays out through the four different seasons of the year where we see not only passion for one another grow but we also see the rekindling of the passion for each of their professions in one way or another and through the inspiration and motivation they gain off of each other wherein lies our conflict Tension is built through the conflict at the core of this love torn romantic musical story which is in essence the long fought battle between ambition and love You are made to thin that the romance of this film refers only to the romance between the two leading characters however this is not the case The romance of pursuing one s passion for their craft and the heartache that comes along with such passion is also an integral part of the superb narrative being told here concluding in one of the deepest and most meaningful as well as thought provoking and bittersweet climaxes to a film I have seen in a long time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3854144/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2017,A Fun But Overrated Musical,Perhaps it was all the hype but I came away from viewing La La Land a bit underwhelmed Yes it was a fun film with some heart and the whole family can enjoy it It does remind you of films from Hollywood s better days How often do we get to see a script to screen musical I understand that some members of the academy perhaps wanted to encourage more of this kind of film making and I d like to see more as well That said this is not a great film It does have it s moments The story is bittersweet and the cinematography is wonderful LA hasn t looked this good in a long time I enjoyed the music especially the theme track There s a lot of energy in this film and it keeps you interested from beginning to end But I don t think the final product deserves all the Oscars even if I ve never thought much of them anyway Everything is done well even really well at times The lead actors are earnest and likable We re rooting for them but it doesn t add up in the end I found the progression of the plot in the final 30 minutes to be a bit of a stretch These two were never really meant for each other I found their friendship much more believable than their romance Neither actor is a skilled dancer musician or singer They pulled it off but their performances aren t memorable Viewing La La Land was a fun two hours but I m not interesting in watching it a second time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3873183/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2016,Enthralling,It s so surreal is the sentiment of my cross dimensional trip to La La Land Throughout the journey my modes of transport constantly switch from land to air without a prior notice as the jazz was blaring and songs were impeccably cutting in It was a ride like no other shifting elegantly from reality to dreams and evoking the nostalgia of Singin in the Rain The transition is just so perfect that you d adore how fantasy was woven into life to the point which you might have to scream your lungs out goddamn it this is too beautiful for me to handle I would ve literally screamed when the movie was about to start because some people around my seat were talking and commenting like they were some god like movie experts whom everybody else was eager to seek opinions from Shut up you insensitive self centered conversationalists Thankfully the scene jingled instantly and riveted me from all nuisances I thought I knew what kind of movie I was expecting when the drivers stomped out of their vehicles hopped on the roofs and performed an upbeat song in the middle of traffic My feet were tapping on their own accord and I couldn t wait to see the main characters singing out their stories But unlike other movies in which the characters express feelings in a fabulous way The song halted and everyone just returned to their cars like nothing had occurred The musical intention unfolded itself The songs don t tell the story They are the story I m not going to bother you with the plot because I think everyone should approach this movie without a clue Trust me The story is so simple that you may not give it a second thought But the way the mastermind behind Whiplash told it is enthralling One of my most favorite scenes is when Mia came to her movie audition and was asked to improvise a story The transition of lights and speech to music was so good that you ll resent me if I provide more detail and I won t Here s to the ones who dream sang Mia I feel that it was more of a message for those who don t So bring on the rebels The roles from pebbles The painters and poets and plays It was like a protest to confront a materialistic society to not give up on dreamers their hope and imaginative contributions That was the whole point of La La Land Follow your dreams and don t care what others think The concept is old But I m glad people like Damien Chazelle still believe in it and encourage everybody else to bravely pursue the path of the fools The ending is either wonderful or sad or wonderfully sad or sadly wonderful depending on your own perspective It brings back to my mind the memories of the Casablanca especially the play it Sam moment and that unforgettable ending in which Ilsa had to choose between getting in the plane with Victor Lazslo or staying with Rick Blaine I just simply can t put my thoughts into words when the last shot of La La Land faded,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3602625/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,Very enjoyable but the end left me a bit flat,I built up a high level of anticipation in seeing this film I enjoy both Ryan G and Emma S as actors and like music The high ratings on IMDb also added to the anticipation I found myself quite engrossed in the story and where it was going It was filled with the day to day ups and downs of life and the beauty of aspiring to dreams and love I play the piano and enjoy Jazz and dancing so appreciated the melodic intertwining of the music through the story line Both main actors did a good job with the dancing and singing given they are not professionals in these areas As much as I enjoyed the film I found myself a bit flat at the end as I didn t interpret the ending as a joyous one unlike other reviewers that said it was inspiring and a feel good ending This was not the case for me I felt the ending could have been done much better and there was too much of a gap in the story that was covered in the last 15 or so mins I enjoyed the singing dancing story and overall cinematography the movie had a great realistic emotional romantic feel to it Just felt a bit let down at the end though,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3606228/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2016,A Cinematic Painting,There s always 2 or 3 movies a year that are considered amazing 10 10 or perfect but it ends up being just really good or average but not perfect Well that doesn t apply to La La Land I drove 30 minutes out of town to catch this at a theater since it was the closest place showing it near me in the state and it was beyond worth it Admittedly I wasn t completely sold during the first 4 minutes even though it was perfectly filmed and choreographed But once this film takes off into the story line and characters lives I fell completely in love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have amazing believable chemistry obviously They re able to play off each other so well and make their characters feel very authentic and they re more than up for the task of dancing singing and having great timing with the hilarious jokes that make this the most enjoyable experience all year for me Also Emma Stone hasn t been better She s the stronger of the two with being able to cross the line between determined and desperate for a career that you almost couldn t tell if it wasn t for the way her eyes water and seem as if they have their own hands trying to reach for success And her performance of Dreamers is one of the best movie musical performances ever since Anne Hathaway s I Dreamed a Dream Damien Chazelle the director created his masterpiece and this is only his third film after Whiplash which I honestly wasn t a big fan of But this time him and his team gave birth to a vibrant precise and endlessly fun movie that s able to show the struggle of wanting to follow your passion paired with the best camera work ever and great music He s able to breathe life into jazz and the movie musical while saying they were never dead in the first place Everything in this film jumps off of the screen and fills you with joy Needless to say Chazelle and Ryan Gosling s next film together about Neil Armstrong in space already has me excited seeing how the the space scene in this movie killed me and brought me to life at the same time I could say about 3 paragraphs more but I ll shut up Long story short La La Land is everything it s made out to be and more It s definitely 1 of 2 of my top favorite movies of the year and I m glad this was the last one I saw in a theater in 2016 Please go and watch this if you can,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610019/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2019,Nice!,La La Land is really really good and I wish I saw it sooner I think I might go on YouTube and rewatch some of the songs And a never do that I honestly don t know what to say it s just a good movie This film succeeds on avery technicol level The cinematography set design makeup costume design editing and CGI is all great The CGI isn t there that much but when it is it s pretty good in terms of the film it s set in This segways into my next positive thing The fakeness I know what your thinking but the fakeness is a good thing in this movie This movie is a commentary and tribute to Jazz and Hollywood The two leads both have big dreams one wants to be an actor the other wants to own a jazz club They both retreat from their normal lives with these artforms plus they both live in LA this also applies when they are dating each other Also when I say the fakeness I mean the CGI random spotlights random dancing and montages It has a sense of Hollywood in its golden age which I can t really explain This is called good directing When you watch it it feels like your watching a beautifully filmed play because of this The writing is also very good you get the sense that these people have been together for a while and really know each other I got more out of this movie than I thought I would and I enjoyed it very much This is the best film of 2016 and I highly recommend it Stay tuned for more reviews coming soon including but not limited to Joker Bee Movie and The Scream Trilogy,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5192822/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2016,anti-Chinese sentiments in a movie that could be good,The movie itself isn t bad It could be a good movie What strikes me is the anti Chinese sentiments that is repeatedly expressed in this movie The French Anglo director Damien Chazelle is obviously racist against the Chinese First he made Ryan Gosling tell the audience that nobody would ever want Chinese coffee Later on Emma Stone s boyfriend who s supposed to portray a real jerk shows that he does business with Chinese people He also tells that the Chinese is building a bridge which is controversial as a hidden political message to the movie viewer This Frenchman obviously has a lot of hidden anti Chinese frustration and tries to use La La Land as racist anti Chinese propaganda for his own hidden political racist views against ethnic Chinese people The movie s story itself wasn t bad and it was quite well executed but ruined by the butt hurt personal political frustration of this racist French Anglo director writer Damien Chazelle It s no wonder that an Asian Man White woman couple is the only couple that has been banned from showing in this movie If the movie wasn t politically motivated I would give it a higher score,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3609491/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2017,"Magical and warming, a true cinematic great.",Admittedly this was the first time experiencing a romantic musical at the cinema for me and I was a little apprehensive Drawn in by the accolades it had received however my wife and I decided to give it a go and took our seats at the local movie theatre on a Saturday evening How good could a musical love story really be Two hours later I had my answer and that answer was very very very good indeed The first twenty minutes or so of the movie is very much a full on musical affair songs huge dance sequences very vibrant and colourful and its OK if you like that sort of thing but then there is a moment when the two main characters connect and you connect with them and from that point onwards the film just gets better and better until the ending which stays with you for days afterwards along with the haunting piano melody of Mia and Sebastians theme tune Gosling and Stones on screen chemistry is the best you ll see all year natural and believable they draw you right into the story I can t imagine another two actors who would fit this movie as well as they do The other real star of the show is Los Angeles This movie is a real homage to the city of angels The sunsets palm trees beaches and warm colours of the horizon seen from the Hollywood hills adds to the romance and is all shot so beautifully that it makes you want to book a flight and visit Definitely a movie to watch at the cinema if you still can If you connect with the characters and story then you most definitely won t regret it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3646057/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2017,so real,I have never written a review before on IMDb But I have to say a couple of things about this film It wasn t all about love It was also about life itself It was so real There was sadness and happiness at the same time The film was so colourful but it wasn t girly at all It was t like the other clich Hollywood films The soundtrack the casting the costumes were all great I watched Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone together in Crazy Stupid Love and Gangster Squad too But these two films were not that stunning Maybe the scenario wasn t good enough But their roles in La La Land were perfect for them That s why they both are nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress Oscars,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631280/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2016,Here's to all the dreamers,Damien Chazelle did it again His Whiplash knocked it out of the park two years ago and La La Land is everything we can ask for and more The fabulous score and the skillful direction make this piece a thoroughly engrossing experience The chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone works like a charm Chazelle shows us how to craft a movie that is as well tuned as a seasoned jazz pianist s instrument We can enjoy the harmonious relationship between the cadence of the plot and that of the melodies weaved into the fabric of the story La La Land is much more than a musical it speaks to anyone who lets themselves be awed by high quality professional art The entire movie feels just right in its pacing its style and surprisingly perhaps its message It is uplifting when a film manages to encourage us to chase our dreams without being naively ignorant of life outside the movie theater We are told a Hollywood story that rises above itself It brings value into a frivolous genre with ease joy and all the right moves,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3609765/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2016,A magical salute to the romantic Hollywood musical,La la Land may not be everyone s cup of tea but let s look at why there are so many reasons to see this inspired film To name a few important ones go see it if you believe in the power of music dance romance and dreams This film beguiled me and I can see how it beguiles its viewers through its lighthearted approach to a serious topic how do we chase and hold on to our dreams without losing them Hats off to Damien Chazelle for reviving the musical genre in an engaging and thoroughly entertaining way The acting writing and direction are spot on The movie takes some time to build momentum in the story line but when it does it really takes you on a journey Emma Stone is perfectly cast as the vulnerable and quirky young actress while Ryan Gosling s character is a complex layer of jazz tradition dreams stubbornness clarity and magic all spun together I loved that the director saluted the hey day and romance of the Hollywood musical and that perhaps it s not a genre that is dead but very much alive If you re willing to let the film take you on a journey and suspend your expectations the magic of this film will find its way into your heart and mind I also say hats off to the ending which was both inspired and realistic and not a typical Hollywood ending but still retains a lingering touch of magic like the final note of a piano piece that still resonates in the air after it ends Two thumbs up,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3610196/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2017,Very original film worthy of its hype (if you appreciate filmmaking).,I don t like musicals at all but I loved La La Land The reason for this is simple It s unlike any movie I ve ever seen I have a huge appreciation for the way films are made so when I watch one as innovative as this it s really special The plot of La La Land isn t really what the hype is all about Two twenty somethings fall in love while trying to achieve their dreams in L A That s pretty much it The plot moves slowly at times because a lot of the film relies on visuals not dialogue I think this is the main reason people don t understand the hype surrounding La La Land and I totally get that However if you know anything about the way movies are made you understand EXACTLY what the hype is about The cinematography is so unique I ve never seen light implemented quite like this before in all my years of watching movies The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is palpable and even though they aren t professional singers by any means there is so much heart in their singing that it doesn t matter The score is superb The costume design is effortless and brilliant The musical talent of Gosling on the piano is wonderful La La Land is reminiscent of old Hollywood in a way that will make you feel nostalgic for a time and place you ve never even been to So if you don t like La La Land that s totally fine but I recommend you watch it a second time with a more careful eye The hype surrounding this film isn t about what you see at first glance but about all the little details that bring it together A movie like this doesn t come around very often that s WHY it s overrated,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3651363/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2017,I came out of the closet because of this movie!,By that I mean the musical closet gotcha What a visual masterpiece some say being critical about something shows how much respect one has about what is being criticized worthy of critique I feel La La Land has received quite a bit of mixed views because somehow it portrait a telltale which is very dream like if not unrealistic Is that really the point La La Land praises the very medium it is being portrayed through film and cinema it does so in a thoroughly enjoyable way by delivering the panache colour splash and the dazzle most of us actually dream of It is an optimistic vision in a world full of anger It is a nostalgic protest a loud praise for musicals of old and it is beautiful The cinematic execution is out of this world the production music fidelity filmography costumes the love for the form is transpiring through the silver screen It makes you want to dance sing and celebrate are those feelings hard to enjoy It also makes you sad and angry at times it surprises it is FUN It delivers all that with what I would call a perfectly fitting ending The scene on the clouds why care if it was corny All the awkward bits play into our own subconscious anxieties and insecurities at least for some Oh well a solid bloody 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721278/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2018,A complete waste of time of a complete overrated movie,After hearing all the praise and glory of this movie on the radio and TV I ve decided to give it a chance and couldn t believe what I ve seen There were terrible numbers terrible dancers terrible acting and terrible songs I could hardly get to the end of this movie as it was a complete torture and pain for my ears and eyes The main actors can t sing and can t dance the songs are of the same low level and it all seemed to me like a low budget movie Hearing it d got so many Oscars was no doubt the last nail in the academy s coffin What were they thinking Oscar for what Two new actors that bring nothing to the screen No feelings no acting no singing and no dancing nothing Look carefully at their dance they simply can t and don t dance Hear carefully their singing they can t don t really sing Do you remember any tune from the movie other the one they keep playing on the radio or any dance This was a clearly PR movie full of buzz and empty inside I highly recommend avoiding this one Don t see and don t waste your time on it If you wan a musical to love see The Greatest Showman that s the right way to go,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4213672/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2023,Day Dreaming,Sometimes when I am engaged in the chaos of everything everywhere all at once I muse about another place and time That reverie is in La La Land in a club with a neon sign at a table with a low lit candle listening to the softer side of jazz reminiscing about licorice pizza looking into the eyes of my favorite person among all those I remember Thus was my initial emotive impression of this fictional film The story starts with an upbeat meeting of two individual young adults aiming to find a path in life with respect to their vocation and relationship but with vocation trumping relationship Nature enters and they fall in love and their relationship now trumps vocation Through tough times they support each other and begin to achieve their vocational roles in life Alas their relationship falls victim to the requirements of their vocations The relationship mutually fractures Five years later they briefly interact in a jazz nightclub as two people passing through a dark night without a word but as their eyes connect there appears a slight mutual reminiscent smile There are touching moments in this film but this scene is the most poignant The time of the classical musical romance film is waning but this one has adapted achieving balance between the musical and romantic parts It struck me that it requires a multitude of entities and people each with unique skill sets and standardized emotions to come together to make a movie However the individual emotional parts synthesize to create an emotional whole which is unique and entirely new,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9299502/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2016,A Musical And More. About Having Dreams And Falling In Love.,I ll give this movie a 10 To me it deserves that much The movie has everything Sure the musical aspect of the movie will not appeal to most people After all when people think musical its either Les Miserable Grease or Disney Films La La Land however is so much more It is about having dreams of performing about hope and of course about love Ryan Gosling plays Sebastian who can t afford to pay his rent because he can t find a stable gig He dreams of opening his own Jazz bar and he has such a passion for jazz that you start to love jazz too Jazz is dying and he is on a crusade to save it Emma Stone on the other hand plays Mia who is an aspiring actress However she fails all of her auditions miserably They meet and fall in love and the rest goes like how love stories goes Except with singing and dancing Ryan Gosling is one of my favourite actors so it definitely helps that he is playing the lead role And as he is also a good singer it seems a perfect fit Emma Stone on first impression seems like a different role than she normally gets But she pulls it off perfectly The chemistry that these two have on previous movies together can also be seen here The movie definitely has class The musical scores and the songs especially the jazz To be honest some of the musical scene might get a little bit draggy but thats only for the 40 mins when you re getting used to having a song sung by the actors after every new scene It mellows down afterwards and gets bit more serious I love the pace of the movie because you get to know the characters and feel their motivation of why they love performing and why they choose to Act or play jazz I left the movie charmed by it It is a definite must see Not for everyone to be honest But personally its up there with the notebook,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601164/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2019,the making of an american artist,While presenting the audience with spectacular sceneries La La Land instills American ideology in them Enclosing a clich chick flick with the form of musical La La Land just like its predecessor Whiplash is essentially about the director Chazelle s perception of the making of an artist According to what Chazelle has implies in La La Land if you want to become an artist in modern America you have to 1 be talented 2 chase your dreams 3 wait to be discovered by discerning art people 4 enjoy your success as a bourgeois now that you got everything you wanted During this process you will be lonely much of the time Few people in your life would you get along with They all talk about parties world politics and business the things you do not quite care Art is the only thing you are passionate about In La La Land neon lights always surround the leads Their art their dream and their love are elevated and glorified through the whole film Even the whole universe serves as the background for this love As their lives are filled with philistines we witness two artist wannabes against the world What Chazelle has understood as the making of an artist is fundamentally a clumsy fusion of the myth of great artists and the age long American dream In the former talent always triumphs though the artists are never properly appreciated by their contemporaries Consider the cases of van Gogh who cut his whole ear off and Gauguin who according to Maugham left home for an island to draw inspiration In the latter hard work is always rewarded well Chazelle uncritically absorbs the two ways of making an artist ignoring all logistical loopholes After all life and arts are among the few things that could not be made successful simply through hard work Convinced by the concept of American dream Chazelle is an American patriot at heart He sets his film in Los Angeles and he alludes to the distinct American classics jazz musicals and Rebel Without a Cause As well as elevating the two young artists Chazelle is also elevating these American cultural icons he loves The problem is the film implies a problematic understanding of high art pop culture and sociopolitical context By making fun of vulgar people Chazelle categorically dismisses any value of pop hits But jazz was a treasure for suffering African American people Musicals appealed to a wide range of audience for its hedonistic qualities Rebel Without a Cause is a hymn of discontented youths who struggle to find larger significance for their mundane lives None of these seem to qualify as the kind of high art Chazelle emulates in this film and Chazelle a Harvard graduate fails to understand the campy nature of James Dean s performance that makes Rebel Without a Cause a cult classic of all time In the end La La Land is just another film about self absorbed art people set in Los Angeles The more it strives for a status of classic the more it reveals its propagandist nature,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5349361/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2017,a musical with surprises,La la land is a musical rom com film starring Ryan gosling and Emma stone in the leading roles of a musician trying to find his way and a somewhat failing actress this film is an beautiful love letter to Hollywood and music as they are blended into one musical film hybrid one aspect that needs the highest praise is the absolutely beautiful and emotional music throughout the movie that drags you into the film and is an absolute beauty to listen to that sets the tone perfectly for every scene in this movie but as every film has its best parts it also has its bad parts Characters As everyone knows every film needs good leads to captivate and engross the audience and this film has exactly that the characters throughout the film expresses their struggle with their careers and their personal struggles as well which makes the audience sympathetic for the the characters and understand them as people the chemistry between the two leads is so convincing and shows the development of their characters because of each other showing their support and love for each other but also falls due to the clich s of romance tropes but tells a much deeper personal story within the characters and their dependence on each other The on screen chemistry between the leads of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone was a great addition to this film and really drove the film for me in my opinion along with the music although the romance does fall due to the clich s it is easily the best part and really developed the romance in such a way that it felt real i cannot praise the superb job the actors did in their respective roles and is worth all the praise Plot When it comes to the plot of the film for me its kind of hard to pin down what it was really about i know the answer would be clear to other people who have seen the film but for me it was more of a music drives the film forward and gave me a better understanding of the story more then the actual film did which is quite a unique experience being a big fan of the type of music used to tell the story in this film i enjoyed it a lot more then anticipated and got engrossed in the emotional impactful scenes that grabbed my attention and left me speechless one problem i did have with this film was the way they executed the balance between the musical side of the film and the character interactions and development at many times during the film i would often forget it was a musical because of the imbalance of story being told and the musical side this would often become jarring but the absolutely fantastic music made up for the problem which was an easy way to keep the audiences attention overall this film was fantastic and well worth the watch due to its fantastic music and great acting along with the great on screen chemistry from the leads of this film if any movie goer has two and a half hours definitely see this film even if you are not a fan of musicals 9 out of 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625702/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2017,A film for old WASP,Let s make America great again and this is his kind of movie This is a film directed at WASP who long for the times of The Racial Segregation Syruped with a touch of fantasy land where everything is clean colorful safe prosperous rich neat and without the least concern Everything ready so that the characters impeccable model of a WASP overcome small obstacles to achieve their dream life Black People Negroes only exist as a bearable cargo and are a mere accessory There are no colored people of any kind nor any race The only Latino person spic who only appears to the end is an acceptable accident The rest is only white for racist WASP who miss the old southern white times and for whom the rest of humanity does not exist except to abuse it by waging war and then we know the rest White men and women of the last century who have always lived longing for the world of white fantasy that some rulers of the contemporary America have promised them that someday will come It is a shameful that The Academy have given Oscars to this type of film,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3687187/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,In the Realm of Kitsch,This movie puzzles I watched it two days ago and I m still a bit confused There is no doubt it is well done It touches you The last scene is amazing and brings a tear to the eye It also full of interesting commentary on life like when Gossling s band mate asks him How can you be a revolutionist if you re such a traditionalist There s amazing freshness that the director brings to the screen for example the long car horn flashback and it s subsequent use throughout the film But there s no denying the film has issues that depending on what you re expecting will affect the way you see it 1 Is it too long or too slow It could be The first kiss scene for example seems to be an endless impossible build up But the question is is the kiss really important If you don t care about rushing to anywhere maybe you can just enjoy the long dance and talk and fantasy that precedes it And that s true for the whole film 2 Is it full of clich s Yes It is You will enter the Realm of Kitsch But hey it s a musical for heaven s sake And it s even called La La Land So why should you expect anything else There is no effort to avoid clich s or kitsch on the contrary they are sought after and elevated This movie is an ode to innocence To the old naive cinema The characters are not complicated they have simple drives The narrative isn t complicated an important evening the other promises to be there but he she forgot that they have other engagement etc a pure and clich expression of the conflict between love and life It sells you the big dreams of being an artist and not selling out of romantic love that transcend time But so what These are universal themes that we all should be reminded of sometimes even if they are far far far from our realist and complicated life 3 There s also the tiny con that the actors didn t always hit the note too well But it s not too bad or noticeable I think if you will take all this into consideration you will enjoy this movie tremendously But even if you don t it s still a good fun movie that is definitely worth seeing,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625004/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2018,Don't believe the hype!,I couldn t sit through more than 20 minutes of this movie I have no concept as to why everyone loves this movie so much and how it won so many awards It it such a boring movie with a weak storyline lacklustre singing and songs that I couldn t even recall if I tried Do yourself a favour and do not believe the hype give this one a big miss,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4123038/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2016,Even if you don't like musicals you might still like this one.,First of all I hate musicals I really do By my opinion movies should be just about acting Singing just makes them look ridiculous But that s my personal opinion and if you share my view than this review might be useful for you To be honest the only reason why I went to see this movie is the fact that I have a cinema season ticket I didn t have any expectations and maybe that s main part of the reason why I really liked it There is not that much singing and even when actors sing it blends nicely to the plot it just doesn t look silly Also the soundtrack is amazing Basically it s just one melody throughout the whole movie but its very catchy and you will end up humming the tune for the rest of the day But back to the movie It s a love story It s not original but still quite nice and it has the potential to raise emotions I enjoyed it and I was really surprised how much entertaining it was Also the acting is actually very good Especially the parts where the actor is trying to be an actor She is very convincing This is only third movie of the director but when you take in mind that it was directed by the same person who created Whiplash and 10 Cloverfield Lane than you must know that it will be good as I enjoyed both his previous movies a lot So in short This movie is worth your time Pure entertainment But be aware that the ending might surprise you,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3609487/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2018,Emmm...Just cliches,Honestly I think High School Musical is more enjoyable than this Emma Stone is hot af as always Everything else is cliche after cliche also their fight makes no sense And why can t Ryan Gosling just have a smooth and happy relationship in movies,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4224248/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2017,Not a date movie,I don t recommend bringing a date to this movie because of The story is decent the last ten minutes made me cringe hoping they do not screw up the ending It is not difficult to guess what the ending is going to be but the journey to the conclusion is what makes this interesting The singing and dancing was not really that good OK for the shower at home but not for Hollywood They are good actors but you need different skill sets for the other two He was stronger than her When they dance in an ensemble the lack of grace and smoothness shows This is about young lovers dreaming big and hitting the reality barrier and making adult choices Not date movie,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3621186/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2019,"A enjoyable movie that was never dull, and was truly fun to watch",While the storyline may not be appreciated by all who watch this film there is no denying this is one masterpiece of a film Chazelle s use of colour sound and light are some of the most creative I ve ever seen The cinematography was used very creatively to work with the other visual components of the film Both Gosling and Stone give terrific performances and perfectly showcase their skills in both acting and singing Ultimately a very enjoyable cinematic experience,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4890877/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2017,La La Land was a captivating sensory adventure,The world was magical so I put up with intermittent excessive song and dance An ever present current of warm piano gave the film a sense of unity that felt reminiscent of Chazelle s prior film Whiplash I did not care much for the bland characters and their clich plights but Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were not the central characters of this film the sets the music and Los Angeles were the focus Over time my affinity for the film has dwindled but that does not discredit the pleasure I had in watching it for the first time As a whole La La Land was a captivating sensory adventure that was pleasing from start to finish,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630435/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2017,I enjoyed it but ...,Don t get me wrong I enjoyed this That being said I didn t think it was quite the level of OMG this was awesome raves that it s been getting I can t help but think that half the reason this is getting such critical acclaim is because it s set in Hollywood and is about Hollywood If these characters had been some something other than a struggling actress and musician and it was set in another city it wouldn t be doing as well If the critics and AMPAS people didn t identify with it as much as they do would they still love it,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3611247/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2021,A dream like experience that feels more than real.,I saw La La Land when it first came out and I was absolutely dazzled by its magic Fast forward five years later and that feeling is just as strong if not stronger I did not realize it at the time but this is one of those movies that made me fall in love with cinema Upon second viewing I can appreciate more of the subtleties of the film As an aspiring filmmaker I have so much respect for both the technical mastery and the emotions that this film is able to evoke Damien Chazelle is one of those once in a generation writer director prodigies that just doesn t miss At the core of this film it asks the question of What is the price of achieving our dreams and is it worth it I find that this really resonates with me not only that but the concept of taking that initial leap of blind faith in order to pursue your dreams that is a very romantic idea and you kind of have to be insane to try it but there is just something about this idea that is so pure I can t stop thinking about it The performances are stunning I think Ryan Gosling put in one of his best here Emma Stone plays Mia with such vulnerability which makes her feel so real The whole movie feels so close to reality it s scary Despite all the dancing and the songs there is something so true about the human experience in this film It explores what it means to have hopes fears in a way that I ve never seen before The final scene says it all it is one of those rare pure cinema moments where it delivers an entirely sensory experience The reason it works so well is that the whole movie has been leading up to this point Every damn scene has a reason for being there and it just builds and keeps on building until finally it hits you To think about what could have been there is something so tragic about that The technical aspect of this movie is perfect There is nothing more to say The directing cinematography and sound all come together to become more than the sum of their parts it is incredible In essence this is a lovely film that has inspired me deeply Stanley Kubrick once said movies ought to be more like dreams and just like dreams this movie has touched me on the subconscious level To be able to evoke all of these complex emotions through pictures in such a way that is authentic and real That to me is the pinnacle of cinema,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7565923/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2019,"A Musical Lacking in Music, but Makes up for it with Charm",The introductory scene had me hyped for large precisely choreographed crowd dance routines Instead the story rapidly zooms down to the two main characters There s a lot of charm and nostalgic wonder to this film It s a classic story of desperately passionate people trying to catch a break in cruelly beautiful world But I can t help but lament the lack of actual musical scenes For once this is a musical where the story comes first It s a refreshing change but a little jarring,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4568013/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2021,Unique harmony of music and dance,La La Land is simply a magical movie With their mouth watering props make up costumes and camera lens you feel like you re watching a movie that was released in the 1940s even though the story takes place in the present I can say that director Chazelle has accomplished the impossible He did a good job both technically and with an impressive script It s really impressive that Chazelle is still in her thirties but has achieved such a result in her second feature film The acting was terrific Ryan Gosling gave a powerful deep and as always charismatic performance in this movie He especially showed his character s love for jazz very well And his chemistry with Emma Stone was great as always But Emma Stone made it official in this movie and undoubtedly gave the best performance of her career You can watch the movie just for this couple,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7265088/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2017,A Thank You To Old Hollywood,As I take my earphones out and return to reality I am left with the feeling of joy that I have not felt in a long time This movie has not only blown me away but in fact given me a reason to love movies even more This film is hands down one of the best works of art i have seen in a long time Mister Damien Chazelle you directed this with class and respect and it shows with every shot ever line and every scene I was blessed to lay my eyes on Mister Linus Sandgren your work as cinematographer is jaw dropping to say the least I should know I spent half the time with my mouth wide open the other 40 was spent shaking my head in disbelief and the last 10 had me with my head on the table trying to figure out how I will ever be able to even come close to the techniques you used in this film Lastly the talent that graced the screen from Mr Gosling and Ms Stone was second to NONE I don t know how to adequately put my feelings for the appreciation that I have for this film other than the words Thank You You guys have proved that there is still hope for great talent and film that isn t complete and utter filth This film is something that I would be proud to have made and would stand behind 100 even though i don t like the one time Ryan said F them but even still I believe this film should have won Best picture and I hope that in the years to come this movie is remembered as the beginning of the Rebirth of Hollywood God Bless and I look forward to seeing more incredible works from this team and God willing being able to work with you in the near future darrick,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3651307/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2023,Outstanding production quality,I did not really know much about this movie before watching it I knew it had won awards and its reputation was that it was one of if not the best movie to come out that year And I would say it somewhat lived up to that reputation It was definitely not one of my favorite movies I have seen recently but the direction and quality of it was too good it kept me interested Honestly part of the reason I did not love it was because of how long it was I feel like some aspects or scenes could have been cut out while still maintaining a solid storyline I also feel this way about the marvel movies that are super long though so it might just be a personal preference Ryan and Emma have an amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie I think it helps that they have played love interests before in other movies too but they are also just phenomenal actors so it makes sense The camera work is one of the best parts about the film They way it moves with their dancing is so unique I also like the use of the different angles throughout the film The coloring is on par and as it would be in real life Overall it was a very solid film I do not fully understand the hype around it but I can appreciate good cinematography and strong acting which were both present in this film,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9006639/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2017,One of the best movies I've ever seen,I came into this movie knowing nothing save the fact that it was a musical What I didn t know was that the movie was so much more It told the story of the two main characters Sebastian Ryan Gosling and Mia Emma Stone The director took two actors who didn t sing or dance and made them sing and dance and they were fantastic The story was incredible and unpredictable I never knew what was going to happen The director understands that film is show not tell and he did it so well The movie was the perfect length The scenes flowed The music fit in and enhanced the story The opening scene set the feeling of the movie so well For the most part the issues that I had didn t take away from the movie save one major problem that for me keeps it from being a 10 The sound quality is quite low especially for a musical It doesn t ever get to the point that you can t understand what anyone is saying but I do feel that the sound quality held back the fantastically written and performed musical numbers,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3650291/?ref_=tt_urv

Bad Leads dancing,This movie was SO overhyped and under delivered Once the spectacular 4 5 minute opening sequence is done it s ALL DOWNHILL How ANYONE imagined either of the leads could sing or dance beats me Gosling cannot sing and can barely dance His first solo starts too low for him and to think they had the audacity to consider he was compared to Gene Kelly As a dancer he s not fit to be mentioned in the same sentence as that extraordinary dancer Female lead isn t much better Don t waste precious lifetime watching this Go a walk you ll get more out of it,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5180372/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2017,Good movie but not as much as the hype suggests,This movie was not bad the leads were dynamic in their acting skills and what was refreshing was relying purely on the merits of the story and not having women exploited and objectified in cheap sexist scenes Yet I felt this movie was OK I did enjoy the actors being authentic in song and the unique spin which I won t advise details on Worth a watch and it may touch you a bit yet it cannot compare with movie greats worthy of such praise If you are looking for a light and fun film this movie is your ticket even though it will make you think and invoke sadness at a point Perhaps it will help people better look at their own lives and how they value priorities if so then it would be worth suggesting for a night out,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626924/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2023,Waste of my time,Performances were fine but it left me with no memorable songs or melodies It left me empty I was so excited for a musical to be on screen again and perhaps begin a new era of entertainment My expectations were not met in any way The only thing I did enjoy was seeing some sights of Los Angeles That brought warm memories of our vacation there The movie was pleasant to look at but not enjoyable to sit through I have tried to watch it a second time to give it another chance but it still falls short for my taste Perhaps musicals will continue to be produced That would be wonderful I look forward to that,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8777038/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2020,Perfect,I was never a fan of musicals 98 of the ones I watched were just cringe and illogical But this one is a masterpiece Everything about it is perfect All the dance parts feel natural The imagery is gorgeous and you can see the change of the colours when their mood changes when they are happy everything is vibrant and cheerful but when they are mad at eachother everything is bland kinda greyish And on top of that the message this movie sends is so beautiful and so deep I almost cried Just watch it even if musicals aren t your thing You won t be disappointed,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5939818/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2017,So there really is this one movie that can change your life,I work in a small cinema and the first time I saw a bit of La La Land I was leaving after 2 minutes I m usually not a big fan of musicals so the first scene was already enough for me at this point 1 week later I was in a situation where I HAD to watch the movie so I though I might as well give it a chance Starting with Someone In The Crowd I slowly fell in love with the movie and as MIa Sebastian s Theme first came up I fell completely for this movie I don t even know where to begin The perfect music the wonderful actors I was just hoping no one would talk to me because I surely wasn t able to talk with all those tears in my eyes This has never happened to me before you can totally lose yourself in this beautiful movie From this day on I was using every single chance to see the movie again and again La La Land changed the way I look at things I feel way more open for unknown things This movie is pure creativity and it well deserves all the awards,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3668763/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2017,One of the greatest movies ever.,When you see the hype of any Oscar nominated movie you wonder what it is about Is is worth it I was never fond of watching musicals or any kind of romantic films But this one is just out of this world If you think you wont like this movie you are god damn wrong With the charming and brilliant acting of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling this piece of cinema gets you enthralled into a incredibly charismatic and musical experience Chazelle brought a lot of colours into this movie The elements of joy nostalgic affection confusion were astonishingly woven together with stunning songs to create such a masterpiece Its about dreams that may look maddening in the beginning phases of failure or defeat but with the continuous perseverance and sacrifice nothing is impossible It beautifully captures the bond between the two character Mia and Sebastian and how they support each other and love each other even when things were going haywire In the end it reveals the bitter truth of life that how one cannot have everything you desire in life There is always some pain for some amount of gain,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3684005/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2017,What a waste,As soon as the trailer for this movie came out I had a vague notion that it would garner a lot of praise from Hollywood and be thoroughly undeserving The wife was on me to see it and I begrudgingly relented when I thought my mood that Sunday afternoon would be best suited to stomaching this tripe Unfortunately I couldn t stomach it Hollywood is far too in love with itself Someone somewhere along the line needed to tell them that Emma Stone s and Ryan Gosling s voices aren t up the leads in a musical The only decent song that I can even vaguely remember included Gosling whistling I watched the movie 18 hours ago and that s the best I ve got The acting isn t up to scratch from the two leads and if either of them win an Oscar it will be a travesty How this film could win over Lion Hidden Figures or Hacksaw Ridge is beyond me And I went into Lion and Hidden Figures sure I wouldn t fall in love with them either I wish I could tell you this film gets better towards the end but I fell asleep it was that bad Don t bother,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642559/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2017,Ryan & Emma Can Do Anything,These two are just super cute together although to be honest I buy them more as best friends or brother sister I didn t think it was a wall to wall song and dance musical like I expected it was more like a regular movie and more drama than I expected with a few neat musical numbers Their first dance together when they didn t really like each other that much was terrific I loved seeing J K Simmons in it which reminded me of the excellent Whiplash that Damien Chazelle made before this and I m really proud of Chazelle for getting this done now he can live his dream and make exactly what he wants This love letter to Hollywood is his story too I wasn t crazy about the surprise twists at the end but it s definitely the most charming picture of the year something the whole family will enjoy Like The Artist it s a unique experience that deserves all the praise it s gotten,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3617025/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2017,"Extremely boring, generic, and formulaic movie",As someone for which musicals are not all that entertaining I can say that I thoroughly loved Grease and West Side Story I cannot say the same for La La Land The music is repetitive in La La Land and quickly loses its charm The acting is great I ll give it that but the story has no place being called a good one It follows the formula of a love story meeting honeymoon trials and eventual reunion but fails at a flowing plot The jump cuts with the season name is lazy at best and feels to be a lazy scenery change The plot events don t even do anything to hide that And the music is utterly monotonous Clearly it is meant to be slow emotional but tracks like City of Stars consist only of a few chords and fail to develop beyond that The melodies are repetitive as well as the dance sequences being mediocre at best For someone who enjoys classical music and jazz too it is odd how this movie would have put me to sleep,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3700429/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2016,Initial Thoughts,Just saw La La Land and I think this is probably my favorite movie of 2016 The film directed by Damien Chazelle who also directed 2014 s Whiplash follows the story of two artists a musician named Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling and an actress named Mia played by Emma Stone who fall for each other and have to figure out not only what they want to do with their careers but also with their lives After the movie was completed I was in awe of what I have just saw The film was a beautiful tribute to Old Hollywood and the films produced then It also manages to present some interesting social commentary about the state of the film industry as well as the reality of someone working in that industry The cast was great Gosling and Stone had great chemistry They truly felt like a real couple and both performances felt genuine and real The musical numbers were also amazing I m definitely looking up the soundtrack on Spotify The cinematography by Linus Sandgren was also amazing His work felt colorful and vibrant Chazelle s direction as well as writing was great and never manage to hold back Overall Thoughts From the script to the acting to the cinematography and musical numbers to the direction La La Land is a complete tribute to Old Hollywood and manages to both honor the legacy of that era while also managing to tell a heartfelt story about two artists falling in love in the City of Dreams This is a fantastic movie and quite possibly my favorite movie of 2016 I highly recommend seeing this movie during the holiday season It s worth your time and money As they say in showbiz sometimes They don t make them like they used to,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608883/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2018,The Music Is Better,Right just as I have said the soundtrack is much better than the movie itself I have drown into the soundtrack sometimes but it was 2 mouths after I have watched the film The soundtrack can remind something which is beyond the movie It is the first musical film I have seen So as for a musical drama it is pretty good but not so excellent to win so many awards and nominates The story is quite simple actually Just a couple of lover who is chasing their dreams Finally they achieve their goal but lost the great relationship which is really a pity And that is what life supposes to be you can t get all you want Now it is about the music it is greatest part The most amazing may be Epilogue It collaborate all the climactic of the soundtrack But not for me I enjoy the Engagement Party and Mia Sebastian s theme it is marvelous isn t it At least it is in my view In this two pieces of music you can imagine your future remind the past beautiful life always your own story also it is easy to remind the movie I don t i am gonna care about that Then maybe the humming of City of Stars after the light is already on The song itself is very amazing The Academy can not resist it the reward is very right No matter what version all good L A is usually be a dream city for many people Hollywood may the important but not the most And this song is a very good explanation In some aspects maybe NYC is less attractive than L A All in all the soundtrack can let you listen again and again IT does not matter not see the movie in the theatre but it can really a pity miss the concert if you really love this movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039391/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2017,say hello to musical movies,La La Land is a musical and it is a fact that the current movie audience is different from the audience in the 50s who loved musicals Even the great movies like dancing in the rain and an American in Paris where Gene Kelly dances are not being watched by the new generation who has grown up listening to this rock and other modern music Some peoples initially say that the period of musical films has passed this film does not do business but apparently the viewer liked this film However La la land is opening with a stage where the people who stuck in the traffic starts to dance with joyful drums playing jazz rhythm which also catches the audience It is said that after people watch the movie they return home with a happier better and higher mood But in the La La Land on the background is not only classic jazz but a rhythm dominated popular music and jazz blended musical genre surrounds a broader audience Unlike past musicals dance and music alone are not enough It is a solid production in the dramatic direction for example the characters dialogues are very strong It can respond to the expectations of the younger but more intellectual audience of today Director Damien Chazell stated that his favorite films were The umbrellas of Cherburg 1964 directed by Jaques Demy actress Catherine Deneuve Chazell is a very young director and writer We remember him from the film Whiplash which he wrote and directed again in 2013 Cinematographers remember that movie with a drummer who struggles in the hands of a tyrannical music instructor The director seems to have a mission to make people love jazz music and this new film continues to progress from that track The main players are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling Ryan Gosling s biography is pretty full Emma Stone entered the cinema with her 2010 film Easy A Though the filmography is not yet rich it seems likely to win the Oscar with the perfect game in La la land So we are almost witnessing the birth of a real star as if it were in the same movie role as this production J K Simmons who plays the role of bullying trainer in Whiplash is surprised by a small role boss who does not understand the music It s about the impossible love of Sebastian who wants to play refined jazz but forced to play music that he dislikes in ordinary places and Mia an ambitious cafe cashier who wants to be a player The American dream is brutal Whether you want to pursue a career or climb to the fame even the bonds of love are as weak as cotton yarn I recommend that the audience pay particular attention to the final scene It s as if referring to the final scene of the unforgettable Casablanca movie,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3639577/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2017,great movie,La La Land is a very good film There is a number of film techniques that are used to create an overall great movie An important aspect of the film is the set design with vibrant bright colors it contributes to the classical film noir With the great cinematography and an array of shoots including close ups and establishing shots we can see how the set design contributes to the expressionistic aspect of this classically composed film The cinematography is great especially with each scene having a different feel from the large portfolio of almost every imaginable film technique used Another important aspect of the film is the melodrama between protagonists The intense emotions can really appeal to the viewer and have a significant impact With reference to many golden age films we can see a modern interpretation of a classical film The production design is a very important aspect of the film with color being an important symbol and how it symbolizes the intense emotions thought the film la la land definitely deserved the award for production design With both realistic and expressionistic story telling the film appeals greatly to almost every viewer Lastly the staging and progression of the film is important The way the space is used greatly helps the meaning of the film The way each idea is built off each other and the film smoothly progresses the film to build up to a extremely dramatic ending that leaves the viewer very satisfied,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3814460/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2017,A great feeling of nostalgia,This movie just brings a breeze from the old times when you would see Mary Poppins going all the way down stairs all those performers in All That Jazz Hell It even reminded me of Jim Carrey as the Mask dancing mambo In many aspects there are highlights I would mention in particular I really missed seeing long shots for a single scene with a superb performance I would definitely like to watch again some of them more carefully Perhaps the way the story is unfolded might be classic but in many other ways it s intriguing and surprising eventually The actors did an excellent work In this movie I laughed I felt sad I felt frustrated I felt happy I cried I got angry I screamed I started pulling the hair on my head The mix of the story the performance and the music really made me feel part of that world Except At some points you will figure out A lot of emotional work can be felt here About the music I think I started hearing it everywhere It s so lively and colorful It is just life as it is Mr Hurwitz must have gone through really tough nights playing composing experimenting The end of the movie I think it s fantastic It just speaks by itself I think it has been made so easy to understand for most of audiences and it transmits quite a strong message or two I will probably want to watch this movie again in a few months or a year just to go through all this story and all these feelings one more time But it s going to be hard to forget,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3730101/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2020,More than a romantic movie,When you see the trailers for the first time you might think it is just a simple romantic movie but it is more than it First of all the actors and actresses did a really nice job In my opinion the director chose the right persons for the characters I love the songs in the movie because they were professional and piano melodies were perfect That was the most impressive part for me Especially the scenes in which Ryan Gosling played the piano were wonderful Also visual effects and colors were successful You can get rid of stress with this movie It will warm your inside with a little smile,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6333782/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,Not really interesting,I read many reviews about this film and decided to express my opinion Start Quote from the review of the public VKontakte page This is a film about support What kind of support are you talking about Undoubtedly in the beginning the characters supported each other but in the middle of the film Mia began to reproach her lover for his selfish attitude towards her I m sorry but he wants to open his own jazz club probably he must have some money to open it There are only contradictions connected with the main character Then she reproaches Sebastian that he is wasting his time on the wrong thing and soon Mia gives up her dream and leaves for Nevada Secondly how can you empathize with the heroine She behaves like a child blames everyone but not herself He does not try to eliminate mistakes in his behavior in his play She s just going to her parents This is fearlessness passion craving for a dream,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7779685/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2017,i would watch it a million times,I am not a fan of musicals for two reasons 1 I don t find them realistic and 2 I don t like that the plot gets second and the songs first So going to watch this movie i was psychologically prepared that i wouldn t like it but I absolutely loved it I liked the sense it left you that dreams do come true if you stick to them I liked the sense of love not as something possessive but to lead the other to get as high as he she can get I liked the songs that were there helping the plot to rise and not to hide it under the music In the beginning of the film I was shocked i almost started to grieve for the money I gave because it brought to me bad memories of the bad musicals of 60 s though while it kept on it got me in a magical world which had sadness but still dreams could come true On the actors their chemistry was like amazing and they could make you feel what thy felt I never appreciated gosling so much but through his latest works he has proved me wrong and Emma stone i think her to be one of the very best as she has the talent and the movement the voice and the right choices The director was as expected amazing I expected nothing less than magical from him I particularly liked that he gave his musical a social aspect which is really impressive He made his move something other than a passatempo he made it actually matter Also I must refer to the photography the scenes and the costumes usually we don t see so bright colours in the cinema and there is a reason for that but these guys really made it work Amazing All in all I think that this is a movie everyone can and should watch I recommend it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3614187/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2017,Overrated and Cliché,Technically La La Land is a flawless movie The visuals the cinematography the performances the costume design and music are all really neat However beneath that thin veneer of cinematic perfection lies a flat and unoriginal story It seems as if critics who praised this movie spent too much time ogling the gorgeous visuals while simultaneously ignoring the plot The plot is the same old trite story about a man and a woman who meet and fall in love There s nothing brilliant or unique about this concept This story could have easily been told straight without all the theatrics but then it probably wouldn t have gotten an Oscar La La Land is a disappointingly bland musical with an ending that not only makes you feel hollowed inside but also like the whole experience was a waste of time,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3740028/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2017,Not equal talents,She was not particular about what roles she could get She did not refuse any roles she just was not chosen for any He never left his piano I think he was the real talent He chose not to play for money when he always could have She quit completely and he saved her He never quit the piano but he did settle for some money at one point How talented was she Did her future husband get her that first job Remember her barista days when the big star came in for coffee How she admired her appearance It was not her talent that was featured just the sunglasses the clothes the walk the limo the big tip was that what she wanted Anyway it wasn t a equal comparison of careers I loved the ending where the point was that they had to go their separate ways or he would have spent all his time nurturing her not his jazz they both got their dreams but not each other It reminds me of A Star is Born but without the booze and the unhappy ending the Disney version,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3820781/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2021,Not the shallow nostalgia trip some people think it is,I saw many bad reviews saying that this movie is superficial and shallow only relying on dumb nostalgia and not looking to the future Seeing how Seb s problem is exactly that does make it a bit contradictory BUT this movie knows exactly what it is it s a homage to the Hollywood dream The big musical numbers don t feel real because they aren t They focus not on being deep or realistic they simply show the excess of the Hollywood dream The movie does an excellent job at contrasting those bombastic scenes with the dull sad and boring but realistic and sometimes beautiful depiction of the real life From grand colorful shots of fireworks and overflowing champagne to a grey street sign and absolute silence It does follow modern problems of struggling artists trying to make it in the acting industry and a dying genre while showing what these things once were and what people wish they would still be Sebastian is a hardcore traditionalist and wants jazz to be the exiting new genre with widely known artist But thats just not what it is today The movie doesn t focus on the music being the best jazz you ever heard but rather showing the passion Seb has for it It tries to and in my opinion succeeds to introduce jazz to a new audience while not overwhelming them with expertise But at the same time going absolutely crazy with the Hollywood related scenes because we all know it We all heard the mesmerizing stories of early Hollywood it s pomposity and glamor But really everyone knows its all just on the surface This is also what the movie sees it as And it shows Mia s constant struggle of not being enough and producers not taking a second look at her is a real thing It s what many aspiring actors have to deal with and what s the ultimate fate of most actors in the industry Also the directing is absolutely amazing damien chazelle makes this movie one of the most memorable cinema events i have ever seen The colors the contrast and the beautiful shots and scenery It is perfectly done He uses lighting to highlight the prominent features of the scene for example darkening the face of Ryan Gosling to automatically laying the focus of the audience on the music On that note the music good It s not the best score ever but it s very fitting and Mia and Sebastians theme is absolutely amazing,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6935206/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2023,A perfect love story in a paradoxical atmosphere,La La Land is without a doubt one of the most successful films in recent decades One could expect nothing less than this after the equally stupendous Whiplash Damien Chazelle with exceptional direction has revolutionized a niche genre by taking it to the roof of the world A Jazz musician and an aspiring actress fall in love in Los Angeles the city of dreams the plot seems obvious but it is in the last act the best one completely overturned from the classic musicals of the 1950s and 1960s to which La La Land explicitly refers The acting performances of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are superb two versatile actors capable of alternating styles and emotions in the simplest of ways Not to mention the music this film s soundtrack is the real key to its success And in the end in front of true love it doesn t matter if Los Angeles is not so much the city of stars As long as it is or was for two people in love,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8938414/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2023,Don't like musicals but still liked this movie,Finally got around to watching this movie six and a half years after its release and as someone who does not typically enjoy musicals was pleasantly surprised That is because the story acting directing and cinematography are all excellent You can feel the director is telling a story from the heart The sacrifices one must make in pursuit of one s dreams are illustrated beautifully in this film both in one s career and relationships And I can only think of a few other movies that pull off an emotionally resonant ending like La La Land does So if you re like me and put off watching this for years because it is a musical I recommend giving it a watch because it delivers as a movie on many fronts,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9077487/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2023,Timeless,There was an awkward moment at the Oscar s ceremony in 2017 when La La Land was announced the best picture only to be overturned a minute later in favor of Moonlight The latter was a good movie no doubt but a year later stood mostly forgotten While Damien Chazelle s masterpiece is infinitely rewatchable 7 years after and have not lost an inch of it s charm So I believe the incident at the awards was really a Freudian slip hinting who the real winner was La La Land is the kind of movie that reminds me of what Hollywood is capable of when they really put their heart and soul into a project It s a beautiful love letter to classic musicals while still feeling fresh and new The best part for me was the performances given by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling They re both so talented and their chemistry on screen is off the charts,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8945088/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2017,Exaggerated movie,I think this is an exaggerated movie because the only difference between this movie and the Notebook is the being musical everything is same Is not offering innovation that s why this movie not good enough I was expecting a happy ending but the movie did not show it this is my review thank you,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3643434/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2023,"La La Land, a perfect love story",If I could rip off parts of my body to replace it with a movie I would choose La La Land It was incredible in all aspects Outstanding perfomance from both of the main actors incredible writing direction the list could go on and on I think that there s a lot of love stories that looks all the same but not in this case La La Land presents a love story as you had never seen before Seeing the characters fall in love as the story progresses it s something incredible and unique They have a lot of personality and the musical aspects in the story fit really well in it s on way side note City of Stars is an amazing original song I could write a lot more about this movie but I think that if you watch the film you get it I fell in love with the story just like both of the characters,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9191402/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,Whimsical Musical with cool hair colour Emma and Mr Stud Muffin Ryan,La La Land What can I say Well first off let s make it abundantly clear to EVERYONE that I do NOT LIKE musicals Hate them There is one exception Grease and maybe The Rocky Horror Picture Show cause I liked the songs I only went to see La La Land cause it won a heap of awards and has been nominated for everything so I figured it cant be all that bad The first 10 minutes for me was Painful very Painful did I mention I Don t LIKE MUSICALS I hate that random song and dance it just doesn t make sense to me So I sat there in the theatre watching this painful singing and dancing by random strangers and then Emma Stone showed up I like Emma Stone She does that slightly quirky confused thing really well and she s pretty Then she started singing umm Emma you are definitely an actor but then she started dancing OK not too bad this girl can move Then Ryan Gosling showed up I love you Ryan Gosling I am sure there is nothing that you can do wrong WRONG Ryan Gosling is okay with the dancing but please Ryan do NOT sing ever again E V E R After lots of gazing into each other s eyes Emma and Ryan formed a connection I would like that connection with Ryan He s good at that I think I m falling in love with you gazing thing So slowly I started to relax and start enjoying the film The singing got better Emma NOT Ryan and the dancing was great The old time romance was lovely to watch This film had a great story line Two wanna be s in Los Angeles who meet fall in love but ultimately just want to make it in Hollywood That is their goal They just happen to have bumped into each other in the meantime It was only in the last 15 minutes of the film that I decided that I LIKED the film It is one film that I can confidently say actually doesn t leave anything hanging You don t walk out of the film thinking but what happened with bla bla bla All lose ends get tied up and not that many films manage to do that these days So that is why I liked the film because it all made sense Yes it was set up as an old fashioned musical with some mobile phone text messages thrown in yes those mobile phones reminded you that you weren t watching an OLD film and the film I thought was very arty too with lighting and scenery I m glad that I saw it and you should probably see it too You can probably wait for it on DVD or TV as it s a musical folks and I Don t LIKE MUSICALS,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3634857/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,Greatest Tearjerker Movie at the moment,Watched this at the opening day but i just rewatched it again and i just want to say that this is a tearjerker At the start things look colorful and it feels like each scene looses one color and then the emotion starts to get sadder every scene but i just loved it so much till i don t even hold back my tears at this movie i hate Damien Chazelle for making me ugly crying for half an hour and i dont regret a single bit watching this movie all i gotta say is this will revive musical movies and Damien Chazelle i just wanted to say that he s the best at making endings on la la land and whiplash Im very excited to see babylon,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8705326/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2023,the pathways we choose (epilogue),I ve just finished the movie for like the 15th time I was 11 when I first watched it and this incredible experience touches me even more deeply now it was the movie that put me into cinema The story of Mia and Sebastian reveals the truth of life and our dreams with simplicity and beauty It s colorful shining and uplifting but in the depths you have a storytelling which will slap your face And it s okay Sometimes our dreams become shattered and unrestorable because of the pathways we choose to take and we know that from the start The real thing resides in the effect we leave on each other the way we mark people The dreams keep the humanity alive and constantly getting up even with struggles That s what happen with Mia and Sebastian Damien Chazelle brings this profundity with subtle aspects the perfect acting the gentle yet powerful soundtrack the colors from each scene and the right tempo for things to happen AND WHAT A FINALE MY FRIEND La La Land is one of that rare movies it has something to tell to everyone who watches it It tells a lot about the viewer The dreams can be harsh when the city is shining just for one but remember it s just another day of sun,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8978461/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2021,A series of beauties that is simply mesmerizing,Thanks to a wonderful video that I came across today showing Damien Chazelle tapping the cameraman s shoulder to give him the signal when to change the view I watched this movie again I didn t like it when I first watched it in 2017 but this time I finished it crying and loving the movie I think the reason I didn t like it first time is that I m always prejudiced against musicals and there is not a single musical that I like except this movie Therefore I need to warn you not to ignore this one just because you don t like musicals I already realized in Whiplash another great movie from him that he shot 3 years before La La Land that Damien Chazelle has an amazing talent for music but in this movie he uses music in a way that there is a great harmony between the music and scenes which makes it impossible for the audience to imagine the scenes without that music or vice versa This movie is simply a series of beauties that mesmerizes the audience Of course we should also appreciate the cinematographer because it is obvious that every frame is meticulously planned and every detail is thoroughly considered see the Another Day of Sun scene see the famous A Lovely Night scene etc By the way Damien Chazelle shot this movie at the age of 32 and is the youngest director to win the Best Directing award at Oscars 2017 Insane Finally Emma Stone 3,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6469836/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2017,Good but...,Somehow I thought Ryan Gosling wasn t the right guy for the part I liked the music and the staging but the characters and script were not complicated enough and needed another couple or something to play off of The story didn t draw me in as much as I wanted it to not really the actors fault And the movie didn t quite come together enough for me to give it more then a 7 The movie looked difficult to make and that made me love it a lot less However still worth seeing again,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3725547/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2017,La La land,So I ve just watched La La Land for the first time I have to say I wanted to love this movie I wanted it to become my new favorite movie of all time But sadly it just didn t make it I love musicals can t get enough of them to the point I wish we could have a slew of musicals just like we have lots of Superhero movies So after saying all that why isn t this a five star review Because it had issues For me Emma Stone has in the past put out some great performances and here she does a very good job here acting wise But at times I found her singing to be a little sub par then all of sudden it would be great before going back to being sub par It just felt really uneven to me and had me thinking I wonder how Emma Watson would have played it if she had gotten the part However Ryan Gosling did a great job throughout this movie Is there anything this guy can t do at this point Overall the story had me engaged and the music was great I really enjoyed the ending Because I thought it was going to go in one direction and went in another direction Which I really appreciated Although I really don t think the 2 55 CinemaScope that Damien Chazelle and Linus Sandgren went with worked But I get why they did It was an artistic thing trying to recreate a 50 theme set in modern times But it just doesn t translate well to a 65 inch 4K television What I m trying to say is this film is best suited for the cinema It s watchable at home don t get me wrong but you re not going to get the best experience from your home Overall it s a nice addition to the genre and I will definitely watch it again,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3709113/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2019,Singing the Praises for La La Land!,Damien Chazelle director producer screenwriter is the brilliant director to his second major success After his previous award winning movie whiplash he directed La La Land This movie is about two people living in Los Angeles California trying to achieve their dreams The first character we are introduced to is Mia Emma Stone who has loved acting her entire life she writes her own one act play with hopes to become a successful actress While the second main character Sebastian Ryan Gosling who is in love with jazz music is trying to open a Jazz club After their random encounters they fall into a stunning romance full of song and dance La La Land a musical like no other Director Damien Chazelle uses the movie s beautiful music in a way that you don t see every day The music is used to further the characters not just the plot of the movie In Musicals like The Greatest Showmen the music is used to tell what they are doing not who they are You learn more about Mia through her song called someone in the crowd This song not only shows what is happening in her life but also the life people have as a struggling artist While the music was amazing the movie also had subtlety wonderful costumes The entire movie stuck with minimal patterns on the clothes with vibrant colors to make the actors pop In the first dance song that Mia was in she was wearing a bright blue next to all her friends wearing equally bright clothes This just makes the audience feel as though they are with the characters in sunny California In scenes where Chazelle wanted to send a message he would dim out all the lights having a sole spotlight on the character This created a contrast to the brightness of the characters emphasizing the character s intense emotions The characters Mia and Sebastian were played beautifully by Stone and Gosling They had previously played in two movies together and in La La Land you can see why their on stage chemistry is evident Not only can they act they can also sing and dance which is an amazing combo to have As amazing at the actors are they didn t have the script to fulfill their endless potential We learn very little about Mia s actual life when she is writing and performing her one act play there is no detail on the process it took to make the play or the people who helped And when Mia goes into an audition she is asked to tell a story but she tells one about her life not her aunt The character Mia is amazing she would be even more amazing with a history The scene itself was beautifully done They do a complete pan shot around Stone as she sings a beautiful story about her aunt The turning pan shot represents the major turning point in the movie La La Land made the movie similar to older movies There s dancing around lamp posts and doing everything they can to achieve their dreams La La Land truly is one of Damien Chazelle s best movies This movie is one for the record books It s about achieving your dream no matter the cost It s a symphony of music love and color La La Land is a musical has one of the best soundtracks out there This movie makes you feel in sunny California with the marvelous character Mia Emma Stone and Sebastian Ryan Gosling,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4586411/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2017,Not as Bad as Some Reviewers Think,I m not generally one to criticize others opinions or reviews I definitely believe we re all entitled to our own opinions but I honestly can t fathom how a number of reviewers are giving La La Land a 1 rating Do they honestly believe this is worse than Leonard Part 6 Or in the musical category My Fair Zombie OK so it s not Singing In The Rain or West Side Story Or Chicago or 42nd Street That certainly doesn t mean it warrants a 1 rating And to be fair I don t believe the movie warrants the 10 ratings it received either One of the complaints I read was the jazz in the movie was not of the level Sebastian Gosling s character pontificates about OK so they couldn t get Miles Davis or Dizzy Gillespie of course not they ve been dead for years but what I heard was good enough from my non expert perspective to set the stage for the movie Personally I enjoyed La La Land and will most likely see it again I found the characters engaging and the music entertaining Is the score on par with Chicago No but that doesn t mean it s terrible I especially enjoyed the opening number recognizing it was done all in a single take and marveling at the coordination that must have taken I ve never been a huge Emma Stone fan but I liked her in this more than I expected to Ryan Gosling s character is a bit of a jerk at times but not so much as to be a detriment to the story Overall I thought it was a pretty solid addition to the musical category,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3851082/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2017,A nostalgic trip to classic Hollywood,As a huge fan of classic cinema this movie did nothing else to me than remind me why I love this art form so much the cast was superb the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was great the music was beautifully composed so many tunes that are going to stick in my head for a long time and the story is quite beautiful and simple The film making is superb the work between the director and cinematographer is admirable they brought back a shooting style that I don t see fairly often these days they let the actors create the emotion and the camera is just there to enhance it Just watch it Trust me you won t regret it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628482/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,Best or Bust?,This is my first review for a movie I went with my wife and daughter to see this movie I enjoyed it they did not I noticed many of the reviews are either overwhelmingly positive or very negative Very few in between I believe you will enjoy this movie if you like musicals but 1 You are not a huge fan of older musicals to be able to compare them since Ryan and Emma are not great at dancing or singing though they were very good and 2 You have not seen Ryan and Emma in their other movies together since you will expect their roles to be similar These are very different roles for them The producers may have done better be selecting unknown actors for these roles It s like seeing Pierce Brosnan singing in Ma Ma Mia after watching him as 007 It s just odd My girls could not accept Ryan tap dancing and singing and floating around in this movie and therefore did not enjoy it I could accept Ryan and Emma in these roles though not immediately and did enjoy this movie so I give it a 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608195/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2020,Let it surprise you,The best thing you can do in this movie is to let yourself be surprised but how they paint it as the movie of your life as the best musical of your life and maybe when you watch it it is something else and it doesn t come to you It is a musical but it is not gray nor is it the miserable ones it is somewhat more intimate that of the passion for jazz and that of frustrated dreams is one of the most highlighted in the film then you must see it judiciously In production themes it is interesting how they have used violet colors with Emma Stone while Ryan Goslin which is to say that they are very good and are in their role all the time their chemistry is evident,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5858457/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2022,The Magic button,I m a middle aged Englishman who fell in love with the movies as a child waiting for Christmas for lots of reasons but one being I got to watch reruns of The Wizard of Oz and Jason and the Argonauts in the pre VHS era Only three films in my lifetime have caused me to queue up more than once Jaws Gladiator and La La Land All pretty populist mainstream no sign of a Bergmann or a Truffaut But these three pushed buttons in me that I didn t know I had for wildly different reasons And within three bars of Another Day of Sun I knew I was a goner Films have to do something It s enough to entertain to educate to exhilarate but the greatest films move people They evince anger debate retrospection self examination and tears It doesn t matter which just that they do And La La Land moved me intensely You d be hard pressed to find a more polarising film of recent times Years after release I d ask people what did you think of La La Land and most of them didn t They didn t get it Which is not a criticism They just don t have that particular button They say why didn t Damian Chazelle cast more accomplished singers and dancers in the lead roles and my heart just sinks a little By the time the final credits rolled that most brutal of endings and yet most perfect had played out and nuked me I was as invested in the relationship of Mia and Seb as any actual relationship in my own life You might call that sad vaguely ridiculous I don t I call that masterful storytelling direction and acting For months I thought if two people as perfect as Seb and Mia don t end up together what the hell chance does the rest of us have And then I d get angry at them for not trying that little bit harder And then I d remember that look That locking of eyes initially so forlorn so what if Then that little reciprocal smile just so full of mutual love and kindness that said yes it s true I will always love you even though we won t be together I think it s the magic button I adore La La Land and I hope you do too,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8613126/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2022,Review,La La Land is a must see for fans of romantic themed musicals Tells the story of a man who wants to own a private jazz club Sebastian And a woman who wants to be a famous actress Mia Interesting storyline where they both have their own problems But because of these problems which actually brought them closer The music offered is truly beautiful with beautiful singing as well In the end they both managed to achieve their dream But sadly they can t be together,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8120326/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,Fun to watch...repeatedly!,Everything is almost perfect in this film from the music to the cinematography I always enjoy musical movies and I should say it s one of the best I have ever seen Even still now I will loop its soundtracks The story is relatively cliche A loving couple separate in order to pursue their dream Years later they are both successful and accidentally meet one day Even though they still have strong feelings not necessarily love affection toward each other eventually they just pass by what a typically tragic love story But this movie delivers it really well A non complex story is actually helpful so audiences can focus on enjoy the spectacular dance and music,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8537647/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,A Unique Perspective:,First of all the soundtrack is phenomenal That s nearly universally agreed upon Secondly the rest of the film only resonates with the viewer if the viewer is a dreamer In other words you ll love it if you can relate to it It s not like Star Wars where you don t need to be a space pilot acrobat to love it its universally loved Lala Land is for the people who struggle with their own creativity It inspires you to reach for the stars to accomplish your wildest dream and find your perfect life But my favorite part is that it also shows that your life doesn t need to be perfect in order to be content Even if you don t accomplish all of your dreams you can still be happy We live in a world where it is brainwashed into our brains to dream big and be the best you But lala land alternatively suggests that you shouldn t only have one dream to strive for and accomplishing one of those goals can lead to an ideal life This message is however MOSTLY true coming from a christian perspective Overall the movie gives a unique view of a perfect life or in other words a Lala land,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8532919/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2017,La La Land : A Musical on Love and loss,La la land is a piece of art I am not merely saying because of the bright musical that it is or the great acting by the leads But deep down underline somewhere it shows the conflict between love and dreams and though the movie is dreamy enough a 33 year old Damien Chazelle never forgets to showcase us that it is not practical to be only in love and be together We got to make choices between dreams and love to make the memories more beautiful Mia and Sebastian could never meet yet they met through their dreams They couldn t be together yet they always lived in their memories Love for them was in fulfillment of each others dreams and if Sebastian would not have called Mia for that casting or if Mia could not have confronted Sebastian about his compromise of music over jazz they would have been mediocre Than there is Emma Stone who easily steals the show with her eyes and expressions This was acting for the ages and Ryan Gosling beautifully underplays himself making her more relevant to the plot giving her context yet making his presence felt in a subtle manner The music was refreshing and the Jazz was infectious Most importantly i like the way Director plays with the camera and the mood of the movie He makes Mia as gorgeous as she can be by vibrant deep earthy colors He makes Sebastian a sad soul without making him speak much and he had the most innovative sets you can see in a long long time so yes La la land is a piece of Art I wish Damien Chazelle does a musical with Leo someday Would be refreshing to see,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3685920/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2017,What a Land!!!,And Oscar goes to La La Land This promise to be said at the Oscar ceremony to be held at the end of February Yes it is true I have traveled to the future and I have learned the end result Such movies are not doing it anymore It was a very accurate word It s like an old time movie But it was built with a modern infrastructure It was a fairy tale film that was reinforced by the facts and technology of the era we lived on Those who do not like the musical may not like the musical but they will watch it I know myself I do not like Singin in the Rain that everyone fancies I like to listen to the music but the dances are boring to me But is that so The dance scenes that resemble Indian movies are not much in the way I have already mentioned I think I might have loved him that much Already the musical is called this film but the romantic part of it is heavier It s a musical somewhat romantic drama style It has a pure delicate beauty It is a star of the year 2016 that you feel as if you were different from your first stage I loved the soundtrack of Stars with City Of Stars I can say that Oscar is unrivaled in original music The City of Stars plays the song so many times that you get bored if you hear so many other songs so often but you can say that you play a little more as you listen to it Damien Chazelle Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling What kind of work did you do I always call it an Oscar but I need to say that each of these three will get at least a nomination Emma Stone is fascinated by its beauty beauty Ryan is a romantic man We remember from The Notebook movie with Rachel McAdams It is a player who can be played without thinking in such roles Chazelle made the right choice Both players What I m going to tell you about Chazelle is that he s a musician I do not know if he might worship music Whiplash first now this movie Dude please keep making movies In the film there is a message like capitalism and human being as a sub text Or I do not know if it came to me Messages such as returning from ideals for money being a slave of money abandoning its goals because the community does not like it living for others waiting for others to like you constantly I think that s the main idea I think these kinds of things add more to the reality of people I did not know The essence is not the year but maybe the best musical of all time This year s best film did I say that Good looking,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3611071/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2018,A blissful love song to all the dreamers and underdogs.,La La Land directed by the extremely talented Damien Chazelle is a perfect amalgam of old school musical with a grounded story which lets us know that things always don t work out Even though it is something we ve all seen before the movie is fresh It s a breath of fresh air into the dying musical movies We rarely get such wonderfully crafted films let alone musicals The soundtrack is great the performances are excellent and the direction is superb It shows us that even if things don t work out in the end it s fine Everything will be alright eventually And that we should not hesitate to dream on Ever,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4268336/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2017,An epitome of good storytelling.,La La Land is an epitome of good storytelling There isn t anything unique about the story itself but the way on how it was told to the audience is what made this movie stand out among the others The director must be so proud for turning his vision of the story into picture because personally I really did appreciate it a lot Partnered with great cinematography awesome soundtrack superb transitions funny dialogues and nice acting with some singing and dancing I can say that this film is a definition of entertainment Kudos to the production team for delivering such an above average film Nonetheless one of the issues that I noticed in the film is the flow of the story I really like how the writer gradually introduced and built the characters and their world in the beginning however when the movie was nearing its conclusion I found the flow faster compared at the beginning which caught me off guard that the movie is about to end In addition I am not really a fan of how the story ended but is of the film s ending I really like how the filmmakers depicted the story if things went the other way around a style I ve always wanted to try Moreover I am also not a fan of the film s scenes wherein the character s background fade into black and a spotlight focuses on the actor Personally I find this style and aesthetic amusing in crucial scenes but is not in those which I perceive as not that relevant since this decreased the depth of the message Generally La La Land is one of those movies which made me leave the theater with a smile on my face What made the movie remarkable for me and for most people probably is its depiction of life embodied into two distinct characters that most people can easily relate to Personally I have seen myself in some of Emma s scenes portraying Mia I m really glad that I did not waste my time and money seeing this film,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3625951/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2017,Ye it was watchable,Yes I liked it and my friend was touched by it Some parts went a bit weird and others seemed to drag on I am not a huge musical person so maybe that s why I didn t give it an 8 I did like the story line that s how life goes and it was sad at the end Both actors did well I would watch it again but only 1 more time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3647014/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2017,La La Land Is A Wonderful Story Of Achieving Your Dreams And Being Successful,La La Land Is One Of If Not The Most Entertaining Emotional Breathtaking Humorous Heartfelt And Inspiring Movies Of All Time La La Land Is Truly A Love Letter To The Art Of Cinema During My Experience While Watching The I Did Not Notice Any Negatives Only Posatives The Acting Is Amazing Especially Emma Stone Who Gives Perhaps He Greatest Performance Yet Ryan Gosling Is Outstanding Also the Soundtrack For The Movie Is Some Of The Best Ever Put On The Silver Screen I Highly Recommend La La Land 10 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3649568/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2018,Slightly Overrated - Follow my instagram for more @thelittlefilmreview,This film was one the most talked about films of 2016 but was it overrated Personally I think in some parts yes And some parts no And if you re not a fan of Broadway or west end musicals then this film is definitely not for you The art of film was fantastic and I can not fault one bit the picture the songs choreography And the acting was also great but did they really need such big actors Honestly I don t think so it was like being in a theatre so many other actors and actresses would have taken on the role perfectly and maybe even made the film better Another thing the story line it was so basic A typical love story that was actually quite underwhelming There was such a hype for this film and it really left me a little disappointed The only thing that stood out was the visuals for me it was just a lovely cinematic film but everything else was then left average and that was not what I was expecting from an award winning film that was displayed and talked about all over the world,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4426004/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2017,Pure happiness....,I am a 73 year old movie goer Saw this for the first time not sure what it was all about As of today I have been to the theater 10 times to re watch what I now call my favorite movie of all time I admit it s a little much but I can t help it It has stolen my heart and soul and as if I ve just fallen in love I can t wait to go back and see it again Tomorrow is Academy Award night and I hope it does well The creators of this film can rest assured it is a masterpiece of enjoyment from the great music to the great story to the film editing etc etc I saw and enjoyed so many parts I can t stop thinking about it Yes I ve seen other movies I really liked but nothing ever like this Call me crazy but I don t regret one moment of the experience Definitely a BIG SCREEN event Only one thing I didn t get When Sebastian was putting on his tie in the bedroom and Mia was on the phone He looked up at the ceiling and viewed a large stain Is there any significance to this or was it just random filler I can t figure it out OTHERWISE I don t know how anyone can ever top this production but I ll see it as many times as I can Thanks for reading,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3647985/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2017,I love her,As the film progresses and is shaped each sequence is becoming more and more powerful until you reach the critical point where you simply feel that everything is possible as long as you do not stop following your dreams The film is magical and deserves all the prizes to which it was nominated Accompanied by a delicious soundtrack and amazing songs that surely won the Oscar is for me and many one of the best films of the last years Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling dance and sing wonderfully Besides having a chemistry in the impressive film so it is not difficult to imagine them together The film besides being a tribute to the cinema of the 40 s and 50 s poses itself the problem of How to be revolutionary while remaining traditional And it turns out is an old fashioned musical that despite being in the contemporary era reminds you at all times of musicals like Singing In The Rain etc P D if you do not give the Oscar to Emma Stone I kill myself,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628721/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2017,A true masterpiece and easily the best film of 2016,The fact that this masterpiece is so unfairly being rated a 1 out of 10 by a large minority of haters is precisely why I never pay attention to reviews on IMDb for certain types of movies Over the years I ve observed that there s an obvious bias against musicals anything with romance or a strong female lead no matter the quality of the film on IMDb Anything with a superhero in it however breaks through the stratosphere of 9 10 or greater by default before it drifts downward even if it s a real turkey So yeah I definitely take the averages on IMDb with a grain of salt since they are motivated more by unfair biases than the true quality of the film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3784454/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2017,"A timeless masterpiece. Honestly, truly.",My head hurts I haven t had this great of a cinema experience since Whiplash Not only is it a love letter to old Hollywood films It s a love letter to achieving your dreams It s a love letter to LA It s a f k you letter to the industry in LA Honestly it s the definition of great filmmaking It s the reason I go to the cinema Lol it could literally win 14 Oscars and I wouldn t even mind Ugh the way it switches between modern style of musical to the Singing in the Rain vibe it shook me I was blown away by the cinematography production design and especially the editing After seeing Whiplash and wow can we talk about all the Whiplash references Chazelle put in there I knew the editing would be superb but this was just they even made me like the fade effect which is usually a big no no for me Not only is it a tremendous script but the way the lines were delivered it s like they re already classics the first time you hear them Even though the film was already greatness the ending is what really defines it An iconic timeless masterpiece Just like Whiplash s ending Damien Chazelle truly is a god I don t deserve and I cannot believe I m saying this out loud but La La Land was almost as good as the legendary Whiplash Go see it Don t listen to the fools giving it a 1 10 La La Land is sitting on 14 Oscar nominations and 7 Globes for a reason If you don t like it go argue it with your mama,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628204/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,A double love letter to cinema and music,I have to say I am not really a fan of musicals but was completely captivated by La La Land The opening scene on the highway was a shocker for me I was starting to fear that I will a have a hard time with this movie Thankfully Chazelle s screenplay and directing are top notch the musical parts also get better as it goes on and the climactic last scene was just perfect La La Land is basically a love letter to both cinema and music coming from someone who himself was torn between becoming a filmmaker or a jazz drummer Just like in the case of Whiplash you can feel this project was really important for Chazelle The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is great and the former gives one of her best performances and proves to be a quite talented singer as well Go watch it even if musicals are not your thing,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7270783/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,Not the best!,Emma Stone is Mia and Ryan Gosling is Sebastian in the musical drama named La La Land The movie introduces you a musical world of colors songs and dance cheering you with two beautiful characters Mia and Serb They have a story together against the backdrop of great music and brilliant cinematography But when Damien Damien Chazelle director writer succeeds in introducing us to this world he doesn t let us stay there long Mia is waiting to be found as famous actress She attends auditions and work in a coffee shop for living Serb is a Jazz hermit He wants to revive the Jazz music culture Mia and Serb run into each other multiples time and soon they realize that there is something about them They set off their romantic journey and what happen between them takes us till the end of the movie The director could have done it a lot better than this It is disappointing to see a movie with all fine ingredients in it but not blended enough to create that magic An overly stress in creating this magical musical world has done little justice to the real story of the movie But I would not hold back appreciate Damien Chazelle for his attempt Justin Hurwitz has done a great job as music director Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are great picks for their characters They complemented each other well if i am asked to pick outstanding category of this movie that would be cinematography art and dance,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3624897/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2017,"Try it, even if you don't enjoy musicals",I am not a lover of musicals I have seen and studied the origins of film musicals so perhaps it is more accurate for me to say that I do not enjoy the cheesy utopian tone which many musicals tend to adopt La La Land was spectacular and fought off any potential cheesiness with showing the reality behind the Hollywood dream It did begin with a musical number which I thoroughly enjoyed and I believed that the characters breaking into song was so cohesive because it was written into the narrative in such a naturalistic way Emma Stone s performance was thrilling she is an actress of amazing talent and I believe she far outshined Ryan Gosling s performance in this film perhaps he acts better when he is in slower moving and more emotional films The choreography and cinematography worked hand in hand and I thoroughly enjoyed this fresh breath of air in the film musical genre Congratulations to the director for pulling this off I can t imagine it was easy to pitch a musical given the current successful films,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628265/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2017,Loved this movie,This is one of those movies that I will see over over I don t believe it was meant to be a fabulous musical but rather an honest depiction of the struggles that aspiring actors musicians face and the difficulties they face in their intimate lives The actor playwright who is on her climb to success finally and the fragile male ego and that eminent downward spiral Destined to be a classic,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3808619/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2017,Intro to Film Class Online Review,I have never seen La La Land before but I had heard mixed reviews After finally seeing it almost a year late I must express that La La Land exceeded my expectations and literally blew me away The main female lead Mia played by the brilliant Emma Stone works at a coffee shop on a movie set in LA dreaming of landing a role in Hollywood someday The male lead Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling dreams of owning a jazz club trying to make sure jazz will not die with the older generation They set out on their dreams together while being romantically involved The story of Mia and Sebastians adventures teaches us that you re never too old to chase your dreams and that giving up when you fail is not an option Overall I thought the plot was pretty basic and clich however the chemistry between Stone and Gosling was memorable The determination of the characters trying to chase their dreams gave the audience a heartfelt story and definitely was an all around feel good movie La La Land is a modern spin off of our favorite classical musicals Singin in the Rain Casa Blanca and many others As a musical theatre enthusiast I enjoyed the filmmakers choices to make La La Land an ode to the originals Connecting to classic musical films spoke to younger generations in a way to show them that the oldies shaped modern musical theatre into what it is today The production design for the movie was absolutely brilliant The use of vibrant colors through costumes and lighting brought the story to life The main color choices of red yellow and blue grabbed the audience s attention and made each scene stunning The choreography in each dance number was lyrical and stylized again brought the story to life It made it seem as if I wasn t in class watching the film I was actually there Much credit given to the choreographer for putting on the most memorable dance number of the film the opening scene Another day of Sun The accuracy of synchronization made the number exciting upbeat and concrete Overall I was very impressed with the film I thought the plot was good the songs were classical and the colors were vibrant Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys musical theatre,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3816569/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2022,"Charade of empty plots, shiftless acting, and deluded filmmaking.",One of the biggest cinematic letdowns of the 21st century Although very visually pleasing La La Land was a travesty of a film and its harrowing plot is a clear indicator Additionally the film is considered a musical however its songs are monotonous and boring with no repetitive flow and the movie does not feature many of the necessities needed for a film to be classified as a great musical The plot enhances no significant growth with the characters facing very few problems possessing a constant theme of desperation to be far greater than they are Despite being a great actress Emma Stone s acting in La La Land was beyond horrendous The only thing that she achieved with this role was a level of utter atrocity that no person could ever begin to describe Her winning an academy award for this role proves how simpleminded and ineffectual the academy truly is Ryan Gosling s performance however was good and if anyone should ve won an academy award for this movie it should have been him To conclude this film is a charade of empty plots shiftless acting and deluded filmmaking It disguises itself to be far more astounding than it truly is and if I could I would give this film no stars I would as it deserves none,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8036426/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2021,What A Masterpiece,First of all let me make something clear I have never been a fan of musicals and I have never sought to watch them I saw la la land mainly out of curiosity because of two of my favorite actors Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Well anything I can say about this movie is an understatement Any way you slice it this is a masterpiece from the talented Damien Chazelle The direction the choreography the incredible songs and music the acting and much more make you love this musical whether you want to or not The dialogues are quite thoughtful and the story is extremely powerful and moving In general I love to fall so far out on movies thinking I won t like them when the exact opposite is true So whatever I say is a bit much the only thing I want to emphasize is to look at movies with a different eye and not jump to negative conclusions,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7263292/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2017,I am young and dumb so what do I know?,I didn t see top reviews coming from laymen when it comes to musicals The too praising come off as insincere or pretentious while the too critical feel snobbish and honestly a little psychopathic It does a fantastic job of letting the viewer take away the meaning of the relationship based on your own personal experiences If you re jaded like myself then be prepared to open old wounds The ending felt as if I was being talked to directly and held my hand down a dark tunnel of thought Where i was forced to evaluate decisions and there unfortunate consequences It s a little ironic how it s being judged harshly when it comes to plays since Ryan Goslings character IS them and harbors same feelings but with jazz instead but hey I am young and dumb so what do I know,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633522/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2019,You'll Go GaGa For La La... Land.,A musical composed of the moments in dreams reality and everything in between La Aa Land is a soul thrilling intensely felt rollercoaster of emotions that even Acrophobians will enjoy a ride on This movie is strongly structured with a soundtrack that will steal your heart purposeful camera techniques the subtle and realistic execution of acting and major characterization throughout the entire film from the opening scene to the ending credits Mia Emma Stone a barista with aspirations of becoming a big time movie actress is too set in her bland reality to pursue her dreams Sebastian Ryan Gosling is just the opposite A jazz fanatic wandering his dreamworld hoping that one day it will all be his reality And in the meantime unwilling to settle for any job that doesn t fit his perfect idea of starting his own jazz club When Sebastian and Mia find each other their first few run ins are some what of an unpleasant nature From road rage during a heat filled LA traffic jam to a rude encounter at a bar childish teasing during a party is what could have been the end of their encounters However fate falls into play and Mia and Sebastian fall into each other After a long LA party Sebastian and Mia walk to their cars together Along a lamplit street and a sunset sky the two share a dance and sing a duet saying that they simply have no feelings at all towards each other It s ironic that the two sing such things in perfect harmony And with the synchronized choreography by Mandy Moore the scene is portrayed with such charm that it s overwhelmingly captivating and honest The chemistry between them is as electric as the LA city itself It s very clear that the two complete each other strengthening their weaknesses through the others strong suit The way that a movie is shot makes or breaks a film Every angle every movement every frame means something For instance when Mia went to Sebastian s concert she started out close to the stage When the music picked up into a sound that wasn t Sebastian s style the camera Linus Sandgren takes on a wide angle shot and shows the crowd of strangers pushing Mia back farther away from him This shows us that as Sebastian morphs into someone Mia can t recognize they will grow apart Another example of why the filming is so important is when Mia and Sebastian go to the movie theater As their hands fumble into each others for the first time Sandgren decides on a close up shot to make it seem like that is solely the only thing you re meant to notice However the dialogue of the movie that plays in the background the one no one would ever pay attention to discreetly hints at the ending of the movie Simply due to the shot chosen you only subconsciously pick up on it This is clever because you might not even understand they you knew the ending all along it until you watch it a few times through Being a musical it s obvious that one of this movies key components is the score Justin Hurwitz La La Lands Composer did a miraculous job at creating music that allowed the audience to connect and become invested with the characters and their performances With three Oscar Nominations for his work in La La Land it s clear to the ear that each musical number was deliberately written to enhance certain emotions of every individual scene The music in this film often arise from a soft dream like tune to a lively upbeat and loud one This aids the audience in getting a sense of the reality verses the dreamworld and even gets them caught in between the two Although nearly every song goes back and forth from soft to loud one specific song stick out The movies most popular song City Of Stars is played many times throughout the film in different renditions Each carry a unique mood For instance it s first introduction to the audience is when Ryan Gosling sings about the city all by his lonesome as he walks along a pier in the early evening He sings the song as a hopeless romantic like Sebastian would in a rather pensive and calming tone Expressing that he s drifted into another dream In the second version of the song Ryan and Emma sing alongside each other It s played with a more upbeat mannerism At some points in this version the two even giggle playfully with each other This symbolizes that together the stars have never looked brighter It shows that they both have a positive outlook on life and feel that dreams are achievable In the third version the simplicity of Emma Stone humming the songs tune leaves the audience with a light hearted giddy feeling almost like a daydream It shows the effect that Sebastian has had on her And at the end of the movie after we ve witnessed all that Mia and Sebastian have been through the track plays once more This time it s morphed into all the songs from the film for the big finale This brings back all the emotions we felt at once It overwhelms us in the best way possible and it s an experience everyone should have The melody of this final rendition of City Of Stars shifts from a hopeful and curious tone to one of remembrance As it is played differently than its past debuts you get a sense that it s no longer a turned page but the closing of a book Aside from the technical aspects of film culture such as filming score and acting La La Land was enjoyable to the fullest extent Not once was there an unintended dull moment and it s not doubted to be one of the best films to arise in 2016 With 12 Oscar nominations and 5 winners of best actress Emma Stone best cinematography Linus Sandgren best director Damien Chazelle best original music score Justin Hurtwitz and best production of design David Wasco you should not worry about walking out of the theater disappointed,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4588338/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2017,LA LA LAND: A modern fairy-tale in a realistic world.,Before the release of La La Land people were already pretty excited about the movie mainly because of our favorite duo Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone and also because the expectations went for an epic love story to take place I was pretty excited too although I usually get turned off by people over enthusiasm for a movie Now that I have watched the movie I can say that this is by far one of the most wondrous movies I ve ever seen La La Land is a musical comedy following the lives of an aspiring actress Mia Emma Stone and an ambitious Jazz singer Sebastian Ryan Gosling as they try to forge their paths through art and music while falling in love all at once It might seem a bit clich simple story but it s a dreamy one that only gets better thanks to the magical touch of music and the theme of dreams La La Land is the kind of movie that instead of a scenario you watch the actors singing and dancing This instantly brought to my mind Grease Sound of Music and West Side Story and others The only difference is that La La Land takes place in our contemporary world yet still it gives off the retro feels and that s how revolutionary La La Land is Having previously worked on Whiplash Damien Chazelle has done more than an excellent job when he made this simple story into a piece of art narrating the story in a dynamic unexpected way This is a genius work in my opinion It was far from simple The cinematography camera moves and shots colors costumes and lights this all was the soul of the movie As for casting I love Ryan Gosling for so many obvious reasons just like I love Emma Stone However at some point while watching the movie I had this feeling that what if Mia wasn t Emma Stone Don t get me wrong in fact she was really amazing she had a warm voice but she is replaceable unlike how things are with Mr Gosling Their successful chemistry though is my solace I can talk about the theme of the movie for days I needed a movie like this I needed to believe not only in achieving my goals but also in fairy tales because that s what we miss in our world now The clash between your dreams and the sacrifices you have to make in the process was more than brilliant because unlike fairy tales this is purely realistic Having someone in your back telling you not to put your dreams in the back burner reminding you that you are not stupid but letting go your dreams is The soundtracks couldn t be better Justin Hurwitz is the master of the beautiful tracks the best of which for me is City of Stars and Mia and Sebastian s theme The dance moves weren t that exceptional but was more than enough for me Again having a musical comedy in a contemporary world with a touch of retro is something I never thought to be a thing That one definitely deserves the 14 Oscars nominations,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3626270/?ref_=tt_urv

If you can, go watch it right now, it deserves your attention",Movies about how great movies are Only by that the viewer can already feel excited and more if it s well executed This film is definitively the case It s a musical and a love story but that doesn t keep it from shining The film gives a perfect balance between the epic elements and the dramatic elements while also having very good and clever comedic moments Damien Chazelle has consecrated himself as one of the greatest most influential contemporary directors he will win every single accolade for it because he deserves to Whiplash was great but certainly no masterpiece La La Land surpasses the boundaries of what a masterpiece should be The script is not being treated as good as the rest of the film but I disagree the script is powerful deep and compelling The acting is top notch and the musical numbers are exhilarating and exciting Some people are unfortunately bashing on it without any good or constructive explanations yes it s OK if you disagree from the objective perspective but if you hate something just because it s nabbing all of the attention you are being hypocritical being jealous of something that s good in stratospheric levels will not prove any point Some people are also not getting the ending I m not giving any potential spoilers but the ending is not for everyone but if you re lucky enough like me or my parents and my sister who saw it with me for the first time and you get the idea and understand the subject you ll get it and you ll love it It s been nominated for 14 Oscars I wouldn t be surprised if it swipes them all I would instead be surprised and very disgusted if it doesn t win at least the big five awards Best Picture both Leading Actor and Actress Directing and Screenplay If you haven t go give La La Land a watch I give it my highest grade and recommendation it deserves that and much much more,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3631884/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2017,Review,La La Land is a movie by Damien Chazelle which brings back together with old musicals like Singin in the Rain Broadway Melody shall we Dance and much more Overall it is a movie about movies The whole movie plot is about potential but struggling actress Mia who thought that she can be an actor because her aunt showed her some Casablanca posters when she was younger and jazz pianist Sebastian who is currently stuck with the idea of bringing back the glory of jazz like before The beginning of the movie took my breath away even though I am not a big fan of the musicals but that bridge scene was stunning Later the whole plot of the movie was about following struggling lives of actors until their paths came across and then guess what they fall in love nothing to be surprised for Later they started to support each other towards their life dreams until Mia dumps Sebastian because he was going for guaranteed success instead of opening jazz bar Mia went home to her parents and giving up on her dream to become actress until Sebastian comes and saves the day by persuading Mia to go to this promising audition and then something happened that I didn t even expect to happen they both went separate ways until they met again in future Mia as successful actress with family and Sebastian with this dream achieved to open successful jazz bar That scene was interesting because I didn t even expect it and it kept the dose of reality it was a happy ending but not as usually one This film had some interesting moments from technical shooting aspect The cinematography is good and the movie is visually perfect but what can you expect from the movie with more than 30 million dollars budget I really liked that the movie was shot in the way that somehow it reminds you of old days because of the visuals you could say that it is only because of the usage of modern technologies like iPhone new cards etc it is obvious that is modern age This movie includes one interesting scene that can be referenced as slight return of Mise en sc ne scene where Mia and Sebastian were on their first date there were in cinema watching Rebel Without a Cause the situation between them were starting to get bit more serious until the screen goes black because of technical issues and then everything stops The lighting and colors were playing a huge roll in the movie colors were crucial in displaying the current emotions The blue color was used a lot it surrounded Mia few times for example the moment when Sebastian had the first concert with a bend she also had a blue dress at the party and the city was shining blue after she left the party The yellow played a huge role because it symbolized the change ahead Like the moment when Mia and Sebastian danced after party Mia s dress was yellow and before that they were in not so friendly relation but after the dance they looked like more than some friends Also the moment when they were on dinner they both were bathed in yellow color while the background was green in the end that scene resulted with the possible break up I really liked the moment where they shot the 360 degree scene with Mia singing the song it looked like she is alone in her own universe telling the tale about her struggling to reach the stars From the analytical aspect the movie is decent but I have expected more The story was so basic that even clich s had clich s even though I was really surprised by ending it caught me off guard there was that dose of reality trough whole movie that I really liked,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3817301/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2020,You will get this movie if you ever had your heart broken,I remember watching this movie for the first time in cinema in 2016 with my friend I was and still am not a huge fan of musicals I felt that the movie was too long and a bit overrated I can t say that I disliked it but I remember leaving the cinema and talking with my friend about it we were both a bit disappointed but we still liked the music the storyline and of course the acting A few years later I fell in love and I fell in love deeply It was a beautiful relationship where me and my significant other mutually shared truly intense love Sadly this relationship didn t last but we parted our ways while still loving each other Then one day maybe one year after our break up I watched La La Land again Boy did I cry my eyes out I sat there as the movie ended thinking how the hell I didn t really like the movie when I watched it a few years back This is obviously the greatest movie ever made I was so moved on the emotional level that the next day I was telling my friends and family members that they have to watch it and they are going to love it A few of them did and then told me that they actually didn t enjoy it that much or that they didn t make it to the end You can say a lot about this movie the acting the music the scenery But to me if you ever deeply loved someone and for some reason couldn t be with them anymore this movie hits like no other,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6425166/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2023,"""fools who dream""",Welcome to the phenomenal land where dreams come true where music and passion comes to life in the city of stars but beware of the rules of this Land you may only choose to live one dream so pick wisely Mia is an aspiring actress and Sebastian is a struggling jazz musician Mia and Sebastian take us on a journey that initially starts from modern day LA a city charged with traffic and the sheer rush of life in this millennium Right from the start the film dances upon the fabric of romance and comedy to address the dreams of the working class stuck in the gear of the 21st century capitalist machine Through an unconventional narrative and directorial style Chazelle uses a rather classical musical style to tell a modern love story where both lovers male and female have a seemingly dominant dream career which is an impressive manner to confront the contemporary social structure Mia and Sebastian s story can be a reflection of any story that requires sacrifice especially stories where the cost of our dreams is the loss of a loved one or perhaps leaving something very dear to our hearts in the chase of a cause within a greater meaning This might be why this film gets linearly better with every rewatch since there are endless possibilities and interpretations that gives the audience the freedom to approach the story from different angles Some might choose to limit the story to a case of forbidden love others may generalize it and take it to a bigger scale In the end all that matters is that all approaches end up with a rather marvelous fruitful and inspiring ending One couldn t help but feel a retro style that the movie tries to convey over a modern LA and that may be the particular reason behind creating Sebastian as a jazz artist This is also evident in the production design which has received an academy award of the sets and outfits set on the characters that are out of time For example Sebastian s suits and shirts As for Mia the sundresses all these articles of clothing are both modern and retro at the same instance as if the film is set out of the bounds of time that we re used to Not to mention the tap shoes that solidifies the classical musical aspect of the film With every rewatch a different rush of emotions hit me ones where my soul elevates with each time Justin Hurwitz or Sebastian in the film s case strikes the keys of his piano creating tunes that speak to our emotions and addresses our thoughts it is then that I find myself stuck in my own La La Land for days after wondering about my dreams trying to fight my fate as I try not to be one of those fools who dream but I can t seem to emerge victorious in my battles for it is part of our modern culture to chase that disney love story sort of dream or as Mia puts it all we re looking for is love from someone else Maybe maybe not it is the film s aim to strike down this ideological construct we posses regarding love but love per se is an incubator to all these different scenarios that can play out Hence it remains debatable whether Mia and Sebastian found what they were looking for or not,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8858634/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2017,Fun filled Enjoyment,I ll start off by saying that I am not the biggest musical fan and as such I went into this movie with a certain amount of trepidation hoping that the Gosling Stone combination that we ve all enjoyed before would be enough to change my opinion on the genre I m happy to say that to a certain extent it did I have to admit the all singing all dancing over the top opening scene did little in the way of settling my initial concerns but from that point on the film was a delight Light hearted with two excellent protagonists on one side you have Sebastian an aspiring jazz musician looking to revive the romance of old style jazz while the rest of the music scene moves on On the other there s Mia a stereotypical wannabe actress who spends her days as a barista in a LA coffee shop between the hundreds of auditions that she hopes will one day see her discovered It s the age old story of two young ambitious individuals who are surely bound by fate to end up together each with their own happy endings But aside from the basic premise nothing about this film is typical The chemistry seen between Gosling and Stone is one that has rarely been seen in recent Hollywood movies both play off of each other perfectly and if you didn t know better you would truly believe that the two were in fact in a real life relationship But despite these two exceptional pieces of acting which will surely land one of the two an Oscar the real praise has to land firmly on the shoulders of director Damien Chazelle for the way he assembled this movie For many the prospect of a two hour long musical is the stuff of nightmares 120 minutes of singing dancing and jazz hands But this is a musical like no other that I ve seen each song serves as the perfect accompaniment to the exceptionally written script each lyric bares significance and the style and the understated manner in which it is all combined works perfectly It s for this reason that the excellent as they may be performances of Gosling and Stone are left in someways out shined by their director A true triumph of musical film that is sure to go down as one of the great pieces of work of our time Not least because it actually got a musical cynic like me to truly appreciate the genre and even consider a second run through in as many weeks,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630271/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2017,La la land by Damien Chazelle,A great movie about love music jazz chasing your dreams and sacrifices Damien Chazelle s masterclass musical is one of the best musicals ever made and is the best musical in recent years Damien Chazelle continues his work on the theme of jazz which just goes to show how passionate he is about the genre of music Great performances all around especially Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as they have great chemistry and it makes you feel as though you are watching these two characters fall in love However not as good as Chazelle s first masterpiece whiplash in my opinion La la land is still a great movie that should ve won best picture The visuals of the scene and the frequent use of vibrant colours makes La la land beautiful to watch and admire The musical numbers are fantastically placed in this movie as they aren t just shoved in whenever they make you feel as though in that situation you would break out in a smooth song and dance number which is what it should make you feel All in all La la land is one of the best movies of 2016 and I highly recommend you watch it even if you aren t a fan of musicals 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3687022/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2017,saw this movie with my wife,Honestly I took this movie as a popcorn movie just for killing an afternoon with my wife And the first 3 4 part of the film exactly matched my expectation till the fall came I am not a native English speaker and in my culture the autumn means mature and harvest SO I took it as a mater of course that the hero and heroine will be together till the end of world with fantastic success in each one s business then the light turned on and people left with delight but suddenly it turned out to be a fall then I realized it would no be a film which i had deemed the following story was what i did like a bit of mild melancholy but aestheticism not perfect but realism It s a story in LA but I believe every young or was young man or woman would be touched wherever he or she living I held my wife s hand we are old spouse now have a happy family and lovely son but once we met something seemed unavoidable and unconquerable let us within an inch of breaking fortunately we overcame it that make us could appreciate the movie quietly instead of wiping the tears at the corner alone All I want to say to this film is thank you thanks for give us a happy and meaningful afternoon,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655216/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2020,Hollywood Schlup,This movie is made for an audience who has never seen a brilliant musical before Don t get me wrong I love the stars but they should have cast singers and dancers instead of big hollywood names A good tune somewhere in the music might also have helped but that s Jazz Go back and watch Singing in the Rain or West Side Story rather than wasting your time with this The fact that it won so many awards reflects just how much modern society is all about the cult of personality rather than real talent For the record I thought the acting was great but the story line was so pedestrian that Robert De Nero couldn t have saved this one Very disappointing,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5944247/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2017,Does La La Land Live Up to the Hype?,La La Land is an absolutely beautiful movie The sets the outfits the scenery the lighting the colors the cinematography all gorgeous The cinematography is of special interest to me Chazelle and Sandgren implement luscious long takes lovely wide shots and a style that is judicious and flashy at the same time The dance choreography is fantastic as well and the two come together lovingly to create a delicious feast for the eyes To say that La La Land entranced me from start to finish would be an understatement The story too is great Just when you think it is going to turn conventional predictable and sappy it doesn t but I ll not give any spoilers Just watch it Suffice it to say that the movie brings out two real truths among all the glam The first truth is this The road to success runs difficult and steep Many obstructions lie in your path and you must strive and sweat and sometimes suffer in order to reach your goal You will probably never see success overnight and hard work and hard time must be put in to see your dreams fulfilled The weak of heart should not set out upon that road but the persistent may see victory The second truth is that there are people in our lives whom we befriend and even grow close to people who help us along aid our growth and we aid theirs We should love and cherish those people and always remember them However those same people don t always get to follow us into the next stages of our lives the stages that they helped us reach Sometimes in order to reach our goals a decision must be made to either forgo our life s path and follow the other person s or persons or to leave them behind and continue our own way It is a sacrifice that must be measured and made and it does contain consequences There is a third truth in there too when I think about it Success doesn t always mean fame Sometimes we must forgo fame to achieve our success Success is the meeting of our life goals I could continue talking about La La Land but I won t go on long I only have one negative with the movie In some ways the almost celebration of Hollywood kind of overshadows the themes that the movie s story presents Other than that this is a near perfect picture Gosling and Stone give one hundred percent and they have a charming chemistry The supporting actors and actresses are all good and it s cool to see John Legend in a movie The music is amazing and I especially enjoyed the focus on jazz and its merits as a genre The characters are excellent and their story arcs are engaging and satisfying I ve already mentioned the cinematography and production The movie is extremely creative and the nods to old musicals are handled quite smoothly Oh one other thing I forgot to mention Yeah in case you didn t know this is a musical I don t really like musicals But this one I loved it The musical numbers all grow organically from the screenplay and it never feels like Oh Time for another song and dance number Even if you hate musicals watch this if you love movies One more thing before I go Fans of Tom Hanks s under appreciated That Thing You Do might catch that Tom Everett Scott who played the main character Guy appears in a small but important role here When you see it you ll say Half your luck Guy So is La La Land worth all the hype I say in many ways yes,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3771669/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2017,Ingenious or cinematic sacrilege?,It s clear to understand why countless five star reviews extravagantly blazon the film poster for La La Land as La La Land is essentially a film critic s dream It s a film about film itself created specifically for film lovers and after a career of dissecting and analyzing an innumerable amount of them it must be a certain thrill for a critic to witness one being deconstructed before their very eyes La La Land first seizes a classic film genre and contorts it re imagining the Old Hollywood musical by juxtaposing a contemporary Los Angeles setting with the heightened whimsical reality of those early 20th century productions straddling the two contrasting eras in such an expert manner that they somehow miraculously harmonize The musical sequences are delightfully executed with exhilarating Baz Luhrmann esque camera swoops capturing charming choreography amongst sumptuous set designs that are doubtlessly littered Tarantino like with suitable film references It s near impossible not to be enraptured by this as La La Land s infectiously joyful tone combined with its sublime filmmaking aspects produce a positively captivating experience reminding us in a modernized and relevant sense exactly why the musical genre is so beloved and producing a refreshing antidote to the relentless cynicism that permeates our recent culture Suitably its narrative is the traditional scenario of a love story between two struggling artists and dreamers with Emma Stone s coffee shop barista Mia enduring multiple brutal auditions in the hope of movie stardom while Ryan Gosling s Seb is on a one man mission to change the modern perception of jazz and regain its glory They re befitting casting with Gosling s stoic charm and Stone s buoyant persona hearkening to that specific bygone era while their wry conversational wit simultaneously grounds them in the present day backdrop Also appropriate is the simplistic nature of their developing romance proving the strength of La La Land and all its components by producing such impactful scenes from these conventional and exhausted romantic comedy tropes These scenes culminate in a transcendent moment as Seb and Mia spontaneously float and ballroom dance amongst the stars of an observatory conceiving a surreal sequence that sincerely embodies the beauty and magic of cinema After reaching such soaring heights of razzle dazzle ness it was perhaps inevitable that La La Land would ultimately fizzle out and in an act of rather unexpected cruelty the enchanting development the film has so effectively accomplished is dismantled before the viewer s eyes The somewhat jarring introduction of Seb s old friend Keith John Legend is the catalyst that spurs this sudden shift of tone as Seb accepts his soulless job offer despite a lasting desire to own a jazz bar Thereafter Seb and Mia s aspirations for themselves and one another are continually dashed and dampened their passions gradually engulfing their passions for each other while the film adopts an unforeseen gloomy essence of realism It s where motifs from director Damien Chazelle s last feature Whiplash 2014 a savage observation of artistic ambition are introduced as Chazelle essentially hijacks this established genre with his personal beliefs and developing directorial trademarks In retrospect the foreshadowing is evident an earlier scene of Seb and Mia strolling through the Warner Brothers studio back lot allows the viewer a peak behind the cinematic curtain before La La Land eventually takes them behind it s own Nevertheless without the sheen of Old Hollywood charm the simplistic nature of the plot is ultimately exposed as the unoriginal clich ridden Fame esque narrative it actually is with its discussions on hopes and dreams now obtaining a level of triteness Additionally the approach is neither authentic nor hard hitting enough to be entirely effective instead striking an unsatisfying middle ground that fails to fulfill the potential of its inspired and intriguing concept Gratefully the film somewhat salvages itself by its culmination reintroducing it s much missed homages with a beautifully performed sequence that in it s own unusual bittersweet way depicts the power film is capable of and is an ode to cinema itself Indeed La La Land is a film about film itself created specifically for film lovers but its exact assessment of the subject is something for the viewer to ponder While there s undoubtedly an ingenious aspect of deconstructing a departed genre for a modern age there s simultaneously an element of cynicism and cinematic sacrilege In a pessimistic society and a film and television landscape that frequently reflect that and it s in this respect La La Land would ironically be more subversive if it retained its jubilant spirit is it truly necessary or beneficial for the audience to glimpse beyond this cinematic curtain For a few hours can ignorance be bliss and can the sanctity of film be sacred while the audience resides temporarily at least in the whimsical escapism of La La Land,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623420/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2023,This film makes me cry,SCORE 10 10 I have one word to describe my experience watching this movie Serotonin Even when I was completely sobbing in complete depression I still could not help but marvel at the beauty of what I was experiencing When this movie first came out I remember leaving the theater so frustrated at how it ended How could they build up such a beautiful bond between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone s characters just for them to rip my young heart out by them not ending up together I was furious and never went back to watch it until now You know who I can thank for that Nicole Kidman I am an AMC A List member and every single time her ad plays before a movie I see the short clip from La La Land This movie tackles so many deep topics about life some of which I am in the heat of battle with There is so much pressure to hold a steady job in order to survive in today s world In Sebastian s case he took the steady paying job at the sacrifice of both his dreams and relationship It s amazing what we will tell ourselves to convince ourselves that we are happy Safety is comfort and comfort leads to happiness But we only get one life on this earth Why would we spend it doing something we don t like for the chance that everything else will work out In Mia s case all she wants was for Sebastian to be supportive of her dream as much as she was for him Sure it stung a lot for her to have a low turn out at her play but it hurt way more for Sebastian not to show up Once they split and he receives the call from the casting agent we see a complete switch in his mentality and the story unfolds beautifully from there Mia gets the part goes to Paris and then 5 years later we are presented with the sad reality that she had moved on had a child and was living her best life And then her and her husband take an unexpected turn to avoid traffic and stumble upon a surprise venue Half way through the movie I was actually inspired to learn Mia and Sebastian s theme on piano and I can t help but cry while playing it because of the meaning behind the song It was their song The song she heard when she first met him and the song she hears 5 years later when walking into a random Jazz bar one night only to find that it was Sebastian s Not only that but the name of the place was Seb s the name that she suggested We then get a scene of what would have happened if things had all gone right and we see a life where Mia and Sebastian are together and happy but are quickly reminded of reality which teaches a very important lesson We can only move forward 2 people once in love forced to go their separate ways to follow their dreams are once again together sharing a magical moment with the song that started it all 6 years ago I didn t understand but now I do They both found happiness and neither of them would have done it without the other We never know why we are in certain peoples lives but the power we hold to make a difference is immense Now it is my turn to discover what my dream is I am currently trapped in the world of security and stability and the fear of doing something I am not comfortable with This movie has changed my life and I hope to look back in 10 20 30 40 years to credit this film for being the catalyst for me to start living my life the way I want,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8859218/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,A truly magnificent work of art,I just watched La La Land for the third time The first was in the cinemas I suggested it to my wife The reviews were mixed but I felt it would be fun From the opening scene and all the way through I was repeatedly laughing with delight or had tears of joy in my eyes To say I loved it would be an understatement I think it is one of the most enjoyable beautiful artistic and moving movies I have ever seen This from a lover of movies It is a work of art I think if you view it in this light you cannot help but acknowledge it is truly a masterpiece Nothing like it exists The scenes the music the acting is so full of life So perfectly and lovingly crafted I loved it so much my wife and I returned a week later with our son Although they both enjoyed it I don t think they appreciate the brilliance of the artistry as much as I do So today I watch it for the third time on my own and I love it more than ever No movie has ever made me smile so much that euphoric feeling when you get goosebumps You would think third time watching that it would have lessened but I still am blown away by how beautifully crafted this movie is I know the reviews are mixed I generally don t write reviews But I feel that when you experience something that to you is one of the most enjoyable of experiences you have had you should let others know,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5926348/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2023,This film is a great eye opener,Well can t say I watched this at a good time I can relate to the movie on a very deep personal level Don t watch this if you are longing after someone you are just going to attach more to the memories and that s going to hurt you more than their abscence Anyways a real review The film has a perfect pacing not too long but well explained The sound design and the soundtrack doesnt break audioexperts ears cause it doesnt really need to The emotions you are supposed to feel are accompanied by the music while the visuals complete the whole picture The coloring the shots and the camera work on this film is masterful no other words to describe it really Perfectly conveys the feeling of loving someone but having to let them go on their way Although its a musical on paper definitely more of a drama in my books In conclusion If you actually love someone you have to let them go on their way Watch their steps from afar and support them deep down The past cant comeback it can only imitate,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9413167/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2018,This film is so lovely...,I may have noticed that this film won the Oscars so I ll write a review about it The characters of this film are listed below Mia is number one in the La La Land character list because I love women and girls Her face looks pretty although I hate it when she argues with others Sebastian comes next in La La Land because his romantic fascination for Mia is high However I don t like it when he s been accused for raping people I m a little tired to continue writing for now and I don t want to know much about the other La La Land characters Anyway this film has lovely characteristics and I hope you think like that too,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4060274/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2020,Cinematography and Music Personified Into Motion Picture,One of the best movies ever made La La Land after a long time brings justice to the genre of romance comedy and drama simultaneously which is itself a rare combination But the most vital part is the magical potion given by this movie to music in Hollywood Excellent direction by Damien Chazelle reflected through those brilliant single cut songs Justin Hurwitz s music is so melodious that 2 academy awards seem to be insufficient to honour The choreography Herculean task for these long songs fantastically done by Mandy Moore Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling and Mia by Emma Stone are the best performances of the duo which even earned Emma an Oscar Other casting is perfect The opening scene of the movie will remain a subject of study for the students of cinematography in the coming decades All the songs in the movie their music and choreography are optical treats Beautifully shot scenes and colourful costumes add those last elements which makes this movie stand completely different The song City of Stars is the perfect depiction of feelings of the characters at different points in movie A lovely night will forever remain a perfect date song for couples now onwards There are many iconic scenes in the movie for instance a scene in the planetarium which seals both the leading characters relationship The ending of the movie is definitely melancholic but satisfactory at the same time La La Land is about chasing dreams but enjoying life those fragile colours around La La Land teaches the true meaning of love and life The age old tradition conveying love is only about being together is negated professionally by the producers After all love is love even if the one you love part ways it s the feeling that stays within Though lightly but the movie gives subtle message of love responsibility dreams endeavors and struggle This masterpiece is a story complete in itself so the sequel is not expected which is a sad part Also paying tributes to great old ideals through various actions the jazz and it s rejuvenation the influential lyrics are some of the most beautiful aspects This movie indeed takes the viewers to the La La Land of joy but brings them back too and depicts reality of life through amazing twists and turns The history of cinemas will always be stated as incomplete without the prestigious mention of La La Land and substantially it s music too,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6420913/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,"Man, I loved this movie. I'd say the best of 2016.",I saw this for my 15th birthday and it s great from the opening Cinemascope card to the very last frame Sebastian Ryan Gosling is a man who wants to start a jazz club to enliven the genre and Mia the always talented Emma Stone is an aspiring actress who is also a waitress Naturally these two meet and the film follows them and their ups and downs I hate giving away spoilers so I won t The soundtrack to this film is very catchy the opening scene alone is a musical number in a traffic jam and I reckon if your kid is mature enough to understand the film there is very little inappropriate content but the PG 13 rating in the US is because Ryan Gosling says an F word once and there s a little bit of bad language and the chemistry between Ryan and Emma just feels very natural The film is a hybrid of a musical and a serious romantic drama and the singing from these actors is pretty good the dancing more so but when it needs to be emotional it is When it needs to be funny it is There is just a magical quality to this that I can t describe If there s one thing I can nitpick it s that the film can sometimes be a little slow But that s nitpicking Seriously see this when you can you will not regret it Video review link for this and The Edge of Seventeen  www youtube com watch v 6hfnx7B4KHQ t 50s DRAK Entertainment channel link  www youtube com channel UCLPGKPD7g2FjF2I2pk8OKmw,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3624721/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2017,Beautifully made and uplifting,The trailers for La La Land didn t do much to entice me to go see it but I have to admit that any doubts I had were wiped out of my mind the moment the film started I couldn t believe they managed to pull off a complicated musical number in one shot on an LA freeway of all places That s quite an opening From there we re introduced to our two leads Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling who still clearly have chemistry left over from their previous film together It s such a joy to watch them on screen together It s hard not to find them sympathetic The story isn t anything we haven t seen before in stuff like A Star is Born but the witty dialogue stars chemistry and musical numbers help set it apart Sure Gosling and Stone are far from trained singers or dancers but they do just fine Their voices never soar like you d expect from a big Broadway belter but then again they have a camera 3 inches away from their face If I had any nitpicks it would be that the sound mixing is sometimes a bit off In the opening musical sequence I couldn t really understand the lyrics either due to bad mixing or the singers whisper singing If it s playing near you definitely go check it out,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3643285/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2023,La La Land- 10/10!,La La Land is a film that completely changed the trajectory of the movie musical film category Musicals are best known for their theatrical atmosphere To see a musical one would typically buy tickets to a local show and see live performers There was a great phenomenon back around the 30s 40s when movie musicals made their way onto the scene thanks to no longer having the barrier of the silent film era It appears there s a highly anticipated movie musical once every 5 or so years These films are typically movie adaptations of stage productions This is what makes La La Land so different from the rest it was its own completely unique show and film all in one La La Land follows two individuals who are in the process of chasing their dreams We meet Mia our leading lady who aspires to grace the big screen one day Mia spends her day working a coffee shop on a movie set in hopes that someday she ll be the actress on set We also meet Sebastian a jazz loving musician who wants to play the music he loves He dreams of opening a jazz club where he can be his own boss and play whatever kind of music he likes Throughout the beginning of the film Mia and Sebastian s paths continue to cross In the beginning neither one can stand the other After a certain amount of time the two begin to wonder could this be fate and choose to try and get to know each other This film is about love life and dreams It is such a heartfelt and realistic film that almost every viewer will sympathize with in one way or another This plot is coupled with the aspects of a musical It is a beautiful film to watch The creators wanted to pay homage to one of the most iconic movie musicals of all time one that solidified the genre Singin in the Rain What makes these films so beautiful is their use of technicolor The movies are vibrant and encapsulating The use of technicolor in Singin in the Rain was a brand new concept at the time We can tell that La La Land is paying homage to this classic because technicolor is not widely used as often in this day and age of film Since this movie is a musical there s a great use of music There are numerous show stopping numbers that never seem out of place The songwriters did such a phenomenal job at writing songs that fit certain emotions so well Such as the song Someone in the Crowd This song encapsulates the feeling of having plans but feeling so drained from the day that you don t want to go anymore It s all about friends finally convincing you that you never know who s going to be there that you should know The persuasion throughout the song ends up breaking Mia down and she agrees to get dressed and go to the party which then really kicks off the events of the plotline between Mia and Sebastian There s also a use of a tune entitled Mia and Sebastian s Theme This piece is so beautiful and warms my heart every time I think about it It s a couple cords that we hear Sebastian playing at the beginning of the film that ends up growing so much once he meets Mia What really cements this movie is that it feels as though it s a musical first and a film second It has every element of what makes a musical great The movie uses the opening song to their advantage perfectly They use it to set the scene and introduce us to where our story will be taking place This is a device utilized by musicals to help jumpstart exposition A great example of this being in the musical Hamilton In Hamilton we are introduced to our main character and the setting through a song In both of these opening numbers we don t hear from our main characters we hear from the world of people around them Something that really stuck out to me was the use of camerawork for our main exposition song Someone in the Crowd The bulk of the song takes place in Mia s apartment as the roommates are all getting ready The way the song is filmed includes a single shot camera The camera pans from roommate to roommate and follows them as they navigate through the apartment After everyone is dressed and ready the roommates get into the car and there s a sequence of flashing bright lights displayed throughout the city Once at the party the camera follows just Mia for a while using the single shot What I love about this party scene is the use of background actors As Mia walks through the party she didn t want to be at feeling all alone we see everyone seemingly in slow motion In reality there s no slow motion the background actors are simply mimicking slow motion throughout their actions This use of camerawork keeps the viewers eyes locked in on everything happening This song is a big piece of exposition as it gets our leading lady Mia out and ready to mingle It also just so happens that after the sequence of this song Mia meets her soon to be love interest What s so beautiful about this movie is how we get to see the behind the scenes of both Sebastian and Mia s lives When they pass briefly we move into Mia s storyline and get to see what her life consists of When the two finally end up in the same place once again we then jump back and get to see what makes up Sebastian s life We feel equally introduced to each character and it helps the audience to better understand why they act the way that they do throughout their early interactions It also makes the crowd root for them and want them to have their happy endings as well as each other This movie makes you care Taking all of these elements I ve discussed into consideration I personally would review this movie as a 10 10 In the past after the first watch I may not have rated it so high as I was not a fan of how the movie ended However through more watches and growing up a bit I ve grown to love the ending of this film It s a heartbreakingly realistic depiction of real life It makes the viewer sit in silence and contemplate not only the past two hours of the film they ve just watched but also their own life and what they want to become of it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9328878/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2018,Horrible,There s this quote I once I read Life is like a bad movie You can sit through it you can drink and laugh at it or you can leave early Since I had no alcohol at the time I chose not to suffer and just leave mid way I rarely stop watching a movie in the middle but then again most films even the poorly written ones tend to have even a bit of substantial context to them In this case I felt like I watched one of those ridiculous Bollywood movies only instead of the occasional burst into a dance without any reason that happens in Bollywood here we have a movie that does it through at least the first hour after which I decided I ve seen enough I won t go into detail but I felt like there was no plot to hold on to I love musical movies but in this case it seemed to me like I was watching a generic pop song with a very shallow meaning I didn t care about the characters so all these magical musical scenes seemed meaningless I m happy for anyone who did enjoy it and did feel immersed in the love of story of the protagonists but I simply couldn t I am writing this review because I felt it s shameful that this movie deserved an Oscar nomination but while writing it I realized that if I could care more about the story I d probably love the film Guess the Academy saw something I didn t seems to constantly for years now Did I lose change my taste in movies or is it the academy,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4247171/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2019,"Boring, Cringy, NOPE",My partner and I really tried to watch this movie even though we do not watch musicals really 1 hour into the movie and we definitely had enough and switched to another movie as it just was way too boring I just could not feel during this movie whether joy sadness nor love really The musical parts were so cringy making us feel very uncomfy and we ended up skipping those parts I was honestly looking forward for this movie but this was a bloody disappointment,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5325702/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2017,The purple sky,Love in the 21st century is fragile and reluctant Am I sure I want to give in What about my dreams Am I getting exposed or dependent Sebastian and Mia s romance was sweet but uncertain both of them half in half out without any loss of control even when the things went bad A fine dialog between individuality and love a subtle game of hiding or showing their feelings That subtlety of emotion is what the sweetness and warmness of the movie derives from And it s this outdoor light this purple sky always half day half night that sheds its magic all over the film They say early morning and early evening are the best moments of the day and that s because half light gives a soothing sense of safety and carefreeness And indoors the light is either the dim one of a jazz club or an early morning sun shining through the windows That light protects and calms us undermines our defenses and allows us to dream,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3776260/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2017,A Hollywood fairy tale,Who didn t once had the dream of becoming a movie star or a famous musician even if you only got the tree part in your school play or can t even play triangle you have already at least thought about what your life would be like if you were famous I bet you did This movie s about this universal dream played by two individuals who have enough talent and guts to persuade it and they happen to follow in love with each other The rest is art the movie itself is a masterpiece the colors the tunes the choreography it s like watching a movie in Technicolor just amazing It reminded a lot of the Wizard of Oz The final scene I think will be forever stuck in my mind as one of the best endings I have ever seen Why did I give it a 9 Well their connection isn t perfect Don t get me wrong both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are great actors but something is missing Lacks chemistry both play their parts masterfully nevertheless they don t get well together they just seem a very unlikely couple I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals cinema dreams and everything in between,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3618245/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2017,"A great movie, but not a true musical",To me it was sold as a musical but it was actually a movie with music in it It indeed had a lot of performed songs and it had the jazz but that s not what a musical is supposed to be not at all A musical is supposed to tell the story through the music itself and in La La Land the music itself didn t tell the story which is what a musical does it tells the story through the music I acknowledge that it s a great movie but I felt cheated and it disappointed me because I wanted to watch a musical in the likes of Chicago Dreamgirls and Hairspray I wanted to watch a movie that used the music as the means to tell the story,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3627009/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2017,La La Land,With all the hype the movie La La Land was getting during this Award season and the countless nominations it received I wanted to see what all the noise about this movie was about To my surprise it was actually pretty good Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were phenomenal in it and the songs and music were extraordinary I would recommend this movie to anyone especially if they were into Jazz or musical type of movies It almost sorta of reminded me of growing back in the day and watching High Scholl Musical or even watching Grease Last but certainly not least I didn t know that Emma and Ryan can hold a tone and also can Ryan play the piano did he have to learn for this part and John Legend being in this movie was the icing on the cake for me,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3630060/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,A great gift for Hollywood-golden-age musical lovers,I ve been a musical movie fan since 12 I remember the first time when I saw a musical movie I was amazed by how characters suddenly started singing and dancing while one second ago they were just talking like normal people I didn t know such a wonderful world exist It was just like a dream world for a 12 year old For two or three years since then I would look for old musical movie discs and would play those I love over and over again As if I stopped watching those wonderful musical movies the dreamy musical world would disappear from me Then for years I haven t have much new findings of good musical movies And as a grown up I almost forgot my teenage passion for musical movies But this movie brought it all back This movie has made it to return to the musical movies original nature Yet it is not without modern observations and values It is classical and new at the same time What is more magical about this movie is that after going out of the movie theater when you sit in your own couch at home listening to the original sound track those happy and sad emotions in the theater all come back to you I am sure in 10 or 20 years on a random day if I turn on the radio and if it plays a song from this movie I will cry again Thank you Director thank you the whole movie crew,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620981/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2017,Eh.,Since the overwhelming consensus is that this is the best thing since sliced bread my opinion probably means very little here Still I ll try to sum up my feeling of the film 5 seconds in I had tears in my eyes The first musical number is absolutely incredible It s big it s wild it s colourful and filled with power and joy The last scene in the movie is absolutely amazing as well I won t spoil anything but it somehow captures both the extreme highs and the lows of emotion in only a few minutes It s the bits in the middle that bother me See a lot of it just drawn out At some point it just becomes an infinite loop of the two lead actors staring wistfully into the distance to jazz music There are a few of those big show stopper numbers in between but they jar with the long quiet blandness of the rest of the film These two parts of the film are never reconciled There s something off about the flow of the whole thing the way it all connects The cinematography and colours are beautiful even in the normal scenes but all of the big emotional creativity the actual core of the movie seems to have been reserved for the songs Now this wouldn t be a problem if there was a song for each important beat but there are only about 5 songs that are actually sung by the characters Considering most Broadway musicals have about 15 songs this movie exists in a weird state where the creators aren t sure as to whether they want a colourful larger than life Broadway musical or a realistic toned down non musical drama Which is a shame really because the scenes on their own are crafted masterfully it s just that they fall apart as a whole The cinematography and directing is a delight the actors are lovely if limited by the script as said they spend a lot of time staring wistfully into the distance and the music is wonderful So I dunno go watch it if you have the time you ll probably like it more than I did,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3620120/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2017,The film did not live up to my expectation.,That Ryan Gosling takes role as a male main character reminds me of the film The note book 2004 which also has the quite similar storyline to La La land 2016 except the 2004 s one left me with better impression and absorbed in thought I have heard many compliments on La La land before and my friend also recommends me this film But after spending 2 hours for it I end up feeling disappointed and let down The plot is relatively regular and not hard to predict However I ll give an 8 for the stunning view and the marvelous starry sky scene,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3748784/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,unrelatable at all. lacks substance,Characters too fake and their problems too insignificant,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5776085/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2017,Singing in the film,The bulk of the film was amazing but what took me away from watching it was the lack of musical influence when I saw Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone trying their best to sing The dancing style I like but the singing was not so impressing There is something missing in the soundtrack and it s that melodious type of feeling not displayed in the film,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3844730/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2018,An entirely competent movie that's worth seeing.,So the obvious both visually and audibly this movie is nothing short of stunning The colour palette the score the costumes all practically flawless and with great traditional stage lighting to support what amounts to a very beautifully constructed piece of cinematography The dialogue was a little too smart at times but it never strayed so far off the beaten path to pull me out of the experience The characters were likable even if they seemed to go for the all too common trope of characters that are only flawed because other characters tell you they are whereas throughout the entire movie they practically make no missteps in any capacity Speaking of characters the leads were brilliantly acted but didn t feel quite as fleshed out as I would have liked The leads both Gosling and Stone stole the show and the chemistry between them never felt forced to me Secondary characters were entirely forgettable and I struggle to recall a single notable one The plot was entirely competent Nothing groundbreaking but then I don t really feel it has to be after all moonlight and love songs are never out of date In summary a great way to spend two hours Themes felt a bit heavy handed at times but the film was a feast for both eyes and ears and it s worth catching,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4267646/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2018,Beautiful music and enchanting movie.,Beautiful music and enchanting movie When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high The excellent cast the music and an exciting new director writer were enough to get me in the door I m always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals Will it be stagy stilted and awkward Not in this case Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this film s endearing observations trials and tribulations but anyone who s ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this film s gargantuan heart I m a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see but La La Land gave me all the feels and more I cannot recommend this film enough It s the kind of film you leave and you don t want the buzz the tickle the movie high to end I can t wait to see it again when it s in wide release The artist in me is inspired again,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4320527/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2018,"Great music, beautiful visuals",Just like many people here I heard great stories about this movie I expected a way better movie and was quite disappointed The storyline is empty and doesn t really get you anywhere The reason why this movie stayed on my mind was mainly because of the music The feeling I think they wanted to create didn t get to me through the movie itself but through the music The visuals cinematography are is great which made it for me still a pleasant movie to watch in the end but definitely not because of the storyline Although I am going to keep listening to the music I definitely don t want to watch this movie ever again,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4031473/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2018,"COLOR, COLOR, COLOR",As someone who majored in Theater in college it s probably a no brainer that I love musicals As great as on stage musicals are there is just something about a musical being put on camera that makes it extra exciting It took me a while to see La La Land but with all of the talk and hype it was getting I know that I had to The movie was great the story line was sweet the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was so real as it always is and don t even get me STARTED on the colors If there was one thing that ket me engaged this entire movie it was how colorful it was The set wardrobe lighting EVERYTHING was so bright and bold I couldn t take my eyes off of the screen As much as I did enjoy this movie my rating wasn t as high is other s because at some points I found myself getting a little bored Even with the two amazing actors and the bright colors that I loved so much my interest in the movie went in and out as I was watching it I wish I knew what it was exactly that took me out of the film Maybe the sweet story line wasn t exciting enough for me Maybe watching it at home led to too many distractions Maybe I should have seen it before all of the eye so my expectations weren t so high I m not sure But even with the moments of disinterest La La Land is still a great musical film and i d still recommend my fellow musical lovers to see it if not for the movie in it s entirety then for Gosling Stone and all of the beautiful colors,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4499716/?ref_=tt_urv
