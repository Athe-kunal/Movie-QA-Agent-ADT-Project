24 May 2020,AVATAR REVISITED,I m not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash Avatar I know it wasn t when it came out because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn t get enough of it In hindsight I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it somehow once the film had become the most successful movie ever unadjusted for inflation it stopped being cool to like James Cameron s eco sci fi extravaganza Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story unoriginal ideas and bland characters as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados FernGully in space or Dances With Wolves with blue cat people are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure which in all honesty I don t get I mean it s fine not to like the movie all art is subjective and all that but how so many self professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture which on Metacritic is rated even higher than The Dark Knight was nothing but a bland unoriginal run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the then novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original director driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at Avatar an original director driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties The ideas in the film are not original they claim Come on guys seriously So you ve seen a world like Pandora before A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness You ve seen many films about a bio database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors You ve watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs And by the way how many eco sci fi films have you seen Such a worn out concept and tired old sub genre right No my friends in terms of Hollywood blockbusters these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti colonial anti imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience To that end the film uses certain well known story tropes the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy the soldier who realizes he s been fighting for the wrong cause the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he s invading or the timeless trope of the fish out of water but they are not what the film is about And those tropes are not copied from Dances With Wolves either any more than that film stole them from Pocahontas they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history from Lawrence of Arabia to Shogun or The Last Samurai and countless others And yes our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters though neither are they as bland as the film s most vicious detractors claim but that s because they aren t really the film s main focus Avatar s actual protagonist its true star if you will is Pandora It s the WORLD we get to experience through Jake s eyes that really matters here and the film aims straight for your gut not your sci fi nerd brain which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans now claim to be disappointed with the film More than anything Avatar wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand in for our own threatened world and the film is an unapologetic uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature as well as a call to action to preserve them Which on an emotional level works marvelously nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon It s a genius scene and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of Home Tree does in Cameron s film So again I m trying to hammer my point home here Avatar is simple Yes but that s the point the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate the themes are not just derivative re treads they re as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone And that s exactly what Cameron s intention was to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world Which given the film s success it obviously did Personally I think Avatar is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness And while this may only have been my own individual experience Avatar was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D It was also the last time a film managed to do that And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular It s a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top notch CGI filled with fascinating creatures and jaw dropping future tech and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out non stop sci fi action thrill ride on a scale the world had rarely if ever seen before Obviously that doesn t mean it s a perfect film and as I already pointed out it s fair not to like it for any number of reasons above all personal taste but Avatar is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days Get over it people simple doesn t equal simplistic and the fact that Avatar is neither subtle nor cynical doesn t make it dumb even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed In all honesty I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film instead of the most successful movie of all time many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci fi adventure classic for the ages And as far as I m concerned that s exactly what Avatar is a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur Rant over,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5766451/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,It's an experience! A magical one.,I was waiting for this day for the longest time I was a kid back in 2009 when this movie released So never got to watch it back then But now when it rereleased I booked the first day show to a IMAX show and oh boy was I blown away This is nothing short of a masterpiece It s beyond belief how a film like this could ve been made Every scene every shot is perfection You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping Last time this happened was after Infinity War That movie too was a damn brilliant one I m from India and this is legit rare where people go crazy so crazy after any English film This was one experience that I will never forget I m definitely going for it again next weekend cuz just once was not enough Every human on the planet needs to experience this magnificent work of art,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8563215/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2009,One of the best cinematic experiences ever...,Forgive me I m going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here I haven t had the jitters after a film the way I ve had for Avatar in quite sometime James Cameron s Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life It is incredible simply put What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler s List His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on Avatar is the story of Jake Sully a paraplegic marine who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na vi the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora where there is a precious ore that sells at a ridiculous amount When Jake learns the ways of the Na vi his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy The performances here in the sense of reacting becoming and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando Tom Hanks or Diane Keaton these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives This is all based on character movements and reactions Sam Worthington as Jake Sully is an actor who s on his way to becoming a star Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film he gets the job done Zoe Saldana who plays Neytiri a Na vi huntress is thrilling and electrifying Stephen Lang as the rock hard Colonel Miles takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr Grace is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron She lives inside her role with effortless ease but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness but when the second act takes off it s sky high with no limits for James Cameron Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism I sat on this for two days before charging it out but I mean it It is the best visual experience of my life period Other than those visuals the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds enticing the viewer and shifting us around Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year It was if the viewer sat down in a chair put on glasses and was literally placed on Pandora spaceships and floating mountains The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees Avatar is utterly hypnotizing James Horner s score is some of the best work done in his career It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears It goes back to his work on Titanic where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals machines and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron s exquisite film James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back bigger badder and mature in his crowning work of his career Terminator 2 Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart He s a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards You have admire the raw natural talent the man has How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics awards His screenplay leaps and bounds better than 1997 s Best Picture Winner is primed developed and ripe for the taking Though you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was to put it bluntly Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi who is as underrated as they come Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci fi epic Joel Moore showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball An Underdog Story And the classy veteran actors CCH Pounder and Wes Studi who just simply don t work enough Avatar is one of the best films of the year The most exciting thrilling and superb work you ll feast your eyes on in any theater this century Cinema forever will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself but for any man daring to change the game the way Cameron did Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered and please experience in a movie theater first,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2174283/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2010,"Visually mind-blowing, but lacking in the story",I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago and didn t know what to make of it To me it felt like a visual feast if little else Re watching it again I found more strengths but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece Starting with Avatar s strengths it is absolutely mind blowing visually The cinematography landscapes scenery colours make up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar s strongest asset I also liked the score it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard but it had some very nice moments while Cameron s direction is competent the message admirable and the finale well and truly explosive I also loved the flying sequences they were breathtaking The acting in general is a mixed bag Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over the top villain of the piece too however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so so doesn t help really her character isn t that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren t given very much to do What didn t work so well is that Avatar s story with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment is rather simplistic and predictable I also felt it took a while to get going and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side And is it me or does this film drag at times particularly towards the end Now don t get me wrong I liked the concept it wasn t exactly original as I often heard it described as Dances with Wolves in Space with rip offs of Pocahontas and FernGully but I am not going to join those who say that I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me Then there is the dialogue which is nothing special and never quite rings true There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy The characters also came across as rather clich d especially Giovanni Ribisi s and the character development was lacking So all in all Avatar does have a lot of strengths but a lot of weaknesses too I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker which to be honest left me cold but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5 star masterpiece 6 10 Bethany Cox,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2291287/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2010,Technically impressive and important but beyond that there is not a huge amount to talk about,Although I was not too bothered about seeing Avatar as a film I felt it was a bit foolish to let this milestone of cinema go past me particularly when the thing it is hyped for are the effects and being the first big film to utilise 3D technology to this degree It just seemed that watching it on my TV in about 9 months on DVD with a basic stereo system would be missing the point Unsurprisingly I was right because Avatar is technically a brilliant film that deserves to sweep the Oscars in terms of awards for visual effects and other such categories If we ignore the 3D for a minute the actual effects look great and I imagine that it will still be impressive in 2D The landscapes and world of Pandora are imaginative ironic since how dumb the name of it is and very vividly created to the point where you forget that they are effects when you step back from them Likewise it is so easy to forget that the Na vi are not actors in quite brilliant outfits and makeup because they look so real and move so naturally it is a million miles from the films such as Spiderman or Indy 4 where you can see where the real person ends and the jumping swinging special effect begin There were points in the film where I found myself wondering how on earth they managed to get a particular shot and where the camera was only for my brain to kick in a second later to remind me that what I m seeing is entirely virtual OK the fantastical visual aspects are clearly creations but I was startled by how accepting of it all was and in 2D I thought that the effects were pretty seamless In 3D it doesn t quite hit the same mark for me The look it s in 3D shots are not as obvious as some of the other films where stuff comes out of the screen for no reason but it is still a little distracting when the 3D forces your focus or has stuff where it doesn t aid the scene Of course the world of Pandora looks great with things moving around in front of you and the final battle sequences are great the money is all there to be seen Thing is the reason I was able to think about how did they do that shot while watching the film is because the technical aspects of the film is really all there is to engage with The plot is basic and obvious others have talked at length about the rights and wrongs of a story where the white man comes to the aid of the indigenous people so I ll not add to that debate The problem for me is simpler than that it is simply that the plot is weak and the script is just as weak My girlfriend laughed out loud when the name of the mineral on Pandora was named as Unobtainium and there were plenty of things like this The dialogue between the characters is full of needless plot exposition and thus doesn t ring true Of course all this is helped by the action and the effects but the narrative and writing weaknesses are all I can think of when I have to listen to people tell me how Avatar is the best film ever The cast manage to do solid jobs considering how easy it is for them to get lost in the effects see the modern Star Wars films to see this happen Worthington is stuck with some awful dialogue but he is a good presence even in his Avatar Saldana s performance is good again despite some of her expressions and dialogue Weaver is so so Moore is pointless Ribisi is miscast in a character that is so clich d that it needed a decent casting to make it be more than it was I liked Lang a lot and his OTT badass character worked well Rodriguez seems like she is there because someone important likes her and her character doesn t add a terrible lot Voice work from Studi Pounder and others is good Overall Avatar deserves to be seen for its technical importance and how impressive it is but the degree of praise for it needs to be put in context by considering how it plays as more than just a special effects milestone In these terms it is not as good due to a poor plot and script that hurts the actors more than the effects do by handing them some awful dialogue That it works is testament to how impressive the effects are but there is not a terrible lot to gush about beyond these,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2214814/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,A NEW WORLD.....,Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for thinking and creating a vision like this It takes a lotseof hardwork research to build a whole new world And there is a reason why this movie is still the no 1 movie in the world I ve never seen this kind of visuals in any other film And this movie was made in 2009 that was an amazing achievement by the VFX creators the director itself You can easily get connected with the movie plot and the way the director has shown the Pandora world was just unbelievable Cast of this film has done a fabulous job while performing so well and get into the character that not a single one will disappoint Emotional scenes are so powerful that you feel the characters and their pain for what their suffering Visual Effects makes this movie so powerful that every creature and big scenery scenes looks real That s why it has re released once again to feel the same experience Don t miss this one on the big screen if you haven t seen it It s a total new world experience Can t wait for the PART 2,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8562637/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2010,"Looks great, I just wish I cared what happened in it",Avatar is not the next Star Wars or Lord of the Rings It might be the next Matrix though Or perhaps more accurate the next Matrix Revolutions It s technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after Return of the King There are a lot of bad guys a lot of good guys and sooner or later they re all gonna meet on the battlefield The little details are not so shockingly unimportant since nothing could stop change or even really comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film s story It s the future An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora mining the planet of all its precious minerals The native population big blue humanoids called the Na vi aren t too happy about this The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na vi bodies to be controlled by human brains in order to communicate to the Na vi that they better move lest be bulldozed by the evil Col Qautrich Stephen Lang Jake Sully Sam Worthington is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother who had an Avatar made specifically for him is dead The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement Oh and he s paralyzed so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him I don t feel as if I need to continue with the plot description You know what ll happen You ve seen Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai Heck even Dead Man The Na vi represent nature the all American corporation represents destructive technology Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like we have to fight terror with terror The Na vi are clones of Native Americans filtered through the imagination of a white liberal It s all very obvious The question of course is whether or not it s entertaining Well sometimes It certainly looks good Some sequences especially those with the winged beasts are eye popping Lang makes a fun villain Pandora is more derivative than original it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson s King Kong All the monsters have a plastic y look to them that make them feel too well done The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty It s worth seeing for that reason but I don t think it ll be as fun after multiple viewings The great thing about Star Wars was the characters Han Solo Luke Skywalker Princess Leia R2 D2 Darth Vader Obi Wan Kenobi Yoda and so on They embodied the other worldliness of the story taking the weight off the effects In thirty two years I don t think anyone will remember Jake Sully 6 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2183995/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2009,"Incredible, inventive effects can't save this",James Cameron s long awaited Titanic follow up is very pretty to look at but suffers from a flimsy plot and astoundingly stupid plot development The characters are one dimensional both as written and as portrayed and there s hardly anything unpredictable The only thing this movie has going for it are its state of the art effects which are truly boggling Sam Worthington plays Jake a paraplegic ex Marine who s sent to a distant moon to help humans mine a mineral called unobtainium in the running for the least creative chemical name ever Seems there s a huge cache of the stuff under a huge tree in a jungle that s populated by an indigenous race called the Na vi blue skinned really tall people with feline characteristics Meanwhile a scientific program headed by Grace Augustine played by a typically stiff Sigourney Weaver has focused on learning as much as possible about the Na vi in order to benefit scientific knowledge Augustine s research funded by the same company who s mining the unobtainium involves the use of avatars in which scientists form a psychological link with a mock up that looks just like a native Na Vi the better for the humans to exist within the unbreathable atmosphere Jake gets inside the Na vi within his avatar and attempts to find out what they would want in exchange for moving from away from the giant store of unobtainium during the course of his mission he falls for the Na vi chief s daughter Neytiri Zoe Saldana Of course he does And as said mission drags on Jake s perspective changes from meathead jerk to tree loving jerk and he begins to wonder if what he s doing is right Is he serious You re an alien race humans and have no business on this moon Your employer s stated goal is to gobble up all the jewels he can find basically raping the planet Your employer will stop at nothing to get it as he answers to no one You re being sent down to find a diplomatic way to screw the natives out of the bounty on which they sit And he thinks this might be wrong A power grab ensues when the military leader of the human expedition a Colonel Quaritch Stephen Lang decides enough is enough and wants to bomb the hell out of the Na vi with the approval of the head of the company Parker Selfridge Giovanni Ribisi another patently obvious name This sets up the rather obvious showdown between the primitive Na vi and the gung ho ex Marine humans who have missiles and guns and ammo and rockets and helicopters and who knows even a Star Destroyer or two The final battle scene is overtly reminiscent of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi in which the primitive Ewoks manage to defeat a stormtrooper army using only their quick wits and some old school homemade traps of destruction But even if the plot doesn t need to be complex it sure ought to make sense Here s a nonspoiler question to ponder Jake under the guise of his avatar is taken in by the Na vi whose spiritual leader asks Neytiri to teach Jake their ways Why this is to be is not terribly clear It s evident that the humans have made several attempts at learning the ways of the Na vi but that prior emissaries had been scientists as soon as Jake tells the Na vi that he s a warrior they re all about teaching him I don t quite follow the logic here if I were the Na vi and had not been able to teach the smart humans who obviously to me were not there to do me harm why in the world would I want to teach someone who s used to using aggression and violence to solve problems I get that the Na vi as a warrior race would relate more to the soldier but surely they would be reluctant to share knowledge with someone who was outside of their group anyway let alone with one who might well do them harm Moreover I m not sure what the Na vi thought Jake was really He looked like them through his avatar but they referred to him at least once as an alien My best guess is that they just thought he was from another clan Other clan I ll assume that only this one clan the Omaticaya made its home at Hometree yet another clumsy naming convention and therefore was the only clan with a stake in protecting it But if they simply thought Jake was from another clan why did they let him in anyway Why did they teach him What purpose would it serve them And on top of that since the Omaticaya mentioned being approached by aliens before doesn t it seem more likely that they would have assumed Jake was another alien ambassador anyway This makes my brain hurt I think it s pretty obvious that Cameron wanted this to be his own Star Wars an epic taking place on a distant world He uses the standard Cameron recipe of astounding special effects and innovation coupled with a weak plot and laughable characters and hopes it all comes out okay although for a movie that gestated for more than a decade that s simplifying things a bit The effects it should be noted are really mesmerizing visuals of the jaw dropping variety The 3D effects were unbelievable and I mean that in a good way Avatar is extraordinarily shot using 60 CGI and 40 live action and the two elements are flawlessly intertwined It s a remarkable film But it s only part of a film the entire movie seems to try pretty hard to keep some emotional distance from its audience and when a film is emotionally uninvolving it s lost the battle for your heart And that s the core problem Despite some wonderful beautiful effects Avatar gives us characters in whom we can t really get invested and when a key element of your story is an interspecies romance this is a crucial fatal flaw,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2182878/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2009,Incredible scope and spectacle,A film with the scope of James Cameron s Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially especially in today s economic climate Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world The beautiful environs the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses visually aurally and emotionally The world in Avatar is the true star of the show The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves Relative newcomer Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science fiction fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na vi Neytiri Even though the characters they both play are blue giant catlike aliens they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects That s not to say that everything is perfect The story is basic and dare I say clich d and predictable We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media The bad guys are cartoonishly evil and sadly paper thin The love story while charming is also clich d despite being between man and alien But in the face of these shortcomings Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event It does exactly what cinema was always intended to it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future 9 5 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2174894/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2012,Colourful Visuals . Black And White Storytelling,I really did not like the way way this movie was advertised A film that will change the face of cinema etc etc etc I m one of those strange creatures who is actually turned off by hyperbolic markerteering On top of that I m not someone who s going to sit in a cinema wearing 3D glasses It s bad enough being a speccy in real life Who wants to add expensive insult to injury by sitting in a cinema looking like a muppet with shades In summary I had no intention of watching AVATAR in a cinema if at all In April I found myself on a very long plane trip from Heathrow to India and decided that because I d seen most of what was on offer I decided to watch AVATAR Being on a plane where the format is cropped and missing the 3D visuals means that you re able to concentrate on the story The truth is that the plot is absolutely threadbare and is padded out with long sequences that might seduce an audience in to watching the visuals but plot wise there s nothing happening at all Fault number one there s very little happening to the plot for large chunks of the movie Fault number two is that character wise everything is black and white Good guys Read humans are blacker than the darkest night while good guys Read blue skinned aliens are so white they re brighter than the sun itself It s almost like watching a simplistic revisionary Western where the Indians are the goodies and the calvary are the baddies I say almost because Hollywood has never come up with a Western like that and never will There is no complexity involved what so ever The bad guys are bad guys and the good guys are good guys and there s no motives involved Some people may complain that LORD OF THE RINGS also suffered from this characterization but at least the LOTR wasn t a 3D gimmick and had saving graces Take away the 3D and you ll find AVATAR has no other function as a marketing tool Also nice to know it was stuffed at the Oscars by the cheap and compelling tiny budget THE HURT LOCKER,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2676964/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2009,The best blockbuster in years - the master is back!,I m not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash Avatar I know it wasn t when it came out because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn t get enough of it In hindsight I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it somehow once the film had become the most successful movie ever unadjusted for inflation it stopped being cool to like James Cameron s eco sci fi extravaganza Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story unoriginal ideas and bland characters as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados FernGully in space or Dances With Wolves with blue cat people are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure which in all honesty I don t get I mean it s fine not to like the movie all art is subjective and all that but how so many self professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture which on Metacritic is rated even higher than The Dark Knight was nothing but a bland unoriginal run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the then novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original director driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at Avatar an original director driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties The ideas in the film are not original they claim Come on guys seriously So you ve seen a world like Pandora before A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness You ve seen many films about a bio database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors You ve watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs And by the way how many eco sci fi films have you seen Such a worn out concept and tired old sub genre right No my friends in terms of Hollywood blockbusters these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti colonial anti imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience To that end the film uses certain well known story tropes the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy the soldier who realizes he s been fighting for the wrong cause the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he s invading or the timeless trope of the fish out of water but they are not what the film is about And those tropes are not copied from Dances With Wolves either any more than that film stole them from Pocahontas they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history from Lawrence of Arabia to Shogun or The Last Samurai and countless others And yes our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters though neither are they as bland as the film s most vicious detractors claim but that s because they aren t really the film s main focus Avatar s actual protagonist its true star if you will is Pandora It s the WORLD we get to experience through Jake s eyes that really matters here and the film aims straight for your gut not your sci fi nerd brain which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans now claim to be disappointed with the film More than anything Avatar wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand in for our own threatened world and the film is an unapologetic uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature as well as a call to action to preserve them Which on an emotional level works marvelously nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon It s a genius scene and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of Home Tree does in Cameron s film So again I m trying to hammer my point home here Avatar is simple Yes but that s the point the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate the themes are not just derivative re treads they re as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone And that s exactly what Cameron s intention was to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world Which given the film s success it obviously did Personally I think Avatar is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness And while this may only have been my own individual experience Avatar was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D It was also the last time a film managed to do that And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular It s a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top notch CGI filled with fascinating creatures and jaw dropping future tech and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out non stop sci fi action thrill ride on a scale the world had rarely if ever seen before Obviously that doesn t mean it s a perfect film and as I already pointed out it s fair not to like it for any number of reasons above all personal taste but Avatar is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days Get over it people simple doesn t equal simplistic and the fact that Avatar is neither subtle nor cynical doesn t make it dumb even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed In all honesty I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film instead of the most successful movie of all time many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci fi adventure classic for the ages And as far as I m concerned that s exactly what Avatar is a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur Rant

19 December 2009,"Mr so-called ""King of the World"" returns with a visually dazzling spectacle and so-so story",James Cameron has big ideas and big visions Thankfully the latter he dives into with a lust for cinematic glory and with more money than some countries have in an entire year he has made his vision of a planet called Pandora in the year 21 something something of a real wonder If only his big ideas weren t for the most part cribbed from other movies and stories and archetypes I would be reminded of Joseph Campbell s myth buster formula that so many have taken to heart in adventure movies but Cameron s formula would appear to come second to his attention to visual detail This has its pros and cons some more or some less depending on what viewer sees hears in it all It is ambitious and quite expensive and it all shows up on the screen It has to be said Avatar is absorbing to look at So much time and energy was spent into creating this fictional alien species the Na vi and it pays off in the respect that Cameron s visual fx team painstakingly makes it appear real and otherworldly at the same time We might recognize the lush and green surroundings or even some of the trippy creatures and if it comes close to anything it s like Ferngully The Last Rainforest squared and made semi pre historic But it s the scope and grandeur and when we see the Na Vi in close ups or even just far away you can see the sweat and the detail in their faces the human beings playing them projecting off the screen I forgot if only for a few moments at a time that they were animated and done in motion capture If part of a filmmaker s job in a situation like a super mega sci fi epic is to make us believe in another world and place even if it s familiar then Cameron has done his job very admirably So if Pandora is great to look at especially in the practically prerequisite 3D which also has its own levels of detail and nuance and doesn t just JUMP at a viewer and if the technology shown on screen of how a human being goes into an avatar is fascinating then why isn t it such a smash all around Simple the story and the characters Cameron does pay them attention but only inasmuch as to get us going into the Pandora environment When he has characters like Jake Sully very good Sam Worthington and Neytiri Zoe Saldana even better saying such trite dialog and going through the motions of a story that is familiar to anyone who has seen Ferngully or Dances with Wolves or to a lessor extent Last Samurai or New World super pro environment obvious anti colonialist it starts to drag the film with it I never grew tired of the cinematography or the wonderful sights on Pandora but could I have done without such one dimensional gritting of teeth from Stephen Lang Absolutely I m not sure if there should be more movies like Avatar It takes a filmmaker with the ambition and drive and the super screw you guys clout that James Cameron has with such a project not to mention the time for it allotted him not since Kubrick has a filmmaker taken so long between projects to pull off something like this CGI driven movies could progress thanks to the prowess displayed here but it does need to be done with the right frame of attitude towards the story Even if such story is formulaic as this one a filmmaker does need to try and push the technology a little further while also not forgetting about the human element Cameron comes close no he does go over the brink of doing style over substance but for this case and maybe just this one time from an otherwise masterful blockbuster director it s satisfying,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2176853/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2011,How To Retire Early: Volume 2.,Without doubt the most hyped and publicly marketed film in the history of contemporary cinema Avatar has since dominated the big screen in all corners of the world going on to generate over 2 7 billion in revenue and giving director James Cameron the highly respectable title of having been at the helm of both the most and second most financially successful cinematic endeavours of all time Avatar takes us more than one hundred years into the future where the Earth played by the United States sends a group of Marines to mine the foreign planet of Pandora for an extremely rare MacGuffin known as Unobtainium Involved in this operation is the crippled Jake Sully who is given the task of fusing his body with a cloned native in order to gain the trust of the planet s Indigenous population the Na vi and convince them to flee their home in to accommodate the excavation of their sacred site Along the way Jake becomes more than friendly with the Na vi princess Neytiri and begins to question the underlying motives of his employer For many cinema goers this film offered a comprehensively positive answer to the most debatable of movie topics can a film made with the budget of a small or in this case not so small country which is made to appeal to the masses also be embraced by the critical community Unfortunately I m not one of those believers For pre hype about Avatar to include such claims as it will revolutionise the way people watch and interpret cinema it s fair to say expectations were pretty high I walked into the film expecting a heavy dose of originality to complement the many socially conscious themes suggested by trailers and ultimately implicated in the film s plot including a criticism of America s involvement in the occupation of Iraq as well as the need for us all to make our thumbs a little greener What I got was same old same old Hollywood production line stuff A plot recreated dozens of times in different environments coupled with a romantic sub plot lacking any sense of depth meant this was just another movie in my eyes I m always open to give two thumbs up for innovation in film and quite frankly would have had no problem in seeing the closing credits roll following Jake s refreshingly insightful monologue about how we all have to wake up sometime Of course the film dragged on for another 45 minutes climaxing in a fierce battle scene allowing the special effects crew to show off to their heart s content which was that s right thrown in to appeal to the masses Despite this I am impartially obliged to list three positives to come out of what was otherwise a disappointing film Sam Worthington s portrayal of Jake Sully was while by no means Oscar worthy leaps and bounds ahead of his previous enterprise in the dreadful Terminator Salvation The attention to detail offered in terms of the mannerisms of a paraplegic was something I was worried would be pushed to one side in the scope of such a grand undertaking but Worthington did the role justice Secondly Avatar has given 3D cinema the push it needed to avoid being just some flavour of the month promotion and I for one am glad to see it hang around Avatar is the first and by no means the last blockbuster to accommodate this revolution in filmmaking And speaking of revolution no one can voice their opinion on Avatar without mentioning the visuals Not since our encounter with a real life T rex in Spielberg s suspenseful 1993 roller coaster have computer generated effects taken such a huge step forward Now if only JC and company could have formed the plot character development and dialogue to match There s nothing I love more than a bit of feedback good or bad So drop me a line on jnatsis iprimus com au and let me know what you thought of my review,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2379314/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2010,The most overrated film in history,The plot is stolen from many different movies there was only 3 good actors the characters are either bland or stereotypical and yet it made almost 3 billion When I think a film is overrated I usually like it I don t think of it as Oscar worthy but I like it Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie It didn t have any effort put into the story at all Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas It is an awful movie but people and critics liked it Why is that Well that is due to the effects Few watching or reviewing cared about what the story was All they cared about was the effects Yes the effects and 3 D are great but without the substance of a well written story it fails I don t care if the effects are the best ever Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer and staring at the screensaver You think it looks cool so you look at it Next time you look up it is 3 hours later Would consider that a good way to spend your time No you would not but you think that Avatar is worth your time This a movie that is destroying filmmaking 1 star out of 4,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2289284/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2009,"Even if it is sporadically decent or fun, it's mostly a bore",A crashing bore There is almost no real reason to see this film As you could probably tell from the previews or other plot descriptions it is a virtual remake of Dances with Wolves but starring elongated CGI blue aliens Yet even that movie wasn t nearly as patronizing with its noble savage bullcrap I am not exaggerating when I say I have almost never seen a less imaginative movie But what about the visuals you say Well they are pretty and the CGI is better than it has ever been in the past But I d say it isn t even close to a huge step forward A pretty tiny step really from The Lord of the Rings Gollum The motion captured faces look more expressive than Gollum s But they still have far to go before the CGI creations look photo realistic as the idiotic Cameron likes to describe his cartoon characters and settings And they still haven t worked out just how to move CGI characters they still don t look like they exist in any kind of real world outside of a computer hard drive But I guess by now I have to accept filmmakers are always going to rely on CGI and it s always going to look like a cartoon I have to say I did mostly enjoy it when Cameron was introducing new jungle creatures I think the final tally is about nine different species of animals that live on the planet but both the flora and the fauna are reminiscent of black light posters and prog rock album covers I ll credit Jim Emerson for tipping me toward that but I knew even in the previews that everything looked a little too familiar And the N avi They re Native Americans Cameron s allegory is easily the thinnest I ve ever seen in a major motion picture Some critics have argued about how it allegorically relates to current American military woes but frankly if Cameron intended any of it he screws it up royally by making the N avi 100 justified in whatever they do It s every bit as black and white as anything George W Bush ever said I m sure he loves the Hell out of this film And even if I tried to just shut off my brain pretty impossible so much of the ride is uneventful If not for the film s final half hour which is comprised of the big battle I d probably call this the worst film of the year As it is I d probably rather sit through Transformers 2 again At least I can marvel at the audaciousness of Michael Bay s tastelessness It s better than Cameron s utter blandness,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2181514/?ref_=tt_urv

Pandora before A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests A world where nature forms an actual neural network

ve watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs And by the way how many eco sci fi films have you seen Such a worn out concept and tired old sub genre right No my friends in terms of Hollywood blockbusters these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti colonial anti imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience To that end the film uses certain well known story tropes the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy the soldier who realizes he s been fighting for the wrong cause the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he s invading or the timeless trope of the fish out of water but they are not what the film is about And those tropes are not copied from Dances With Wolves either any more than that film stole them from Pocahontas they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history from Lawrence of Arabia to Shogun or The Last Samurai and countless others And yes our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters though neither are they as bland as the film s most vicious detractors claim but that s because they aren t really the film s main focus Avatar s actual protagonist its true star if you will is Pandora It s the WORLD we get to experience through Jake s eyes that really matters here and the film aims straight for your gut not your sci fi nerd brain which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans now claim to be disappointed with the film More than anything Avatar wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand in for our own threatened world and the film is an unapologetic uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature as well as a call to action to preserve them Which on an emotional level works marvelously nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon It s a genius scene and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of Home Tree does in Cameron s film So again I m trying to hammer my point home here Avatar is simple Yes but that s the point the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate the themes are not just derivative re treads they re as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone And that s exactly what Cameron s intention was to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world Which given the film s success it obviously did Personally I think Avatar is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness And while this may only have been my own individual experience Avatar was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D It was also the last time a film managed to do that And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular It s a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top notch CGI filled with fascinating creatures and jaw dropping future tech and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out non stop sci fi action thrill ride on a scale the world had rarely if ever seen before Obviously that doesn t mean it s a perfect film and as I already pointed out it s fair not to like it for any number of reasons above all personal taste but Avatar is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days Get over it people simple doesn t equal simplistic and the fact that Avatar is neither subtle nor cynical doesn t make it dumb even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed In all honesty I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film instead of the most successful movie of all time many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci fi adventure classic for the ages And as far as I m concerned that s exactly what Avatar is a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur Rant

15 December 2009,Avatar is a masterpiece & a breakthrough in cinema,I m not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash Avatar I know it wasn t when it came out because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn t get enough of it In hindsight I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it somehow once the film had become the most successful movie ever unadjusted for inflation it stopped being cool to like James Cameron s eco sci fi extravaganza Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story unoriginal ideas and bland characters as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados FernGully in space or Dances With Wolves with blue cat people are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure which in all honesty I don t get I mean it s fine not to like the movie all art is subjective and all that but how so many self professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture which on Metacritic is rated even higher than The Dark Knight was nothing but a bland unoriginal run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the then novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original director driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at Avatar an original director driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties The ideas in the film are not original they claim Come on guys seriously So you ve seen a world like Pandora before A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness You ve seen many films about a bio database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors You ve watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs And by the way how many eco sci fi films have you seen Such a worn out concept and tired old sub genre right No my friends in terms of Hollywood blockbusters these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange

12 December 2022,A cinematic triumph.,Avatar is the kind of film that makes a cinema visit worthwhile I saw it 13 years ago and it lived with me ever since It is of course known for its sensational visuals but it is so much more than that It s a great storyline I love the concept of the planet The Avatars Jake s story it s just captivating It s moving exciting dramatic it crosses over so many genres it s the kind of film that takes you away from whatever you have going on You still cannot help but be blown away by the visuals you could say it s arthouse in the mainstream but it s more than that this film was a game changer the visuals even now are spellbinding The animals forests effects are all tremendous they ve aged pretty well also Three tremendous performances which have all always stood out for me Sam Worthington Zoe Saldana and of course Sigourney Weaver I knew we d get a follow up I just didn t think that we d be waiting 13 years for it I can t wait to see it Glorious 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8732109/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2009,Fascinating concept .Must be seen cannot be described,I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London which is a superb venue in which to view this film Huge screen excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby 3 dimensional image The whole effect is mind blowing This is a Must see movie innovative and extraordinary I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art The level of realism achieved is remarkable and although the film is relatively long in real time it retains it s excitement and holds the audience s attention to the end Performances are good but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance as do the rest of the cast But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way As Writer Director James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records I thoroughly enjoyed this film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2172619/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2009,People are weak minded.,I m not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash Avatar I know it wasn t when it came out because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn t get enough of it In hindsight I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it somehow once the film had become the most successful movie ever unadjusted for inflation it stopped being cool to like James Cameron s eco sci fi extravaganza Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story unoriginal ideas and bland characters as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados FernGully in space or Dances With Wolves with blue cat people are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure which in all honesty I don t get I mean it s fine not to like the movie all art is subjective and all that but how so many self professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture which on Metacritic is rated even higher than The Dark Knight was nothing but a bland unoriginal run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the then novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original director driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at Avatar an original director driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties The ideas in the film are not original they claim Come on guys seriously So you ve seen a world like Pandora before A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness You ve seen many films about a bio database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors You ve watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs And by the way how many eco sci fi films have you seen Such a worn out concept and tired old sub genre right No my friends in terms of Hollywood blockbusters these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti colonial anti imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience To that end the film uses certain well known story tropes the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy the soldier who realizes he s been fighting for the wrong cause the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he s invading or the timeless trope of the fish out of water but they are not what the film is about And those tropes are not copied from Dances With Wolves either any more than that film stole them from Pocahontas they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history from Lawrence of Arabia to Shogun or The Last Samurai and countless others And yes our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters though neither are they as bland as the film s most vicious detractors claim but that s because they aren t really the film s main focus Avatar s actual protagonist its true star if you will is Pandora It s the WORLD we get to experience through Jake s eyes that really matters here and the film aims straight for your gut not your sci fi nerd brain which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans now claim to be disappointed with the film More than anything Avatar wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand in for our own threatened world and the film is an unapologetic uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature as well as a call to action to preserve them Which on an emotional level works marvelously nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon It s a genius scene and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of Home Tree does in Cameron s film So again I m trying to hammer my point home here Avatar is simple Yes but that s the point the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate the themes are not just derivative re treads they re as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone And that s exactly what Cameron s intention was to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world Which given the film s success it obviously did Personally I think Avatar is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness And while this may only have been my own individual experience Avatar was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D It was also the last time a film managed to do that And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular It s a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top notch CGI filled with fascinating creatures and jaw dropping future tech and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out non stop sci fi action thrill ride on a scale the world had rarely if ever seen before Obviously that doesn t mean it s a perfect film and as I already pointed out it s fair not to like it for any number of reasons above all personal taste but Avatar is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days Get over it people simple doesn t equal simplistic and the fact that Avatar is neither subtle nor cynical doesn t make it dumb even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed In all honesty I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film instead of the most successful movie of all time many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci fi adventure classic for the ages And as far as I m concerned that s exactly what Avatar is a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur Rant

20 October 2016,A Movie With Too Much Hate That Deserves More Appreciation,Over the years James Cameron s Avatar has become an extremely controversial movie with some people calling it groundbreaking and a masterpiece and some calling it an overlong and derivative bore I find myself not completely agreeing with either side but I do believe that it s got far to much um warranted hate The main hate from this movie comes from that fact that it s got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it s probably this films greatest short coming but it doesn t kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad But one other slight negative with the film is the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything other than what he s required to But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this character and is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings The one thing that no one can call derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the Nav i look incredible they re culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow The action sequences look amazing and you feel the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron s direction In all honesty there s nothing particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he s incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the battle scenes I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured his heart and soul into it It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that even though similar to others is like nothing I ve ever seen before 89 A,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3565512/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2010,"Spectacular to behold, but nothing more...",This movie was a treat to the eye and that was about where the hype ended for me The CGI effects were through the roof and amazingly nice to look at The story the plot the characters Well they were taken straight out of a how to make a Hollywood action movie book There was nothing here that haven t been seen in a bunch of other movies Actually Avatar seems to be a million dollar remake of the Battle for Terra animated movie Everything in this movie is clich and seen countless other times I am not going to give away spoilers for the movie but once you sit down and watch it you will go hmmm I have seen this exact storyline and event somewhere else Were I to give a rating for the CGI and effects alone this movie would be a top score but a movie needs to be more than glamorous effects and fireworks it needs depth and a solid story This is where Avatar fell apart And you just got to love the way Cameron worked in the climate situation propaganda That was just hilarious Overall the movie takes you in for a thrillride of spectacular colors and effects and provides mediocre entertainment story and plotwise I was left with a sense of disappointment from this movie It could have been so much more than a mediocre thrillride,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2202260/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2009,Welcome Back the King of the World (and Other Worlds),James Cameron had not directed any movie since being the King of the World after Titanic in 1998 This big movie Avatar is certainly more than an worthy comeback project to again re launch Mr Cameron back into filmdom s firmament When I first saw the trailer some months ago I admit that I was not entirely enticed to catch this film Lately though the film had been garnering nominations and wins for Best Picture in some year end award giving bodies including the Golden Globes And finally I was lucky enough to win two free tickets to a special invitational 3D screening tonight so there was no question that I would watch this And wow I am sure glad that I did Truth to tell the basic story is not entirely new as we have seen it in various incarnations in so many previous movies However the grand imaginative vision of Mr James Cameron is what elevated this piece into the masterpiece that it is We are effectively transported to a whole new time in the 22nd century and planet called Pandora with plant and animal life the likes of which we have never seen before The magical effect of 3D was put to good effect in the whole movie From the amazingly big battle scenes to quiet scenes the 3D drew us into this alien place as more than a mere spectator I found it hard to imagine watching this film in regular 2D The extra money you would pay to enjoy the 3D is very much worth it The acting of the humans and the aliens were all very good Clearly standing out are the good guys led by Sam Worthington very convincing as both the crippled Marine Jake Sully and his alien Avatar and Sigourney Weaver as his mentor and leader of the Avatar project Dr Grace Augustine On the alien side female characters like Zoe Saldana s Neytiri and CCH Pounder s Moat stand out The bad guys were a bit on the cardboard side one dimensional in their wanton greed and evil machinations This film is definitely a front runner in the award season in the next few months It is clearly the leader in the field of Visual Effects Cameron reportedly conceived this project back in 1994 but only pushed through now when the technology to realize his vision had been developed and how We the audience are also effectively drawn into the heart that beats within the story and get caught up in the adrenaline rush of the action along the way This is told as only James Cameron can Indeed he is back,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2175611/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2009,James Cameron: thanks for the chance to witness a turning point in cinematic history.,How often do you get to see a turning point in cinematic history Not in hindsight but as it is actually happening Not often Those watching The Jazz Singer in 1927 debut of audible dialogue or Becky Sharp in 1935 introduction of Technicolor experienced it I wasn t born for another eight years but I have read and heard that when Star Wars first came out in 1977 people were feeling a similar way that they were witnessing something never before seen that would change movies from that point on Has it really been 32 years between motion pictures that have had this impact Well revolutionary movies wouldn t be revolutionary if they came along all the time James Cameron s long awaited much touted 3D motion capture technique is a step towards the future What we see on screen during Avatar is nearly impossible to explain with words But I ll try Do you think 3D is just a gimmick Think again The depth and clarity afforded by the third dimension is invaluable it immerses you into the action so well that you aren t sitting in a cinema for three hours you enter a whole new world Forget the blurry patches to the sides of the screen or the impossibility of seeing things that are moving too fast as experienced in previous 3D flicks with Avatar you see everything as if it were real The digital surroundings that Cameron has created so he could shoot his actors with mo cap in an environment that already existed are awe inspiring Pandora is a beautiful forest and jungle like land whilst its non Na vi inhabitants are exotic and exhilarating in equal parts The realism of this fantasy world is extraordinary from the opening shot to the closing credits Pandora and all its creatures do exist In addition and most importantly the motion capture technique used for the Na vi is astounding Cameron s groundbreaking technology enables the Na vi to look move and interact realistically the smallest of nuances from the actors including pupil movement have been mimicked flawlessly onto their digital counterparts The aforementioned visual revelations are unsurprisingly marvellous during the action sequences the climactic battle is undoubtedly the standout however they lend themselves to the subtler scenes just as well Cameron refuses to use his pioneering invention just for spectacle he wants it to assist in capturing the minds and hearts of his audience Take for example a couple of the scenes where the Na vi fly on their local birdlife To experience something so graceful and elegant yet so thrilling and jaw dropping is where the real pleasure lies Most gratifying is not all the optical splendour on offer mind you it is the powerful tale that it is in aid of Cameron s account of love war and nature is more affecting than you might expect Avatar boasts a screenplay which at times will make you laugh at times make you cheer and at times make your heart heavy It never neglects the story and even infuses the action with a surprisingly high level of emotion A pivotal scene midway through where the humans launch their first attack is genuinely gut wrenching and shattering evoking similar feelings you get when watching the atrocities committed in wars gone by Cameron is greatly assisted by James Horner s booming score too it s African esquire sounds giving it an exotic and poignant feel that match the proceedings perfectly Hollywood s new kid on the block Aussie actor Sam Worthington delivers a star making performance as the conflicted Jake that along with his turns in Terminator Salvation and the upcoming Clash of the Titans will surely see him catapult to the top of the A list The unrecognisable Zoe Saldana is breathtaking as Neytiri Sigourney Weaver adds her usual class and elegance as the mother of the Avatar program Dr Augustine Michelle Rodriguez gives a career best performance as the cocky yet likable pilot Trudy Chacon whilst Stephen Lang makes one heck of a badass James Cameron thanks for giving this 24 y o his first chance to witness a turning point in cinematic history It will not be forgotten 5 out of 5 1 Rubbish 2 Ordinary 3 Good 4 Excellent 5 Classic,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2175367/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2022,Groundbreaking cinema,I ve always enjoyed this film following the release of the trailer for the second avatar film I decided to give this a rewatch to see if it has aged like many CG heavy films do after 5 10 years and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it holds up There are certain shadows textures lighting which look a bit old now but the rest is still stunning to look at From a story point of view this is one of my favourite type of films with the big action set piece the underdog coming out on top I really enjoy the world building My main critique of this film is the rushed ending it feels as though the last 30 minutes some BIG things happen that would impact our characters but this is heavily glossed over which I believe can be put down to the runtime Overall I give this film a 9 because of the quality of the film craft the beautiful soundtrack and the story isn t bad just rushed at the end There is also great rewatch ability to this film which helps its rating I m hyped for the new film,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8133511/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2009,AVATAR has a soul,AVATAR has a soul I saw AVATAR today It was a boiling 40 degrees Celsius in Australia I caught a bus and train to get there I spent months on a forum before that Incremental stops included a scriptment stills a teaser a foot AVATAR day and a full trailer Now released I have had many reviews to read which have been mostly very positive It is a marvel to watch The opening scenes are very sci fi with a glimpse of low gravity aboard a space craft Sam Worthington fills us in with a short narration He is taking over his diseased brother s role in the AVATAR program These opening scenes are actually among the most effective 3D in the film pulling you into this story tracking shots putting you into the steps of the characters I jump ahead like the film to The world of Pandora which is lush with earthly life as seen through pulp fantasies The rendering of this world is terrific The life and activity is in the plants as much as it is the animals Wonder is generated with this ambitious creation Cameron has lifted the bar The CG is the best I have ever seen Everything you have heard is true The 3D enhances this with leaves falling and swaying branches life like in the foreground The realisation of the Navii is also ambitious They are CG but there are many moments that make you think they are real and in terms of the story they are more than good enough to propel the narrative with strong emotional content I went into this film knowing mostly everything within it Hours of reading some from the treatment and pages of the recent reviews It is very much a family film like Nealz said in his IMDb review There is a moment where one of the ferocious animal species that earlier were attacking Jake are seen with a litter the children in the audience loved the cute pups The spiritual side of this film is much better than expected It is in fact a beautiful story The structure is classical film making but with amazingly new scope in CGI to express grand images An epic The journey that Jake takes through Pandora is lovely He is taken in by the Navii and explores their culture language and habitat Natirii the female Navii he meets while lost helps him through this journey This is a love story of both soul mates and with a wider picture Existential connections with the natural world Personal destiny I had tears in this film I tried to hold them back but by the roll of credits they came This is a movie that I have anticipated for so long I think the ingredients of its story and my connection to this films production gave me a very emotional response I cant imagine this disappointing any of the fans on the board Keeping in mind that it is a family film but delivered everything I wanted Expect a special edition After AVATAR is a hit a special edition will make its way to the cinema I can understand why they would cut the earth scenes and it works The actual film seems pretty brisk and it could also have more padding out You want more of it and that is a triumph for this type of film running two and a half hours It is a good balance because at two and a half hours AVATAR is aimed directly at the cinema going audience Broadly appealing with elements for everyone My earlier prediction of a billion or more world wide seems safe I don t want to go on about visuals too much but the lovely shots of the natural wonderland of glowing life in still 3D shots is magical Something to take kids to see Floating tiny neon li fe jellyfish their way through the air with grace The monkey like extra limbed creatures with the peeping eyes flock through the forrest quickly The creature design is done in a clever way with the motion of a living thing The action is over the top epic frenetic and a new take on the battle sequence James Cameron didn t stuff this up He probably pressed the studio way beyond their comfort zone with the time money and effort that has gone into this Sam Worthington is excellent casting choice Sigourney Weaver ads frank reason Stephen Lang chews the scenery as the ultimate you know what Zoe Saldana is beautiful as Jakes guide into this world and I went to the cinema and it was a very hot day By the time I left the cinema the streets were wet with rain A warm humidity was thick in the air Lightning splashed my walk to the train station with white light I honestly wondered if It was my time to be struck down with a bolt of electricity from the sky Watch this film It is destined to become a childhood classic to many little ones too young to be on this forum It will be talked about at high school by male and females as spectacular It will be watched multiple times by fans I loved it but beyond my appreciation for the film itself is the the message of love permeating from this movie that I hope enters the zeitgeist like elements of Cameron s other stories have At its heart is a soul AVATAR is an achievement in many technical departments but I wouldn t say the story is deficient It is a beautiful experience and the story is surprisingly what I loved most Believe the hype,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2175343/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2009,Solid Hit,Well I m going to have to give this movie a full rating because it really lived up to my expectations We have here a science fiction epic set on an alien world It s a classic story of a good guy hero who must overcome a battle within himself to do what is right Although the movie doesn t exactly have the biggest twists turns or surprises it simply sets out to do what movies like Star Wars the ones in the 70s and 80s that is did to stun us a little with the latest in special FX give us a classic Romanesque story and enchant us with a very creative world This movie did what it set out to do perfectly and maybe even a little better than perfect The world is so detailed and rich Every animal looks as if it is real and everything just matches and seems convincing The humanoid race that inhabits this world is very interesting and the way the world works together is amazing This may be one of the few sci fi adventure movies where the computer animation actually works in favor of the storyline Animals and beings do not look like animations This realism this pushing of the limits is what science fiction is all about But you obviously cannot have just a beautiful movie without no storyline or character to back it up There is a lot of character in this movie All of our human characters the alien race and the avatars all equally have great character And the storyline although nothing extraordinarily original is chiseled from classic storytelling Good versus evil doing what is right all spun neatly together What a wonderful escape this was It was dazzling and even got me thinking a little about what life is really out there on the various billions of stars that make up our galaxy and the other billions of galaxies out there And that s what movies like this should do,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2177752/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2010,Simplistic and boring,Jake Sully Sam Worthington is a paraplegic Marine who travels to the world of Pandora to do what he thinks is protecting the Earth The natives of that world are said to be vicious and cruel By transforming into one of them in his sleep or something he realizes they are NOT the evil ones and he begins to have serious doubts about his mission This leads to an all out battle at the end Basically this is cowboys vs Indians in outer space This is VERY easy to follow and understand which is the main problem Everything here is totally and utterly predictable You ve seen these characters and situations all before I was always one or two steps ahead on the plot and this isn t good for a movie that runs a needless 165 minutes This could have easily been wrapped up in 90 minutes Some people find getting into the world of the aliens is fascinating I wasn t fascinated at all just thoroughly and utterly bored To make matters worse the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book and the characters are either evil or good no shades of grey or ambiguity The movie also preaches it s against war but entertains us with an all out battle at the end Lots of people agree that the plot is light but the incredible special effects make up for it Not for me Yeah the special effects are impressive especially in 3 D but that isn t enough for such a long movie with a dull storyline I can t really comment on the acting here considering no one is given a character to play they re all walking talking clich s Only two people stand out Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver Worthington is very handsome with beautiful eyes and a cute little Australian accent Weaver is strong and commanding playing a scientist I will admit the battle at the end was kind of fun but I was mostly bored silly throughout this I kept looking at my watch patiently waiting for this to end I have to admit I m in the minority here It s gotten rave reviews from critics and has already broken box office records I attended a 4 30 show on a Saturday afternoon and it was sold out It s also among the top 50 movies here on IMDb I guess a lot of people like predictable stories with non stop special effects and cardboard characters I need something more than that The 2 is only for the effects and hot Worthington,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2189219/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2010,Absolutely breathtaking and an amazing surprise overall,Of course I had heard the hype over Avatar for a long time but just refused to believe it for many reasons It seemed very overrated at first glance as it probably did to most and I really didn t care to see if for awhile Now I am so glad that I gave it a chance because Avatar turned out to be a visually beautiful incredibly written and wonderfully executed work of art that indeed is my favorite movie of 2009 and one of the best movies I ve ever seen and that s without me viewing it in 3D First of all yes it does seem overrated at first glance Even when the film started my thoughts were that it had pretty bad dialogue and that it was going to be incredibly crappy and a complete waste of my time I changed that thought within the first twenty or twenty five minutes of the movie It begins to get so interesting and the characters start making an unbelievable impact on you and you really start to care for them and the story within the first twenty or twenty five minutes I don t lie It starts becoming more and more entertaining until you are completely mesmerized and astonished by how wonderful it truly is and how entranced you are in the film and how alluring it is to all your senses The movie is amazingly brilliant and even though it was long I was taking in every second with the utmost delight because James Cameron makes it so enjoyable to watch and has a direction that creates the most pleasurable and sensational atmosphere as he s done with every movie I ve seen by him The actors and actresses capture their characters superbly as well and make them really believable and likable down to the very core Sure the movie didn t bring that much new material but the way they handled it so delicately is what really pays off and makes the viewer tantalize every aspect I thought the suspense romance action and all other genre mixes were balanced perfectly and though the plot was paper thin it was strong because of how amazingly beautiful the visuals were and how powerfully the actors and actresses make their characters and how well the CGI makes it seem like you are actually on the planet Pandora and living every second of the film Simply fantastic I must say Well people who think it is still overrated after seeing it have probably disagreed with this by now but if you are a fan of Avatar and appreciated it for the astonishingly magnificent piece of work that it is I am right there with you It was exciting and riveting to the bone with CGI and lush picturesque scenes that are to die for The plot was well done because of how wonderful every one that worked on the film makes it be and the movie was entertaining as hell I am proud to say I enjoyed it highly and that James Cameron deserves all the money he received for this marvelous movie After it was off I wish it would ve never ended,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2250865/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2009,"Putting perfect Visuals and Virtualities aside, going deep into the Avatar's concept",Looking into Hindu mythology when Gods descend to Earth they acquire avatars to make themselves known by human beings Of the recent years TV animation series let s look over ban Star Racers from Jetix and The Last Airbender from Nickelodeon for avatar concept In ban Star Racers the Earth had been threatening by antagonist galactic races and human beings were expecting a savior from space who is called the Avatar On the other hand in the Last Airbender avatar concept was completely confused with Prophecy Aang the Avatar was born in the form of human being which is wrong because Avatar is a form of a God which has no destiny no life no death Herein James Cameron s Avatar the concept is truly appropriate to the origins of Hindu mythology When humankind explores the planet Pandora they aimed to search for underground resources so they send an ex serviceman to the natives in a DNA mapped hybrid body which seems like one of them to capture their secrets Becoming the Avatar of natives by time the ex serviceman saves the planet from humankind turning against his origin Exploring a new planet descending on the ground trying to capture it by blending within natives but failing to do so This actually is the same storyline with a Sci Fi legend Franklin Schaffner s Planet of The Apes 1968 Still keeping its sense with having the most terrifying ending of all science fiction works ever created Planet of The Apes has so many things in common with Avatar The Apes and the Na vis both seemed atrocious and uncivilized at first Then we realized that they re in fact very cuddly creatures Both Charlton Heston and Sam Worthington became beloved with a female native and we re introduced to their untouched and God s gift virgin nature Then as in Star Wars and Abyss humankind declares war against the natives to capture their lands and resources Another unique similarity between Planet of the Apes is that humankind is the evil side again So the same message we get with a deeper self criticism is that humankind is the one who destroys the nature and is responsible of all wars Wasn t this the Terminator s message as well spoken out by Sarah Connor It s in our nature to destroy ourselves All to the good we didn t lose our World to apes or cyborgs this time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2177106/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2009,An epic masterpiece,James Cameron has never directed a bad or even mediocre motion picture this is the guy who has brought us such classics as the first two Terminators Aliens one of the best sequels of all time True Lies exceptional action movie and of course Titanic That s why despite some negative buzz I was always pretty sure his latest endeavor Avatar was going to be something else Maybe not a game changer as many including Cameron himself have been saying but certainly something that we haven t seen before Well I still am not sure if this is a game changer but it certainly is something else Avatar is the most visually impressive and most immersive motion picture I ve seen in some time Not since Peter Jackson released the last of the Lord of the Rings movies has someone marveled me in such an amazing way transporting me into a different land where apparently anything is possible So maybe the story Cameron is telling is not 100 original but the way in which he tells it certainly is I haven t seen the movie in 3D I will on Saturday and a review will follow and I imagine it must be impressive but even while watching it on 2D I can t imagine anyone not being marveled and feel inspired by what Cameron has created This is one epic epic film an event and an experience unlike anything I ve seen this year Performances are quite solid The real scene stealer is Stephen Lang whose Quaritch is one of the most effective villains I ve seen in some time We know he is the villain not only because the screenplay tells us so but because Lang makes the character his own a real sonofabitch who knows no compassion and no mercy He never goes over the top and avoids turning his character into a caricature Although he is larger than life Sam Worthington is pretty good as Jake Sully although his American accent is less than stellar and Sigourney Weaver is memorable as Dr Augustine On the other hand Zoe Saldana has a tougher job Weaver and Worthington appear both in human and Na avi form but Saldana s character appears only as the former No problem though her performance with the aid of performance capture is strong enough to make the audience believe in her Like Gollum in the Lord of the Rings pictures the audience believe in the Na avi we believe they are real characters who breath cry laugh and can even die not just a bunch of pretty looking cartoons But what about the spectacle Despite all the drama and the romance Cameron has actually managed to deliver action wise if there is someone in Hollywood who truly knows how to portray the right balance between action special effects character development and story it is Cameron Simply put the film is breath taking Despite being approximately 60 CGI there was never a moment in which I was aware that I was watching big powerful computers at work There isn t one not a single one fake looking shot Pandora is simply beautiful and all the creatures including of course the Na avi are amazing and totally believable The way Cameron has populated his world is simply put worthy of applause every single plant creature monster predator everything is credible and awesome looking showing that Cameron is talented at both creating great stories and characters and using his vivid visual and fantasy based imagination And there is the difference between a masterpiece like Avatar and a mindless product like Transformers 2 the viewer actually believes in all the computer generated creatures characters and locations accepting them as real and believing they actually exist even when they appear on screen at the same time with flesh and blood characters Unlike the soul less Michael Bay movie Avatar has spirit and charm and never bores Yes there is action but it is not mindless because there are incredibly high stakes at hand and because we feel for the characters There are a lot of ridiculously tense moments in Avatar because of this on the other hand I didn t even flinch while watching Transformers 2 And if I did it was because the action scenes were almost incomprehensible Since I haven t seen the film on 3D I really don t know if Avatar truly is a game changer or not Why I do know though is that the movie is one of the most imaginative visually arresting and gripping motion pictures I ve seen in years and quite possibly the best film I ve seen this 2009 Avatar is not simply a movie it is a experience something that quite literally has to be seen to be believed It boasts a smart screenplay it has believable and sympathetic characters it s got the most believable and awe inspiring special effects ever seen on the big screen and it contains more thrills and emotions that any other film this year I don t care that Cameron took 12 years to make this film the final product was definitely worth the wait I just hope that all the rumours that say Cameron plans to shoot a sequel are actually true This is one rare case in which I just wish a second installment is actually released Hopefully it won t take 12 more years,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2176165/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2009,Wow...That is the only way to describe it.,I m not exactly sure when it became a thing among my tribe of film geeks to bash Avatar I know it wasn t when it came out because most of the film fans in my circle of nerdy friends went to watch it multiple times and couldn t get enough of it In hindsight I suspect it was around the time when everybody and their grandmother seemed to have seen it somehow once the film had become the most successful movie ever unadjusted for inflation it stopped being cool to like James Cameron s eco sci fi extravaganza Nowadays the film is often brought up in snarky movie blogs as a typical example for a film with great effects but a dull story unoriginal ideas and bland characters as if this were somehow the general consensus among film aficionados FernGully in space or Dances With Wolves with blue cat people are some of the kinder descriptions the film has to endure which in all honesty I don t get I mean it s fine not to like the movie all art is subjective and all that but how so many self professed film experts now pretend this critically acclaimed picture which on Metacritic is rated even higher than The Dark Knight was nothing but a bland unoriginal run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster that only succeeded thanks to the then novelty of 3D is frankly beyond me What I find even more astounding is how the very people who decry the lack of original director driven blockbusters in Hollywood are often the same who turn up their noses at Avatar an original director driven blockbuster that came out when most other big budget movies were either sequels or adaptations of already existing intellectual properties The ideas in the film are not original they claim Come on guys seriously So you ve seen a world like Pandora before A bioluminescent visual wonder that merges the colorful marine life of coral reefs with the lush vegetation of tropical rain forests A world where nature forms an actual neural network that stores memories and builds a collective consciousness You ve seen many films about a bio database that people can plug themselves into via ancient trees and communicate with their ancestors You ve watched countless blockbusters that take place in an eco system where you can form instant symbiosis with other creatures depending on your needs And by the way how many eco sci fi films have you seen Such a worn out concept and tired old sub genre right No my friends in terms of Hollywood blockbusters these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti colonial anti imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience To that end the film uses certain well known story tropes the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy the soldier who realizes he s been fighting for the wrong cause the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he s invading or the timeless trope of the fish out of water but they are not what the film is about And those tropes are not copied from Dances With Wolves either any more than that film stole them from Pocahontas they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history from Lawrence of Arabia to Shogun or The Last Samurai and countless others And yes our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters though neither are they as bland as the film s most vicious detractors claim but that s because they aren t really the film s main focus Avatar s actual protagonist its true star if you will is Pandora It s the WORLD we get to experience through Jake s eyes that really matters here and the film aims straight for your gut not your sci fi nerd brain which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans now claim to be disappointed with the film More than anything Avatar wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand in for our own threatened world and the film is an unapologetic uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature as well as a call to action to preserve them Which on an emotional level works marvelously nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon It s a genius scene and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of Home Tree does in Cameron s film So again I m trying to hammer my point home here Avatar is simple Yes but that s the point the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate the themes are not just derivative re treads they re as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone And that s exactly what Cameron s intention was to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world Which given the film s success it obviously did Personally I think Avatar is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness And while this may only have been my own individual experience Avatar was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D It was also the last time a film managed to do that And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular It s a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top notch CGI filled with fascinating creatures and jaw dropping future tech and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out non stop sci fi action thrill ride on a scale the world had rarely if ever seen before Obviously that doesn t mean it s a perfect film and as I already pointed out it s fair not to like it for any number of reasons above all personal taste but Avatar is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days Get over it people simple doesn t equal simplistic and the fact that Avatar is neither subtle nor cynical doesn t make it dumb even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed In all honesty I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film instead of the most successful movie of all time many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci fi adventure classic for the ages And as far as I m concerned that s exactly what Avatar is a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur Rant

14 September 2016,"Classic ""first release shock""",As a prolific reviewer here I have on many occasions encountered what I call first release shock Essentially a film so off the beaten path so unique so different that instead of appreciating it for what it is initial viewers go into a sort of shock and become numb to what they are watching This film is the poster child for that syndrome On its own it is one of the most daring best written best acted best SFX d films of all time It comes from a man Cameron who is known for blockbusters but this is easily his greatest work This film should rate a perfect score regardless of the rating system But as explained above initial viewers did not know what to make of it And the cost of the film became an issue for the studio when the numbers failed to meet expectations It is not the job of the reviewer to worry about studio receipts The job of the reviewer is identify brilliance and recommend it See it six or seven times it just gets better One of the greatest films of all time and also timeless,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3544275/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2019,Incredible: 10,This movie was hyped A lot More than probably any other movie in history This hype eventually piled up so high that the film itself could never catch up But shockingly enough it came damned close to doing just that Like Star Wars and The Matrix before it this film marked the beginning of a new generation of visual effects and like those films delivers enough in other areas to leave an impression that was more than just skin deep Despite this movie s singular flaw the script this cinematic titan delivered more than enough thrills to compensate for James Cameron s occasionally iffy writing It also does something that no other film has managed to do before it truly makes you feel like you are there in its world and you find yourself filled with a genuine sense of wonder as you try to take in Pandora s rich flora and fauna The quality of the special effects has been discussed to death already but this is the factor that anchors the film the aspect of it that was the main source of the astronomical anticipation other than the name James Cameron However if visual splendor serves as this movie s anchor then the ship is built mainly from two materials story and acting The story or more accurately stories though they have been told countless times before seem to never fail to leave a mark on audiences and the resonance of one in particular is felt almost too strongly today The clash of science commerce and militarism make for some great scenes of dialogue and tension and add a philosophical aspect to the film especially taking the constant contrast between the human Pandora and Na vi Pandora into account Of course the world of Pandora wouldn t be at all believable without characters populating it and the actors fit their respective roles like gloves Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana work incredibly well together onscreen and truly bring their roles to life with some of the most underappreciated performances of 2009 One final part of the movie that I feel was the most unappreciated is the soundtrack James Horner s best yet it combines most of the best aspects of modern orchestral scores with those of traditional tribal melodies to match the setting of Pandora and as a result is some of the most purely beautiful music anyone who cares to download the soundtrack will ever hear Though you only leave Pandora just under 3 hours after you arrive Pandora will not leave you for a considerably longer period of time While it may not have been the best film of 2009 in terms of raw quality its emotional impact outstanding direction and truly spectacular eye candy easily make it one of the most entertaining,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5018963/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2009,It's out of this world!,James Cameron s sci fi epic finally arrives having gestated in the filmmakers mind for longer than a decade Is his vision of the future just as fresh in 2009 or is should this avatar be terminated There s one thing you have to give Cameron he is like the postman he delivers granted sometimes he may be a little late but if there s one filmmaker you can always rely on its Cameron I haven t disliked a Cameron movie to date in fact I ve loved almost everything he s done with the exception of course being Piranha II but let s not get into that Avatar is a razor sharp reminder of how epic film making is done Not since Return of The King has epic been done on a scale this big A paraplegic ex marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet s indigenous Na vi race in this ambitious digital 3 D sci fi epic from Academy Award winning Titanic director James Cameron The story ticks all the right boxes at least for a Cameron film It s got good guys with guns bad guys with even bigger guns and appalling guys with even bigger guns It s far from original and won t come up at this week s book club This said it s very engaging and the people and aliens involved are interesting The film goes to great length in order to develop its characters so we feel the hardship and pain when they fall in battle The film does an excellent job of keeping a good pace Its near impossible to get bored whilst watching the film and this may have been the quietest i have ever seen an audience It s an engaging trek through uncharted lands that while feeling very familiar is a brand new assault on the senses James Cameron has spent a long time in incubation flitting around on submarines but if Avatar is a reminder of anything it s a reminder that he s the best the industries got His harsh no nonsense approach to film making has landed him with one of the most polished pieces of art of the century and for that I take my hat off to you This may be the most polished movie of the decade sweeping epic and dare I say flawless Not quite As far as the direction goes however it s close enough and ranks for me as Cameron s second best film to date behind Aliens IN the hands of any other director this could have gone terribly wrong anybody other than Cameron may have played it safe delivering a spectacle but an underwhelming one Cameron pushes so many boundaries with one single film that it s hard not to stand up and cheer once the final credits roll This film has pushed the limitation of the cinema medium and emerged as one of the finest film of the decade And dare I say a classic The acting is exceptional Nothing warms my heart more than seeing Weaver and Cameron united for the first time since she stood toe to toe with the alien queen She is astounding and gives an electrifying performance as Dr Grace Augustine a woman split between two worlds What s funny is the fact that she is not the strongest actor in the film If anybody deserves a standing ovation is has to be Zoe Saldana who completely transforms into this other worldly thing If you had gone into the movie not knowing that that was her you would never had guessed she was even human She is unrecognisable and exhilarating as Neytiri who is without a doubt the standout role of the film Other congratulations must be given to Sam Worthington who shows us that Terminator Salvation was not just beginners luck Michelle Rodriguez gives a stellar turn as Trudy Chacon and ends up the way Rodriguez usually ends up That however would be too much information Now for the pi ce de r sistance the reason you ve already booked your ticket the reason you re so sceptical the reason the hype for this film is so large The presentation To call it out of this world would be an understatement It s stunning Sun all those pre conceived judgement and see for yourself The sheer scope of the film is impeccable This film will have you clambering through the jungle on horseback soaring on the back of a banshee and just when you ve taken in the sights and sounds Pandora has to offer you ve bee blinded be the beautiful destruction on the final act Any filmmaker that can make such destruction rather beautiful is a mastermind in my opinion Verdict Avatar is far more than a movie it s a cinematic experience This is a visually assault on the senses and something that is destined to change cinema forever It s utterly gorgeous all backed up with scene stealing acting fantastic direction and wait for it the mother of all battle scenes Believe the hype Cameron has delivered one of the best films of the decade and something that will undoubtedly stand the test of time I ll be waiting in anticipation for the sequel just don t be too long will you,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2176022/?ref_=tt_urv

how many eco sci fi films have you seen Such a worn out concept and tired old sub genre right No my friends in terms of Hollywood blockbusters these ideas and concepts are about as original as they come and some of them are even inspired by actual biological phenomenons like the discovery that the roots of trees do indeed form a sort of neural network in a symbiosis with fungi where they are able to store and exchange information But what is true is that the filmmaker cleverly chose a very straight forward story to get his environmentalist plea and anti colonial anti imperialist message across and make some rather complex sci fi ideas more accessible for a broad audience To that end the film uses certain well known story tropes the spy who changes sides once he falls in love with an enemy the soldier who realizes he s been fighting for the wrong cause the invader who gets to know and appreciate the foreign culture he s invading or the timeless trope of the fish out of water but they are not what the film is about And those tropes are not copied from Dances With Wolves either any more than that film stole them from Pocahontas they are so universal you can find variations of any one of them in numerous legends and stories and thus also throughout film history from Lawrence of Arabia to Shogun or The Last Samurai and countless others And yes our heroes Jake and Neytiri are not the most complex of characters though neither are they as bland as the film s most vicious detractors claim but that s because they aren t really the film s main focus Avatar s actual protagonist its true star if you will is Pandora It s the WORLD we get to experience through Jake s eyes that really matters here and the film aims straight for your gut not your sci fi nerd brain which I suspect is the actual reason why so many former Cameron fans now claim to be disappointed with the film More than anything Avatar wants you to lose your heart to this beautiful planet that functions as an obvious stand in for our own threatened world and the film is an unapologetic uncynical declaration of love to the wonders of nature as well as a call to action to preserve them Which on an emotional level works marvelously nothing in the film is as painful and shocking as the destruction of a single big tree which symbolizes quite literally nature as the home and shelter we depend upon It s a genius scene and I dare you to find an action blockbuster where the distruction of a city or a whole planet carries even a shred of the emotional heft that the falling of Home Tree does in Cameron s film So again I m trying to hammer my point home here Avatar is simple Yes but that s the point the simplicity and familiarity of the story are deliberate the themes are not just derivative re treads they re as universal as those in myths and fairy tales and thus speak to everyone And that s exactly what Cameron s intention was to use simple enough tropes and archetypes to convey a heart felt message that would work across cultural borders and reach people all over the world Which given the film s success it obviously did Personally I think Avatar is a prime example of visual and emotional storytelling done right and viewing it for the first time offers an experience that is almost without equal in its immersiveness And while this may only have been my own individual experience Avatar was also the first movie in a long time that completely vowed me in the sense that I felt like a little kid again in the theater which had very little to do with the novelty of 3D It was also the last time a film managed to do that And even in terms of pure entertainment the film is simply spectacular It s a rousing adventure with gorgeous visuals and top notch CGI filled with fascinating creatures and jaw dropping future tech and the final 40 minutes of the film provide an all out non stop sci fi action thrill ride on a scale the world had rarely if ever seen before Obviously that doesn t mean it s a perfect film and as I already pointed out it s fair not to like it for any number of reasons above all personal taste but Avatar is far from deserving the kind of snark and ridicule it gets these days Get over it people simple doesn t equal simplistic and the fact that Avatar is neither subtle nor cynical doesn t make it dumb even if it does make it harder for some of us nerds to like it wihtout feeling slightly embarassed In all honesty I believe if this had been a slightly more obscure film instead of the most successful movie of all time many of the same people who hate on it now would hail it as an epic sci fi adventure classic for the ages And as far as I m concerned that s exactly what Avatar is a modern classic by a visionary filmmaker and true auteur Rant
