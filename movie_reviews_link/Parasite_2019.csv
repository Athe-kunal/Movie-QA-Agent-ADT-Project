5 July 2019,One of the best films of this decade,I am remarkably stingy with my 10 10 ratings I ll be the first person to acknowledge this Of the roughly 2600 titles I ve rated on here only 34 have a 10 Parasite is one of them If this isn t a masterpiece then I don t know what is I m going to keep it vague on the plot front because I didn t know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways What I will say is that this film more than just about any other I ve seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132 minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent Parts of this movie were hilarious Parts were heartbreaking Other parts were insanely suspenseful I m honestly not sure if I ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad way back in 2013 And it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering You come to care for just about all of them I m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie And sure I ve seen many movies that are hard to fault but it s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect It s extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake there s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie s over and this one s not going to leave my head for a while I can tell Catch this one when you can and believe the hype Joon Ho Bong has made many great films and so far no bad one s but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was this one will surely be up there,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4978432/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2019,"You name a genre, this movie covers it",I can t remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as Parasite The movie starts out almost like an Ocean s Eleven heist film and then expands into a comedy mystery thriller drama romance crime and even horror film It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too I love a film that respects its audience There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch ability factor will be very high The film was incredibly entertaining too I can t think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening at least in terms of action Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this I had a great time with Parasite and I think most that give it a chance will too,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5166061/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,In a meritocracy success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination Anyone can rise to the top and for some lucky Cinderella plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired you too can achieve you dreams if only you try The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition backstabbing deceit and callousness You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one and then perhaps when you at last feel secure you can afford to be kind and confident and generous It s easy to be nice when you re rich the mother in this film Jang Hye jin at one point observes But it s a very long and very crooked ladder and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip and sometimes they ve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down either by those above you or just as often by those staring up from the ground below There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder But in a meritocracy you can t blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it No you must blame yourself You should have tread more carefully You should have climbed more quickly You should have used a firmer and more precise grip anticipated disasters and known just when to leap If you fail in a meritocracy it s all your fault You should have tried harder Better luck next time Kim Ki woo Choi Woo sik the young man who is the main character of PARASITE several times refers to metaphors and the film itself is of course a metaphor On a surface level viewers are treated to a very thrilling engaging well paced and well plotted crime story At all times however bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film there are deeply personal meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer These insights are rarely foregrounded They are so subtly interwoven in fact that if you re like me you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate humanist story you ve just witnessed Bong Joon ho s filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he ll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he s done so I want to avoid spoilers here but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece beautifully lensed enthrallingly edited superbly acted and intimately involving South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky Higher education is widespread so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs I lived in Korea once and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day six days a week public school English immersion private school piano class soccer team taekwondo math camp chess club and so on I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long As the father Song Kang ho in the film at one point says this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job One can t afford not to struggle The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea however They are the story of global capitalism and the specter of American materialism and imperialism note the Indians looms heavily over the film Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all It s nice to dream and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine and how nice an ending it is when they do But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be maybe just whims and fancy More often it seems our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5080349/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,"Engaging as a drama, with an intelligent social aspect to it",A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family if they can engineer it they can each get one of the jobs within the household This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story seeing the rich family as the marks As it plays out though it keeps this assumption in the background eating at the viewer as an idea before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot Between the start and then the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself In this the film engages and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film for me the key one was the falseness of the con itself Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family it is not like they are stealing money from them or somehow dislodging them from their position in life no they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job and the rich family could probably not care less about the truth as long as their needs continue to be met This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film and adds sense to what happens and why but it is interesting in and of itself Technically the film looks great and the director builds mood and tone well Performances are strong across all the cast but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition but it is a handsome clever film and the timing in the year is right I don t see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture but this is more to do with the system than with the film Regardless of awards or not it is an engaging drama with unusual developments and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative,0.0,20.0,24.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6001308/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2019,For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half,It s not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated especially if the reason is that they didn t like the second half of it It s much easier to understand the message of a movie when the good guys win or the bad guys get punished in the end I m not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values But still I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there s a character with a clearer moral center whom audiences can easily relate to So I think it s no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences Some complained that they don t understand Ki Taek s motive for killing Mr Park But to fully appreciate this you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is crossing the line It s a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people s privacy or as one should mind one s own social position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position If interpreted as the latter meaning it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families respective dwellings It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon Ho chose such a path and he is too good a director not to see such a danger Instead he chose to make Mr Park a reasonable enough character despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature He seems to treat Ki Taek fairly enough at first but he also warns the latter not to cross the line if Ki Taek attempts to pry into his private life At first it seems that it s quite easy for Ki Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr Park s house in various roles and mingle with them Ki Taek even compliments how nice Mr Park s family is but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard when he was hiding under the table what Mr Park really thinks of him almost a different species of the human being who doesn t even smell like him Ki Taek s final disillusionment came when Mr Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son s shock while virtually ignoring Ki Taek s daughter s status who s dying on the ground spurting blood from the stab wound That moment Ki Taek realizes how Mr Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being but something much more insignificant And he also realizes the line that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour Instead it is a line that can even determine the life of those lesser human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those proper human beings However easy it was for Ki Taek s family to sneak into Mr Park s house or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr Park s family their existence is no better than that of a parasite which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house With such disillusionment and anger Ki Taek chose to kill Mr Park as a parasite could to its host and like a parasite he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host s body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr Park s or Ki Taek s personalities Instead it s a line drawn by an invisible hand separating those classes according to their respective social conditions which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey Of course not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care free pastime that everyone can understand But without if the movie didn t change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year 4 662 out of 5 125 found this helpful,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5195256/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,Thoroughly entertaining,PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho a talent I ve long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago He s had his ups and downs over the years although they ve generally been ups rather than downs but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece It s a quiet and reflective work his maturist yet a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way The issue is universal which is why this film did so well abroad and at the Oscars although I ve been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think,10.0,70.0,98.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6225768/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2020,An original dark comedy about class struggles,This is a well written and well perfomed original film With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success,9.0,193.0,277.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5400852/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2021,Thought It Might Win Best Foreign Movie,When the buddy who got into college tells him he s moving to the US and he s passing on the 14 year old he s been tutoring just tell em you re enrolled in college even though you aren t the son of a family so low class they ve sunk through the foundation finds them very nice very accepting and very clueless So he and his layabout family get all the help fired his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister the father as the new chauffeur and the mother as the cook housekeeper Yet even though you don t see them there are vermin living in the foundations and they come out when the people in charge aren t around It s a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror with a script that handles the theme of the people we don t see because they re not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion When I saw it in a theater during its New York run I was impressed I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie and might even win,10.0,38.0,58.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7628856/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea like what movie Us attempts to do but done properly It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like and its realism is very painful Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc but many people still live miserable lives and situation is very similar to that in China where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt and this is often directed against the white people who being able to process milk smell like butter and are seen in rac ist light as unclean but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles like roaches in the dark but in life and death situations resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies with many subtle points criticizes their culture and emulation of the America with a few cruel but precise strokes The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie,9.0,88.0,135.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5411971/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,A black comedy on social inequality,There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim Parasite 2019 generates a great deal of conversation but be warned it is not a film for everyone especially those averse to gory endings If you step back from the story s twists and turns the narrative premise is simple A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as one by one each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor driver and housekeeper The gullible family is easy to deceive while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion However the plan comes un stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub plots and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens But that is not the point of the film Director Joon ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea s social order This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy There is more to this film than political discourse As a black comedy it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low hanging fruit One can also find elements of magical fantasy as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers The acting tends towards wooden and it is difficult to warm to any particular character The film s climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites For many the critical pendulum swings towards the masterpiece label But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original engaging and disturbing tale of endemic class tension oppression and helplessness Although tenuous the message has universal relevance,8.0,118.0,190.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5362817/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,Totally Unique,Usually I don t read reviews before seeing a film This one however I did and happily so First of all it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about We need to shed our cultural biases including how to make films This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters The title I assume means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves I hope to see more from this director in the future,9.0,50.0,80.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5971949/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2019,Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,As a film about a family imposing on another and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us tell a multi layered story in a widely entertaining manner but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative That s not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare writer director Bong Joon ho is in a class of his own The film follows a lower class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper class family and their lavish household As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances It s a twisty satire on social economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts However to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride,9.0,361.0,565.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4972695/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.,Finally saw this much talked about film As a fan of Korean thrillers this film surpassed my expectations The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple posing as unrelated highly qualified individuals The film begins like a dark satire it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u it is not at all demeaning It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious,10.0,102.0,183.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5459301/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2019,"FUNNY, TURNS SUDDENLY TWISTED, THEN SAD",This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families one very poor the other very rich How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half then in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread and perhaps even enjoy Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes If you see only one foreign language film this year this should be it Exciting and provocative throughout it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away Deserves all the accolades it has already and surely will continue to receive,10.0,212.0,357.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5234889/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,"""If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""",This film s ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly Usually when a hot new release makes it s way into the Top 250 it manages to remain in it s general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote Parasite entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall and since then has managed to improve it s position to 26 as I write this No one knows if that will hold obviously so I m curious to see how the movie rates over time Having stated that I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it s way into the life and home of the Park family What was questionable to me was why the Kim s weren t able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min Seo joon Park suggested the tutoring job to Ki woo Woo sik Choi Each of the Kim s demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long It s not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition because once that ambition kicked into gear there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park s Not that it wasn t done by underhanded or devious means but with those kinds of street smarts they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood But that was the set up so you have to go with it Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim s luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak Personally I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon gwang Jeong eun Lee unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home they would have been discovered by the Kim s had they followed and observed Moon gwang to begin with Instead the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim s from their lucrative positions I have to admit I was somewhat baffled by Mr Kim s Kang ho Song stabbing of Park Dong ik Sun kyun Lee but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective I can t say that I agree wholeheartedly but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive all revolving around the idea of crossing the line that the Kim s were guilty of Even so by giving the story a Tarantino esque spin for it s denouement was going more than a bit over the top And to venture even further into the realm of unreality Ki woo s survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone not once but twice was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer As for the ultimate finale who s to say that Kim woo s plan to rescue his dad wasn t a viable one grow up get rich and buy the house Good luck with that idea because in the very words of Mr Kim himself If you make a plan life never works out that way And on top of that it would be a decade long mission at the very least In the final analysis if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park s I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home But it didn t turn out that way and as a result I think it misses the mark as the year s Best Picture at the Oscars Addendum 2 10 2020 Well I m not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture s chances at the Oscars It won Best Picture last night in a pretty competitive field Congratulations,8.0,43.0,75.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5438540/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,"Class struggle. After Karl Marx and Victor Hugo, here is Joon-ho Bong",This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d Or at the Cannes Festival If I have one and only one advice to give you go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information Indeed this film might schematically be split in two parts the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous especially the gorgeous Cho Yeo jeong for whom I may confess I have a crush As a postscript an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you re French in the middle of the film the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap Le rustique and Bresse bleu Unbelievable,9.0,208.0,385.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4924389/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,"Parasite Review: Comedy, drama, suspense, and yes, even horror.",A family who doesn t have a lot of money or opportunities in life starts working for a wealthy family But will this change the life of the poor family DIRECTOR Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS Bong Joon Ho Han Jin Wan CAST Song Kang Ho Lee Sun Kyun Cho Yeo Jeong Choi Woo Shik Park So Dam Lee Jung Eun Chang Hyae Jin In the movie we follow the Kim family who doesn t have much money By chance the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family He teaches their daughter English Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house Then the movie starts to get darker and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie The title of the movie turns things on its head Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience Parasites are found in all classes of society From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie and it s pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down and you feel like they re on board the Titanic They must run from the top and down to the engine room What a wonderful sequence and it s so beautiful to watch The cast was fantastic and everyone fit the needs of their roles The characters were well written with the performances complementing that perfectly It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people whom despite their eccentricities maintained a grounded realistic feel The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing So if you like foreign films thrillers or movies that can make you think a little check this one out It s a crisp film from a technical aspect and with a blend of great writing and acting you can t go wrong It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence 9 10,9.0,21.0,33.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5469880/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2019,Lacks any realistic human dimension,South Korean director Bong Joon ho Okja says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way Palme d Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival Bong s Parasite Gisaengchung does indeed thwart expectations but the question is to what end Defying any strict genre classification the film is a conglomeration of comedy drama satire crime horror and anything else you can throw into the mix Bong sees the film as a statement about the ranks and classes inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye and says that the film depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today s increasingly polarized society Unfortunately the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong s statement without much impact The film looks at class differences between two families one well to do and the other n eer do well For the Kim family life is a struggle They live in a cramped bug infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf The father Ki taek Song Kang ho Snowpiercer has failed in business and has accumulated many debts His son and daughter Ki woo Choi Woo sik Train to Busan and Ki jung Park So dam Cinderella and Four Knights TV series have repeatedly failed college entrance exams The mother Chung sook Hyae jin Jang Adulthood along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company but cannot even get that right Not to worry they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi Fi from the next door coffee shop On the other hand the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages Mr Park Lee Sun kyun Jo Pil ho The Dawning Rage is the CEO of a high tech company and the family lives in a spacious modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon kyo Jo Yeo jeong The Target a teenage daughter Da hye Jung Ji so The Tiger and a hyper active young son Da song Jung Hyun jun Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude for Bong they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters With the aid of a friend Ki woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da hye Of course he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs Park of his competence With that conquest out of the way the cunning Ki woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso Mrs Park hires Ki jung as an art teacher then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims this time for the deadbeat dad Ki taek and his wife Chung sook Bong said that Sometimes with the characters in my films I look at them cynically but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters even with the villains This compassion however does not seem to extend to the loyal hardworking household workers their work scammed out of existence Without going into detail the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over the top unsettling even though utterly implausible Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers revenge bloody violence a torrential rainstorm people hiding under beds and any other mayhem that may come to mind To be clear Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp edged yet it is hardly as one critic described it a masterful dissection of social inequality When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film Bong said I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about It is in parts funny frightening and sad and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it I ll wish for nothing more Enjoy the drink In a little while you may have trouble remembering what the film was about,7.0,72.0,132.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5189278/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2019,"Poor pacing, too few twists, too unbelievable",I think there s a really good movie buried in Parasite somewhere but I gave up trying to find it It has the same problem the director s previous The Host had the pacing is broken That s not all though People have written about the movie s unexpected twists and turns The thing is it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive they are too few and far between and too unbelievable The first major twist happens about an hour in and seems to come out of nowhere The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits though they are far fetched how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly until by the end I wasn t even paying attention Pity Some of the sequences were brilliant,6.0,78.0,146.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5338090/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,It's so metaphorical,It s so metaphorical is what Kevin says when they show him Da Song s paint he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about most critics of this movie say exactly that It s so metaphorical obviously Most know what you are talking about when writing something about a movie I have to be 100 sure that I have understood It s so metaphorical This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground sometimes leaves it to the public s interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house the house is shown in a low angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way as there are many examples throughout the film the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight the shots in the Kim s house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs are some simply steps over others Who are the real Parasites the Kims or the Parks the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty living under the ground and in precarious conditions but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings there is nothing they can do their children are educated by others their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others Kim s family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages even better than many college students his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did control and support Da Song but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won t be able to read while he has a dream after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes,9.0,120.0,191.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5446179/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2020,Bong's Brilliance,When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood When I see a decent foreign film I can t help but want to praise it more because they don t have the multi billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them Usually they have to be more creative more ingenious and more resourceful Parasite is one of very few Korean films I ve watched in my life My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space Korean films are a rarity for me This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them That is essentially what happened but you re not holding anyone s attention with that concept alone Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either Some how Parasite did that The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead The Park family was wealthy yet unlike your average rich movie family they were not cruel or unbearable people In fact they were very likeable Normally we want our clear cut good guys and bad guys We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose In the cases where all of our guys are good we want them all to win In the cases where all our guys are bad we want them all to lose In Parasite not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners,8.0,19.0,31.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428173/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2019,Family Affairs,Winner of the Palme d Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019 to say Parasite is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament When you have to spill blood in a film you have to dose it with genius hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and above all understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well Don t get me wrong Parasites is not a bloody drama but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art it is a tragicomedy about love life and death it is a film about the joy of living about survival about the family of the 21st century but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many that sick stifled definition confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019 many dispossessed and a few privileged in a game of services and currency exchanges in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence horror and death Although director Bong Joon ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes I only know one of his films the cult fable The Guest a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus Again in Parasite Bong addresses the family issue opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children to a rich family with the same number of members The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story A third component personified by a housekeeper gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax which is not the end of the fascinating story at this point of the story it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell until the sad final close up that ends this work When I watch films like Parasites my heart skips a beat I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L A garbage that the cinemas offer week after week freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes As soon as Parasite appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies don t miss it,10.0,22.0,36.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5301416/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,Brilliant Dark Satire,Parasite A con artist family preys on an upper class couple and their children That s the bare bones of this film but it is a multi layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon ho keeps things going at a brisk canter A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park s home is a joy to observe First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper the existing servants just cast aside Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror Another masterpiece by Bong Joon ho which he partially based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family 9 10,9.0,25.0,42.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5438030/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,Parasite,Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar The first third of the film had me wondering why The film opens in a dilapidated smelly semi basement in South Korea The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour s wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes Dad Ki taek is the weak link He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted Son Ki woo gets a stroke of fortune when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma Ki woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion Soon Ki woo gets his sister Ki jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son The wily Ki jung conspires to get the Park s family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung sook All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family pretty soon the Kim s are earning good money and living well They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park s are away on a break the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey s The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter It goes in that direction but then swerves off When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese It was his movies Bong studied in film school The key is Scorsese s own British influences ranging from Ealing Films Hitchcock to Powell Pressburger There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class A fatalistic metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy Parasite has a heightened reality the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people like those who travel in crowded tube trains they seal their fate Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far Ki woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed fate and fortune will ensure of that,7.0,27.0,47.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5505827/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,Neither fish nor foul,I am not Korean and maybe I cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me In some scenes I saw an actor or actress pretty weak in the next rather strong Sometimes I had the feeling they were no professional actors at all And I can judge acting and I know that that was not on purpose The camera work was good I really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes some misleading others very clear Would the storyline have been as thorough as that this would be a great movie in my opinion But it wasn t None of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments The dichotomy of a society here in lower class people and the rich worked well yet a little stereotypical The poor were poor but witty the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive Would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down No it wouldnt that s what this film tells us It s a satire of course For a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a well thought script Like some others here I don t know why this got an Oscar for best movie Was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win,5.0,44.0,74.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5842146/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2019,The Best Film in Years.,Maybe it s just me but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017 2016 was a very good year for film the last great year altogether Have I simply seen too many films In 2016 and earlier There were a whole bunch of films that I could say now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen Since 2017 the most that I could say about I film I love would have been I love this film But I don t adore it One of the best of the year not ever Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours But throughout that duration time stands still We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains Parasite follows two families the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum many people interpret this as a social satirical film I can see where they are coming from but I didn t care about that Many different themes such as identity are also looked at but that is all just icing on the cake Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions so we root for them right away to get out of the slums Ki woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da hye in english Ki woo does not know English well but figures he can fake it and make some money he may be just a tutor but it pays well He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son so Ki woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy s therapist With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job it all seems like a sinch to get them in But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom Parasite could be simplified as family vs family but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters They are smart sympathetic even likeable The reason I call this film Hitchcockian is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine Even when a movie is unpredictable the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily But with this each time a twist comes which is frequent the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard The director really pulls out the rug from underneath Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director Bong Joon Ho could easily have messed up at any moment But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material In fact it it just the opposite the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate With all that happens Parasite becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget 4 4,10.0,23.0,38.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5256898/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2019,Food for thought delivered with exciting wit,Parasite is the best movie of the year This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety second Academy Awards This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy drama horror thriller and tragedy The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money Parasite however is less cumbersome melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit depth and creativity instead International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions The movie is so detailed precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again I m grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre People are craving for a change and are tired of tame predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels remakes and sequels There should be more creative dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets,10.0,29.0,50.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5252080/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2019,"Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""",If there s an argument that s been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class From the days of cavemen the Roman Empire the Enlightment and even modern times philosophers scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor It s something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all It s hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that s its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa This is also something that many movies has dived into In fact one of my favorite movies of the 2000 s is the science fiction thriller Snowpiercer It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out It s a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into It looks like he s made another movie about class except Parasite is a smaller story about two families but is still as impactful We start with a family of four living in the slums in a basement under a store father Kim Ki Taek played by Song Kang ho mother Chung sook played by Jang Hye jin son Kim Ki woo played by Choi Woo shik and daughter Kim Ki Jeong played by Park So dam They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes When a friend of the son comes to visit he offers Kim Ki woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family s daughter He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of a fancy house built by a famous architect wide space a backyard and nice cars After some convincing from the family a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son the father as a new driver errand runner and the mother as the new housekeeper The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something Though there is a second half to the movie I can t talk about it without spoiling it Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019 It may sound like a typical dark comedy but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn t expect At the front this is still a story on class difference A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of helping the poor Thankfully Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different Parasite doesn t try to make the wealthy family out to be villains But they don t try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child If anything it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad but even that can depend on a number of factors This movie is the prime example of would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully but it s acted amazingly Though the movie is in Korean you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I ve seen this year hence why I m not naming them one by one I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has I ll give this ten fancy houses out of ten It may be in a different language but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is,10.0,21.0,34.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5257052/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2019,One of the decade's most clever and original,South Korean film crews may be World Cinema s most painstakingly dedicated the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves As is the case with Bong Joon ho s Parasite they might also produce some of our time s most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process We meet the impoverished Kim family father Ki taek Song Kang ho mother Chung sook Jang Hye jin son Ki woo Choi Woo shik and daughter Ki jeong Park So dam and we soon learn they aren t the most honest bunch Ki woo through his friend Min hyuk gets hired as a homeschool English teacher using forged Oxford documents at the home of the upper class Park family tech company CEO Dong ik Lee Sun kyun his stressed out wife Yeon gyo a wonderful Cho Yeo jeong teen daughter Da hye Jung Ji so and little Da song Jung Hyun joon This is but the beginning of the Kim family s sneaky ascent Learning of Da song s troubles Ki woo going by Kevin informs Mrs Park of an art therapist he knows named Veronica who is actually Ki jeong who may help Da song evolve Through a series of events I won t spoil Veronica later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki taek going by Mr Kim who in turn recommends a new housekeeper played by Chung sook The way the Kims continually fool the Parks from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad libbing based on research they ve done for the fields they pretend to work in is clever tense impossible to predict and morbidly hilarious throughout It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it s edited for instance cutting from Ki taek lying to Yeon gyo to him finishing the same sentence during Ki woo s rehearsals how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence and how utterly believable these performances are The actors who portray the Kims in particular give remarkably layered performances Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family s home employees The characters themselves are convincing actors hence their successful duping of the Parks which makes each real world actor s performance all the more considerable And yes it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position but the film is self aware and deliberate about this not only because the Parks in their carefree luxury aren t the most observant This is all comical to experience yes but what Bong has to say about class inequity and during the film s bleaker later scenes how it isn t necessarily so simple as letting the poor have some luxury for the sake of fairness is what makes Parasite stick We may understand the downtrodden Kims we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique and laugh at their conniving schemes but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end Parasite is generally well loved but divisive in the circles you d expect My guilty pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families also calling it a cancel culture comedy because I guess anti family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to cancel offensive celebrities and indeed berate classism So far as I can decipher White s main evidence is the fact that in the story a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi titular social parasites whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists As mentioned the Kims aren t strictly heroes or justified Isn t this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters read villains who co opt our customs perversely But then psh who d reason like that,10.0,18.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5303579/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2019,Extremely absurd without basic logic,Huge Oscar Winner What a JOKE There s no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4 member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family The two screenplay writers one of them was the director Bong simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99 struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1 rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation like feel good opportunity for the poor a self righteous self justified self indulgent revenge on the rich class At the beginning of this movie this lowlife 4 member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition the husband father was unemployed for a very long time the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times This helpless and hopeless family couldn t simply become a well practiced con artist family overnight If they were such great scammers they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time They were just like you and me who don t have money to afford a dignified basic living standard They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con artist so easy and so soon The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers director who made the rich people looked so stupid naive emotional fragile and so easily to be conned they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich The differences between the rich and the poor are many but usually it s because the rich people are smarter more intelligent more cunning 1 000 times sharper than the poor they are not so easy to be manipulated conned scammed or swindled otherwise they wouldn t become rich and successful Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn t even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile naive shallow emotional wreck but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split hair sharp otherwise they d not be able to handle their social status The husband in this movie also showed that he s a hardworking super smart self made businessman and entrepreneur he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers Yet this movie again simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers In summary Zero Probability Highly Unlikely The long term helpless 4 member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well experienced well organized smart grifters swindlers How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly so suddenly become so smart so organized so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step It s against the basic logic and absolute impossible The director screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples hate resent bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10 minutes standing ovation it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich so they were so generous to award this one way street movie the grand prize I don t know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con artist imposter swindler fraud genre movies Ah ga ssi Handmaiden 2016 is almost the same like this sucker but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love making scenes these two movies are basically the same HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE SAME CRAP DIFFERENT TITLE Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them To me both of these two movies are just a torture to watch There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers so I think it s time to call off making such stupid movies I m a poor guy yet I don t hate the rich people but envy them I m also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me there s no way I could manipulate them and con even 0 01 out of their pocket,0.0,276.0,574.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5102024/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2020,The Privilege Class crashes into the Working poor,My Review Parasite My Rating 9 10 I m so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer director Bong Joon Ho Parasite has already received numerous accolades with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director and Best International Feature Film making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition At the 77th Golden Globe Awards the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards It also became the first non English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture The film s title Parasite was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning which he had to convince the film s marketing group to use Bong said Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family and I think that s why the marketing team was a little hesitant But if you look at it the other way you can say that rich family they re also parasites in terms of labor They can t even wash dishes they can t drive themselves so they leech off the poor family s labor So both are parasites I read Director and script writer Bong Joon is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I m sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout Stairs are used as a motif voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times and most obviously there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park s home I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film Unfortunately I ve only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon It s a movie I want to watch again as it s as good as all the hype it s getting and what a journey it takes the audience on Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2 2 20 this film had grossed a Worldwide 163 3 million and was estimated to have cost 11 million to produce Of course I don t know any of the actors but they re all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year I still think it s odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I m certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to I m still so fond of Pedro Almod var s Pain Glory Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more There s so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite The story depicts Class divides Climate Catastrophes Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it s unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing Emma this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series Succession portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup The common thread that Parasite Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it s survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently dresses differently or anyone doesn t process a degree or wealth The poor family s ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular neurotic self obsessed rich Park family 2 comments from Parasite said by Ki taek and wife Chung sook stay in my mind Ki taek They are rich but still nice Chung sook Ki taek s wife They are nice because they are rich Chung sook Ki taek s wife If I had all this I would be kinder Ki taek Rich people are naive No resentments No creases on them Chung sook Ki taek s wife It all gets ironed out Money is an iron Those creases all get smoothed out by money Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites parasite Learn to pronounce noun 1 an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species its host and benefits

9 February 2020,"A good, relatable, and easy-to-access South Korean film, much like ""City of God"" was for Brazil.",Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles For a foreign film from Korea this is very accessible for all languages and audiences The actors are all expressive attractive and do a really good job acting The story has lots of universal contemporary components to it of pop culture For what it s worth the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea s City of God or something along those lines what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed well written and pretty gritty It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller part mystery without giving away spoilers I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating but unfortunately I just could not Sorry but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded and that s not to say that it wasn t fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the perfect range of storytelling The same issue also arose in the second back half of the movie some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10 However other than these two fairly big big enough to deduct two points flaws the script is practically perfect especially for a foreign film The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate immerse and challenge your mind while also keeping it entertaining They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender but unfortunately it just didn t quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility It could still happen but after viewing it with an open mind it looks like it s between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917 EDIT Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat,8.0,17.0,26.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5470163/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2020,If thrillers were poignant and funny,Only mild spoilers If you are looking for film that skillfully evokes a myriad of emotions from the audience you ve landed on it The Koreans have always been great at combining tones genre s Parasite Is a deftly handled film about social classes income disparity in particular the psychological impact of it and karma Song Kang Ho gives the standout performance as the father of a poor family who seems perfectly willing to break through any ethical walls to climb their way out of the slums The meat of the storyline comes when the fathers son infiltrates a wealthy household as an English tutor Does the event spark an opportunity for financial freedom or horror for the entire family This is both a visually and intelligently spectacular vision played out to near perfection There is some great symbolism throughout the film the highs of high society and the drowning abyss of the lower class The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking The film is also as funny as it is thrilling Hopefully American audiences can take all of the comedy in as some can literally be lost in translation and dryness The films not perfect I think the poor fathers emotional state could have been fortified a bit with a longer opening set up if for no other reason but to drive home the income disparity impact in Korea Americans may not fully understand the dangers of income disparity and the monopolization and manipulation of capitalism a good system but not necessarily a foolproof one but perhaps watching this will help That aspect of the ending is a slightly under developed or just perhaps under appreciated according to your demographic though the ending as a whole is still well fashioned and thought provoking I ve only seen a few of the Best Picture nominees Fordv8 19178 Once Upon a Time7 5 8 and Irishman7 but this is clearly my personal favorite It wont win IMO The Oscars gifted The Artist the foreign acknowledgement Best Picture a few years back so it may be awhile before we see another one Not that there haven t been many that should have one or at least been nominated On direction writing acting cinematography and pure enjoyment this film checks every box for me You might like this if you liked The Host 7 3 Iron 7 5 8 Nightcrawler 8 Sympathy for Mr Vengeance 8,9.0,11.0,16.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5461214/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2020,Perfection.,There s quite a bit of hype around this film already but going in I knew nothing about it I prefer this I rarely watch trailers for this very reason the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off The opening is delightful a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty but looking out for one another keeping positive and striving to help themselves It s touching heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot Good fortune finds it s way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for It s not until half an hour in that this new hope gives way a little Just a little crack almost undetectable What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit I m loathed to give too many details but suffice to say this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace it s nothing short of perfect I don t think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises desperation to survive The plot cast cinematography every damn facet flawless The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint does anything but I know it s only January but this surely has to be film of the year,10.0,31.0,55.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5406226/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2019,Parasite Review,Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it s not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick The film s message is a little on the nose but I don t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable Other than that this film is perfect There is not one bad performance in the movie Cho Yeo jeong Park So dam and Kang Ho Song are standouts from the film All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable Another aspect I loved was the cinematography The film s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design The film s story and themes make this film incredible The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems It s so incredibly tense You never know what is going to happen next and it s always surprising to see what eventually happens The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family Every time this occurs you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil His score adds so much more to the tension I know I m using the word tension a lot but that s what this film is A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale For me each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year Overall Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting great cinematography and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose,10.0,17.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5224654/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2019,What's more disgusting than actually being disgusting?,A family of incompetents who struggle to fold a pizza carton miraculously transform to ingenious con artists and infiltrate themselves into a rich home where they successfully pretend to deliver services they have no clue of The inhabitants of the house on the other hand are so incredibly stupid that they don t notice anything is wrong except for some wierd smell But the impostors refuse to be judged by their smell A bloodbath follows The end Standing ovation at Cannes Palme d Or 8 6 star rating on IMDB It s not just a bad story no it s actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor you cannot be expected to be good and if you are rich you are never good enough Naturally stereotypical characters follow and I couldn t make myself care about any of them The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it Otherwise all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end Now I know I m supposed to dislike the rich family but although I didn t like them either I don t see what s so wrong about them But the urge in society to favor the have nots no matter what their actual traits might be is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side while some even find them lovable And that I find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting Post Oscars Addition Technically Parasite is a great movie no really But the Oscars are not about that Nor it is why anybody watches movies People are interested in stories and these awards are all about politics Now the fact that this movie won most of the major Oscars is not that surprising Could be because it is a foreign movie could be because it is a marxist movie could be both as far as they are both valid arguments for leftist Hollywood What concerns me is that it looks like the whole world is praising it happening and I m sure that most fans don t care about the art of storytelling or directing I think they believe what Bong Joon ho ultimately shows us that nobody is deserving that we are all a bunch of idiots clashing in a stupid game for money But think about that someone did build the house where we all want to live in right And that must be someone with some knowledge skills and integrity otherwise the roof would have collapsed wouldn t it Does everybody really find it fair to deny all this,1.0,272.0,524.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5272463/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,A beautiful masterful foreign experience,My second time seeing a subtitled film in the theater after Raw 2016 and Parasite was so worth it It s about a family that lives in a little house that want better things Such a gloriously well filmed story in every aspect including the cinematography writing production design and captivating characters Well deserving of the awards nominations unfortunate people didn t like the movie,10.0,17.0,29.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5452565/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2019,A masterpiece that showcases an artist truly in control of his impeccable craft,Parasite is a movie where each element has the precise intended effect Bong can shift from hilarity to tension in an instant and showcase surface level plot elements and deeper class themes in one clever shot If you haven t seen Parasite yet I implore you to stop reading this and anything else about the movie and just go watch it The class divide between the two families is at the thematic heart of Parasite On a surface level everything the Kim family does is to earn money and live more comfortably while the Park family is as secure as could be and are oblivious to the situation and scheme of the Kims The twist adds to the complexity of the situation who s the parasite in the situation and how did the Kim family and housekeeper family get to their respective situations The ending is a devastating metaphor showing how the family is never really able to get out of the basement or buy that house It s also an edge of your seat thriller where you re so nervous that the family is going to get caught and then that the other family is going to escape Even the descent into violence at the end was controlled and each attack made sense The comedy is an underrated element as many scenes were very funny especially the self portrait artwork discussion which was hysterical The acting was all excellent and my two favorite performances were Jessica the sister who was so great in showcasing how she acted differently with her family and as a tutor and Mrs Park who portrayed the innocent honesty of the upper class wife perfectly The cinematography was great and reinforced the class themes especially in the juxtaposition of how the houses are shot with the cramped underground Kim house and the spacious green Park house or how as they go back home in the pouring rain that they keep going down down down So many things to absolutely love about this movie that I could go on about and nothing feels incomplete or not fully satisfying Parasite is a genuine masterpiece,10.0,23.0,39.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5247127/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,Unconventional and terrific,The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars including best picture I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run time but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward This is one to root for at the awards,9.0,18.0,29.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5460979/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2020,A unique and unpredictable feature film from one of the world's most exciting directors,Over the course of well regarded and unique films such as The Host the under appreciated Snowpiercer and the crazy Netflix distributed Okja Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho has established himself as one of the most noteworthy foreign directors of the last few decades Following on with his ability to mix and match genres with an ever present dark vein of humor seeping through his narratives veins Ho has hit it big with the surprise 2019 hit Parasite that now sits pretty in the IMDB Top 50 films of all time and stands head and shoulders above other foreign films from 2019 in regards to box office takings off a small scale budget of a couple of million dollars Incomparable to any other film you could think of Parasite is a very original beast that believe it or not combines drama comedy thriller and even moments of horror to ensure that its many twists and turns and social commentary co inhabit to create an entirely unpredictable experience that is best watched with as little pre understanding as possible Centered around the below the poverty line Kim family and their new employment in the household of the wealthy Park family Parasite allows Ho to weave together a loaded plot line that may seemingly be headed one way only to surprise us all as it veers further and further away from the expected Wonderfully played out by its core cast with highlights from Kang ho Song as father Ki taek and Hye jin Jang as mother Chung sook Parasite is the type of unnerving film that keeps you mentally on edge throughout as you re glued to the screen unable to turn away from a disaster in the making that must surely be headed towards a finale as wild as we would expect from a director like Ho As you watch the expertly directed edited and scored film one that has you laughing one minute and gasping for air the next you begin to appreciate that you re watching a director operating at the top of their game in what s still likely a career only around its halfway mark it s exciting to think of where Ho and his inventive mind can go in the future as he continues to give us films that seem to be cut entirely from their own cloths In an age where many films are nothing but pale imitations remakes or sequels its exciting to see efforts such as Parasite that give us something new fresh and exhilarating no doubt a reason why the word of mouth from cinema goers helped make Parasite a world wide smash hit and a genuine Best Picture contender at the upcoming Oscars Final Say While not flawless Parasite isn t far off it a darkly observed social commentary piece that is both heartbreaking and brilliantly humorous Bong Joon Ho has further established himself as one of the in form directors working today with what could well be his most important film yet 4 1 2 peaches out of 5,9.0,12.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5457457/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2019,A Masterpiece in Filmmaking,Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now Admittedly I haven t seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years I thought both of those films were great so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film Parasite After viewing not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019 but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you ll see all year Now some people may not like the turn it takes but here s why I think Parasite demands to be seen To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven t seen it so I ll stick to the basics here The Kim family lives in a basement living space All unemployed they find any way they can to make things work Ki woo the eldest sibling in the family is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con artists Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate this makes for some terrific tension The biggest praise I can give this film is that it s constantly in motion never wasting a moment to surprise you The set up for this movie has many clever aspects to it the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn t disappoint either Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to it becomes that much more interesting In other hands this story could ve have come off as a very generic film but there s truly something special about how well made Parasite is Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung pyo Hong each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say It s very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon This movie is brilliantly made in every way It s very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here so I won t bother trying because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much A great engaging story that surprises you from start to finish along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year I can t praise this film enough This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn t be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today,10.0,18.0,30.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5219988/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,Bong Joon-Ho is a genius!,Bong Joon Ho is a director that I ll definitely check out more I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone Parasite is nothing short of genius It s best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent Bong Joon Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety Bong Joon Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience The events that unfold don t come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing Aside from the story this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019 The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic The editing is fantastic as the film s pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever The aesthetics on the whole is top notch I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense Whilst delivering a fun film there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they re dumb 2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven t then go watch it immediately This is a film you should not miss,10.0,30.0,53.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5438127/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,"Long, with inconsistent characters and no moral compass",This had the makings of a fun farce As I watched the first hour or so I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy Implausible yes but amusing in an absurd way But then it started to go in weird places Some will call it social satire but to me it was just dark amoral and incoherent The protagonists the family of scammers are profoundly unsympathetic They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers Yet the film maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film Their story also makes no sense When we meet them they are solvenly helpless inept and unemployed In the opening scenes they are scolded for doing a simple job badly assembling pizza boxes But then suddenly they become master con artists taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family running everything with efficiency and aplomb This is just bad writing not a masterpiece While their employers were absurdly naive I didn t hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to Yes they are silly but they are also hardworking and accomplished they love their kids and in almost every way they are morally superior to the people preying upon them In the director s upside down world view their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them The fates of the employers and their original employees don t seem consistent with any sort of moral compass Without spoilers all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters previous behavior If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay unadorned with acting and cinematography it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess I would not recommend this so called masterpiece though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent,1.0,243.0,483.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5088123/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2019,Staggeringly original Korean social satire; one of the best of the decade,I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype It was the recipient of the Palm D Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews It s an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of the past ten years I won t say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible extremely wealthy family The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society but also in the world as a whole From there its main raison d tre expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations The results are shocking startling hilarious and utterly brilliant Such results certainly couldn t be achieved without a truly outstanding cast but lucky for us Bong Joon ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble Even more impressive is the film s character development While the film s primary characters are often not the most ethical they are surprisingly likable and multi dimensional especially when heightened by both emotion and tone You ll certainly remember them long after the credits roll But what s most unforgettable about Parasite is that the film manipulates in the best way possible its tone in so many unique and engaging ways that it is able to fully subvert the viewer s expectations of not only how the film will go but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions Combining laugh out loud witty comedy taut suspense and moments of pitch black darkness viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years While such tonal shifts may sound erratic they could not have been done more perfectly here so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film s almost impeccable tightness not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged One review cited in the film s trailer calls Parasite a magic trick I couldn t agree more both literally and figuratively A definite 10 10,10.0,17.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5201749/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2019,Noted Korean director's enjoyable grifter family farce devolves into unfunny bloodbath,Bong Joon Ho the celebrated Korean director actually won the Palme d Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Parasite His heroes at the outset are the Kim family semi lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki taek mom Choong sook son Ki woo and daughter Ki jeong They live in a dirty semi basement apartment in a lower middle class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in The inciting incident involves Ki woo s friend Min hyuk who informs his buddy that he s going abroad and he ll gladly give Ki woo his job as tutor to Da hye the daughter in the wealthy Park family whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on The fun begins when Ki yoo cons Mrs Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software Ki yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da hye and then convinces Mrs Park to hire his sister Ki jeong as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da song Before you know it Ki jeong who calls herself Jessica in the Park household plants her panties in the one of the family cars leading to the firing of Mr Park s driver who s now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend Jessica now introduces Uncle Kim to Mr Park as a new potential driver the uncle is of course Jessica s dad and he s immediately hired by the unsuspecting father The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks Housekeeper Moon kwang who has been a fixture there for ages will not be so easy to get rid of until it s discovered she s allergic to peaches So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew poor Moon kwang is felled by her allergies When Uncle Kim convinces Mrs Park that Moon kwang is suffering from tuberculosis Mrs Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it s revealed that her husband Geun sae on the lam from loan sharks has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there s a secret bunker the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles When Moon kwang discovers the new hired help are from the same family she records footage on her cell phone proving that they re simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs Park When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker Choon sook ends up pushing Moon kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head suffering a concussion As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted farce is permitting the outrage without the consequences The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point the story is supposed to be a farce But once Moon kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury Choon sook is no longer an amusing character A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before The Kims minus Choong sook manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home only to find their apartment flooded during a storm They re forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night Moon kwang then dies from the head injury The next day Mrs Park throws a birthday party for Da song and the three Kims return Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki yoo wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min hyuk goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun sae who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock The sight of the bleeding Ki yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings on will continue But it gets worse Geun sae goes berserk and stabs Ki jeong to death only to be stabbed and killed by Choong sook with a meat cleaver Mr Park desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure gets a whiff of the dying Geun sae whose smell repulses him it s been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle class people When Ki taek witnesses Park s reaction to the smell he goes berserk and stabs Park to death Finally we learn that Ki yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery He and his mom Choong sook end up getting probation while Ki taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him Ki yoo fantasizes of the day he ll become rich buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath the comic tone is lost The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose but without the playful tone established early on Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer

12 April 2020,Were the blueprints to the house never filed with the local planning commission?,See while the film is moderately entertaining it is flawed It certainly isn t a masterpiece in any regard The massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film Because the Kims are poor we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy The Parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy The driver is underdeveloped The housekeeper we feel bad for at first But she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else So the Kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work All the energy and ambition they put into their scheme they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service But their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end Are the Park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving No Is the house any cleaner The chauffeuring all that life transforming Naw Perhaps if the Kims presence in the Park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax And the wealth rock symbolism Got it If they were so smart they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment So yay never hold your metaphor as the writing rule goes And the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient For the Kims it s one dead two on probation and one scot free after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class That is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind Yeah yeah the dad gets trapped under the house How was this proper retribution He was never the mastermind his rotten kids were And mainly it was the son who is the agent of everything Without his friend without him receiving the stone without his foot in the Parks door there is no movie The daughter gets what she deserved But he gets lesson learned maybe And Mrs Kim is just along for the ride A big fat no to that I also found it hard to believe that the source of those flickering stairwell lights would not have been investigated by the fastidiously rich residents with their impeccably stocked wine fridge especially with Neurotic Helicopter Mom no 1 always home I already was well aware of the rich stay rich and poor stay poor cycle that was supposed to be the revelatory theme of this movie so it was not nearly as impactful And with the characterization and outcome flaws the film was okay but not nearly as evocative as it could have been I really wanted to see some arc movement to any of the characters even if ever so slight before the same ending But they all start out and stay one dimensional And it takes a bloodbath at a child s birthday party to get a couple of them to say aw shucks maybe this wasn t a great plan And then the final point of the movie per the director himself is to just accept your impoverished state because even years of honest work will not get your murderous father literally out from under the rich that you caused to begin with by seeking to be like them The whole notion of why bother makes no sense or point thematically in art,6.0,9.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5634321/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2019,Crime & Class,An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder Parasite is the best Korean film I ve seen for quite awhile though it s not without its flaws Even allowing for poor translation a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow several plot threads are introduced that don t go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained and too many elements the morse code for instance stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell rather than making any sense within that story But for all that Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema a twisted amoral mischevious inventiveness interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out of nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration in this instance at a kick down some stairs I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all and it s a doozy taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I d been expecting Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look,8.0,21.0,36.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5293690/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2020,'Parasite' is generous in giving you the cerebral food,Parasite is a deep complex layered multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven ts the haven ts are pitted against each other It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax Director Bong Joon Ho of Memories of Murder and The Host fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human s imperialistic pleasures As a result what starts in a mild satirical tone climaxes in a disturbing manner so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle This is no easy movie let me remind you But if you can finish the journey it can stay with you forever for the ample food for thought it offers Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre,9.0,11.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5470227/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,"Parasite, a spoiler filled discussion",Parasite Hollywood Theater 11 11 19 I ve seen Parasite three times in five days I think something may be wrong with me It s just so good even after repeat viewings the high tension scenes still hold so many thrills Bong Joon ho has made a perfect film I ve seen it so many times I ve memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles this made the movie even more enjoyable I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie pretty much conversing with myself here but feel free to read Oh and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven t seen the movie Yeo jeong Jo the performer who plays Mrs Park is such a gem Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch Her face is so expressive and bright there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra rich Park family My favorite character is still Mr Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang ho Song The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he s said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work For example Song may have had an over the top take but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors It s seamless to us but to Yang that s a lot of pressure Personally this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on good to know larger productions do this too It s fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song s Mr Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat He s the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what s going on around him is captivating During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film They really clicked and made sense to me this time around The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film The title Parasite doesn t take a genius to decode The poverty stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks The Kims are driving them around tutoring their children cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr Park s salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family Which is insane to think about that distribution of wealth is ridiculous There is a line from Mrs Kim she says Mrs Park is nice because she is rich and how if she were rich she would be nice too She also likens money to an iron smoothing out the creases Which is an apt analogy sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds We can say that money doesn t buy happiness but money does buy us breathing room it sands the sharp edge of reality down When you re broke and down and out everything seems like a threat It seems like one strong wind or in the case of Parasite one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways A beautiful heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live only to completely flood and destroy the semi basement where the Kim s live All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums consuming the entire Kim apartment The next morning in the car Mrs Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is she also takes notice of her driver Mr Kim s unpleasant smell Unbeknownst to her 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions all of which fit in a single box The most striking shot in the film is Mr Kim s daughter calmly smoking a cigarette perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth Cut back to the luxury Mercedes Mrs Park rides in pinching her nose and rolling down a window only for Mr Kim to almost lose it His face deftly registers exhaustion anger jealousy and pain the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are Mrs Park isn t a villain her wealth just acts as a warm protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper As the ending events of the film lead to Ki taek Mr Kim going into hiding while his son Ki woo and wife have both now caught legal reps Ki woo writes a letter his father will never receive He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education no trained skills and a criminal record have What shot will this kid get The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki woo s future I however was not as optimistic Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don t know what the future may have in store for the Kim family It s a self contained grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two hour segment and a world I will continue to revisit many more times,10.0,28.0,44.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5252759/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,A masterful emotional rollercoaster,Bong Joon Ho is an outstanding director and this might be his best work yet Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade hell I d go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it It s funny it s heartbreaking it s intense It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused which is something that many films fail to do The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic with no good guys or bad guys They re people They feel like real and believable characters which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year It s well shot as to be expected and the social commentary is fantastic This is the first movie I ve seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect I loved every single bit of it,10.0,23.0,38.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5412346/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,Great and different,A great film that really has a bit of everything in it It starts off funny as they infiltrate the household before turning into a thoughtful look at the gap between the richest and poorest in society and ultimately ends up as a bloodbath and rather sad The social commentary is topical the plot has some good surprises along the way and the arty style and use of music makes it a very interesting film to watch,8.0,12.0,19.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5435244/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2020,Smells Like Poor Spirit...,For reviewers universally acclaimed and awards sweeping movies call for immediate viewings and reactions whether along the enthusiastic stream or the other way the eagerness to express a dislike being even greater With Boon Jong Ho s Parasite I wanted to write a review as soon as I finished it But I was puzzled by that bloody climax The last South Korean masterpiece I saw was Old Boy and if I was riveted by the story the violence disturbed me no matter how relevant to the plot it was Now I didn t expect that film that started like a fun comedy of errors leaning toward screwball to generate such a hyperbolic outburst of violence It wasn t even black comedy but straight out drama I wasn t sure I liked it but I wasn t sure I hated it either I guess I had to sleep on it and figure out what Boon Jong Ho was telling us So here s my personal take and apologies if I don t mention the actors names with the exception of the father played by Song Kang Ho First of all this is not a spoiler free review which allows me to get right to the point Having digested the film now I realized that Boon Jong Ho didn t make a comedy at all which makes senses I don t think the film would have won the Golden Palm or the Best Picture or all these awards if it was a cute comedy of a family of con artists Of course the film Is encrusted with many humorous bits but so was Jordan Peele s Get Out a film less celebrated for its humor than its sharp blow against white liberals Retrospectively I find it obvious that the director and screenwriter was preparing us to a fatal clash between the classes but I didn t expect it the catalyst and film s leitmotif to be something as trivial as smell You read me There are three key scenes in my opinion that build up to the final rage that will lead the father to kill his boss despite the total absence of enmity between them 1 They have the same smell we ve come to the comical momentum where every member of the poor family got a job in the rich property They re all fitting in the family appreciated for their work and yet it s the little kid who smells something fishy in the way that they all smell the same Bong Joon Ho doesn t treat it as the hint that there s something fishy about them which a lesser director would do but that they live in the same ramshackle house with all the street and fried onions stink sticking to their clothes They smell because they smell like poor people The smell symbolically blows their cover 2 The hidden under the table scene what could have been used as a slapstick moment gives more depth to two key characters the fathers Laying on the sofa snuggling with his wife and watching his son outside in the teepee the rich father compliments his driver s work but laments about his terrible smell Notice that the comment is paralleled with another one about him knowing how to stay in his place Also notice the father s reaction he realizes that he s not just a man or a valuable employee he s got the smell in the package of appreciation Notice that the comment is said in secrecy during an intimate moment because in real life we never tell anyone about his smell only a child can be that careless But the father s comment resonated like an indisputable verdict one that reduced the father and automatically his family to their poor and stinky background like the untouchables in India Speaking of India the scene is followed by a huge flood in the lowers streets that feature the third key scene 3 One last cigarette while everyone is trying to save whatever valuable hasn t been taken by the waters the daughter rushes to the toilet where huge sewage cascades are propelled from the bowl spilling all over her body Without minding the foulness she just sits down and savors one last cigarette We realize how familiar to the low depths these people are that smelling anything is barely an issue They don t like it they just don t have the luxury of caring but from the rich ones perspectives people who don t mind the stink stink physically and then symbolically So no matter how friendly the relationships are they clash each other on that iron curtain made of streets sewage gasoil or cooking fragrances and bourgeois hypocrisy Which all naturally leads up to that moment where having just seen his daughter stabbed to death the father must give the car keys to his boss to take his boy to emergency The keys lay under a dead man s body and the rich father is repulsed by his smell one time too many The poor father who should be angry toward that man who took his daughter s life directs instead his anger toward his boss tracing an ironic line of solidarity with the killer because he knew the hardship he went through inthat bunker and the respect he showed to the house master only to be reduced to a smell him too If there s one movie that shows in powerful symbolism the battle of classes it s Parasite and the mood whiplash at the final act was like the detonation of a talent Boon Jong Ho proves that Asian cinema is one to rely on an Art that tells inventive stories and make them insightful and relevant and entertaining It also reminded me of my criticism of former Asian Golden Palm winner The Eel where I wished the film left the bloody scene as a climactic flashback Blood is a big narrative expense and should be left to the right moment to implode its meaningful or cathartic power I was puzzled first but once I got that leitmotif I could see the genius,10.0,8.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5541567/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,Fantastic !,This film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park s is shown in such a wonderful realistic manner This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend in their own original way of course My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts some scenes last longer than they should This could be a cultural difference in film making as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well Still it s not enough for me to completely give up on it It s a proper thriller American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade but failed with the exception of Get Out You laugh you re sent to the edge of your seat you get angry and finally you feel sad You know a movie is great when it s able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you ve watched it I m glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve I ve watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers Congratulations to everyone involved with this film you all did an amazing job and I m happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level Highly recommend this film and if you re avoiding it due to subtitles or the non sensible bad reviews you re sorely missing out,9.0,18.0,29.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5441405/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2019,"Parasite is no misnomer. It fully lives up to its title, as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts",Parasite Hollywood Theater 11 09 19 Disclaimer this review is in two parts Part One will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers Part Two will delve deeper into the film itself so read part 2 only if you re cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film With that out of the way Part One Parasite is no misnomer It fully lives up to its title as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts Parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities I can t go a few minutes without remembering of some image joke line or scene from the film My self diagnosis is apt and I fear I may be terminal I think the best way to go into this film is to go how I went totally blind I ve been looking forward to Parasite well before it took the Palme D Or at Canne this year Bong Joon ho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece A devilishly wild pitch black comedy very much domesticated and between two families I ll leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story Just know this film is in Korean so it is subtitled It loses nothing in translation but I really wish I knew how to speak Korean so I could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue The story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls Parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper like quicksand before too long you re in too deep The editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by It feels modern sleek and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad It s worth traveling to see with Joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that Parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities My podunk friends I apologize you ll have to wait for a digital or physical release likely around the end of the year Lucky for you Terminator Dark Fate and John Cena s new firehouse dog movie Playing with Fire will keep you company while you wait Part Two Where we actually talk about stuff here be potential spoilers ye ave been warnd sorry I am still processing The Lighthouse Parasite is astonishing on an emotional level It s a spiderweb of high tension thrills hidden identities and masterfully curated small details We meet the Kim family Dirt poor living in the basement level of a towering overcrowded building Their lives are a struggle phones turned off internet turned off it s an eye opening depiction of poverty in 2019 The entire family mother father and two twentysomething kids is out of legitimate work to help make some semblance of ends meet the entire family folds frozen pizza boxes for a young entrepreneur When a fortuitous opportunity arises for Ki Woo their son to tutor the daughter of the ultra rich affluent Park family he finds a way to get each member of his family working for the Parks It starts slowly as his sister Ki Jung acts an art therapist to young Da Song his father becomes Mr Parks driver and his mother takes the place of the previous housekeeper Typing that all out is simple enough but none of these people are what they say they are And the theatrical scams put in place to get the Kim family into the house are increasingly risky and hilarious Ki Woo played by Woo sik Choi failed his college entry exam 4 times his sister Ki Jung played by So dam Park is a true con artist she literally Googled art therapy and ad libbed everything else his mom Chung Sook played by an awesome Hyae Din Chang a physically intimidating champion shot putter is absolutely not a high end housekeeper but most fraudulent of them all is dad Ki taek played by regular Bong Joon ho collaborator Song Kang Ho I love this man I love this actor I love this character He s totally pathetic physically weak he seemingly has no real skills What is evident about his character is he truly loves his family Seeing his face light up and beam with pride when his kids commit these scams is actually heartfelt and touching I quickly fell in love with these characters as if they were my own family You might get the misconception that the Park family might be rich snobby rude people but they really aren t That s something I respect about Parasite there aren t any clear cut villains or heroes It s not that kind of story It s so grounded in reality Director and writer Bong Joon ho apparently started getting this idea when he was an actual college tutor in a luxurious house in which he didn t belong He started thinking about how funny it would be to have his friends working in this house too What really grips me with Parasite is how the movie utilizes senses It s visually stunning the architecture of the Park mansion contrasted with the shabby half basement the Kims live in the way light darkness and color is used but maybe the most impressive is how much smell comes into play You can t smell movies but somehow Parasite has smells Smell becomes a large part of the film It s hard to explain but if you ve seen Parasite you ll get what I am talking about Bong Joon ho has created something truly mesmerizing and thrilling I do not have a single critique of the film It s absolutely flawless and leaves a taste in your mouth long after viewing I was absolutely convinced Quentin Tarantino s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was the best film of the year but Parasite may have stolen my vote or maybe that s exactly what the little bug in my brain wants me to say See it as soon as possible,10.0,30.0,48.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5251162/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,Whose the parasite and whose the cow?!,What an amazing film Clearly an essay on the class divide Writing lovable but nasty people is tough but perfectly executed here They quite clearly cross the line and when I mean they I mean bother the working class and the upper class You could easily argue that parasite refers to one family trying to suck another family dry Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class and expecting them to be grateful about it too There is also something about the American Indian theme a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity Nature is dog eat dog Or is it a homage to an idyllic past where Native American culture was relatively classless Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles,9.0,237.0,408.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5065284/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2020,Parasite is an excellent showcase of fantastic writing,Parasite is Bong Joon Ho at his best I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed I couldn t have been more wrong Parasite is fantastic it nails a lot of technical aspects such as Cinematography editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next It covers comedy drama horror thriller and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems The way it does all of this is so subtle it doesn t go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes it shows us which I think is a lot more powerful It doesn t villanize any one class both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic The acting is also really strong I can t put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort On the negative end however some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film Specifically the birthday party sequence I just didn t agree that this would be something the character would do I still found the actions performed to be entertaining I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well Overall Parasite is a very well directed written and acted film which is enhanced even further by its excellent cinematography production design and editing With great performances from an excellent ensemble Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise,10.0,25.0,40.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456790/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2020,Not Oscar worthy. Not even close,With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me There s a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I m accustomed to through American film I m very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this I give it 5 10,5.0,30.0,53.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5558988/?ref_=tt_urv

You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.",It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers until now Bong Joon ho s English film debut 2013 s SNOWPIERCER struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017 s OKJA was cartoonish and ham fisted It didn t help that he d relegated two of my favorite actors Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal to cringe inducing career low sideshow performers Besides that I just couldn t vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family friendly cuteness ultra violence and quirky humor It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn With that said let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I ve seen this year However there s the other genetically engineered super pig in the room PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year s Palme D or winner SHOPLIFTERS Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society running cons and scams to get by in a callous world They are held together by their honest love for one another and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place But the main way that Joon ho one up s his award winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character a humor that is immediately physically translatable despite the language barrier It works here so well precisely because it s reigned in and understated throughout the film making the more manic parts hit harder such as when Park So Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon ho s science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich privileged and naive family Beside the obvious haves vs have nots one would expect from this scenario there s clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other s throats for short term gain Believe the hype PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far It s tense hilarious and poignant and I m forced to genuinely re evaluate this director s output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time,10.0,10.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456735/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2020,Masterwork,It is demonstrably an excellent film within the first 15 minutes and it gets better It has a very good script one which is honed with good characterization and motive together with fine structural exposition No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill In terms of execution the directing and other technical components all coalesce brilliantly It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake The story has many layers which are relevant to this time chiefly inequality but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion The ending is somewhat classical a purge clarifies the entire drama and it is effective in its own terms but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error Signalling wokeness is pointless with this film It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come That durability is honor indeed,9.0,16.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5473227/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2020,Overwhelming as hell,Movie starts off with a very intimate portrayal of the poverty and the vigor of the first family Mastery is very evident The rich family is portrayed next with just as much intimacy and depth The story starts unfolding the deviousness is a bit disturbing when it begins Intimate portrayal is about showing everything not just the stuff that gets the audience to like the protagonists Bong Joon Ho is ruthless in his script and making The excesses of the rich is contrasted sharply with the abysses of the poor There is so much to this movie that the various departments of the movie like cinematography music etc don t make it to the plane of consideration on the review table Shocking movie Must watch Amazing content amazing execution,10.0,22.0,38.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5440325/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2019,Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face.,After winning the Palme d Or in Cannes the French Oscars let s say Sydney Film Festival was quick to reel in that line and get Parasite to screen at multiple sold out venues around the city At the end of the festival the film got awarded the biggest price Best Film and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas Ki woo Choi Woo sick is a young man with not much to look forward to He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki taek Song Kang ho snappy mother Chung sook Hyae Jin Chang and his clever sister Ki jung Park So dam Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults They use free wi fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company until Ki woo s friend offers him to take over a student to tutor Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory Ki woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you ve ever seen Here he becomes the tutor to Da hye Ziso Jung daughter of wealthy CEO Mr Park Lee Sun kyun and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon kyo Jo Yeo jeong Everything seems to go just as planned until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control Scriptwriters Bong Joon ho who also directed and Han Jin won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well written film you ll see this year Every line gets delivered so smoothly as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story with Jung Jae il s classical score masterfully playing in the background The cinematography by Hong Kyung pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way to make it even clearer that they don t belong in the same world Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals but being nice doesn t take that much effort The film focuses on poverty desperation and what we are willing to do to take what should be ours Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face Bong Okja always loves to blur the lines of genre and he makes sure he hits every step on the staircase to succeed in his efforts Parasite is a mite that doesn t discriminate and will get under every moviegoer s skin no matter what background you come from The power of this story is found in the way comedy and drama rub each other in just the right way to spark a bit of thriller that flips over into pure horror when despair and hate meet each other This is one infestation you can t get rid off,10.0,49.0,95.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4968322/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2020,Just saw it for the second time.,PARASITE impressed me enough that I wanted to see it again Having done so I ve increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10 What I thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that I had missed in my initial viewing And with the element of surprise gone I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives I especially liked that no one here is 100 blameless or 100 evil That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life I only wish it were more common in movies This time I also paid much closer attention to the film s abundant symbolism Admittedly though I still couldn t figure out the significance of the Scholar s Rock But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film If not the for THE IRISHMAN I would root for PARASITE as this year s Best Picture winner Still it s a shoo in for Best Foreign Language Film,10.0,10.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456166/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,Just OK for me,After a first screening in a theatre I couldn t understand the hype around PARASITE So I watched it a second time at home and once again wasn t impressed at all I suppose it s just not my kind of flick and as I write this review a few months later I realize that I don t remember much of it even after seeing it twice I have read all the praising comments with a 10 10 note but couldn t find any of the qualities described as if people commented another movie,4.0,83.0,153.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5606211/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2019,Polished and Masterful,The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet When a friend of the son Ki Woo s who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family has to leave his position he recommends Ki Woo for the job Now having an in with the wealthy family the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well to do having what usually gets termed as first world problems while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood It doesn t shy away or try to be subtle about it but interestingly enough we don t feel beaten over the head with it either which is a major change from the ham fisted approach taken by most filmmakers Couching this in a comedy is a good approach as well as the audience s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas However I do say it s MOSTLY a comedy The third act takes a dark dark turn and the contrast not to mention general disdain and even indifference between the classes becomes much more severe This gets into some hard territory and characters that we ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves At the same time it doesn t feel unexpected almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it but aren t surprised by it when it does show up This is some masterful characterization Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor It s a smart film yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don t spoon feed you everything which is a refreshing change from the usual head beating most filmmakers go for At the same time they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don t have to understand each and every one That understanding merely enriches the experience but isn t essential to it This film has gotten some recognition and deservedly so It is rich intelligent and polished to a degree that we sadly don t see as often as we should nowadays showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft This is easily one of the best films I ve seen in 2019 Highly recommended,10.0,18.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5198162/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2020,"Ok film, but that's all. Overrated for sure.",The film is ok but that s as far as I go It s worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me It s not a masterpiece it s not film of the decade it s not even film of the year I don t understand how people can give it 10 10 is a perfect score 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect 719 out of 1 373 found this helpful,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5389992/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,The film of the year,The less you know about this movie heading in the better Parasite is a wonderfully original film from South Korea that manages to mix several genres together perfectly This tale about class is filled with poignant metaphors and social commentary Bong Joon Ho s vision and mesmerizing control over his craft make for an unforgettable experience This isn t a simple rich vs poor story where there are clear protagonists or antagonists and therein lies the beauty of Parasite It s just murky enough to provide some true thought provoking imagery and storytelling Don t let the one inch barrier of subtitles prevent you from seeing this modern masterpiece,10.0,10.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5462200/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2020,"Exceptional piece on class, culture, and family.",Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier but great film making and writing can instead turn that into a bridge and such is one of Parasite s strengths I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn t understand that culture or anything along those lines and that s why I highly recommend this movie to anyone Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general Visuals never dissapoint The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while There isn t much else to disect Just go watch it,9.0,21.0,34.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5413344/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,A flawless masterpiece.,Bong Joon ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase His latest film Parasite gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make All unemployed Ki taek Song Kang ho and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon ho his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn t see coming at all It s a brilliantly written film the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking There s a real intricacy to the screenplay co written by Bong and Han Jin won taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard hitting It isn t just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park s family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze like features almost serving as a character itself Hong Kyung pyo s sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin mo s score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess Coming to the performances Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season It s very much an ensemble piece each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand outs for me were Song Kang ho Park So dam and Cho Yeo jeong Parasite is Bong Joon ho s magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to I haven t been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it s going to get better with each viewing,10.0,10.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5459055/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2020,BEST MOVIE OF 2019!!,This movie is a masterpiece It is well casted and acted the cinematography was very well done The themes are thought provoking But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love effort and dedication went into this This movie has every genre in it yet it doesn t feel too cramped It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again It is such a fine experience watching this movie and everything is perfect about it 10 10,10.0,15.0,21.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5388846/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,Not that good,The Kims are a struggling lower class family One day the son gets an opportunity from a friend He also gets some good luck rock from him that will lay a role later in the film He can work as an English tutor for a rich family His sister forges a bunch of documents for him so he appears US educated He gets the job and starts a relationship with the his tutee The rich family lives in an amazing mansion built by some famous architect The wife is naive and lives in materialism The father a famous arrogant musician isn t home much but there he is worshiped They also have a young son who is trouble as all kids that age But the mother acts overwhelmed and thinks he s some kind of painter prodigy That gives the tutor a chance to get his sister hired as an art therapist for the troubled son So the sister impersonates an art therapist When she s meets the chauffeur she devises a way to get him fired and her dad hired instead Now they all figure out a way to get rid of the housekeeper They succeed When the Parks leave for a weekend the Kims celebrate in the mansion Then the former housekeeper shows up She reveals that there is a secret basement where she s been keeping her husband and begs mother Kim to take care of him in exchange for money Then the entire Kim family falls literally to the ground in front of the housekeeper and this the entire scam is revealed to her She takes some video The families fight over the video Then mother Park calls announcing that they will return home soon The Kims hide under the living room table The old housekeeper fell down the basement stairs and is seriously injured Her husband is bound back in his basement room Eventually the Kims escape as the Parks actually decide to sleep in the living room There s heavy rain and their humble basement home has been flooded Then they get a call from the Parks to help them for a birthday party for the son next day In the middle of the party the housekeeper s husband has freed himself and takes his revenge by smashing son Kim s head in with his good luck rock then attacks daughter Kim with a knife Father Park has repeatedly complained about the smell of the Kims That leads father Kim to attack Park after he s taken care of the housekeeper s husband Parasite is a horror comedy of sorts that shows the stark contrast between the poor working scheming family and the wealthy naive family whose problems are mostly blown up minor issues The characters are slightly cartoonish Things are somewhat enjoyable for 2 3rds of the movie You do end up rooting for the Kims The bizarre and unlikely appearance of the housekeeper and her husband change the tone of the movie and for the worse It also disrupts the movie too much and it doesn t recover From then on you know and expect something you happen you just don t know from which direction it will come In the end it s somewhat of a surprise but it doesn t amount to much really Sure economic class is an issue here but the story is covered in satire and humor no doubt to make a serious issue more palatable thus diluting whatever serious issue is being addressed It s not so much about class warfare but rather codependency As with any codependent relationship there are pet peeves and unaddressed grievances and resentments But there is no major message in the movie It could have don t more with the theme but it went for an easy solution one that doesn t solve anything,6.0,4.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6093570/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,"Fine, but Overrated.",This film doesn t allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects many ways to look at Is it thriller Comedy Drama Societal critique It s all of it and therefore none of it All in all I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated The style is there I grant it Cinematography is great Acting is awkward at some points but it s OK because of the partially comedy like nature of this film But then there is a problem with story telling It builds up nicely toward the middle where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below And then it makes an unexpected turn It s alright to make a surprise at the end I d even say it s good as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line A reveal must make sense once it is revealed This one didn t do the job convincingly for me We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party This film is just fine but no masterpiece in my opinion Some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting others are so obscure to the point of being pointless Great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum Unfortunately this one is leaning to the pointlessness,6.0,8.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5525744/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2021,Frustrating - tense at times but pointless,Parasite failed to grab my interest near the start Later on it picks up momentum and becomes quite engaging But this is less because I liked it and more because it manages to keep the plot moving in unexpected directions By the end it felt like the exercise was a waste of time or worse Worse because I worry that the filmmakers and many fans actually sympathise with the murderers just because they re apparently poor The premise falls apart when you think about it While it s somewhat entertaining at first seeing the main family lie a bit to get jobs supporting a rich family it really sinks in that there s no reason for them to be poor If the girl can fake university documents if the boy can tutor English if the father knows streets well and can drive confidently why on Earth can t they get proper jobs They can fake being qualified and well off so they can succeed in job interviews Little lies are one thing like faking a degree to get your foot in the door It s wrong but it s not that bad if we re meant to believe there s some kind of unfair system But after that we see more and more how immoral selfish and ungrateful the poor family is As Dickens might put it however poor they are in terms of wealth they re much poorer when it comes to decency and morals The girl lying about art therapy to manipulate the mother is appalling Are we meant to find that funny The way she talks about the rich family behind their backs is also very demeaning The main bad things the rich family does is 1 be rich so what and 2 complain about smell Nobody likes bad smells It s very reasonable that a part of progressing economically is taking care of personal hygiene It s a practical thing not a class thing What they do to the previous maid is also terrible Abusing her allergy And planting underwear to frame the driver The boy flirting with the girl he s meant to be tutoring They don t care about the lives they ruin as long as they get ahead We never once see them apply for jobs They use their intelligence to manipulate others and only progress by bringing others down I felt that the only happy ending would be one where they all get killed by some psycho killer or at least where they all get exposed The best section is in the middle where a single night spirals out of control and keeps you on the edge of your seat But even this was somewhat predictable and convenient for the writers Why are they partying at this house Who couldn t guess that an emergency would arise and the family would return early The maid coming back and having her husband locked in a cellar was a nice touch You don t know where the story is going from there But while this could make for a decent horror or thriller it doesn t gel with the rest of the movie which is more of a comedy drama The ending is frustrating I hated the poor family They ve now killed a woman on top of everything else I understand the cellar husband s desire for revenge But when the poor father kills the rich father There was no justification for that I liked the rich family They were nice people The father earned his money The mother cared about her children and was very open and kind The kids are normal kids It makes no sense The dad hides in the cellar Sure But you re telling me the police didn t look there The son s bloody body was right next to the cellar entrance They didn t search the room Look at blueprints for the house This guy comes out of nowhere probably presumed dead and goes on a rampage and they don t search the house more thoroughly And it seems like the filmmakers want us to empathise with the murderous father Sorry but he should rot in jail Along with his whole family who were complicit in all this The maid was pretty crazy too keeping her husband in a cellar Wasn t she earning enough Couldn t they pay off the debt even if it took years Why not be honest to the rich family Parasite is misguided and extremely overrated It s decent as a thriller horror at least for part of its running time It has good acting and directing There are a few funny moments But the message is deeply confused and immoral Poverty doesn t justify murder Or lying or destroying other people s jobs And if you have so many skills the girl seems very smart and good with computers why are you folding pizza boxes for a living They can t get proper jobs I call BS Even when they all get jobs by lying they don t move to a better apartment or improve their lifestyle They re only poor because the script says so not because it s remotely believable,5.0,7.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7352771/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2020,"An epic dark comedy. Really funny, really dark, 90% epic",Two nuclear families Mum Dad son daughter one filthy rich one filthy poor The first hour is about how the poor conniving Kims take advantage of the rich naive Parks in an old school way that s like one of those classic Ealing comedies like The Ladykillers You have to admire their cunning and luck and the satirisation of both families self seeking ways is hilarious After the first hour there are two of course it all starts to go wrong in the way that classic Ealing caper movies used to do except with severe though not over explicit violence And to an extent so does the movie which becomes a wild morbid farce complete with plum extract secret bunkers and barbeque bloodbaths You start to feel a little claustrophobic about the fact that it all happens within the swanky architect designed show house Apart that is from the sewage floods in the Kims squalid semi basement Parasite does have a solid story arc sharp social observation and mostly engaging characters though and the poignant ending brings it to a satisfying close It s quite old school but with an up to date take Imagine a later Steve Martin comedy with cutting social observation Did I mention the great acting I do wonder what happened when the son s friend who got him the tutoring gig in the first place got back from university Parasite II anybody joke,9.0,10.0,16.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5474831/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,Engaging but didn't match the hype,I won t go into the details of the plot which can be read elsewhere but simply give me impressions Well directed interesting story even if there were some clunky moments good acting good dialogue but way too long People are raving about PARASITE I m not one of them Masterpiece Hardly All the characters are supremely unlikable Perhaps that was intentional Ironically the rich family provoked more sympathy which I doubt WAS intentional I racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie Do you suppose bc it has a sub text I mean of course it has a sub text it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in Korea But that is plainly obvious It s not subtle Actually it s not even a sub text it IS the text But up against Hollywood cinema which rarely has ANY sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large PARASITE then is seen as sophisticated I didn t rate PARASITE very highly That s my loss I guess,6.0,18.0,30.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5494063/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2020,Great Film? Sure. Masterpiece? Not So Fast.,I do recommend this film but it definitely isn t the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like The Godfather Casablanca etc Why it received so many accolades is beyond me Probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films The acting was fine It s the story itself that left a lot to be desired I really had high hopes going into this one At least it didn t fall knee deep into the Korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet,7.0,20.0,37.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5383785/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2019,A devilishly delicious and twisted tale of class dynamics,After hearing so praise much about Bong Joon ho s latest film when it premiered at the Cannes film festival this year I went in not trying to know too much about it And it definitely lived up to the hype The Kim family struggles to get by as the father Ki taek Song Kang ho is unemployed and are forced to live in run down basement apartment in an already poor neighbourhood Conning and manipulation is second nature to the family as it is their only means to ensure they come close to living And once the opportunity comes in the form of the wealthy Park family needing a new English teacher for their teenage daughter the Kim s young adult son Ki woo Choi Woo shik takes the position to help his family get the money they need to escape their impoverished lifestyle Through a series of planned and highly calculated manipulation and trickery Ki woo gets all of his family members employed but at the expense of getting the Park s previous driver and housemaid fired to steal their paid positions Eventually the Kim s start living off the of the Parks s luxuries as if they entered the gates of heaven and awarded for their scheme To explain anything more would ruin the rest of the story The joy of it will be watching the twists unfold as the ideas and themes of Parasite take on a very unique and unexpected look at the class dynamic The film portrays neither families as the hero or villain of this story Similar to his English language sci fi thriller Snowpiercer Bong Joon ho dives deep into a surreal abstract world to explore the class dynamic between the wealthy and the poor The difference in this being neither side is worth rooting for nor against The Kim s take advantage of the Parks s naivety through their con as the most sure fire way to gain the benefits that are denied to them because of their class status And so it means they are ignorant to the moral consequences made by their scam until it is too late Meanwhile the Parks are so condition to their wealthy and privileged lifestyle they are oblivious to how unfair they treat the lower class while being paranoid and frightened by what doesn t meet their high expectations The cruel unexpected circumstances of the film s events prove no matter how well planned things go the poor will still in the end be feeding off the scraps of the rich that blindly ignore them Don t want to say anything much else about Parasite other then it is worth seeing without not much else about it Go see it,10.0,22.0,37.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5211294/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2019,First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.,First Hit I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd We are introduced to this South Korean family the Kim family as they are getting ready to eat The below ground level home has few street level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room the view outside the room and by their sparse cryptic and entertaining conversation However they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making The family consists of the father Ki taek played by Song Kang ho the mother Chung sook Jang Hye jin the son Ki woo Choi Woo shik and the daughter Ki woo Park So dam Ki woo s friend Min hyuk Park Seo joon comes by their home wanting to give Ki woo a present It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well being Because Min hyuk has to leave town for a while he tells Ki woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he s gone The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye hye Jung Ji so Dye hye s mother Park Yeon kyo Jo Yeo jeong Min hyuk says isn t too bright so he should easily pass the interview Ki woo expresses his worries that he ll be found out and may not be good enough but Min hyuk assures him that even though he s only got a high school education he ll dazzle the ditzy Mrs Park When asking Min hyuk why he s giving him this offer Min hyuk explains that he didn t want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl wants to date her when she s out of high school and knows that Ki woo is a true friend and wouldn t cross him in this way Arriving at the Park home he s let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon gwang Lee Jung eun Walking through the house he s amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is It s very modern and filled with all the luxuries he s never known and only dreamed about The interview with Mrs Park goes very well and he s hired to tutor Dye hye Noticing artwork around the home he asks about it The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house But he s also an artist and Mrs Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean Michael Basquiat Seeing an opportunity and because the family is wealthy and pays well he says he may know of a young woman who is an Art Therapist that could work with the boy to become a great artist Getting home he tells his family about this and his sister is ready to do her part and take on a new role as Art Teacher and Therapist I ll leave the rest to your imagination but let s just say the family all participates in this adventure But when the wealthy family takes a camping vacation and the old housekeeper comes to collect something she left behind the whole story starts to turn towards the macabre Parasite is a perfect name for the film and it is not easy to pin down all the aspects this film offers the viewer As it won the Cannes Palme d Or for best film and I can see why Song as the patriarch of the Kim family was exquisite in embodying this character Early in the film when he announces that they need to leave the windows open when the street fumigators come down the street I knew I was in for a ride It was perfect for setting up his mindset His silent looks while driving Mr Park around after he learns that the Park s think he and his family smell are spot on Jo was excellent as Mrs Park Her expressions when buying into the stories shared Ki woo and Ki jung were priceless She was the perfect foil and focal point of the Park family Choi was terrific as the Kim family young man His wistful story at the end of the film about finding his father was excellent Park was sublime as the Kim family daughter turned instant Art Therapist Her embodying the story she made up for herself was funny engaging and perfect Jang as mother to the Kim children made me laugh Her actions and responses during the opening scenes while the family was eating were scene stealing Lee Sun kyun was outstanding as Mr Park His command of the family as he waltzed in from work was evident and clearly identified who was in charge of the Park family Lee Jung eun as the housemaid for the Park family was engaging Her arriving back to collect what she left in the basement under the kitchen opened the door for the film to move to another level Bong Joon ho and Han Jin won wrote a wildly entertaining screenplay that had both funny and dark edges Joon ho was outstanding directing this film Some of the shots especially as the family tried to get back home during a major storm told much of the story The direct downward view of the slums in which they lived being flooded was telling Just as the shots of the luxurious home where they worked were just the opposite clean crisp and wonderfully shot with various angles Overall This is a contender for Best Foreign Film and maybe even Best

3 February 2020,Masterclass film,Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively But this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating If you like movies with social commentary this one is for you It is so good With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story to see the father of the family on the same scene trying to save everything he has from his flooded house while on the next scene he has to pretend that everything is fine So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them Finally I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong It s just the situations that makes us react the way we do,8.0,9.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456739/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,"In any successful black comedy, GREED is GOOD.",My rating A plus Just like what others have already stated in this comment section BEST WATCHED WHEN ONE DOESN T HAVE MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM Starts with an unemployed Ki woo who was asked to replace his college student friend in being a rich girl s English tutor even though he hasn t got qualifications apart from having been a repeat taker of university entrance exams This one ends up becoming a thorough scrutiny of the gluttonous side of human nature which is always a welcome and an essential ingredient in any bitter satire that s in the same vein as one of those Coen Brothers films And this one needs to feed off the audience s unabashed derisive laughter for it to deemed a worthy yang to the yin of that J P Jeunet classic Le fabuleux destin d Am lie Poulain or even to a lesser extent C Nolan s Inception Whereas the wistful rom com and the meta sci fi have its darker elements in the narrative neatly tucked away in its recesses the Palme d Or recipient does the exact opposite Such dualism that occurs in the cinematic world is much needed which serves to cleanse each other s cinematic excesses And it took a long time for a film like this Korean one to come by and serve as a worthy film to counterbalance the sentimentalism which can only be considered to be a magnet very much ripe for any Cy Bugs to devour wantonly in such an orgiastic frenzy But the film itself can be considered as sharing the same kindredship and is way aligned more to the thematic and aesthetic sensibilities of Yorgos Lanthimos ones Dogtooth The Lobster or even the Favourite if not quite to be considered as it s ugly distant cocaine junkie cousin shares the same filmic DNA sure though fun at parties but can be a bit of a deadweight accomplice Whereas Boon J H s film is more rooted in emotional judgments that each of the characters made that has quite sensible outcomes Lanthimos looks like the logic that pervades throughout have just been delivered via a spaceship that endured light years distance flight Kudos to the brilliant actors and the technical crew that delivered polished work all had their share in driving the narrative the writer director put forth for it to become a resounding triumph Made me laugh so hard I feel the need to re watch it again soon Not to give much away of the story I will only mention one that s among my favorite scenes that of one character s delicious rant mimicking North Korean newscasts delivered with much hysterical gusto I can t help but fall out of my chair on that one It is such an impressive inspired work of an ensemble that might just beg for an American language remake because the immediacy of the issues explored might be considered to be a meaty enough for the Hollywood actors to consider sinking their teeth into that is if the richness of the allusions that are very particular to the Korean identity and consciousness does not work against that thought,0.0,19.0,32.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5150819/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2020,The Prince and the Pauper ........ I've seen this scenario play out a few times before,Mrs Shullivan and I finally decided to sit down and read English sub titles this 2020 Academy Award Best Picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough but to win Best Picture against a great film like Once Upon a Time In Hollywood I think director Quentin Tarantino was absolutely robbed I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive so why not send some awards to South Korea We heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about Parasite and I would agree that the first half was decent enough but the latter half I felt I was watching a cheap version of a Bruce Lee action film I really enjoyed the cinematography and the set designs were eloquent but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled sort of like when in the 1939 Wizard Of Oz the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her I cannot honestly say this was a memorable film certainly not Academy Award Best Picture worthy and I would not recommend this film as a must see such as the 2019 One Upon a Time In Hollywood is a must see at least three times I give Parasite a decent but no higher IMDB rating then 6 out of 10,6.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6275993/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2019,The masterpiece of cinema 2019 desperately needed,There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary all while telling an airtight and compelling story Luckily for us Parasite Gisaengchung checks all of these boxes in a year where we couldn t have needed it more badly Bong Joon ho s latest absolutely blows all else out of the water at least compared to the other 30 movies I ve seen in theaters this year and in a highly organic and original way The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon ho is well known for using for instance in 2013 s Snowpiercer yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way This is the film s greatest strength in my opinion that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components including an interesting and nuanced take on class structure originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another From minute to minute Parasite will have you laughing uproariously and then suddenly have you dead silent and on the edge of your seat The comedy is dark and laugh out loud while the suspense will make you want to lean in if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene so as to relieve the tension It should be no surprise that everything else also falls into place wonderfully from the poignant performances to the razor sharp editing to the stunning cinematography In a year with both high budget and indie takes on class struggle such as Joker and Us Parasite still manages to stand out in a class of its own,10.0,21.0,35.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5262370/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2019,A film that manages to interrogate the choices every class makes while delivering a roller coaster of emotions for the audience,I will just say this first If you are planning to watch this film stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms Now directed by Joon ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre Its really hard to describe this film I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice That aside Joon ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling So much so that at first viewing you won t notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents The name parasite is just one of them At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are Is it the rich the poor their expendable need for a better living or the house itself Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang ho Song Writing is however what makes this film so great You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything There is not a single loop hole Every character choices make sense everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it The social structure with the way we live our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently our priorities and what we value Joon Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened He has completely turned a genre on its head A film about social class has never been made like this before Still this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while,10.0,18.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5128137/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,"Hugely overhyped, a disappointment in the end",I have been watching and trying to watch Korean movies and TV in the past year and my biggest two issues with Korean style movie making are that they overdramatize the mundane and they make the police authorities hilariously incompetent Both of which no surprise showed up in this film They spend so much on the emotional part of film making and none on realism The ending any half decent detective would have pieced it all together including the cellar The invitation why would any sane house sitter invite a total stranger into the house Everything about this movie is frustrating it s like watching 90s hollywood action flick All emotions no realism,1.0,17.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6438587/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,Class Struggle and Deception The Visual Representation.,Directed by Bong Joon ho Parasite follows the members of a poor household Kim scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family Park by posing as unrelated highly qualified individuals This movie exceeded my expectations What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary This movie feels like it s moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows There isn t a dull moment to it you re either on edge or learning more about it s well defined characters Each is distinct and so well performed I recognized Korean Canadian actor Woo sik Choi from Train to Busan he s looking fine in this too btw XD as the brother Ki Woo I may be biased because I ve grown to really like seeing him but he was my favorite character in this film I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father Really well done applause to you sir I loved seeing the scheming involved in this with a name like Parasite I thought this was going to be sci fi in nature But it s not at all It s more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives The Kim family were some sneaky ba let me tell you and I loved it It s like a better version of Ocean s films sorry fans of that series but with less heisting and more actual manual labour But still a lot of deception showing class division without making the rich too villain like So seeing as the story screenplay was superb it s of course coupled with great camerawork visual representations and an on point soundtrack to back it up There s some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don t have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon fed information Which I appreciate a lot I m so glad this film had a U S release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles that would be tragic I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest This by far is one of the best films of 2019 It s thrilling funny tragic and very very intelligent Please watch it if you haven t I m definitely going to have to check out more from the director co writer because he s impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general this is exactly why You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only your language while watching films Don t be one of those people I m going to have to watch the movie a few more times to really pick up on everything Also final side note the poster for this film is genius You ll know what I mean once you ve watched it,9.0,17.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5429257/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2019,UNLIKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN,Parasite is such a fantastic movie that even its comparison with other amazing works can be dangerous Korean director Bong Joon ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism And it all flows smoothly The film begins as a custom comedy Kim Ki woo s family Choi Woo sik lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society that resides in a basement They re always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets The boy s life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim who knows why to keep her safe Changing his name to Kevin the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family and as expected the girl Park Da hye Jung Ziso soon falls in love with him But your dream is much more ambitious getting a job for your whole family in the house First he convinces the girl s mother Yeon kyo Jo Yeo jeong in great acting to hire an art psychologist named Jessica actually her sister Ki jung Park So dam for the hyperactive younger son Using tricks the Kim family s father and mother are soon admitted to the house And on a Parks trip they celebrate at their new residence After that apparent happy ending everything changes in the movie Former housekeeper Moon gwang Jeong eun Lee returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks What follows are comical scenes and amenities until the terrible birthday of little boy Da son Hyun jun Jung From there chaos destruction and despair And an ending Or would it be two,10.0,23.0,40.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5362441/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,Deserves every single award of it...,I already have a good experience of korean movies and this one has surely been one of my favourite though to be honest having a vague idea of what its plot is about when i decided to watch it i was not that certain of what i could expect since films dealing according to critics and reviews with allegories and social messages always face my instinctive mistrust Well these elements are there too but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light almost comedian style plot ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all however this one resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending is really irresistible and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie P S Yesterday global celebration of the Day of Greek language under the motto Do you know you speak Greek So here s the tip of the day Did you know that among plenty of others in your own whichever language the title of this movie too is actually a 100 greek word,9.0,24.0,41.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476180/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2019,mediocre and forgettable,Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie What do I mean with that Well I will get into that late but firstly it was directed by Bong Joon ho who is best known for his English language movies Snowpiercer and Okja Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple they at least try to have an atmosphere They also have a clear message which however show a very na ve perspective on reality Even his previous Korean language movies like mother and the host are very similar in that fashion Parasite however doesn t really show much of that regard Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen with the exception of the masterpieces Burning and April snow Parasite however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies But that s the only thing good about the movie however maybe besides the production value The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it It is lacking in many other departments however The characters for example are terribly written They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring because of its focus on the characters The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes which shows that the production value wasn t well spend in all places The acting is decent considering the director Nothing bad but also nothing extraordinary The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre that s why I said its pretty Korean It had a nice idea but doesn t do much with it and only uses it for shock value It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many kinda like the Korean movie Oldboy,5.0,46.0,82.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5293316/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,Good but nothing exceptional,It s not a bad movie and it has some great moments But it s way too over hyped like much award winning movies these days insert gif of disapproving old Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino You can tell it s a movie that wants to deliver a message the problem is it s not quite clear what the message is,7.0,7.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5552051/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2020,Amazing absolutely loved it.,Great movie great writing greating acting and great cinamotography The only reason I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the ending I feel like filmmakers should have had the guts to leave the ending messy with a bit of mystery After Mr Park gets stabbed they should have just ended it there that would have had much more of an emotional effect on moviegoers,9.0,32.0,54.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5399302/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2020,A little fantastical journey that reflects the harsh and unfortunate reality.,The dark satirical thriller directed by Bong Joon ho began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word metaphor for countless amount of time And as you d usually expect from a Bong film the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name Parasite suggests Though it depends on how you take it what you d like to call it because stairway remains as another option as well How That s the beauty of this two hour long flick Why Let s discuss And to begin with there s the plot that on paper didn t particularly make a lot of sense as it s expected from a satire in general But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty giving the film a base to build upon No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth Each and every actors in their respective roles probably have outdone themselves in that regard On a technical note the cinematography in particular deserves a lot of credits Hong Kyung pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea something which was extremely important for the film in itself while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable The entire set up of the film that provided the innocence and realistic touch deserves a lot of extolling At the end the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together Supervised by CJ Productions and of course Bong with a tight budget it d be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I ve been by their mind blowing piece of work But everything aside what packs the ultimate punch The theme of differences of classes and how it s showcased through the stairways Call it pessimistic as you may like or realistic for the sake of argument the harsh reality doesn t change That said do you stop dreaming No But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes which may be greed for many The dependency on lower classes prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely And the ending eventually solidified whatever pessimistic for some and realistic for many Bong wanted to claim or rather ask you With a lot of differences of opinions on its simplistic yet so complicated ending scene one thing remains certain you re bound to fall in love with this masterpiece that sure does have the potential to snatch the Best Picture award at the gala night of Academy Awards 2020,10.0,16.0,25.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5444635/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2020,We are all Hollywood parasites,As one other reviewer said all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie TEchnically it is very well crafted great cinematography great acting but personally I think overhyped In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor a little bit too stereotipically I might add is bound to get great reviews Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done justice even if only for two hours on a theater Hollywood wants to be that White Knight and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio this year it was the Korean actors I ll bet next year it will be another troup Like the rich family in the movie minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood useful and good while they serve their purpose stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don t No wonder 202 Oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind I don t think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it Beware though last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory,7.0,12.0,18.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5480775/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2020,Do not read reviews or the synopsis. Just watch it.,The best way to view this movie is like the movie Get Out If you do not know what it s about it s to your advantage Enter with a blank mind and watch it before everyone starts casually throwing the plot and ending around If you re still reading this though I can tell you that it definitely deserves the praise it s been getting Korean cinema has been overlooked for a while and Hollywood is finally catching on Korean cinema has so many great films with unique twists that Parasite gets lost in the sea of them but compared to all the other Oscar nominated movies this year it s a standour yes because it s a foreign film but also because it s not in your face and the same old period war biopic Hollywood loving Hollywood movie that seem to get nominated year after year It s more a subtle pensive edgy yet equally humorous and entertaining film that caters to both critics and audiences alike The cinematography direction and script are the crowning jewels of this film but apart from externals I think this movie deserves more than one view because a lot of themes has surfaced and requires a more in depth analysis The characters and their motivations can also be studied It s a movie you can watch with a bag of popcorn and or one that requires complete and undivided attention If you re still reading this then SPOILER ALERT for you before I write my next line I can t stop checking every nook and cranny of my house now If you know you know,8.0,18.0,29.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427054/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,Worthy oscar winner,I loved this it only came out in the UK this weekend and I needed to see it before the oscar winners were announced The use of colour space and sound is superb The actors are perfect and it s just wonderfully funny and thrilling at the same time I found it a little slow to get into but it was worth the effort the poor of society are so often treated as like cockroaches a different species parasitic work shy undeserving And as one of the characters points out if we were wealthy how much easier would it be for us to be kind and generous people The wealthy here are not evil simply oblivious,8.0,10.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476907/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2019,"Kim family vs Park family, and then...",At the beginning of this movie we watch the Kim family struggle to survive in our modern and advanced society Yes I am being sarcastic That s all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn t have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites Good point but I will get back to this at the end of my review The Kim family s struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad We often feel like laughing but then strangely enough we also feel like we shouldn t Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family They are acting as a tight unit One might think that s normal since people usually unite against a common enemy in this case poverty But it is also true that this is a family not just a group of poor people They care about each other Anyway coming back to the plot they will interact with the rich Park family and that s all I think I should tell you How they will do it what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak You will know immediately when that happens This moment obvious to me was nevertheless striking and masterfully done As my step daughter brought to my attention no one is the main character all the main characters all 10 of them are important and extremely well acted Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly and therefore avoids dead times The camera work although sometimes creative is most often straight to the point It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery In other words every shot counts This movie while telling us an interesting story is also a social statement And as I indicated at the beginning of this review I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society Sure it is nothing new but it brings to mind many questions The most important to me do we as a species who is supposed to be intelligent continue in the current direction and continue to make interesting stories or do we stop clean up our act and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own Note how the Kim family is actually pretty smart and resourceful And yet they are poor Yeah s it happens and more often than not just because of the way our society works or rather doesn t,10.0,30.0,53.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5246800/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,The best movie of the year!,I just watched the movie and found it simply wonderful It is a mix of moments that happen as fun joy tensions and sadness The climax scenes of the movie are breathtaking and all extremely well fitting you realized it was no trick of the script to make those scenes happen everything flowed very well I m amazed at the movie a lot of people need to see this work for yesterday NOTE The counterpoint of the rain scene is because of the rain the rich can t get to camp and because of the rain the poor are obliged to camp in the gym,10.0,18.0,28.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5202205/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,Harrowing story of the crimes that greed and envy lead to,The movie parasite was harrowing Greed and envy thats what it is about Lying cheating family traits inflicting these lies on a kind family who employs them First the son lies about his tutoring qualifications and he cheats his way into manipulating the underage daughter he is tutoring Through further subterfuge his sister father and mother all end up working for the family Unbeknownst to them the family of lying good for nothings have not only ruined the income prospects of former employees they go stir crazy and it leads to double murder and countless horrible outcomes not shown Were they punished enough for the horrible things they did to that kind family who employed them I believe the filmmaker tried to partly justify their actions based on the inequality of the social divide between one family to the next If enterprise and cunning got this family into employment why were these skills not used for employment from lawful means The story is skillfully told but it is still a horrible story There was little justice in the end so it does make you regret watching it,8.0,11.0,17.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5470082/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2019,Parasite teaches an important lesson,Parasite 2019 10 10 Such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class Parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday No matter the case desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play Parasite does away with telling a tale of class greed and the values or family Director Bong Joo ho who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting if you watch you ll understand that keeps Parasite from ever falling under Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing Although it is considered a crime comedy I found Parasite to be a scary type of film Think about it manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it no matter how witty and or smart the victim is The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you Getting to the ending which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility It s one of those endings that involve so much but that much just happens to work so well in the film s favor It s haunting it s daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark Verdict Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year There s nothing to not like about this and it ll sure stay with you after the first viewing,10.0,23.0,37.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5248995/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,It's fine. I just didn't think it was as great as everyone else seems to think.,I am going to be unpopular here because it s unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops Let s get a couple of things straight before the off I have no issue with the One inch barriers to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs I have no unlike Mr Trump political bias against sorry not bias prejudice in Trump s case South Korean cinema Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook Park s The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB Oldboy is a classic from Park too I also loved Ho s Okja and The Host although I thought his English speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful So this is not the problem and just because I m not raving about this doesn t mean I didn t enjoy it I did I just feel the praise that s being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation I read one review on IMDB by mysticfall that suggested anyone who didn t love this was a moron and clearly didn t understand it I had no issue with understanding it It s essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea s richest and poorest in one household with the poorest as servants and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste Except he does As the film progresses it s clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it s their smell that reeks of poverty and is therefore undesirable Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton s excellent Inside Number 9 episode A Quiet Night In in which two cat burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode The horror that we are promised is actually gore and is reserved for Act 3 It s very much in the school of Tarantino and of course Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film making so a certain circle is squared The performances are universally excellent but I feel that on occasion Ho strays into slightly heavy handed territory much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer It s not enough to spoil anything but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I ve read The cinematography is simply beautiful It s a fine movie but in my view 1917 was a more immersive cinematic experience and consequently deserved the Best Picture Academy Award Call me what you like but I m saying what I m seeing,7.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5506483/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,With No Plan Nothing Can Go Wrong,Parasite landed with a massive splash in 2019 Bong Joon ho s satirical black comedy is excruciatingly tense and a fantastic confection Its bracing cynicism makes it drop slightly short of being a clarion call to revolution and it has a few too many endings for me but the unpeeling of this particular onion is tremendously fun It s easy to see why it did as well as it did,7.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7496081/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,Trying to Be Intellectual But Not Succeeding,This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites the poor are scam artists lying for money and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids But it s a mess of a story not a masterpiece In the real world the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead but this movie doesn t have any depth the symbolism is amateurish the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming bumbling psychopaths and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless Sorry it s an ignorant view of the world It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one,1.0,183.0,348.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5486055/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2019,One of the best films ever,Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you The script reminds me of Billy Wilder It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that The directing is flawless Acting is compelling But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we ve come to create in the XXI century with no social mobility It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies It is one that will stand the test of time Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right American audiences should read subtitles for once This movie will make you laugh and cry The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle It s a must watch A masterpiece,10.0,29.0,50.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5202636/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2019,Half of a great movie,Overrated doesn t even begin to describe this film I m a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced and so it was with this film Sadly it does not deliver like his other works do Performances are all uniformly excellent particularly that of the poor family s father and the house maid of the rich family Inventive camera work a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn t wait to get out of the theater By the time it s hoping to be ending arrives I had already checked out An interesting failure with a lot on its mind but in the end what s really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn t truly made I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get I keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer paraphrasing a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different yeah becomes a big stinker,5.0,53.0,92.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5224091/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,WTF is this???,I was excited to see Parasite due to rave reviews and it winning best picture I was warned by a theater worker that the first half hour is slow but then it gets really good So I made it through the first half hour and kept waiting for the really good part only to find out that it was the exact same more tedium by a family that was not really likable The violence was not necessary either and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end and that seems to be a way to get more respect or something It was sad and horrible in my opinion I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie compared to 1917 Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood won best picture Honestly what is going on with those who vote that vote for this drivel It was okay don t get me wrong but that s all merely okay For the record I love movies with subtitles and have seen several amazing ones but this was not one of them,1.0,88.0,167.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5489526/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2020,A Quarantine Masterpiece.,Better late than never I say Parasite has shocked the film world in the best way possible Against all odds it defeated a crowded field for Best Picture at the Oscars A field that included heavy hitters like Scorsese and Tarantino Nobody should have ever counted Parasite out but the Oscars don t have a track record of awarding Best Picture to groundbreaking independent films let alone a groundbreaking independent film from South Korea It s win was a watershed moment for filmmakers everywhere It s a shot in the arm for original storytellers in a time that seems dominated by Disney related properties and remakes Garnering international acclaim people have hailed Parasite as the best film of 2019 and the decade itself Does it live up to the hype The answer is an enthusiastic yes Parasite is one of the best independent films I ve ever seen It s a textbook example of how to take a small idea and a modest script with limited locations and launch them all into the stratosphere Without giving too much away it centers around two families on opposite sides of the Korean social class The ultra rich elite class and the poor The poor family devises an elaborate scheme to work as servants for the rich family in the hopes that they can take a taste of aristocratic life and work their way up the ladder All is well until they discover something underneath the house A third class of servitude is revealed A class more destitute and subservient to the rich family than the poor family could ever dream of Reminiscent of The Twilight Zone Parasite serves as an allegory for income inequality and the ways in which the poorest classes of people are often exploited by the rich with no thanks in return The best horror films out there tell stories of larger meaning They need to in order to be properly scary Bong Joon Ho allows his agenda to take shape throughout but cleverly and gracefully avoids being heavy handed For instance there are no clear heroes and villains in his characters To Ho they are all victims of a larger societal struggle In terms of its visual scope Parasite is a masterclass in production design and framing Instantly the luxurious Park residence has become an iconic backdrop in film history It s spacious rooms and narrow hallways paint a chilling picture of the enormity of wealth The large screen door leading to the front yard is reminiscent of a large film screen almost designed to showcase the importance of the Park family household At 135 minutes Parasite tells it s story as fitfully as a best selling novel In the end you don t leave Parasite having missed the point of having watched it It s satisfying minute to minute That s what makes this a great film,10.0,2.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5762927/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2020,Maddeningly bad film,Should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing I really enjoyed Bong Joon ho s Memories of a Murder and Mother Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father pretentious and anxious mother the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set and finally the moody withdrawn awkward daughter The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next Most notably how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune See the movie and you ll see how ridiculous that is The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose Movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened,4.0,21.0,34.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5482024/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,Fantastically Flawless,One of the best movies i ve ever seen This movie is full of wonderful surprises The scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as it s overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in Mr Parks house Also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satirical laughed out loud I have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movie It also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the Park family although they are deceiving them The whole movie took me by surprise and I didn t see any of it coming it s really clever I laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so The director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off I also have to admit I was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed It s a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality meritocracy social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you don t have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie this movie is for everyone Satirical metaphorical genius paradoxical impulsive genuine watch this movie,10.0,10.0,15.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5458055/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,Speechless,I ve been hearing great things about this and after it won 4 Oscars including Best Picture I just had to see for myself even though I wasn t 100 sure what it was about After only 15 minutes of watching I fell in love with this movie And it got every award it deserved Parasite has so many genres in this movie but I would have to say this is darkly written in the most creative way possible It s funny dramatic and intense I can t even think of anything that I didn t like about this movie because I seriously enjoyed every minute of it 10 10,10.0,11.0,17.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476880/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,leaves me with just hollow emptiness,Everybody and his aunts seem to love this movie and I can t figure out why Yes it s technically well done but so what many movies are well done There is not on character of interest to me and nothing makes sense to me,1.0,76.0,163.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5429956/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,Falls apart in the second half,3 511 reviews most of them seem to adore this flawed film I know no one is going to read my five star review because it isn t a ten star review but this isn t a ten star film I just don t see a rich family instantly hiring four new employees without thoroughly checking them out first this would never happen anywhere in the world The first half was intriguing and I began to think if they are a family of skillful grifters then they wouldn t be living in a basement I began to wonder if these people were family members at all or just a random assortment of con men who got together and pulled off cons that would have been a neat twist but no it doesn t go in that direction Then I thought that the rich family would turn out to be parasites themselves which would have been intriguing but it doesn t go in that direction either For some strange reason there s a violent attack towards the end that doesn t fit in with anything else that happens in the story up to that point it s just random and there s no cognitive flow or context or continuity to any of it it s just a disconnected series of events The house is gorgeous and the acting is good but there s ultimately no point to the story,5.0,15.0,29.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8582787/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,Any Explanation Would Be a Spoiler: Watch It!,This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power greed insanity manipulation and false appearances It s a slow rise to disconcerting uncomfortable and then all of the sudden it is disturbing and gory and insane There is no way to see what s coming next I promise you that Now that s a real thriller Highly recommend The ending leaves questions unanswered but many opportunities to philosophize on humanity and class,10.0,27.0,46.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5362676/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,A masterpiece,Snowpiercer was very good Parasite is even better Bong Joon ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller which is horror film comedy and drama at the same time A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them But who are the real parasites The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity but it s precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford And it shouldn t fool us about the balance of economic power We don t see good or bad individuals in Parasite rather Bong Joon ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations Moreover Parasite is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie in which there isn t a single wrong picture,10.0,13.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5230108/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2020,Very interesting plot!,Great Awesome Very interesting plot I think it is one of the best thriller of 2019 I m not a fan of Korean films but this is great movie I hope it win one or few Oscars,8.0,22.0,34.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5408136/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2020,Absolute Brilliance,It isn t every day that you come across a movie like this a practically flawless one in my opinion actually I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive Don t worry this review won t have any spoilers whatsoever To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie Another standout would be Kang Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie The pacing was consistently on point where everything even the change in tone is seamless Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi basement house in the suburbs Furthermore another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie The plot of this movie is something I ve yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming At the end of the day this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind s strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn t in your face Plus by the end of the movie you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist just people People trying to live a happier life Thus making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie Director Bong Joon Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats,10.0,28.0,45.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5394716/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,An Epic Interesting Film,This is a film that has been in the news lately as it picked up 4 Oscars including Best Director Best Picture which is huge for a non english speaking film I have now had the chance to see the film and this is my review for the film The premise of the film sees a poor family look to gain an opportunity by gaining jobs in a higher class family and gain the advantages from that Main Character Now there are quite a few characters in this film but really Woo Sik Choi plays the son in the family and he does a great job in the film you can see he has pretty honest intentions at first but things start to unravel for him and he doesn t quite know what to do He is likeable but you aren t sure if you should root for him and that creates a multi layered character that keeps you interested throughout Supporting Characters Everybody gives a superb performance in the film I won t go through everybody s names as they are quite long but whether it is the poor family or the rich family everybody is believeable and real in the film These characters are as mentioned before multi layered and you just aren t exactly sure who exactly to root for The one actor I will mention is Kang Ho Song as the Father of the poor family he is truly brilliant in this film he probably goes through the most in this film and he is the most interesting person in this film and honestly he should have probably got nominated for the Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars but nonetheless he is great in this film Story The first 20 minutes of this film I wasn t exactly sure where this film was going but it is super fascinating watching the dynamics between the two families and seeing the different personalities and motivations which really blurs the line I don t want to go into the plot too much as I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it so it should be the same for you Also to put it on top the ending for this movie is so thought provoking and perfect for the film that has been going on Script The script even though in Korean is brilliant this film suprisingly has tons of humour in it I laughed quite a bit in this film which shows just how well the writing is to make these characters feel multi dimensional The drama also really works to make you truly care about what is going on and what is happening to the characters that you are watching Style First of all lets mention that obviously this film has subtitles this should not be something to worry about as it is fine and the film is so strong that it doesn t matter Okay this film has a bit of everything in a stylistic way it looks great and has bits of comedy thriller drama horror it is a perfect blend that keeps you on the edge of your seat and excited to see what comes next Overall Overall this is one of the best films I have seen in the last few years it just has a bit of everything to it and was well worthy of its Best Picture win at the Oscars If you are put off by foreign films and reading subtitles don t be as this is a truly special film that has to be seen to truly appreciate just how good it really is Rating 10 10,10.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7639695/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2020,A film worth rewatching.,I tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home but it s two hours since we keep on discussing it enough to rate it with 10 stars which happens very seldom I must admit I am no connoisseur of Korean films so I am not entitled to place it here or there nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top Is it a satire a comedy a thriller a social fresco a mystery It s all of them and then some It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours It was informative of Korean lifestyle It was entertaining It was gruesome It was comic It was satirical It was endearing It was never boring Not only the actors are great in it but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film both the favela style ones and the super rich ones Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully Not anymore although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically Parasite made me laugh made me cringe made me question life gave me food for thought What more should I expect from a film To watch it again clearly,10.0,9.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5469134/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2020,how sick/weird is this movie and still catch you in,The only thing i would change on it is the end why the hell all that had to happen the movie would be great with a different end Overall this is quit intresting to watch to understand the culture the limits between poverty and rich people there is more but i don t want to spoiler it so it worth to watch The movie ended in hurry somehow not showing the life of Kim Ki woo i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean chinese japanese culture movies recorded This movie is pure fiction but is not feeling like it couldn t become a real thingh because doesn t look that unrealistic to happen I note it for 9 because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 but maybe the director of the movie didn t had same vision as us tend to have he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don t end in just a happy end,9.0,22.0,35.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5400281/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2020,"Well, you got me",I know it s unfair to review a movie after watching only 20 minutes But I can t be the only one who won t watch a film if they can t buy the premise even if it s revealed later it wasn t what you thought it was That the members of the family could be SO sharp as to insert itself brilliantly into a rich household but couldn t figure out how to get out of a dump where it s desperate for free wi fi makes no sense One minute they can t fold a pizza box and the next minute they re the best English and art teachers on the planet None of the characters had any appeal and I didn t care what happened to any of them I know I know it tuns into this great revealing movie about class etc Maybe it s just as well I don t like looking at disturbing scenes which this film apparently has no shortage of,1.0,12.0,21.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5644782/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2020,Overrated,From the first scene this movie reminded me of Almodovar but without the required intelligent effort to make it a credible story Metaphorical Yes and no that s where they lost me The pace seems fast but then I found myself wanting to fast forward a number of times since the overly simplistic plot turn into absurd rather too quickly If this is the best movie of the year then Hollywood has a very serious problem,5.0,34.0,58.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5559974/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,"Strange, funny and artistic",It s easy to see why Parasite got so many Oscars It s in that classic Oscar winning style of being quite artsy and something totally un blockbuster like These are always going to be movies that are enjoyable and have a great story to tell rather than just being about a feast of action for the eyes Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides The flood was a great example for one family a bit of fun for another you lose everything you own In the end we cannot assume that we would not behave in similar ways when we have had everything taken away from us and we are losing our lives Quirky but interesting,8.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6374911/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2020,Stuck at the bottom,So much to unpack incredibly thoughtful and clean cinematography Well written script Masterful suspense so many metaphors the music in the suspenseful scenes was so good that you barely noticed it until it was over I was captivated through the whole movie I thought that there might be some symbolism of North Korea South Korea as well as social class but I haven t seen anyone else point that out so it could be me grasping at straws For the main family the film ends in essentially the same situation as it began minus the father and daughter Ki Woo and Chung Sook are presumably still struggling at the bottom of the stairs again Everything that happened in the film did nothing but take half of the family away Thus describes Bong Joon Ho s ruthless realism the poor get poorer and life continues on with no plan to fix anything Not that that matters it wouldn t work anyway,10.0,22.0,36.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5402420/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,Parasite: A Connection That Leeches On To Perhaps The Audience,Parasite was one of the contenders for Best Picture that I was intrigued by I had only heard good things going in but nothing of the actual plot points I came out of this film needing to sit down and process the events that just occurred Nothing had prepared me for what I just endured Parasite is truly a different film with semi realistic events Think of it as the very absentminded Ibsen for film Every plot point in this film seems to bounce off the following event very organically and oddly very calm Although it gets gruesome towards the finish line Parasite is a tale of manipulation as well as a lesson in class The film opens to the Kim family a very low class family living in a semi basement in South Korea The family consists of Ki Taek the father Chung Sook the mother Ki Woo the son and Ki jeong the daughter They all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middle class lifestyle The house struggles with animal infestation as Ki Taek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house acting as a bug disenfectant Min hyk Ki Woo s friend offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house a stone which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it On his final night in town before studying abroad Min hyk offers Ki Woo his job as an English Tutor for the wealthy Park family Ki Woo declines due to his lack of degrees but Min hyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from Ki jeong who excels with her photoshop Ki Woo enters the Park s house where the interview is to be held Yeon gyo The mother of the Park Family trusts him fully as he becomes an English Tutor for Da hye the eldest child On his way out he notices a painting by the youngest child Da song Ki Woo under the alias Kevin from Mrs Park refers his cousin from Illinois named Jessica who is actually Ki jeong Ki Jeong and Mrs Park discuss Da song s artwork and she questions if he had a traumatic experience when the child was younger Mrs Park accepts Ki jeong as Da song s art therapist Understanding that they could all infiltrate the Park Family Ki Taek comes up with a plan One night while exiting the house the Park s Driver insists on taking Ki jeong home She leaves a piece of her clothing in the backseat of the car in order to get him fired for sexual matter while in his workspace The driver is soon replaced by Ki Taek The maid Moon gwang who lived in the house many years before the Parks has a severe allergic reaction to peaches that were planted by the Kim family The Kim s present the evidence as Tuberculosis ensuring the maid gets fired and replaced by Chung Sook The whole family now working in the house experience an upper class living style The Park Family goes away for a camping trip leaving the whole house to Chung Sook who secretly invites the whole family to live there as well That night a heavy downpour begins across town As the Kim s settle in to the Park House drinking and eating Moon Gwang arrives at the door and pleads to Chung Sook to let her inside for she claims to have forgotten an item in the basement The remaining Kims hide while Chung Sook goes with Moon Gwang and helps her move a cupboard which reveals a secret door Moon Gwang opens the door to reveal her husband Geun sae who had been living there for four years hiding from Loan Sharks Moon Gwang pleads Chung Sook to take care of him but she declines The remaining Kim s fall down the stairs and accidentally break the secret that they re all family to Moon Gwang She threatens to tell Mr and Mrs Park as Chung Sook gets a phone call from Mrs Park who states the family is coming home due to the rain Ki Taek swiftly ties Moon Gwang and Geun Sae up in the basement and locks them downstairs The Kim family clean up their mess and hide as the Parks re enter unaware of the chaos that just ensued As Chung Sook cleans up from the dinner prepared for the Parks Ki Taek Ki Woo and Ki Jeong all hide under the living room table Da Song saddened by the fact that his birthday camping trip was ruined insists on sleeping outside in his tent in the midst of the storm Mr and Mrs Park watch from the couch before they both fall asleep Ki Taek Ki Woo and Ki Jeong successfully sneak out of the house and find their old home flooded shoulder high The three gather their belongings as Ki Woo grabs the stone given to the family for good luck The three sleep in a gym alongside their previous neighbours The next morning Mrs Park insists on repaying the debt on making Da Song s birthday fun by creating a last minute garden party for him She invites Ki Jeong while Da hye requests Ki Woo to attend for they have secretly been in love Mrs Park accepts and invites Ki Taek and Chung Sook to attend as well As the party is about to begin Ki Woo opens the door to the basement ready to kill Moon Gwang and Geun sae Geun Sae gets free and mourns Moon Gwang who succumbed to her injuries from the fight Geun Sae bashes Ki Woo in the head with the stone and runs to the party holding a steak knife He then stabs Ki Jeong as Da Song faints revealing that Geun Sae was the ghost that he saw which created his childhood trauma As Mr Park insists that Ki Taek drive them to the hospital Ki Taek murders Mr Park for not understanding the importance of class Ki Taek flees the scene Ki Jeong dies from her injuries Ki Woo wakes up from a coma a couple of weeks later alongside Chung Sook A few months later Ki Woo is walking on a hill by the Park s residence where he sees a message using Morse Code Ki Woo decodes it to reveal that Ki Taek has trapped himself in the secret basement going full circle from where the film began Parasite is a film that has no end It is a reflection on something that could potentially happen Bong Joon Ho is a revolutionary director and this could be his best film yet Although the premise may seem a tad dull and anti climactic ie the first half of the film just being about infiltration the film never loses your interest A great example is during the films first climactic moment when the Park s call The audience is sweating as you watch the father fighting to ensure that the Parks don t find out about the truth the children sweeping through broken glass bottles and the mother who makes dinner Nothing too much happening and yet you are so intrigued I recommend Parasite be seen by everyone Overall Parasite gets a

12 January 2020,Simple yet realistic,This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet It s a very funny and playful movie You can t pin it down into one specific genre much like Bong Joon Ho s other work Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life The director shows the irony of life How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently While watching the movie it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot,9.0,21.0,34.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5402089/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2020,"Unconventional, quirky film that fails to deliver on any level",In 1938 The Grand Illusion was the first foreign film nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture Since then ten others have been nominated and in 2019 Parasite was the first to win Bong Joon Ho described the film as symbolic of the class barrier in Korea and symbolism is the only description or justification for the movie which is very unorthodox in its plot structure and overall style The catalyst the film is Kevin accepting to fill in for his friend as an English tutor for the wealthy Park family s daughter The first act ends when the entire Kim family secures a job in the Park residence After that the story starts to lose control At first the film quickly advances in a clipped transient style Bong Joon Ho establishes the setting and composition of his film and then sets forth No scene lingers too long and each sets the other up so by just seeing the tail end of it the audience understands what s happened The characters are quirky and idiosyncratic black humor is bestrewed throughout creating a light and comedic tone And then out of nowhere the film takes a sharp turn with the Kim s discovering the former maid s husband Geun sae living in the basement Ho has admitted he is an Alfred Hitchcock fan clearly demonstrated by the Hitchcock collection in the Park house and attempted to imitate the incredible twists that became a trademark of The Master Of Suspense However Parasite s twist fails to deliver the punch that those in Psycho North By Northwest and Vertigo do It doesn t change the story or further complicate it but instead creates an entirely new and separate plot Don t get me wrong a good twist in a movie is meant to alter its course e g Judy Madeleine s identity revealed in Vertigo or when placed at the very end to completely alter your perception of all that you just saw Citizen Kane The Sixth Sense Psycho In Parasite no new dimension is added to the film but essentially everything leading up is made irrelevant For roughly the last half the movie meanders with no direction before finally collapsing The birthday party finale is shocking and senseless What prompts both men to murder particularly Mr Kim is unknown Is it a final accumulation of his contempt for the upper class Whatever it is everything that follows drags like car with no wheels Bong Joon Ho brings the pace to a near halt and spends the final moments of this film trying to pile on every last bit of emotion and sentiment possible And as always all impact is only sucked out by the ennui and frustration Since I don t understand Korean I can t accurately judge the dialogue or acting because no matter how precise a translation is something is always lost One is merely left to follow with the subtitles and what an actor emotes non verbally which can never be the same Parasite is a film that probably resembles half a dozen genres which means it doesn t cover any properly The movie is very unconventional and not without some amusing elements but collectively it fails to deliver on any level,2.0,8.0,14.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6323723/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2020,Don't Miss It,This is my second viewing of Parasite and it s just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago It s been winning lots of awards and deservedly so Ki taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that at first is working like a charm It s very amusing and with great performances and you ll be surprised by the conclusion This Korean film is about family and class division and no matter how good a plan you have you can t plan for the unexpected Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d or at last year s Cannes Film Festival,9.0,11.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456523/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,The epitome of modern film art,Is there another film that so amply condenses modern film trends the way Parasite does Is there another film that has garnered so much rapt acclaim as Parasite Has any other film in recent years struck straight to the heart of modern filmgoers even striking a chord with most Americans despite its stature as a foreign film No Objectively speaking I m a bit surprised at the acclaim piled onto this film It starts out innocuously enough you naturally relate to the poor family the Kims but quickly turns into an orgy of such unrelieved nastiness it makes Billy Wilder s Ace in the Hole look tame And this is a full hour before the characters start bludgeoning and stabbing each other to death What is there to like It s well directed certainly like many modern films the architecture of the rich Park family s home is quite aesthetically pleasing and there are a few effective moments of dark suspense But it s all soaked in pure bile this is essentially a story of a conniving poor family duping and destroying a foolish rich one to get ahead in life There s no sign of redemption for these characters barely any remorse even and once they show their true colors it s impossible to root for their success Bong doesn t have the same moral outlook as say Scorsese so there s a complete lack of escalation the lies don t accumulate more than just providing opportunities for awkward humor the violence leads to more violence without affecting the character s psyches The utter lack of moral thought is part of why this film appeals to modern audiences as well as the theme of class conflict which is popular since it is the only way that modernity can justify the kind of actions we witness here Overall I d assume the main market for Parasite is rich people who convince themselves that they re poor at heart or at least sympathetic to the poor Then they can see the Kims and Parks as abstractions instead of human beings I admit I know next to nothing about life in South Korea it could very well be just as Hobbesian as Bong depicts it here That doesn t change the fact that he s an American celebrity this guy is way too successful at this point to convince as a nihilist But no it starts out as people urinating on the Kim s house and culminates in a giant flood where the characters flounder about amid exploding toilets and oceans of excrement Truly this is modern film art taken to its fullest To his credit Bong keeps a tight leash on the plot only unleashing a ridiculous sequence of events in the closing scenes sacrificing logic in favor of absurd contrivances to wrap everything up After committing murder in the violent climax Mr Kim hides in the Park s empty home signaling in Morse code using light fixtures a long letter addressed to his son He apparently does this every day for weeks despite not even knowing if his son is still alive which is bizarre beyond belief What s even crazier is that the son does recover from his injuries does see the message and composes a reply how he will deliver it we do not know I have a plan he says I ll go to work I ll make money then I will buy the house so we can be together again Gee dude you don t say maybe it would have been better to do all that in the first place instead of lying and destroying your way to the top,4.0,7.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8709338/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,Poverty,I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people This is a very very powerful film Very clever But even this film can t depict the real poverty If you ve watched it and are reading this very review you ain t poor The real poor don t watch this film This film might have depicted struggles But real life is on another level And no I don t know what it s like either But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey On their fierce face I don t see any extra thoughts No concerns about ethnicity pain or morality But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner There isn t any flamboyance in that There is only straight up desire And the feed for that desire,8.0,25.0,42.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5415582/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,Just ok,This movie is a vastly overrated film but still had some cool moments It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit The story is good but it just goes on and on without any real purpose It doesn t really go anywhere until the mid point which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt but it just sort of stops Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters They have no backstory They are poor and nothing else They can t even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10 from them They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them They go into people s house and stay there while the people go on trips You just don t feel for them and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers In the end it had some cool and intense scenes a hot sex scene some cool violent scenes but it is not a masterpiece The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece Go watch that instead 7 10,7.0,36.0,77.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5232307/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2019,BIGGEST RIDE OF 2019,Despite being incredibly edited and filmed Beautiful dark cinematography This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated Do yourself a favor and watch this film,10.0,16.0,25.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5202435/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2020,An Original Work of Art,Yesterday at around the beginning of the third act I came to and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention then at the roll of the credits I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie laughing and awe struck by what I d just experienced It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect and it s original films like this that come out of nowhere every once in awhile And today I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem Parasite because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece This is my first and most definitely not my last foreign film to make this list of the greatest I m so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society so it is not just relatable to Koreans The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy drama suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end It is both moving and thought provoking but is also a movie I d recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life It is an all around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast A great ensemble of talented actors including Ho s long time collaborator Kang ho Song make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss When there is so much chemistry within an on screen family you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign possibly best overall Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don t like reading subtitles TE 11 10 19,10.0,10.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5464362/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2020,Exceeds every expectation,I read a lot of rave reviews about this before I saw it I also saw it on many must see lists the past month so I thought alright I ll watch it and approached it with a show me what you got kind of attitude It didn t take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different In fact It is incomparable with anything I ve ever seen before It belongs and at the same time doesn t fit in in any kind of genre It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele s Us tried to be I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I ve seen in many many years Some people refrain from watching foreign language films I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment which this one does Parasite deserves a 10 10 because of the very simple reason that I wouldn t want to change a single second of it everything had purpose So watch it I bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews,10.0,18.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5374868/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,"Daring, original, but doesn't quite hang together",I ve often thought that the genre mix of comedy thriller is the most difficult to bring off Somehow the two different kinds of reality in their extremes don t mix easily unless the very nature of the narrative demands it as in Dr Strangelove The comic first half is somewhat slow and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but na ve family by a streetwise poor one However when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge and so I couldn t believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified A brave attempt but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb It all seemed to lack any solid centre with serious themes looking trivial and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining All a bit tasteless really,6.0,35.0,58.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5518454/?ref_=tt_urv

What did I just watch?,After seeing all the glowing reviews I feel like I am in an episode of the Twilight Zone This movie was awful The only reason I even gave it an overrated 2 is because it was weird I like weird but this was goofy weird Most of it didn t make any sense at all The housekeeper kept her husband down in a secret dungeon and would bring him food every week and the rest of the time just ignore the fact he is down there by himself The poor family couldn t even fold a pizza box then all of a sudden they are master con artists overnight Then the guy in the dungeon goes berserk and starts stabbing the con family and no one seems to care about stopping him not even the family he is after they let him attack the mom and they don t even try to help her The husband just watches him attack his wife and doesn t even try to help Then instead of attacking the attacker he runs over and kills his boss It make no sense whatsoever One of the most bizarre and goofy movies I have ever seen,2.0,17.0,31.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5490034/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2019,Failed portrait of the Poor,The Rich And the Poor In this one the poor family is neither fighting for their rights nor are they fighting for their future They try to go along as the parasites of a rich family I guess this script shows perfectly how a saturated generation X sees the stereotype of poor people in today s times Nothing to like in this movie The story is inhuman in every sense,4.0,15.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5353673/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2020,Bong Joon-Ho's ultimate genre-defying chef d'oeuvre embodies class warfare and capitalist hysteria,In Bong Joon Ho s game changing social critique the rich and the wretched descends into capitalist hell in sardonic comical and horribly grounded fashion Notions of class hierarchy have been told and retold by cinema over the decades Predominately attached to the socioeconomic spectrum stratification has always stirred up a profound impact on societies minds when it comes from caustic satires or reactive commentaries Ranging from Michael Bay s greedy paradox Pain Glory to Alfonso Cuaron s autobiographical black and white gem from Sean Baker s thoughtful portrait of post financial crisis in The Florida Project to Paul Feig s Oscar nominated powerhouse Bridesmaids capitalist prototypes and social dynamics have come and gone in all sorts of unimaginable shapes to bring out the inner demons of human survival In times of cholera and uncertainty Bong Joon Ho s latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head turning accomplishment a surgically accurate class fable a truly gripping multi genre piece of entertainment and a reinvigorating storytelling rich decade new awake Ever since its Palme d Or win Parasite has been ground breaking new history not only by becoming the very first non English language non epic length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony golden ticket Cuaron s Roma lost to polarizing preachy Green Book back in 2019 but by giving new life into movie going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming service battles and rowdy franchise building tentpoles In a way Parasite feels like the Inception of this new century Back in 2010 Christopher Nolan s towering 160 million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry wise putting the absolute always coveted formula into one single movie crushing box office incomes cerebral wholly original storytelling and above else priceless craftsmanship power However Nolan did not treasure any social resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon Ho did overseas Parasite on the other hand is a small budgeted South Korean thinking piece that even while managing different procedures it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan s pic comes to the very same conclusion great filmmaking is the key Social headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like Get Out and The Invisible Man are proving that studios either big or small may still conquer audiences with entertaining on point storytelling Script wise Parasite is an utter knockout At first glance the most outstanding praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected These think again premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon Ho has to offer The truly one of a kind centerpieces are proceedings and composition Take for instance the 5 minute towering montage at the end of the first act where black humor cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up blurring the line between good and bad between wealth and the poverty between sarcasm and irony The film succeeds at it mainly from hugely magnetic characters When first we met the Kim family they leave their banjiha s windows wide open in order to get free extermination They are poor unemployed and Wi Fi needed The film develops them one by one in a highly audience catching way picturing them as both victims and victimizers as the film evolves Later on the Park family steps in They are wealthy intellectual picture perfect individuals However unlike the Kim family the Parks are not portrayed as villains until the masterfully executed final sequence where each missing piece fits in For most of its running time they are na ve nice elite people who do not want to get sick by their long time loyal housekeeper And that feeling of correspondence the film gets from its audience regardless of origin race or social status comes from a core aspect empathy We care about them we are invested in their tragedies we are as worried and shocked as the characters themselves Empathy is paramount for wining audiences over without it most of the film s purposes would be directly trashed out and the South Korean director knows it better than anyone if not just take a look at any of his previous works Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast which by the way became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards making one more time movie history Park So dam Lee Sun kyun Choi Woo shik Cho Yeo jeong and Song Kang ho deliver award worthy performances endowing to the story tangible three dimensional characters that in incompetent hands would come out as hollow caricatures Bong Joon Ho s pictures are described as many things at once black comedies social commentaries genre crossing post apocalyptic adventures Owning every inch of them Parasite spices the mix up with deeper timely metaphors make no mistake peaches and basements are not going to be the same however the film owes it to two crucial aspects visual language and edition Camera movements blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew It could have been a silent film and still it would speak volumes Cinematographer Hong Kyung pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight grabbing class divide by the throat What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion it is now the perfect visual cocktail sophistication and softness luxury and poverty ups and downs dark and light hungry beasts in empty spaces Okja composer Jaeil Jung plays an important role as well shaping the mood and complementing the atmosphere endowing the film with rich elegant horror like sound scales getting a heart stopping small yet often disturbing soundtrack by adding up layer after layer of complex composed sounds Gisaengchung by Bong Joon Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade Many critics have healed it as the picture of the year and even if it is tout fait true Parasite transcends the boundaries of society headed industry transforming films say Jordan Peele s ambitious allegory Us reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare Hitchcock and Kim Ki young and still you are nowhere near to it Many talented socially aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years now Bong Joon Ho in total command of his craft has made it Parasite is a groundbreaking work of

22 February 2020,Parasite Film Review - Bong Joon Ho Directs An Oscar Winner That Trump Dismisses,Parasite won Best Film and Best Director for Bong Joon Ho at the Oscars this month also winning International Feature Film and Original Screenplay Neon the distributors suggested that Donald Trump leader of the free world unsurprisingly didn t like it as he cannot read Harsh My only gripe with subtitles is I cannot always watch the screen action as I don t want to miss the words You get used to them of course but like Pedro Almodovar s Pain And Glory I missed some of the beautiful designs Caught that on demand prior to the Oscars as it wasn t available anywhere locally But missing out on world cinema and tv because of subtitles is very sad To be honest Paradise is a horrible film With horrible characters living a horrible life A black comedy horror tragedy that reeks of the class divide between a successful South Korean family and their poor contemporaries And the living conditions are startling with the poor living in a basement with a window on a street that is regularly urinated in Just in front of them And piggy backing off their upstairs neighbours internet connection We take pleasure in laughing at their hovel while our wealthy family live in the most architecturally perfect modern home we all would imagine living in Bravo to the Production designer Lee Ha jun for realising this on a sound stage So while our wealthy Park family smell of money the poor Kim family smell of whatever you can imagine poverty and that bug infested basement smells of and it isn t nice Old radish our rich husband played by Sun kyun Lee suggests But things are finally looking up for the loving Kim family Not with the pizza boxes they construct for minimum wage though Instead son Ki woo played by Woo sik Choi is recommenced for a tutoring job with the wealthy Park family His rich friend who currently tutors the young daughter wants to romance her when she goes to college We can see where that might go And for Ki woo the Park family live in another world as he climbs out of the basement Mrs Park played by the lovely Yeo jeong Jo goes about her day supported by terrific housekeeper Moon gwang To be honest Lee Jeong eun keeps the house running as Mrs Park is a little on the ditzy side but in awe of her young son s artistic talents He needs an art tutor for sure and once saw a ghost she confides although his sister sees right through him But what are the chances that Mi Woo knows of an art tutor very in demand and just returned from Chicago I think So So dam Park s Ki jeong also climbs out of the basement and spins the gullible Mrs Park a line of Google babble that wins her the job Mrs Park even spins herself the lines as she accepts Ki jeongs Although the Park family are really lovely But as these two chancers have managed to begin feathering their nest they are actually good at what they are doing And with the right opportunity both wasters could have aspired to the same roles without the deception But deception is what they do and Ki jeong sees an opportunity for her Dad played by Kang ho Song to be the new driver to Mr Park Her actions in getting him the role left a bad taste in my mouth Getting her art tutor job didn t hurt anyone But after a wash and brush up Mr Kim can actually drive cornering without spilling a coffee in the hand of Mr Park And now our three hustlers spy even more opportunity for Mum to get in on the action when Moon gwang s peach allergy is discovered and Mrs Kim s Hye jin Jang is recruited as the new housekeeper All the Park s money for staff now goes directly into the Kim s pockets But with all the family out of the basement their smell has followed them Something that the Park s son notices All are perfectly capable of doing their jobs but with their bad odour they pollute the beautiful home Where do they go from here then How do they grab this beautiful life for themselves Well one dark and stormy night the poor cross the line The veneer of respectability can disappear in an instant and ghosts can materialise from basements long gone But all actions have consequences as Bong Joon Ho directs the poor fighting over scraps from the table of the rich when they could have shared instead But why should they share the scraps we ask If his first film was called Barking Dogs Never Bite Parasite will show us that with enough antagonism they will But I don t blame the Park family who gave employment to the poor to facilitate their comfortable lives They are incapable without them Each class living off the other And there is no answer of course to the film s questions only the international language of morse code desperation to decipher and never be able to respond to,10.0,8.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5501369/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2020,simple opinion without any spoilers,1 This movie is too over rated I don t know maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively 2 All the characters are pathetically unlikable They only show flaws You don t want to be them you don t want to be with them not at the beginning nor in the middle nor in the end 3 This lowlife 4 member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition the husband father was unemployed for a very long time the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times This helpless and hopeless family couldn t simply become a well practiced con artist family overnight If they were such great scammers they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time They don t have money to afford a dignified basic living standard They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con artist so easy and so soon 4 I don t understand what the intention of the director is What does he want to explain or to prove Is it a critic of social inequalities Is it a thriller A comedy I don t know and none of these styles is addressed adequately,6.0,60.0,102.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5627495/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,A different kind of film with real-world parallels.,While I do think that it is ever so slightly overrated I can t help but acknowledge the very artistic directing symbolism and acting that went into this film Some parts make you laugh some parts make you feel very sympathetic and many parts make you feel oddly uncomfortable but in a good way that makes the movie pretty enjoyable We definitely do live in different parts of society with different luxuries and experiences that are misunderstood by the other,8.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7548722/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,Convoluted story and plot but good acting,Parasite received all sorts of rave reviews and the movie is really interesting until the part when they find out the housekeeper s husband is living under the house Then it gets all whacked And the son should have been killed by the force of trauma from the scholar stone that was supposed to be for good luck Too many plot holes like how could the family move back into that crappy apartment Wasn t it condemned after all that flooding Acting was superb but the violence at the boy s picnic was gratuitious and unnecessary I m sure some love this movie and want to see it again and again but it was rather dark and depressing If you have a sick macabre sense of humor this film is for you,5.0,3.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6675129/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,Don't believe the hype!,Actually this movie is not that brilliant It has a good start but then the plot is just disappointing The end ruins the whole movie The occuring violence is a very simple move to finish the messed up plot And do not expect good acting or realistic characters It is just overacting,5.0,10.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6760192/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2019,One of the best films of the year as well as Bong Joon Ho's career,Parasite is written and directed by Bong Joon Ho Memories Of murder The Host Snowpiercer and tells the story of a poor family living In Korea who take particular interest in a wealthy family as they slowly integrate themselves into there lives Thats the basic general premise for Parasite and don t look anything else up about this movie beacuse make no mistake this is a movie best experienced by knowing as little as possible it also just so happens to be one of if not the best movie of the entire year aswell as Bong Joon Ho s entire career Where to even begin with this one Well let s start with the director himself Ive always been a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho s The Host is one of my favourite monster movies and Snowpiercer is a fun ride aswell however it s Memories of Murder that really impressed me A perfectly constructed crime thriller which put Ho on the map Ho is a extremely ambitious and confident filmmaker who seems to be always trying something new with every movie he makes One thing that always strikes me and many other fans of Bong s work is the overall tone of his films Just like his previous work parasite is really difficult to place into just one genre At times it extremely funny and playful the next minute it will be an nail biting thriller with a hint of horror Bongs writing style is something that I have always enjoyed but here in particular It works extremely well My favourite aspect of this movie Besides basically everything is the characters and the writing Parasite is a movie that is examing social classes and showing the divide for what it truly is in the film we see perspectives from both poor and rich families With that in mind you may have some preconception of how these families are going to be shown based on what you have seen in the past However you would be wrong Ho manages to show both families with the same amount of respect as each other His not trying to make the rich looks evil but at the same time not trying to make the poor look like saints He is just showing human beings and the effect that these social class divides take on us One thing that Bong Joon Ho said in the Q A after the screening that struck me was There are no Villains in this film and it s true This all lends itself to a truly unique experience where you understand every characters motivations and understand the actions that they take and in turn practically don t necessarily know who you want to come out on top Just go support this movie if you get the chance Especially if you are a fan of film as an art form Beacuse this truly is a masterful put together movie that from the second it starts to the end had me transfixed,10.0,17.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5322097/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2020,Respect!,Writer director Bong Joon Ho pulls off another sharp genre film with a darkly comedic twist after tackling serial killers Memories of Murder 2003 monsters The Host 2006 science fiction Snowpiercer 2013 the only one I did not like and child and her pet genre Okja 2017 it s time for the family drama with a dash of Hitchcockian thriller The poor but cunning Kim family infiltrates the rich Park family through a series of deceptions as the Kims discredit the previous domestic workers to replace them one by one fabricating fake credentials However the Park house hides a dark secret which throws the Kims plan into chaos To say more would be a shame This is for me Bong s best movie since The Host possibly even since Memories of Murder boasting perfect editing fine performances the great Kang ho Song Bong s long time collaborator plays the patriarch of the poor family and clever visual storytelling The attention to details is stunning the film has a strong vertical structure with the road to the Parks house ascending into the sunlight while the journey back to the Kims basement is a long dim descent the two great windows of the houses contrast each other with the Parks showing a gorgeous garden and the Kims a squalid alley populated by drunkards when a Native Americans themed birthday turns into something far more sinister a character s face is smeared with blood in a way to resemble war paintings The script is worthy of these remarkable visuals and finds a miraculous balance between comedy tragedy and tension 8 5 10,9.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5777574/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2021,I hate to say it but...,The only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie And let me be clear here not just specifically korean but literally any non US movie on par with Parasite in terms of quality would have been as successful as Parasite anyway with a bit of luck of course Actually not just a bit of luck they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that s what happened with Parasite It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought That s a lot better than what I expected Domino effect followed and today we got this movie that s overrated and predictable No different than your average ThRiLLeR movie P S The only reason I went this hard on the movie is because the internet went so good on it and the movie got more than it deserved anyway so keep calm the movie is still watchable when drunk,6.0,7.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7155136/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,Interesting look into Korean society.,Like everywhere else there are the successful and the not so In this film the bottom dwellers the Kim family live in a basement suite and do odd jobs One day they use a scam to infiltrate a rich family the Park family In typical Asian manner the employers don t check job references or do a criminal background check Depending on personal introductions and a superficial assessment at the job interview Such is the dependence on the sanctity of Confucian social relationships Naturally the amoral Yi family take full advantage of the naive gentile Mrs Park Behaving in an atypical Asian way to eliminate the other servants Add the complication of a debtor hiding in a secret basement Preferring self imprisonment to life as an outcast above ground Eventually there is tragedy as the past of the deceitful people catch up with them Bringing death to the Park family Excellent direction and acting Quite convincing Like the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon this film offers insights into Confucian society About ideals and the failures to meet the standards,8.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6376890/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,not only overhyped--actually just stupid,I think the great cinematography has tricked audiences into thinking this film is a whole lot deeper more groundbreaking than it actually is It has the plot of a rom com with some gruesome flourishes at the end that allow people to turn this into some type of incisive social commentary Wow Class differences exist Thanks Bong Joon ho for enlightening me Just because you ve successfully deciphered what the director writer sought to convey doesn t mean he s necessarily saying anything profound People need to stop patting themselves on the back for understanding the meaning and realize that despite the pivotal role of the underground in the film its significance remains painfully surface level I see a lot of people separating this movie into halves and it s fitting During the first half I was fairly interested and as I saw it taking on the plot structure of a lighthearted comedy where we willfully accept unrealistic events I started wondering how the hell it had won Best Picture alongside the universal acclaim Well after the former housekeeper s return the stupidity that ensues yes that moment and the very end inclusive signals a dark shift that is surely what summoned most of that praise However it s here where the film starts to break down for me We accept the gullible mother and seemingly passive father as the opposite family begins to infiltrate at every opening That s ok for some time for some genres but I simply cannot find the absurd a fair foundation on which to build a tragedy The existence of the first half of the movie makes it impossible to take the second half as seriously as we are supposed to And on top of it I genuinely don t care what happens to any of these people save a tinge of regret for Mr Park s taking a knife to the chest I find it impossible that the tutor son could survive two 2 skull crushing throws of a rock to the head and I genuinely cannot think of anything stupider than Mr Kim committing the murder in the first place even given the heat of the moment and his motivations I was almost peer pressured into giving a higher review for the simple fact that I ve seen none so low as mine but 3 just feels right Something unconnected that I need to insert the comedy element that seems to be so present to others isn t even there for me either It s smirk with one corner of the mouth funny throughout but never really hilarious It s prettiness is its strongest feature and to say otherwise is contrived,3.0,75.0,138.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5950429/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2019,Best Film of the year 👏,It took me while to be able to sit and review this movie It has been difficult almost impossible to put down into words anything about it I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core Here s a film which leaves no one indifferent It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands the smell inpregnated in old people s clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family s basement window The question starts with a simple title Parasite Who are they The ones in the basement at the bottom of the pyramid The ones in the middle trying to strive even if they cannot get rid of the smell The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT Or aren t WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often Wasn t a camera leading our eyes all the time For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film Sometimes I was moving left right up or down Sometimes I was watching Others I was being watched The window could be either a screen to the outside world inside the house I often felt watched in the movie theatre Was I the parasite If this isn t the Best Film of the year I don t know what it us,10.0,43.0,78.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5348686/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2019,Parasite is not a valid title for this brilliant movie,It s a nice to watch movie and nice to think afterwards of what you ve just saw At first it feels you are watching a single sided comedy in which a family of poor devils manage to build a scam against naive rich people But 45 minutes later you see something different It is a very strong contrast to see the father of the family on the same scene trying to save everything he has from his flooded house while on the next scene he has to pretend that everything is ok The ending is not the best I could think of I guess rich people will keep living and poor people will keep dreaming Very strong and meaningful pictures painting a country that is supposed to be of the wealthiest in the world showing that the barrier between rich and poor people is opening everywhere The main characters is like they re living in North Korea if you think of it Finally I think the description of all characters wants to show that nobody is good or evil nobody is right or wrong It s just the situations that make us react the way we do I am not even quite sure who s the parasite Poor people who discover a window for a better living or rich people who take advantage of lower class people in order to obtain their wealth not knowing how it is to be poor,8.0,21.0,38.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5327708/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2019,Palme d'or? It's a gem!,This is a very rich film with metaphors as the young hero of it might say It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction writing and acting are very cleverly done The themes of the have nots against the haves and the cold hearted versus the warmer hearted people dominate the plot which is thick There is a lot of symbolism in it Who are the real parasites anyway the poor or the wealthy the caring or the indifferent The tone takes a turn three quarters of the way through from French farce style to almost a horror film However it is worth engaging in until its conclusion as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed I can see why it won the Palme d Or at Cannes in 2019 it s a gem,10.0,18.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5231343/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2020,Interesting but certainly not spectacular!,The movie covers a variety of genres and social issues that rapidly developing countries like South Korea are facing a sudden but unequal distribution of wealth and inequality between classes It revolves around a family of Grifters who feel they must take back power and exact revenge on a wealthy class family The problem with the film is that it tends to drag out and become boring after a while The viewer loses interest The story could have been told in a much shorter time It does tend to show what lengths people will go to if they feel they are the underdog and what they are capable of doing to extract revenge,6.0,6.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5519990/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2020,one of those films that makes you wonder how the could mess it up,Parasite is itself a parasite of a movie The start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film It s a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions There are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending This is It makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up One who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it Because there was some good acting and great film work I gave it five stars But it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie,5.0,29.0,51.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5385875/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2020,"PARASITE: Dark, Socially themed, Multi-dimensional, Highly thought-provoking and an incandescent cinematic roller coaster!",Korean films are love Yes they are Oldboy The Man From Nowhere I Saw The Devil The Chase etc etc You name it Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way Parasite adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations And for films like Parasite it spans over a wide sphere for sure Kudos to the director Bong Joon ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions sense of humour lots of adrenaline rush few nail biting moments as well all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families It pin points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo noir black comic style which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including The Best Picture award as a Non English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards It s rightfully the MOVIE OF THE YEAR OF 2019,10.0,18.0,31.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5473956/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2020,I was wrong ...,In my latest IMDb review I wrote the following 1917 is British director Sam Mendes latest opus I also believe that it is the next Best Picture and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing Don t get me wrong 1917 is a splendid and absorbing war movie But after watching Parasite I no longer agree with my earlier statements regarding Oscar statuettes Parasite is perhaps one of the most unique films I have ever seen One second it is a hilarious comedy and in the other a terrifying horror flick Suddently it turns into a romance and then you find yourself watching a jaw dropping thriller The greatest thing about it is that you don t even notice these dynamic changes in genre The natural flow of the movie is just so beautiful I don t even know how Joon ho was able to craft such a film as Parasite No single shot is wasted the intelligent script is baffling and sometimes the characters feel even more alive than real people Some complain over the fact that the film is in Korean and that you end up reading the subtitles more than watching the actual movie I find that statement to be nonsense Maybe it is because I am quite used to reading subtitles that I find it to be so I am from Sweden but perhaps also because the acting is just so good that you know the feelings of each character just by looking at their facial expressions To conclude I wish for Parasite to win five out of six possible nominations at the Academy Awards tonight Best picture Sin ae Kwak Bong Joon Ho Best Achievement in Directing Bong Joon Ho Best Original Screenplay Bong Joon Ho Jin Won Han Best Achievement in Film Editing Jinmo Yang Best International Feature Film South Korea I believe that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood had better sets but in all honesty what is it compared to Parasite I would not hesitate to put it in my top 10 best movies which I have ever seen And it is probably the greatest movie of the 2010 s Read no further about it just watch it You will be delighted 10 10,0.0,6.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5471820/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2020,"Richly deserved Best Picture Award, superb social comment",Director Bong Joon Ho directed wrote the screenplay and produced PARASITES He deserved all the four Oscars that his film and he collected There is something Tarantino like about his style in the way that he presents intersecting individuals from different social strata with apparently comic but definitely violent ultimate consequences However he is more polished than Tarantino was at the same age and stage in his career He presents reality without judging the Kims are a family of jobless and largely useless individuals who do not even know how to fold pizza boxes properly who have no money for Wi Fi and find it only in a toilet in the strangest place in a house that I ve ever seen The father superbly played by Kang ho Song claims to have a plan but ultimately admits that the sole plan that won t fail is no plan He tries to adapat to situations and is quick to react to any opportunity The mother is admirably played by Hye jin Jang a courageous and resilient fighter in the face of life s adversities and a fantastic imitator of North Korean leaders speech delivery styles Sun Kyun Lee plays the son a likeable young man who forges a university degree and copies a more successful friend s example which will ultimately weigh him down like the rock that the friend gives him His sister the extremely beautiful So dam Park is the most level headed and intelligent of the lot a quick thinker who has a touch for children The son finds a job as a teacher of English in a rich home run by a father who is often away on business in Paris and a completely useless but physically gorgeous Yeo jeong Jo lovely legs By first pulling in his sister to placate and teach painting to the bolshy child in the rich family and then finding jobs in the household for his father and mother the son gets the family s foot in the door to a world of wealth such as they had never imagined and which they rapidly start wishing they could occupy Needless to say that can only be achieved with violence and violence does indeed beget violence but there are surprises along the way Acting is of the highest standard by all but I would like to single out Jeong eun Lee as the governess who is allergic to peaches who keeps her husband hidden in the rich house s basement The sequences where she rings the bell during the torrential rain and where she tries to open the passage to the basement are unique and memorable Cinematography is immaculate with memorable sequences like the flood in the poorer sections of town in contrast with the safety in the higher grounds occupied by the rich the scramble for the cell phone before a video can be sent from it and the overhead shot of Kang ho Song running into hiding after stabbing the rich homeowner Credible and gripping screenplay fantastic action sequences Completely deserved Best Picture Academy Award,10.0,6.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5484765/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,132 minutes of perfectly measured film,Like a five star dish every minute of this film is superb respecting the time it asks of you the viewer as it takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows It is not overly dramatic nor does deplete you emotionally which is my typical fear with Korean dramas and thrillers I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you Avoid spoilers at all costs and dive in at the marvel of the story it can tell within two hours as Hollywood struggles with two part films and making coherence out of overly packed blockbusters like Star Wars Perhaps a permanent entry into the Top 250 films of all time,10.0,19.0,32.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5392986/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2020,Parasite(s) and where to find them,With Parasite Bong Joon Ho goes for another exercise of social commentary not unlike his praised The Host 2006 for those who cared for a monster movie dealing with social issues It wasn t for everyone though Both films are so metaphorical as Parasite protagonist Kim Ki woo likes to put it But different strokes for different people no Certainly the metaphors aren t on vacation this time around it s just that they learned to profess some subtlety As back then Bong pulls out all the stops in Parasite and while the former picture s literally Godzillish rendition matching its ambitions makes it borderline the new approach is hard to skip It takes on the shape of a pitch dark comedy with coarse edges when it counts One might as well let one s self get immersed in it enjoy the ride and laugh along relish its twists and turns before receiving a blow from left field Parasite comes across as less pretentious settles on the more down to earth pun intended side of things it plants its seed with a much smaller dose of horror is whimsical ironic even cynic at times and it substitutes CGI for clever story telling and cinematography measuring the highs and lows of the social ladder with visual precision In short ingredients for a less in your face decisively creeping up on you kind of comedy drama of caliber falling into line with Bong s other early outstanding effort Memories of Murder Parasite is an all out visual genre mix of the first order as much commentary about western society s underbelly and upper class as it is a ghost story drawing from a long Asian tradition Things are in play that have always been lingering deep down underneath and come back to haunt us metaphorically and literally In that sense the film is as much a thriller as it is fun stuff and dead serious drama a bit like an attempt at squaring a circle and yet it works Parasite is also the ultimate staircase film to name just one striking image This owes itself to the implied fairy tale lore that at the end of the staircase society s equivalent for the romantic rainbow you ll find a pot of gold right It s just that stairs work in both directions and climbing them up or down is less romantic Bong Joon Ho makes staircase construction his art and builds them vicious circle like Consider this circle squared,9.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5486031/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2021,The Overrated-ness is getting to me,Not gonna lie the Overrated ness of Parasite is starting to get to me When I first saw it at the cinema I was very impressed but after some thought I think it s probably closer to an 8 objectively The last 30 minutes in particular drag it down somewhat Not really a huge fan of the direction it takes I simply don t get what on God s Green Earth made this one of the highest rated movies of all time on some websites and listings It s pretty baffling and far from being a flawless movie That being said I still like it The Black and White Version added nothing to it though If anything it made it pretentious for absolutely no reason 7 5 10,8.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6888062/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2019,"The idea of ""Parasite""",Parasite is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a while it has a message that you have to look in another perspectives to look in a different ways from the poor families and the rich family and that doesn t mean they are rich they don t look after for the poor families but the greediness and the hatred between the two poor families show us how is the innocent family is Spoiler The greedy between two Poor families that caused climax of Antagonism The poor families because of the greediness and hatred the rich family and Innocent family has suffered and caused a death to the rich family,10.0,11.0,17.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5315434/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,I don't get it,It was entertaining with good execution But best picture Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical american narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status To its credit I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer s emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non virtuous and indeed villainous What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect Now many are praising the supposedly deep revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle but I don t find it nearly as profound as is claimed The overtly sensational absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message and the storyline even leaving aside the over the top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction More importantly the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class determinant normalcy It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue even in momentary antithesis Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one and also an implausible one because the world is not so one sided and simple For this reason the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise,7.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5631540/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2020,"Interesting in Parts, Mostly Boring.",This movie is bolstered in it s ratings by piling on but in this sense it is a piling on of unearned praise This is a mixed it will examine the good qualities some of the misnomers of other reviewers and the bad qualities of this film In case anyone wonders this is not my first Bong Joon Ho movie I watched Host which Parasite is so far ahead of Host which was a 5 at best when all things were considered Host is also a movie that gets far better reviews than it deserves it totally squanders its good ideas and Parasite does the same Parasite is expertly made technically outside of it s script which is sophomoric at best Parasite is not a classic it isn t groundbreaking and it is not that good although it is a mildly interesting film by the end it cannot make up for the fact that it is boring because it is completely predictable if you have watched even a few films Parasite may refine what Ho did with Host and irons out the kinks it isn t enough to rise about a 7 when all things are considered I have watched enough Korean films to know they are quite different from their Western counterparts and even other countries such as Japan or Hong Kong Parasite is relatively dull and predictable for the most part but it does have a cohesive vision and tone that for your average movie goer it will set it apart from almost anything they have seen and for those unfamiliar with Korean cinema this will seem a lot more unique then it is I ve seen movies similar to this from Korea it really isn t too unique If you want to see a truly unique Korean film see Save the Green Planet which is about 14yrs I too watched Parasite because of the hype but I could not stop watching the clock up until the last 20 minutes other than a minor twist or two it was totally predictable and it was highly irritating to see the movie dragged out to over 2hrs it just wouldn t end Had it been 100 minutes at best this might actually be a 7 5 8 even with it s unoriginal storyline Despite it s overly long run time and predictable script the direction is Ho is vastly better here than Host the cinematography is well done beautiful music good acting those saying the acting is bad are wrong this is an absurdist film the acting is supposed to be well absurd the lighting and sound are great so from a technical standpoint it is great but it is a very predictable script with too much padding the script is also largely devoid of any real character development there is only a little bit towards the end and is filled with cliches which some are probably confusing for clever Better characters would have driven home some of its main points better and this script is in desperate need of some trimming In terms of the story unlike others I do not feel it is far fetched what the family did per say people get conned every single day While others saw the poor family as being portrayed as dumb and lazy I saw it differently What struck me was the father wasn t lazy or stupid he is the typical hapless and bumbling father that is so prevalent in Asian films Mostly he appears to have lost the ability to care and was aimless without purpose and doesn t actually care about his family which makes him hard to like He has a small progression in this film it just isn t enough The son on the other hand was shown as cunning and selfish from the beginning in the incident with the pizza company and once the family saw that he had been able to complete this ruse as a tutor and they got on board with his plan The father and son of the poor family are by the far the most fleshed out characters but that isn t saying much While I didn t like the stereotypes on either end either the rich or the poor families and it does seem to make the rich people the bad guys which is pretty absurd given they were swindled and far worse by the end of it The film despite other s claims had nothing meaningful to say about class struggles it is simply the same rote nonsense that is in most films these days Unlike some based on the slow burn of the events of the film the violence here felt natural and it didn t feel out of character for these people it felt like a natural progression of the script and the feelings these characters have bottled inside This sudden outburst of violence at the end after a long slow buildup doesn t feel as shocking as maybe it was supposed to be Do not come to this looking for traditional comedy you don t find it here It is more what would be called a black comedy or even a dramedy it just isn t in the traditional sense This film is extraordinarily absurdist however it doesn t get absurd enough The closest Western relative I can think of which really does have extreme and cartoonish violence is War of the Roses a movie that does extraordinarily well in making you feel how horrible divorce can be using absurdities Parasite also contains elements of a typical thriller yes there are some bad things and some violent things in it but that does not equal a horror movie It maintains a consistent tone throughout with the exception of a portion in the middle and the end where it tonally takes some left turns and these elements actually feel a bit out of place in a bad way Fir the most part it blends the genres together and maintains a consistent tone On the whole I don t like this film even though it is such a leap from Host which was mostly awful and wildly tonally all over the place with downright awful pacing Parasite on the other hand sets it s tone from the beginning and it really never changes much the pace also stays the same and that is quite a feat As previously noted the predictability of the events in the film minus a few blips here and there makes it an extremely dull ride unless you ve watched very few movies I cannot fault it s technical achievements but it is painstakingly dull in others because of its predictability I would rather go watch Save the Green Planet again instead of this film it is a much better example of absurd Korean cinema With only a few events to really keep you interested it is impossible for me to recommend this even the twists feel more like cheap tricks than an organic part of the story Granted I am not against gimmicks but this movie is not deserving of 4 or whatever Oscars that it got nor an 8 6 I can only guess it won due to Tarantino s incessant lobbying he loves this guy s films Don t buy into the hype watch it if you want to but don t accept the hype scrutinize it endlessly it deserves

Unfortunately the bad script and mediocre directing.,I wasn t sure what to expect from this movie I didn t read too much about it but watching the trailer and having seen this director s previous work The Host and Snowpiercer I was expecting something in the horror sci fi genre But that s not what this movie was Sadly whatever message the director Joon Ho Bong was trying to convey it was lost in the tonally uneven mess of a script and direction that starts off as a light hearted comedy but then drags down into a dark and depressing disaster When the movie starts we are shown a working class more more like poor family the Kims who seem to be hard on their luck We see they work together folding pizza boxes i don t see how the fumigated boxes were still good to earn a few bucks Anyway luck falls upon them when a friend of their son hooks him up with a sweet tutoring gig at the home of the Parks And as the movie progresses the members of the Kim family slowly insert themselves into aspects of the Parks lives Now I think the intention was to portray this as some sort of social commentary and class struggle But it definitely doesn t come across like this at all All we see is The Kim family using tricks and deception to get their way while the wealthy Park family while a little naive is portrayed as actually fairly nice They don t mistreat any of their workers they don t even do background checks on the Kim family who are masquerading as non related individuals The father seems to be hard working but is willing to take time off along with the whole family to take the young son out camping for his birthday The movie then takes a dark turn when we find out the husband of the previous maid was living in the basement of the home Not as a prisoner but of his own choice to evade the law Now this turn of events is NOT a twist I was expecting the twist to be more like it turns out the original architect owner was locked down there and the Park family was also a bunch of imposters Anyway this movie devolves into scenes of violence where the Park father is killed and really I don t get why he had to die His only crime was he didn t like a particular smell It wasn t a metaphor for poor people because poor people probably don t like smelly people either It just seemed like the whole basement bunker garden bloodbath was shoehorned in for the little twist ending where we see the lights flickering on and off in the house because that s where the murderous Kim father chose to hide The whole movie premise was just bad one dimensional characters who we never learn anything about so we don t feel any sympathy except maybe for the Park family who were too nice for their own good This movie really doesn t deserve the high praise it s been getting It s a clumsy effort that doesn t execute it s themes very well I just gave it a 3 because it s pretty to look at and some of the dialogue was funny But as a whole it s an unrewarding experience to sit through,3.0,32.0,83.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5209184/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2020,"Great Movie, Deserved The Oscar Win",I just got out of my second viewing of Parasite I first seen it back in November at an advanced screening I think anyone watching this after the Oscars will probably think it is over rated I certainly think that about Gladiator and Silence Of The Lambs and 1917 should have won I m not one of them I loved 1917 but I loved this equally as much and I was totally fine with it winning If movies with subtitles bother you this will not be for you For me thought it is 100 original you ll never know where it is going the acting is great by all concerned and it is darkly funny I have to say It was a lot more effective on its first watch as I knew nothing about the movie which is how I think it should be seen and it simply blew me away That has now been taken away now but it is still a great movie,8.0,4.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5483176/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2019,"Funny, messed up, depressing, scary. All of these things describe Parasite.",I have seen two films previously from the director of this film Bong Joon Ho Those being Okja and The Host I like them both quite a bit I think however that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him Don t judge this movie on the US trailers I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film they made it look really pretentious In reality the actual movie isn t anything like that trailer This is a dark funny insane crazy and thought provoking film I won t get too much into the plot as I feel it s something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family the Kims who try and take advantage of a rich family the Parks Things get complicated from there The acting in this movie is phenomenal everyone here gives their A game The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful The screenplay is smart creative darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially and is pure insanity at points The film doesn t take sides on either family they both do pretty bad things but at the same time you surprisingly care about them despite how flawed both of them are The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea The cinematography is beautiful especially those big wide shots of environments The editing is exquisite no scene goes on for too long they make every second of this film matter and I never felt bored by the film the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me The music is also pretty good as well Overall Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year It has great performances amazing direction one of the best screenplays of the year and it keeps you guessing what will happen next Go into this movie as blind as you can the less you know the better,10.0,18.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5294441/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,A great movie,I really liked the movie a lot It is extraordinary The plot is a unique masterpiece Like most Korean movies it is maybe not for everyone s stomach It is a brutal honest and a raw dark comedy which has a deeper meaning that progresses throughout the whole movie and punches you at the end with a knockout twist It replicates the cold and honest reality of the outside world of poor and rich differences So whoever wants to experience a thrilling push of harsh reality packed into a metaphoric world of class diversity and the struggle between them has to see this movie,9.0,9.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5479339/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2019,One of the most overrated movies ever,I am being generous with the 3 stars because films like Charlie s Angels exist but this has to be one of the biggest disappointment of films I have ever seen based on reviews This has like a 99 on Rotten Tomatoes and a 95 on Metacritic are people smoking crack or paid off This movie is just plain stupid it s like a teen caper movie just ridiculous stupidity being called satire What annoys me most are these holier than thou critics who are slamming a brilliant iconic film that is one of the best to come along in 25 years calling its irresponsible and violent while praising a film about lying cheating stealing and actually killing to get ahead in life Actual children are killed some bashed in the head multiple people stabbed and this is somehow okay because somewhere some darling critic said it was good and the rest of the sheep followed This film is silly and the message is disgusting At least some of the folks here at IMDB aren t brainwashed Yeah so a film about not being holes to the mentally ill or anyone because it hurts can aggravate their conditions and drive people to suicide or murder is bad but a film about falsely accusing people to get them fired so you can steal their job then murder them along with their employers for no reason but greed is great in whacky CriticLand Nothing from this film will be remembered next year Nobody will be talking about it Nobody will care Save your money and just watch a teen movie on cable where they are trying to sneak into someone s house and get out before the parents get home Same level of nonsense,5.0,33.0,74.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5228956/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2020,Not terrible but clearly overrated,Parasite is a highly polished and pretty looking movie but it falls short in a few ways My biggest issue was that I couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities and the rich family are basically clueless airheads I really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story The movie also suffered from a severe case of tonal whiplash meaning the tone was all over the place Sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously like a straight drama Also in the last quarter the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose This wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised The movie also has some glaring plot holes like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home I guess if this was a silly cartoon for children that would be acceptable but not in a proper film,7.0,10.0,15.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5732856/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2020,An uncategorizable masterpiece,What is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible to define Parasite Only the third film to win both the Palme d Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture Parasite is one of the best reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non English language film to win Best Picture Co writer and director Bong Joon Ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night four On top of that he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film In short Parasite has had a significant and relatively unexpected impact But what exactly is Parasite Described on its official website as a pitch black modern fairy tale even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn t adequately delineate its real nature part comedy of manners part social satire part heist film part thriller part horror part family drama part farce part economic treatise part social realism part tragedy part allegory And that s just the opening scene It s the Ulysses of cinema adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre And like Ulysses it s exceptional in just about every way screenplay co written by Bong and directing cinematography mise en sc ne editing production design sound design score acting There s not a weak link here in a film that achieves that rarest of things it lives up to the hype The Kim family are down on their luck Father Ki taek mother Chung sook daughter Ki jeong and son Ki woo reside in a tiny basement apartment with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley With all four unemployed they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant However their fortunes change when Ki Woo meets Min hyuk a childhood friend who is now at university Min hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family but he s soon to leave Korea and so suggests that Ki Woo take over Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki jeong on Photoshop Ki Woo successfully applies for the job The Park family father Dong ik mother Yeon gyo daughter Da hye and son Da song welcomes Ki woo into their lavish home and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park s current domestic staff and take their places However it doesn t take long before things start to go very very awry for both families in ways none of them or the audience could ever have imagined Obviously enough Bong s main themes are class division and class conflict the artificiality of societal hierarchy and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place As thoroughly entertaining and funny as the film is it remains in essence an economic treatise albeit with a savagely satirical quality However make no mistake this is a satire with teeth the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and completely bonkers third act ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that s about as different from the film s early scenes as you could imagine Of course this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class but never before has he been this caustic this acerbic but so too this compassionate this witty Indeed Parasite feels like a culmination the film to which he s been building for his entire career One of the most deftly handled elements of the film is Bong s avoidance of the clich s one so often finds in films dealing with economics the Kims are by no means the default protagonists a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists a callous family immediately worthy of scorn Rather the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels Indeed it s the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle all four Kims start to carry themselves differently as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect There are no heroes and villains here Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren t the norm in the real world For all their scheming and lying the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier As for the Parks their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance nothing more At the same time the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame to the best of my recollection we never see the four Parks together in the same shot It s a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect It s in relation to the two family s status as heroes or villains that the film s title is so important A parasitic organism lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts with the Kims feeding off the Parks wealth and status However in a film where nothing is as it seems things aren t that simple Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well they ve been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working class employees i e they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants And so just as the Kims feed off the Parks the Parks feed off the Kims in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship However as strong as the film is narratively and thematically it also has an aesthetic design to die for s cinematography for example is magnificent Hong also shot the superb and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness gliding through the Parks house like it s a fifth member of the Kim family s production design is also praise worthy with the Kims and Parks living conditions contrasted in every way the Parks live in a pristine post modernist semi open plan house accessible only by an electronically controlled gate and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs the Kims on the other hand live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley It s also in relation to production design wherein one of the film s best metaphors is to be found which is also a great example of just how completely Bong is in control of his craft As a film at least partly in the tradition of the upstairs downstairs subgenre Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs mirroring their inability to rise in a socio economic sense On the other hand the Parks lavish home has two main stairways one going up the other going down into the cellar As Ki jeong and Ki woo gain more access to Da song and Da hye they start to spend most of their time upstairs Ki taek and Chung sook however along with Dong ik and Yeon gyo spend most of their time downstairs indicating a fissure between the adults and their children The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal with Bong shooting it like he s suddenly directing a horror film there s a thematic reason for this that I can t go into without spoilers In this way he bestows upon it an ominousness that at first makes little sense but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing There s also a third stairway in the Park home one not revealed until late in the second act but one which will have huge narrative and thematic importance Parasite is a masterpiece with Bong operating at the peak of his abilities never putting a foot wrong It could have been a self serving and didactic message movie a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich but Bong is far too talented for that allowing the film to find its own space Quite unlike anything I ve ever seen it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy and so on This is cinema as art a film which has proven itself very much a game changer and completely deserving of every bit of praise it s received,9.0,6.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5498253/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2019,A collectivist propaganda,Before watching this film I wondered and strongly believed that the title Parasite referred to Kims family an obvious choice for them being the ones feeding on their host and rich family But the hopeful ending for Kims made me realize that Bong Joon Ho does not see Kims as villains He imagined this movie as a class warfare And like any war this one had the winner too the Kim family Apparently for Bong this movie is about the shortcomings of late capitalism And I am here thinking how is capitalism the villain in a story of a murderous cheating fraudulent family of Kims who decide to get rich at the expense of others i e work in a non capitalistic way But in a world where socialism is on the rise where the poor demand the rich to pay for their living because why not where an individual is responsible for everyone else but himself herself this movie is the type of crap that would sell,1.0,56.0,148.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5292256/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2020,class warfare,The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment The son Ki woo gets a job tutoring a young girl Using a series of lies each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with It s frustrating to sit through It took a couple of tries I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style This family is just annoying Pizza girl should never hire them for anything It does get better There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues I would prefer the driver to be less horny He needs to be a complete saint In fact the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws Also they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues The twist is unforeseen That s mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that I do like the smell aspect It s foreshadowed well and has a great build up There are scenes which I can almost smell This is a very compelling statement about class in society,7.0,20.0,59.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5379777/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,it's my own perspectives,parasite A parasite is a living organism that receives nutrients from the host body And parasites are not good for the host body What if two parasite organisms come together in one host body this is what the Bong joon Ho put forward to us the main theme of film is Characteristics of Human Beings Changing their circumstances Reality is that after all more than half the species on Earth are parasites and most organisms are host to a number of them kim ki taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family members the only family income is Proceeds from pizza cover making One evening at dinner a friend of Kim Ki woo s Kim Ki woo is Ki Taek s son came to visit ki woo and he gifted his grandfather s a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to ki woo Ki woo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job and then he starts teaching Mr and Mrs Park s daughter in their home permanently da hye fall in love with ki woo Mrs Park s son da song He is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawing Ki woo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist But really she s not one of these and she also enters the house Kim ki taek tells his family rich people are realy gullible The two Kims plan to dismantle Mr Park s driver and appoint their father as the driver and then the entire Kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper Kim s wife comes to the house of the park s housekeeper and they all continue to work It is here that the name of the film becomes a make sense Kim s family life goes well in that house One day Mr Park s family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his son s birthday Kim s family gathers at Mr Park s house that night unbeknownst to Park Suddenly the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course That night everyone in the house changes their lives If I say anything more about this movie it will affect the enjoyment of the film Bong joon ho was able to make the screenplay of the film nuancly crafted Everything that comes out of this movie is interconnected even a stone Kang ho song s performance as ki taek is subtle The acting of kang s physically and mentally embracing the mannerism of the character is commendable The storyline which goes on as usual is as terrifying as it gets near the end of the story The director was able to intensify all the situations in the film and he is worthy of applause example Ki taek tells to Mrs park that your house keeper has TB the housekeeper takes a coughing when Ki taek and Mrs park steps up the stairs then the camera focus toward Mrs park s face The director edits those scenes into Slowmotion,8.0,9.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5446403/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2019,"At times amusing, overall insufferable, annoying",This is one of those movies from a director who has done some interesting movies before which gets a gigantically good rating and seems the overall most well produced but is on the whole boring or insufferable even while at times amusing or properly tragic The story has elements of crude metaphor of course and shows characters who at first seemed to behave with magical skill later behave pointlessly and foolishly to get to a dramatic enough finale,0.0,34.0,83.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5152376/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,Better late than never... Parasite is as brilliant as I've been told. One of 2019's best.,If you enjoy reading my Spoiler Free reviews please follow my blog Yes I know I m late as hell I don t really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can t really write anything new Nevertheless I ll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer but I kept delaying it underestimating my time So no I m not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars I always planned on it In addition to that yes I also love it like most people and no I m not writing this because I m following the pack Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019 s best films and it s definitely cracking a spot in my Top10 I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja and I m a massive fan of Snowpiercer Therefore this isn t just another South Korean flick It s directed and co written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917 I m more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture and what a film to do it It can be described as a dark dramedy but I think social satire is more adequate The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on screen exclusively through visuals There s so little exposition which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019 s best screenplays The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect Throughout the runtime Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor s face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions which will explain its actions later on There s a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months It s raining and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from The gorgeous cinematography the unforgettable musical score the seamless editing Everything about this sequence is technically flawless and it carries such an emotionally powerful message Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others It s a movie that balances a lot of tones In ten minutes the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy and it all feels incredibly realistic That s one of my major compliments to Parasite I never felt like it was fiction I never thought this is too much this would never occur Even in the third act where the narrative takes some bold decisions everything makes sense with what had been shown until then From shocking character actions to surprising plot points Bong and Han Jin won s screenplay is excellent Everyone in the cast is fantastic but Song Kang ho is the standout in my opinion His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant I m actually surprised he wasn t nominated for Best Actor in more award shows I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me It s tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with myself included Technically I don t have any defects to point out It s one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws I m in love with the score I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography and the editing is perfect Whatever genre the story decides to go to it s always entertaining and extremely captivating Its comedy is very smart and it made me laugh a lot of times Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory it s more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre s flicks nowadays All in all Parasite genuinely surprised me With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level my expectations were very moderate Nevertheless I love it as much or more as everyone else I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion rating but I would never love a movie because I should or because other people do It deserves every award it received especially the ones concerning the screenplay It s one of the best original stories of the last few years and it s written in such a brilliant manner with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime and the various tones are balanced seamlessly Technically flawless cinematography score editing everything s absolutely perfect Nothing is placed without purpose Not a single line of dialogue is wasted Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it He truly put his heart and soul into this and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it s in a foreign language Please don t make such an awful mistake Rating

12 January 2020,Sadistic comedy and brilliant tragedy all bundled up into the best film of 2019.,There I said it It s the best film of the year for this reviewer and it s the best film Bong Jong ho has made to date But to be fair I ve yet to see The Irishman 1917 and A Hidden Life so my opinion could change Though I can t see that being likely The originalness of Parasite is what sets it apart Parasite twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone There s ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon ho frequently uses You observe it in his other films Snowpiercer Okja and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon ho s horror film The Host Which also starred Kang ho Song who plays Kevin s father in Parasite He s hilariously witty in both films Parasite set in South Korea is about a young man from an impoverished family the Kims who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family the Parks He changes his name from Kim Ki woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks and the family makes it their plan to do so The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families When we see the wealthy Park family the house is pristinely clean A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city If you like dark comedies then you re sure to enjoy Parasite I ve witnessed people who don t like foreign films because of subtitle hatred still relish this film You won t see another movie like Parasite perhaps ever Well done Bong Joon ho,9.0,21.0,34.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5403301/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,Good but not worth best picture,So I finally watched Parasite While the film was not bad and had a different view on social disparity between rich and poor I still think that this film did not deserve to win best picture at the Oscars For a best picture type of film I expect more Top visuals scenery camera sound effects music mixing wardrobe and of course great actors and a really great story While those actors weren t especially bad they were not great either Especially the rich woman acted over the top Now the story For me this story was unfolding to easy too cheap At the start of the movie the poor family is depicted as lazy and especially the parents seem to have bad manors There are those kind of poor people that got hit hard by economy and try to work their way up again And there are those that just live on the money of others and are not willing to work hard themselves The family in Parasite falls into the second category They are not even able to fold pizza card boxes correctly Nor do they care to present good work results or make a good impression to keep their jobs Yet this same family is able to get jobs at a rich familiy s home and those rich people the father is a business man so not a dumb person aren t suspicious or realize that they are impostors the lazy woman from the start now runs the whole household as a maid Nor do they ask their rich friends or business partners if they know someone for a driver s or a maid s job Nope they just pick the first one that someone unknown recommends that worked for them for just a few hours The worst about the story I could not sympathise with the poor family in the end It was not like Yeah they were treated unfair by society and had to live a poor live in the basement they deserve better In contrary Especially when they found out that the former maid has hidden her husband in the basement for several years this parasite family does not connect with those people They don t treat them better like they were treated before by richer people They instead want to call the police And when the former maid finds out that this family are impostors she also does not connect with them but tries to blackmail them So the morale of the story is Poor people are as bad as rich people and treat their kind with disrespect as well In the end I had more sympathy with the rich family than with any of those impostors It wasn t a story about from dish washer to millionaire It was a story about an unlikable criminal family that in the end had no redeeming factors at all,6.0,6.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8158525/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2020,"Fairly entertaining film, but one of 2019's best it is not",Okay so these slightly over two hours are Parasite or Gisaengchung the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of This is one of the biggest players this awards season also in North America and that I find really surprising It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d Or at Cannes earlier this year I guess it helps that director Bong Joon ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now Anyway people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film I don t think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations It is decent maybe good nothing more This is the story of a really poor family unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence the son s friend manages to sneak in at a rich family s house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related You can argue to what extent it is despicable what they are doing because obviously how they remove the limo driver and the maid is really full of intrigue Still sometimes I struggled with how realistic it all felt I mean that it did not For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion And there are more moments like this It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually which is what one man does to the other near the film s end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him so if he should have attacked anybody then I d say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody especially the protagonist s family And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home Still there are funny moments too After all this film calls itself a satire The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong but it was hilarious especially when all except the dad get out but then the rich family s son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room but they don t see him Don t suspect anything But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man s smell So they are definitely on the shallow side when they think their employees are not nearby The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again I also wondered why they did I mean I can see why they opened the door but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her which of course would not have been possible but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario Okay what else can I say about this film let me think The three younger women were all really stunning Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction but I would not agree with that at all The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer but this is hardly a criterion I d say It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least Key subjects like religion absolution betting sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino s Scorsese s is roughly on par with Parasite So to sum it all up a few more words on Parasite It has a really nice almost sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys and their kids in order to experience wealth for years to come They are ruthless but are they criminals Up to you to decide and it is all subjective Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don t do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home but later on they are ready to attack him So yes it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much also for the cast or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here the father I think Still go see this one just don t go in it with great expectations I give it a thumbs up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes

20 August 2019,Another very educational movie.,Problem with Bong s movies is that they have very strong message Snowpiercer Okja and now Parasite Problem is that they re Bong s perspectives And he wants to shove it down the audience s throat And it s again apparent in this movie It s painfully clear what he s trying to say in this movie so apparent that it s immature He s almost telling you what to feel and think at each moment And this trend in movies thesedays troubles me In the old days movies just told a story And what each audience takes away are all their own and mostly different What someone got out of Rocky was different that someone else Now it s all telling you what to feel and what to think And this trend is evident in games as well Before you had to explore and use creativity to solve puzzles and quests Now the games all tell you where to go and what to do People are getting dumber and dumber thanks to these type of games and movies It s actually opposite of what this movie is trying to say,8.0,54.0,143.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5070858/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2020,Absolute work of art,As director Bong Joon ho said during his Golden Globe speech after winning best foreign film for parasite Once you overcome the one inch tall barriers of subtitles you will be introduced to so many more amazing films and I am so happy I did Having heard only good things about the movie I expected a lot but it still exceeded my expectations tenfold Firstly the writing is incredible What seems to be quite a simple story about a family commiting fraud and deceipt to escape poverty changes throughout the numerous twist and turns into something very unexpected interesting and absolutely brilliant The pacing is on point and from start to finish the film takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions including but not limited to sadness a feeling of well deserved success hapiness guilt unease discomfort and fear Secondly the score is fantastic and greatly accentuates these different feelings into something more For example the many intense and thrilling scenes are strengthened into a crippling suspense that leaves you unable to lose focus and calm down Finally the ending is absolutely wonderful although it also houses about the only critisism I have for this movie After about half of the film I found myself wondering how on earth they were going to be able to pull of the ending but they did and it was not what I expected Some of the decisions the characters make in the final act seems a bit out of left field and takes them in directions that doesn t neccesarily feel right I do however think that s the point and it brings a very intriguing point about the movie s theme into question In short Parasite is nothing short of a masterpiece,10.0,9.0,16.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5387673/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2020,"A versatile, metamorphic thrillride",Parasite seizes our expectations breaks them down builds them up and knocks them down once more This Korean masterclass assumes no clear genre refusing to pigeonhole its ambition Straddling the line between comedy thriller and horror the production presents the conceptual parasite as the underlying motif it s a profound tragic social commentary on classism as much as it is a satirical sardonic throwaway remark on a parasite and its host Decorated with multidimensional metaphors signs and symbols it would be criminal to not have a second or even third viewing to fully soak up Bong Joo ho s flavoursome visual poetry Should you laugh or cry Take sides or simply observe the events unfold In taking no clear stance does this movie most thrive In stirring and string pulling every capacity of human emotion while dodging the clich s does it tantalise the audience like few other productions have While slow in places and with an occasional plothole this was overall a gorgeously shot satisfyingly unpredictable slice of thoughtful motion picture entertainment presenting a particularly dark blend of black comedy 8 4 10,8.0,4.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5490522/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2019,The Best Bong Joon Ho Movie So Far?,A common factor between movie director greats such as Kubrick Hitchcock Wes Anderson Tarantino and more are that they tend to make movies so unique that you cannot just categorize it into just one genre Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling powerful characters and unexpected twists this is the director I go to The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer one of the best sci fi movies that is more than just a typical sci fi movie and Okja among the best Netflix movies ever but those are memories I cherish Move along you two because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society especially how we perceive the rich and poor The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family s daughter That became a domino effect as one by one each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems I ll stop here as if I continue on I will spoil the story It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing Parasite just like other Bong movies crosses over different genres with relative ease It is a black comedy a satire and a thriller all in one To call it a Family Tragicomedy as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth It is not a tragedy It is not a comedy It is not even an amazing piece of art No it s a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make As for the other elements the acting is sublime the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie In conclusion I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d Or because after seeing it I had nothing but praises for the movie Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so Do not miss this movie at all and bring along a cup of dry ram don with optional sirloin steak if you need to Watched the movie at Cathay Cineleisure 2 July 2019,10.0,44.0,82.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4972422/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,Over hyped,To begin with I m not a fan of Bong Joon ho I discover this almost by accident because I had no idea that he was behind Snowpiercer and the Netflix produced Okja I couldn t get through the first one and I fell asleep during the second I gave this one a shot even though I knew that hyped movies are not my cup of tea They seem to be self reliant on the hype they generate that somehow should be enough to reassure us they ll leave us with an unforgettable memory So while this movie isn t bad and technically well made is far from unforgettable It s heavy handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage less plausible A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon who Bong Joon ho seems to be definitely indebted to A movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence To quote Calvino What many consider to be the vitality of the times noisy aggressive revving and roaring belongs to the realm of death like a cemetery for rusty old cars,5.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5913828/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2020,Questions,There s been some anger over this movie winning an Academy Award It s hard for me to judge if a movie deserves to be considered the best film of the year because the majority of movies that I love always end up being Italian end of the world movies or Mexican ripoffs of American horror tropes Who am I to judge quality I asked into the abyss ignorant of the fact that I ve created an entire site where I do exactly that The idea for Parasite comes from Bong s own experience he was a tutor for a wealthy family and imagined what it would be like to infiltrate their life The title which the director argued for has a dual meaning Sure the poor servants are living off of the rich but the masters are living off the labor class They ve lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves Everyone is a parasite in their own way Instead of taking an existing home the house was specially made for the film That s because each character has a place that belongs to them and another place that is secret to them Boon also spent considerable time storyboarding the entire film as he believes that he must be ready for everything before the cameras start capturing footage There s a phrase in South Korea called Hell Joseon It means many things unemployment economic inequality excessive work hours the fact that poverty is inescapable for the lower class and that the system is rigged for the rich but it generally means that life is hellish and hopeless This is not a phrase that is unique to South Korea What spoke most to me is that the history of the world major battles and the plight of Native Americans have been reduce to party table formations and the hobbies of disconnected children The poor have been reduced to at best slave labor and at worst ghosts A ghost that appears to ruin the illusion that money and status seems to afford but any man no matter his station can ruin and end the life of another I ve always realized that no matter how good or bad your life is there are always people with a status above and below you But I ll lean in and show you my hand If there is any group that I m prejudiced against it s the rich Yet it s hard to be for the family in this movie as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away There is no escape for any of the Kim family The ways that they try to defeat the system through their attempts at grifting But the system was built by people with far less scruples and morals The home that promise luxury is also a prison offering none of the comforts that Ki taek dreams of only a place to sneak out of at night and take his own life in his hands just to steal food At the end of the film I felt worry for each character and knew they were all doomed in their own way They are all trapped whether by death or hope or the house itself No one gets a happy ending even if we wished for one to come true Is having hope in the midst of Hell Joseon worth it I d like to think so even as this film doesn t Is it the best film of the year Is it worth the hype Is it worth watching I can t answer the first two questions but definitely can say yes to the third It takes time to get to the point when the staircase to the basement is revealed but the movie had me from that moment It did make me think as all good movies should Is everyone a parasite unable to function alone in this world Should a father s pride come in the way of his freedom Should children be overindulged How crazy is Morse code These are the real questions I had,6.0,7.0,17.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5496174/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2020,Revenge of the Noble Savages,I gave this film two stars because although the story is garbage it s beautifully filmed and the set design is absolutely brilliant Kudos to the cinematographer and the set design people That being said I found the story to be trite boring predicable and disappointing Caution spoilers follow The plot is nonsensical the characters are clich s and I m not sure I understand the message the filmmakers are trying to convey Is the film trying to illustrate the shallow banality and institutionalized cruelty of the wealthy class and the devastating plight of the word s poorest folks Those points are well illustrated by the flood the rich husband s treatment of his employees etc but beyond that the plot settles into your standard formulaic series of predictable events portraying the poor family as stupid rage filled murderous half wit psychopaths Are the filmmakers trying to say that their murderous rage is justified or that poor people are just too stupid to understand the consequences of their actions The poor family in the story are criminals but they go about their criminal activity with all the calculation of an 8 year old They are buffoons whose undoing follows a series of bad decisions cons and assaults that are carried out with no forethought whatsoever This idea so popular among the entertainment elites that the rich are horrible people excluding themselves of course and that the poor are noble savages seems to inform an awful lot of character motivation and plot development It s a common trope here in Hollywood and I guess their overseas counterparts have learned from the best If Hollywood has taught us anything it s that stereotypes and recycled stories are what the public wants After all filmmakers usually don t portray life as it really is rather they portray life as imagined by a privileged elite who write and produce this nonsense From their perspective inside the bubble Hollywood has spent billions of dollars over the years to bring us clich d tropes such as The hooker with a heart of gold who by the story s end will be rescued by a rich handsome millionaire and The wise world weary black sidekick who guides the white protagonist and serves as his conscience but who sadly must die near the end of the film and The white savior schoolteacher who is determined to make a difference and ultimately is able to reach her students through a combination of white lady tough love mime work hip hop and interpretive dance transforming a ragtag bunch of inner city HOC Hoodlums of Color into Rhodes scholars Maybe filmmakers outside the US have learned from the pros and maybe they got it right judging from the number of folks who rated this film highly and the fact that it won the Best Picture award On some level I find this film offensive and am disappointed that so many have jumped on the bandwagon and rated it highly Having personally known many wealthy people and many poor people I cannot reach the filmmaker s conclusion that the rich are cruel and indifferent and the poor are stupid and violent I ve also unfortunately personally known several murderers They were cold unfeeling sociopaths and when you looked into their eyes you saw an abyss Nobody home But they were not motivated by righteous outrage at an unjust system None of them were poor They weren t rich either From a socioeconomic perspective all the murderers I ve known were people who had decent jobs plenty to eat new clothes cell phones access to credit all of them were white and people they murdered were from socioeconomic backgrounds almost exactly like their own I watched this film to see if it lived up to its hype Sadly it turned out to be just one more piece of garbage no better than most of the junk made in Hollywood What a waste of time,2.0,5.0,8.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5637303/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2019,"Suspenseful, but...",Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong who also directed Snowpiercer Okja and most brilliantly Mother Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films which is saying a lot You never know where the story is headed so there s a lot of suspense throughout the film At first you re given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty Their wifi doesn t work their basement dwelling gets flooded and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists That s actually one of the things that bothers me about the film All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did Poverty isn t enough Even so the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour After that a curveball is thrown at them as well as us the audience And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset I m sorry to point this out again but it gets irksome I expected more from the director of the masterpiece Mother That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous Despite all my criticisms Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety,7.0,16.0,31.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5084616/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2019,Innovative but messy and over-the-top,9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d Or What have we here A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots Nois I ll make sure I pay close attention to this one As expected this film is good However it could have easily been bad if not for the brilliant cinematography strong directorial sense and most of all thought provoking messages and philosophies that don t hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society However you aren t here to see me laud you want to know why I don t hold it in as high regards as everyone else The film feels messy Although the comedy is often effective I don t think it fits well enough in this context The story is innovative though it does feel familiar in certain parts The sudden mood changes aren t my cup of tea as well A lot of the plot points are just too over the top They can be distracting They can be too weird especially regarding the climax ending you ll know what I mean There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end or maybe I need more time to think about them who knows Lastly the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers At the end of the day I ll still highly recommend this film because after all it is a good film and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture But I m still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much I guess I m not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7 10 rating for The Handmaiden but this is open to change and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me I may learn to like it much more than I do,7.0,80.0,212.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4949036/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,Tonal tightrope.,Parasite 2019 like many South Korean efforts I ve seen essentially starts out as one thing and ends up another constantly tightrope walking a razor thin tonal line Indeed this balance between light and dark is probably its best aspect The piece delivers moments of humour alongside moments of horror each as genuine as the other It s always entertaining whether comedic or unsettling and it s very well made to boot Interestingly the focal family aren t really all that empathetic once they start taking things a little too far attempting to usurp the innocent and hard working staff of the rich family they re scamming This isn t really detrimental though It s a distinct decision meant to keep us questioning who is really in the right no matter whose perspective we re in What it also does however is somewhat dampen the impact of the picture s proposed theme Its comments on class perhaps don t quite come full circle at least not in the way you d expect Another issue is the fact that the initial protagonist sort of gets lost once his family moves further into the picture but this isn t detrimental as the flick plays out in an ensemble fashion and the initial lead still gets a decent amount to do Each member of the focal family has a decisive personality and their dynamic is believable For me the movie s second half marked by its biggest tonal shift isn t necessarily as successful as the first despite it being the real beginning according to director Bong Joon Ho Of course the film is always compelling It s astutely crafted too Despite a few issues it s an entertaining experience throughout It s fantastic 9 10,9.0,5.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476209/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,Brilliant!,I didn t know what to expect nor did I have any expectations This is brilliantly written acted and directed The viewer gets sucked into thinking it s a comedy then there are subtle messages in the beginning that turn dark then the entire scenario changes and it s nothing like you expected I love when a movie takes you to places you didn t see coming and this does exactly that I haven t seen anything like this in a very long time and this will be a classic It deserves all the awards and acclaim Just brilliant,10.0,7.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5487478/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,A tad underwhelming.,A down on their luck low class family con their way into the employ of a rich household but events turn sinister after they find a secret in the basement Maybe I ve just seen too many really messed up movies from the far East but at the half way point of Parasite which sees the discovery of a hidden bunker and an unexpected inhabitant lurking within I hoped that matters would get seriously twisted in the way that only Asian cinema can but while things certainly get dark the film is not nearly as edgy or as bizarre or as wild as the premise suggests The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon ho there are some superbly executed scenes of tension the performances are great the cinematography is lovely and the film s social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity Restrained and incredibly drawn out Bong Joon ho letting too many scenes drag their heels with the ending taking an eternity to arrive In short definitely worth a watch but a serious contender for best picture Surely not,7.0,14.0,42.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5433966/?ref_=tt_urv

Nothing new.,Social satire retread that brought nothing new to the topic It seems to have brought the topic back to the basics and to the beginning again and that leaves me feeling as if we haven t learned anything Maybe that is the ultimate point class warfare is neverending Heavy handed storytelling with moments of what I m assuming are to be nuggets of wisdom giving insight to motivations in the class struggle This has been done better and done with more thoughtfulness,4.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5677254/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,Myth of meritocracy under a looking glass,The responses this film draws are often a study of internalized propaganda specifically the smoke screen of meritocracy that attempts to cover the systemic injustices of the world The common thread is to object to the impoverished characters as being portrayed as too capable the If you re so smart why aren t you rich saying being an epitome of this mindset It s a saying that you could hear in a schoolyard because it betrays a childish level of understanding or lack thereof not considering unearned wealth transfer not considering the disparity of opportunities and not considering that the wealth gap is particularly large in South Korea It s unclear how many people who are willingly ignorant about injustice can be reached at all but art like this film must help at the very least by sustaining a discussion of the topic of injustice and inequality,8.0,12.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476350/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2023,"Good, but not wonderful.",I had to leave a comment because I have no idea how this movie received an 8 5 rating 6 range at best As far as Korean masterpieces go I thought The Handmaiden and The Housemaid were far better stories about class The script had tremendous ideas and I was looking forward to them and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot It felt very messy There were scenes that had no follow up or no point Like they had to fill a plot hole last minute If hours of this film were cut that would make sense It felt like it couldn t decide if it wanted to be a dark drama or a dark comedy If it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy you went too far if you wanted to be a intense drama you really dropped the ball It felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe The more I think about it the less respect I seem to have for its artistic merrit Absolutely Overrated As I m reading throught the miles of reviews I m convinced these are westerners who just started watching foreign films this year or they re all paid The common theme is people seem to think they are incredibly intelligent for having watched this Another reviewer commented this is the SAME exact plot as Married with Children even down to Chicago Illinois being a factor Just blew my mind and now I have even less respect for the script,6.0,5.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9050580/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2021,A very funny film about corruption of the soul,Being a Korean language film was not the only reason Bong Joon ho s Parasite was an unlikely multiple Oscar winner it s also unusually dark A vicious black comedy it tells the story of an impoverished family who think they ve found a meal ticket for life when they manage to displace the servants of a gullable rich one but it turns out they re not the only desparate people in town Everyone can enjoy its ingenious plot and wonderful sense of aesthetic but at heart this is a serious film about how both wealth and poverty corrupt the soul As such it has no heroes and its victims are either not innocent or if they are have no right to be There s no question it deserved it s awards,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7599489/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2020,I'm baffled by the over the top praise.,The film is interesting but that s about it The first hour was really slow the whole class thing seemed quite familiar I m not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to see the light Anyway the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives Overall I m more critical of the critics than of the film I recommend seeing this it s worth a look but all the Oscars and best film of the decade stuff is incomprehensible,6.0,11.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5494808/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2020,It's Baby's First Social Commentary! But Give Those Who Rave About It Some Slack,This movie strongly reminded me of several different things as I watched it the first was American Beauty A film with a strong experiential component that is not matched by its actual message or literary value and as such overrated in the moment and forgotten with time Parasite is a very well composed and executed film in terms of emotional engagement with the story and characters it gets you all dressed up and it s easy to feel as if you must have had somewhere to go But you didn t The second was Let the Right One In That was a good movie that was basically rated 2 stars higher than it deserved by everyone in the United States because it had subtitles Exotic and slightly more challenging to watch is easily conflated with quality by people who aren t especially self perceptive in their thinking Had Let the Right One In been in English and set in New York well the dumb and silly parts would have just seemed dumb and silly and it would have had to stand entirely on its own quality and not an imagined quality Parasite is the same way If it starred four American actors trying to get jobs as household help in LA people would be quite meh about it Actually given the nature of the plot I think most people in America currently giving it a 10 would probably be a little insulted by screwball comedy plot that simultaneously seems to fawn over its own profundity and would give it a lower rating than my 5 stars And third this movie can t help but make me think of America s original class conscious degenerately poor sitcom family the Bundys from Married with Children They even match by character the intelligent but lame son the beautiful but still poor sister who connives to get what she wants the dead eyed father crushed by life and the ball busting mother who really doesn t make anyone feel better Just like the Bundy s they re comically poor while placed in a real life setting where anyone with their talents willingness to work and lack of any significant vices means they would at worst be regular poor And probably decently well off They re also selectively stupid when required to be in order to make the plot work which seems a little more forgivable in a weekly sitcom where the writers are forced to create drama dozens and dozens of times a year but less so in a movie where they don t The writers of Married with Children were also smarter in allowing their comedy to shoot for simply being funny where here the slapstick situations lead to completely unfunny dark but still stupidly slapstick conclusions in a badly planned out gambit to give the movie meaning Reading others reviews including some of the top ones on here gives a good impression of why people liked this movie as they discuss how it opened their eyes apparently to the relationship between the rich and their servants and perhaps the rich and poor in society generally Which tells me that most of the people who really liked this film are for the most part very inexperienced in life and also not yet well read I m sure for someone with no first hand knowledge of the world and who hasn t delved into quality literature ever before this is pretty profound stuff It s easy to forget that if you re not just now crossing the starting line of life On the other hand that hardly qualifies this movie as being great If those who gave this movie a 10 are blown away by Parasite s subject matter they need only head down to their local library and begin reading 19th century English literature to get a thousand times greater picture of what it is like for the serving poor and the separation between them and the rich Victorian authors living in England included these basic facts of life out of course in their storylines without even meaning to have them signify some message and if you liked that aspect of Parasite you ll quickly find the movie put to shame in its shallow depth of portrayal on the subject In the end what we really have is a dark comedy that misses it s own setup and ends with a flailing attempt to create a message at the expense of creating a good story It won t be the first Best Picture winner to lose its luster with every passing year as people look back upon it without hype and blindness for objective quality but it at least is another to be added to the list 5 out of 10 stars,5.0,9.0,20.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5484523/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,"When the lights come on, they crawl away quickly!",After watching some good films in 2019 there were only a few that really blew me away I m a big Avengers Endgame fan but The Irishman and especially The Lighthouse really touched me And now we have Parasite by Bong Joon ho the South Korean director of The Host and Snowpiercer Parasite was the first South Korean film to win the golden palm at the Cannes Film Festival and garnered tons of good reviews Recently it also won four Academys amogst other things of course Best Picture Logically I was interested The Kim family lives on a subsistence level and takes every opportunity to improve their situation How fitting that one day the son receives an offer to help a wealthy family The less you know about Parasite the better Nevertheless I try to rate the film as best as possible without giving anything away What is the best way to describe parasite It s not easy because the genre of the film alone is not easy to grasp The film works here and there as a satire can surprise with some really funny moments but also has very metaphorical scenes and then suddenly becomes scary and exciting And that s all an understatement Parasite always surprised me In a moment you suspect you know what kind of film it is but then there is the first twist and then the next and I was always surprised Few films can do that Joon ho stages a masterful socially critical film that works on so many levels The visual level for example is fantastic Parasite works with grotesque but nevertheless appropriate exaggerations which sometimes are difficult to bear in terms of their message and strength The name of the film gives a wonderful hint of what to expect All actors are fabulous and deserve the greatest recognition because it is not just the terrific script or the equally fabulous direction that make Parasite so effective I especially liked Song Kang ho as father of the Kims Technically Parasite offers creative and sometimes breathtaking camera settings Some spectacular sets were built for the film such as the Kims family home The editing is great and Jeong Jae il s score was also wonderfully integrated into the visuals everything just fits here Conclusion You have to see Parasite It is one of those films that certainly offers something for everyone but at the same time brings with it so much intelligence and strength that I am amazed and happy at the same time that this South Korean work is so well received by the audience Without a doubt one of the best films of 2019 A masterpiece a must see and in a way also an important film I think Terrific,10.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5490883/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2020,Modern day parable,This film starts out like a comedy but gets pretty dark I can definitely see Bong s signature style that we can also see in Snowpiercer especially the social satire Both of the families in this film have their own issues that really come out The main point is the overall setting portrayed visually through the architecture Everyone is trapped by the class system and cannot escape except by ruthlessly attacking each other for what amounts to not much in the end,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5890065/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,Masterpiece,Parasite is if not the best definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019 The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible Both the cinematographer Kyung pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts These three aspects together result in one of the most eye grabbing movies of the decade Every shot is at the same time beautiful and meaningful to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film Bong Joon ho and Han Jin won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny interesting sarcastic sad and verisimilar The movie shows the difference between classes like Roma 2018 but has the rhythm and its core similar to Get Out 2017 Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay none of the characters is a villain or a hero The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones The acting by all the main cast is sublime but the highlights are Kang ho Song and Yeo jeong Jo Kang ho plays Kim Ki taek father of the Kim family He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie making his character s arc of development the most interesting of the film Yeo jeong plays Yeon gyo mother of the Park family She is the complete opposite of Ki taek she s naive and has and seemingly has always had an easy life She s clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family Last but definitely not least the music It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen It has hints of suspense comedy and even horror Parasite 2019 is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and most certainly deserves a watch It s eye grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch but is also very dense and insightful providing a vision of how things work that s not usually shown in the mainstream content,9.0,14.0,22.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5434260/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2020,A Solid Metaphor Film,Let me say right away here that Parasite may very well indeed be even better than a 7 10 star film For my viewing experience there were a number of factors that may well have dampened the overall experience No matter how you slice it though Parasite is a solid metaphor film that engages both on surface and deep levels For a very basic overview this film focuses on two families in South Korea The Kims are the definition of poor living in a cramped sub street level apartment and barely scraping together enough to subside The Parks are much wealthier living in a spacious mansion and employee tutors drivers and a housekeeper Through a serious of events both fortuitous and comical all four Kims become employed in varying capacities by the Kims The juxtaposition between clans is readily apparent and brought to an even starker contrast when a momentous discovery changes defines the entire back half of the film s narrative On the surface Parasite is pretty entertaining using a multi genre approach to keep the viewer s interest While watching you will be treated to comedy drama farce seriousness etc There is never a dull moment in other words and the acting is strong throughout The subtitles only take a few minutes to get used to from an American viewer perspective and will quickly become second nature so don t let that be the reason you may shy away from this movie More importantly though Parasite is also very much a metaphor movie dealing with class structures and the fundamentals of capitalism itself I won t go into spoiler details here but there are much deeper meanings here than simply what is visually physically portrayed Multiple deeper readings viewings of the material are very easy to pick out and analyze Like I said in the opening paragraph Parasite may be objectively higher than 7 10 stars For me though it was watched during a nationwide pandemic state in which it was hard to focus on the issues these filmmakers wanted to put forth Also and this is very much a personal preference I prefer metaphor films to sneak up on me as opposed to knowing that going in With this film though the cat was out of the bag after the Academy Awards which is when it will garner the majority of its popular viewings So I knew to look for the deeper stuff from the get go and I feel like that may have influenced by overall viewing experience and perhaps not for the better So as of right now I m giving Parasite a 7 10 ranking A solid film that I enjoyed but not necessarily amongst my personal all time favorites Perhaps upon a second viewing in a different personal social climate it will climb the ranks further It certainly won t go any lower,7.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5573646/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2020,I guess I just don't get it,One Sunday night I eagerly watched the oscars hoping my favorite movie of the year once upon a time in hollywood would win several awards While it won a few I was shocked to see parasite win so many A few weeks later I decided to rent the movie and watch And after 2 hours I can say that I don t think it s all that great Let s start with the positives I enjoyed the comedy There were several bits that had me laughing They were probably not in the same spots others would usually laugh but nevertheless I thought the movie was decently funny I thought the acting was pretty good too Both sides of the family pulled off a pretty believable take on the rich and the poor But that s all I can really say I liked about the movie About halfway into the movie I turned to the person I was watching it with and told them that This movie must get pretty great within the next 45 minutes amiright I had heard so much about the many twists and turns of the movie and I can say that they re really wasn t ever a big twist for me I mean there was one That one lead to the entire 3rd act of the movie so I can t really say it was all too surprising As a person who has loved Movies since I was a mere lad I can say this wasn t anything too groundbreaking and can definitely say if it was made the same exact way expect by an American the movie would be perceived as sucky and unoriginal I really tried to enjoy this movie but I just couldn t Maybe someday I ll revisit it and see something in it,5.0,9.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5521793/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2019,Bong Joon-Ho's most uninspired film to date.,Before I attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating I must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for Bong Joon Ho s past work Snowpiercer was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was I m a huge fan of his and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d Or win He s a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it and I d say winning that award had been a long time coming for him However after my boundless anticipation for this film and finally getting the chance to actually watch it I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment I ve read many reviews of this film all of them flooded with unworthy praise Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade filled with metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns and unfolds in satisfying unexpected ways leaving the viewer wondering what s gonna happen next The former sentiment s mention of metaphors and allegories and the way they are presented in this film have been done countless times over the course of mankind s brief existence and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive There s only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a twist in the film which ultimately wasn t that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling Besides that moment everything is utterly predictable I don t understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon Ho for this film Additionally Parasite suffers from glaring screenwriting issues the most blatant one being an over reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward rather than letting it flow naturally I m not going to spoil what exactly happens but as an example there s a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story s progression Characters make uncharacteristic mistakes that are beyond the realm of believability which sacrifices the film s sense of authenticity and causes the tension to feel forced Using gimmicky writer s tricks like this can make or break a film and if anything it shows a sign of sheer laziness from everyone involved in the screenwriting process Bong Joon Ho obviously included Creativity is another criterion that I exceptionally value when judging a film and Parasite lacks in that department as well Simply put it s a perfectly capable film made by a perfectly capable director Nothing more nothing less On the absolute surface level it s a supremely entertaining movie and if you re typically non analytical and you prefer shutting your brain off before watching a movie then this might actually be a great popcorn flick for you But as far as the artistry goes there s nothing to really be had with this film Bong Joon Ho s prowess behind and in front of the camera was to be expected The performances the cinematography the quirky lines of dialogue etc But with the exception of the expected every aspect of this film is totally unchallenging and risk averse All in all I m still content with Bong Joon Ho s Palme d Or win more so for the excellence of his early work than for the film that actually got awarded Do I think there may have been some politics hidden agenda involved behind the scenes at Cannes Possibly especially considering the flak he got two years ago due to Okja and its affiliation with Netflix Regardless in the grand scheme of his filmography I d rate Parasite towards the bottom rung in his otherwise exemplary r sum And if you re curious I d rate Memories of Murder and Mother at the tippy top which shouldn t come as a surprise,6.0,30.0,49.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5159441/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2019,A quirky family comedy that transgresses into a vicious social satire on Korean class division,I just this for the second time in cinemas and I loved it just as much as the first time I cannot describe how thankful I am that this gem has been given a wide release in Australia before most countries which is a rare occurrence especially with foreign films The first time I saw this I was absolutely enthralled by it because of the unique story being presented I found it to be witty yet subversive and I had no idea where it was headed Bong Joon Ho is a director who s work that I ve seen at this point is something I greatly appreciate He always manages to pull genuinely funny comedy out of his scenes that somehow feels natural rather than jarring It doesn t diminish from the story s overall seriousness nor does it ditract from the dramatic performances of the cast especially Song Kang Ho who I have not seen give a performance that was not great yet Where the story did head completely caught me off guard but in a good way It is one of the best uses of plot escalation I have seen in a long time to the point where the film completely changes genres halfway through and it s astounding because it works so well The stylistic features change with the tone shift as well as the score becomes more tense and dramatic and the camera movement becomes more sweeping and eratic It s all so perfectly complementary to what s escalating on screen The cinematography is so good that any shot could be used as the poster and it would make good one at that The second time I saw this I payed extra attention to any hints or details that are presented which set up the escalation to come and it was a truly rewarding experience I think there s still things I won t pick up until my third or fourth viewing I absolutely adore this film and I think everyone should check it out I would even recommend it to those who confess to not liking foreign films because they have to go through the gruelling task of actually having to read what they re watching This is my favourite of 2019 so far and I would be very surprised if that changed from now,10.0,22.0,42.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5058239/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2020,Parasites linger,Parasite is a hard film to discuss not because it s one of those films that is truly horrendous but genuinely its a hard film to talk about because its one those where you cant do your research or where you can see any trailers because they would most likely spoil the outcome The hard truth is you have to go into it completely blind because its one those films that can surprise you at any turn essentially there are no words to describe this superb South Korean thriller but simply it s director Bong Joon ho This is pure Bong it s insane if you were to put it into one single genre you would a very hard to find trying to find which genre it would slot into is it a horror A thriller A crime caper A comedy Or is it just a drama It s all of them and none of them at the same time But in a way in that sense that s the way that Bong creates his cinema just for him the man has no one genre he has not one single technique in his directing style From his first film in 2000 Barking Dogs Never Bite to Memories of Murder through his monster invasion flick The Host Snowpiercer and there s even no way to describe his last film Netflix s Okja they are all him And his seventh film Parasite goes completely crazy in fact we re not sure if it s trying to be a meticulous crowd pleaser or a mindbending thriller or an Art house caper The point is where he is trying to go he does it successfully From the opening reel it ll have you intrigued and it scratch you out until you are unwillingly bridled to watch it again and again And why shouldn t you It s perfect the plot is watertight the Kim family are poor and penniless and utterly hopeless they are getting tired of their stingy underground basement apartment so the eldest son Woo shik seeks out other opportunity besides living in squalor conditions So he has a plan to work for the wealthy Park family in their stunning mansion liking what he sees he decides to bring the rest of his family along for the ride and for a while everything is going fine until the rise of an unfortunate incident And that s when everything changes Intrigued Well that s enough Because when it comes to Bong it s not the story that matters its the way his characters are written the way they delve into making new plans for the well off Park family No What the story is a about is family Now we know what you re going to say and you can refrain from that because this is the exact opposite it s about a family who have nothing then they go into everything and then they think they re doing fine until they slip And that could result in a lot of things going wrong For the first hour during the different plans you could essentially say that this is another version of The Italian Job minus the cars and Michael Caine or perhaps a mixture between Ocean s and Rififi and you d be write it s all those And much more there s no knowing how many references to old films Bong has put here But what he does in that first hour is absolutely captivating and the execution of the plans is one of a kind cinema It s a film that doesn t that doesn t really sound like it works but it does And here Bong has created a miracle of a film Joyously it couldn t have come at a better time amidst all the modern cinema redos remakes and been there done that sequels this is a real miracle and Bong has a real gem on his hands Plus naturally in crime caper when people get found out they lose everything here there s no evidence of that maybe but remember no spoilers but the Kims they just keep going until they have ruined enough of the Park family s well being There s a moment of a threat of being caught but with eager hands they soon put a stop to that The fact is Bong does nothing wrong here Parasite is a perfect water tight and captivating thriller that will put your heart on edge make you scratch your head and finally make wonder if cinema can get any better No is the answer and Bong could not have made it a better time as it will keep you going to the end reel and refuse to let go even well after the credits roll He s essentially the Korean version of the Coen brothers and there s no better compliment than that VERDICT Bong has made a miracle of a film that s a water tight crime caper thriller and dram a plus many more genres all in one film And with an unforgettable story it will keep you watching for years to come Truly cinema at its best,10.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5483159/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2019,the line between class,Bong Joon Ho has an amazing track record Memories of Murder Mother and the Host are fantastic Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good He s never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice I can say he s still going strong Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender The madman went as far as I say to making the second best movie of the year only behind the Lighthouse for me But for everyone else it s their number one and deservedly so It s just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy critic and casual viewer alike The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there s that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece changing the atmosphere themes and style in a way that makes 100 sense It s like many movies in one This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done Without spoiling too much this movie is about class And not in the obnoxious in your face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there s an obvious message of rich bad poor sad but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud that being mostly about exploring the line between class Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it s shot The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes It s done through lines in the wall one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it s being looked out of a fridge or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they re the lowest of the low in a already low shot How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene Another nice touch is where they re located the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected But how the poor view and react to other fellow poor people in a twist situation was the point where I knew this movie was genius Rather than live together they fight accomplishing nothing but a good time for the audience The performances are memorable and witty and not one dimensional each with a purpose and each one being immensely entertaining in their own way They all had a time to shine and they did with flying colors Bongs directing prowess is at an all time high as every frame and movement feels methodically thought out His gorgeous use of cinematography seamless editing and music fits so well and help flesh out the soothing chaotic and claustrophobic atmosphere tone The set design was also noticeably pleasing as it explores into the themes more I would give my interpretation on the rock but that would spoil it I have nothing more to say other than don t read much else about it and go in blind if you can 10 10,10.0,15.0,24.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5311162/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2020,A Truly Remarkable Work of Cinema,With a fantastic cast fabulous sense of direction and a truly wild sense of storytelling Parasite checks all the right boxes for a best picture winner and proves to be something truly new by also relying on things found familiar The main cast is truly spectacular with Kang Ho Song and Cho Yeo jeong providing for the best of the supporting performances The dialogue is rich and relatable and the humor in the film is well executed and surprisingly often The film s pacing is by far one of its most brilliant remarks with you never truly feeling bored throughout the almost 2 and a half hour runtime and thoroughly entertained without The film simply never stops it doesn t shy away from different styles and genres of storytelling but embraces them as one story and does it so cleanly it truly is quite impressive The cinematography is outstanding with some truly beautiful visuals and captivating points of view Though there are many interesting twists and turns that you may never truly see coming the film can be a bit predictable at times with certain situations and makes the film seem slightly less special in doing so In the end however Parasite is yet another brilliant work from Director Bong Joon Ho and is one of if not the best work he has made to date My Rating 9 75 10,10.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5533278/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,Artsy South Korean Black Comedy Thriller That is Well Done,The scene where the old maid arrives in the video at the door after the doorbell ring was so creepy and I loved the scene where the family is getting drunk and talking around the table after dinner The montage with the peach was also masterful as was the way many scenes were filmed styled and handled I loved how the old maid also got them on cell phone video proving they were all a family and knew each other and then blackmailed them temporarily The young Kim family sister is an extremely talented actress and so is the Parks pampered wife The other actors were all solid as well The story is universal and pop cultured so it is relevant and easy to follow for all languages and nationalities The movie is never uninteresting Even when it slows down a little in its final half hour or so it remains intriguing but this is the only part that I felt that could have been a little bit better I also had some questions about the incident at the Parks outdoor birthday party regarding why something happened the way it did The suspense really worked also outside of the mentioned scenes and the humor was usually landing The artsy shots and creative decisions all worked within the story This is a solid movie for 2019 and deserves the Oscars,7.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5482434/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2019,A dumb bunch of Marxist propaganda,Parasite directed by Joon Ho Bong director of the excellent character study Memories of Murder received an about 8 minutes long standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival It also seems to be widely known now as a masterpiece a term that flows easily these days However the truth is that it is simply a mediocrity and the only reason this acclaim is received seems to be for the fact that it appeals to Marxist nut jobs because it deems poor people to be superior to rich people Now Bong doesn t depict our four protagonists as angels On the contrary they are scheming immoral disgusting conniving backstabbing low lifes but the salient issue here is the fact that especially in the later phases of the film Bong wants the audience to feel pity for these four morons Of course our poor heroes manage to scheme into a rich household in an extremely absurd easy matter made even easier by the gullible nature of the rich Herein lies another problem Standard human behavior is altered in order to fit Bong s sociological narrative meaning that the rich man woman are indeed too stupid to figure out anything whereas a bunch of lazy criminal nut jobs who can t even fold a pizza box properly are genius in their scheming It makes no logical sense and suspension of disbelief can be a good thing but not when it is made for a ham fisted social message That s simply a lack of creativity in writing There s also of course the far fetched plot points such as the secret door behind the bookcase That nobody in the house has figured that out in four years is really something that stretches beyond suspension of disbelief and the fact that someone was down there all the time is even dumber not to mention the revelation near the end when the dad takes the guys s place They re not exactly plot holes but they are illogicalities that are another result of the very poor screenplay In the technical aspects Parasite doesn t disappoint as much as the photography is adequate coupled with an excellent score generally good cinematography Thus it is alright to look at but it is impossible to overlook the glaring holes in the substantial aspects The acting is good for the most part especially by the rich wife who was however a completely idiotic and unbelievable hysterical character further decreasing the subtleties between the depiction of the classes In the end Parasite was created as a depiction of class struggle and while it does show the poor people as wicked creatures Bong nonetheless deems it necessary with his narrative that we as an audience should care for them even though they deserve every single evil they can get We as the audience are supposed to judge based on class distinction which people are good and which people are bad as opposed to something like character development which generally is the more important thing,6.0,12.0,29.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5286735/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2020,Not as good as they said,The Kim family who are the main characters are not likable at all and greedy too They do things very irrationally The first half is quite empty and a bit boring The park family are so gullible too but they are much more likable as the say the bad guys Mr Kim the father his character got the most problem as the father he didn t make good decisions for the family He decisions are really bad They got a young man fired they don t care if he s poor and miserable as they are They only think about themselves selfish They found out about the maid s secret but instead of negotiating something They chose to fight all over the place Mrs Kim the mother is heartless too she pushed the poor maid down the stairs which ultimately ended her life and then they tied them up in the bunker wounded no food and they go on to live their lives normally And they expect to find them alive in the following morning And what s up with that rock I thought it was going to be used for something important but no it was there all this time so that it would used to smashed the son s head lol The party is where everything goes wrong When the bunker guy show up and stab the kim sister and looking to kill the mother it wasn t Mr Kim s problem at that time his mind was totally on Mr park and helping his family comes second I guess he went ahead and stab Mr Park even though he employed him and pay him good money He then left his bleeding daughter and son and his wounded wife to go hide in the bunker Gimme a break the behavior of the Kim family can t be excused because they re just poor Poor people don t normally behave in an erratic way and are contented And since both the Kim family and the Park family helped each other in certain ways knowingly or unknowingly isn t their relationship symbiotic I mean it s not parasitic since both are benefitting from each other right the Kim family get to enjoy the life of wealth while they are taking care of the Park family s kids and house the relationship is symbiotic therefore the film s title should be Symbiosis not Parasite in that case hahaha just saying The film overall doesn t left as much impact on me as say joker did,7.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5850696/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2020,A thoroughly deserving Best Picture winner!,Captivating intelligent funny unique at times Parasite feels like an opera with its majestic score and visuals One of the greatest things about Parasite is its sharp plot The way that the Kim family plot their scheme and enact their plan is brilliantly devised and shot in the most extraordinary way I really liked that the plot didn t bog itself down in the morality of their actions There was no dithering about from the family and no pause for a discussion of whether what they were doing was right which I feel an American film would have bogged itself down in Bong Joon ho trusted us as an audience to immerse ourselves in the world of the Kim s and just roll with what they doing The themes of Parasite were also very layered some more subtle and complex than others but all intricately connected and well thought out The messaging throughout the film was so rich that it remained constantly engaging From the little I knew about this film going in I was expecting a dark thriller so the comedy took me completely by surprise Choi Yeon gyo stole the show for me with her comedic scenes standing out the most and she was perhaps unlucky not to get greater Academy recognition I can t sing Bong Joon ho s praises enough for his direction on Parasite creating such an eerie atmosphere while also nailing the black comedy The minimalist design of the house the bleak colours and tones all holding their own meanings really emphasised the messaging of the film and cultivated a constant atmosphere of unease at times descending into full on horror After a second viewing dissection I m sure I will have more to say but for now I will simply say that Parasite is a must watch Intriguing from the get go and spot on with its dark humour Parasite is sure to pave the way for a greater visibility of eastern cinema in the west,10.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5548502/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2020,"no message, misleading title, plot holes",It is unclear what the main message of the film is and who should be called Parasite As the film constantly makes us feel sorry for the poor family let us first suppose that the rich family members are considered as parasites and we should seriously consider the problem of inequality in our society But no the dad was hard working creating jobs spending all his available time and money with his family The man did not abuse his employees he did not use cheap labor did not force anybody to work in unhealthy conditions getting huge profit in his pocket Similarly the mom was trying to find the best teachers available to get their kids educated and she treated everybody well If they had not had servants probably the dad would have not been able to dedicate as much time to his job and not to forget about his family On the other hand the poor family got their positions by cheating Should they be viewed as parasites then I don t also think so They continued to work hard despite all the difficulties they met They get their job done the car was clean and driven smoothly the favorite dishes were cooked so what s the problem Who are we supposed to like or dislike what is the question the filmmakers arise Also the movie has some problems with the plot and redundant scenes It is unclear how a family who lived in a filthy apartment was not able even to fold boxes became a group of good servants for an upper class family by doing so naive and straightforward tricks Why did the director even decide to introduce the scene when they were getting less money because they were not able to fold boxes What does it add to the film except for the plot holes He could have just portrayed them as diligent but poor people so that they could have perceived as more positive characters,1.0,12.0,21.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5568654/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,"Both comedy and tragedy, a fierce social satire",This movie starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today s world almost as spltited as in Gosford Park It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience,10.0,20.0,33.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5055069/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,"Well, lots of people live underground.",Parasite comes to us in an age where the intersection between art and politics seems to be reaching fever pitch the moving screen has become a battleground for representation and polemic and the arguments that stem from the validity of just that become their own dogfights Films wrest for their spotlight via the award season The media chimes in with their own ceremonies and ribbons Every man and his dog and his dog s twitter account has a voice and those tweets may well qualify for Rotten Tomatoes critic status And at times the noise surrounding a film can impair our ability to discern its true qualities Todd Phillips Joker made the biggest splash throughout 2019 with an array of voices vying for control of the narrative Some critics derided its dangerous allure to the Arthur Flecks of our time ticking time bombs waiting to pull their own talk show stunts whereas the director himself bemoaned the woke culture that had ruined the comedic genre While he s not wrong about the disconnect between imagined violence and real crime in the end no clowns armed with AR 15s showed up at the premiere surely Phillips has to realise the slippery slope of interpretation that his film endorses As a straight forward character study of Fleck s descent into unhinged derangement it s sympathetic enough if not clumsy in its social commentary mimicking the aesthetic of its Scorsese inspirations from the New Hollywood era in exchange for diluting its contemporary relevance But as serious critique it s laughable simplifying society s sickness to a scattershot of seriously specific symptoms These range from a gang of teenage hooligans hunting clown sign holders and only clown sign holders to a pair of cruel Wall Street bankers who coinkidinkily happen to know a full verse and chorus of Send in the Clowns a song that has zero relevance to the scenario other than its title that s Glee level Todd While Scorsese s camera turned away out of embarrassment for Travis Bickle Joker revels in its final triumph consoling its audience s edgiest sympathies A brief glance at the YouTubers serenading the 167th Street stairs confirms this It s brand store nihilism broad enough for anyone to latch onto with their worldly angst Relatively Rian Johnson s Knives Out is more consistent in its overall delivery spinning social parable from the familiar yarn of a classic whodunnit The moral is solidified in the final frame where the immigrant carer surveys her new estate a labyrinthine Clue esque mansion from its top balcony towering above the former employers who held her family ransom But although its interactions strike truer it s gratifying to see the Thrombey clan cajole Marta as part of the family only to sharply change tack when she is granted their entire inheritance exposing their actual priorities the story places the othered outsider on such a pedestal that it feels obligatory to side with her Marta can t even tell a lie without vomiting wielded by Johnson as a clever plot device and yet also a characteristic approaching noble savage levels of patronising The spatial metaphor isn t dissimilar to that of the staircase in Parasite but you wish that it had a shade more nuance and that she wasn t just the straight character in a pulpy film where the rest of the ensemble seems ripped out a 21st century version of Clue In this edition of the board game Marta wins by playing the moral high ground at every turn But real life isn t that easy or that simple As far as Bong Joon ho is concerned politics has always been entwined with the big screen Because the latter is designed to captivate the popular audience surely it must be a reflection of their general wants and needs universal concerns and priorities Some of his more pointed monster movies take direct aim at the injustices of the world the ramifications and pitfalls of American exceptionalism in The Host and the cruel disregard for animal rights by multinational conglomerates in Okja From his worldview profit rises above the rest leaving all behind But Parasite isn t as straightforwardly didactic or as easy to summarise Just when you think you have the film s measure that the Kims have beaten the system by assuming their mantle on the throne of the Parks it swerves violently to the left From the very beginnings of his career Joon Ho has been taking genre films and twisting them into social satire and while the first half of Parasite could operate as a straight thriller on its own the latter half upends its foundations beyond a merely literal sense The cast is uniformly excellent and it is through the Kims that Joon Ho begins to form his thesis that class is performative that being is a constant state of code switching and that anyone could find themselves at the bottom of the basement or the top of the stairs at one point or another in the twisted prism of capitalism There is an entire wealth of nuance in the formal and informal registers of Korean that will be forever lost to foreign audiences but their body language and tone tell a whole story of their own how Ki woo is seduced by the allure and esteem of a university tutor and in turn seduces Ji so feigning aloofness while in awe of her status or how So dam s dialogue pokes through upper class formality while her father fails to bridge this gap or how Chung sook swells above the former housekeeper when she talks down to her scolding the unemployed for not knowing their place When the new head of house nudges the old aside as if she were nothing more than a pesky mosquito our laughter is smothered quickly by the crack of her head against concrete a testament to both the film s careful drip of dark humour and the lateral cruelty inflicted at the bottom tier of society driven by a desperate yearning to ascend and escape Joons Ho s visual style is a slick almost insidious thing willing you subconsciously in the direction of the narrative and to where the power resides within the scene Consider the opening shot of his debut Barking Dogs Never Bite which pulls back from an idyllic forest line to trap the protagonist within the frame imprisoned in a cage of unemployment and yelping neighbouring dogs The closing shot pulls the same trick presenting his success at scoring the coveted title of a university professor before pulling back to replace the old bars of his apartment with a new set He has won but at what cost Parasite begins literally below ground level showing you the world as the Kims see it the veritable vermin of the underground The camera squeezes in with them hunched around their dining table the long lens compressing the planes evoking a feeling of claustrophobia When Ki woo makes his initial ascent the frame expands dwarfing him in the gated community of the Parks bathing him in angelic natural light Only when their gambit is exposed do they scurry back into their murky sewers like rats flushed out by the same waters that preserve the pristine pastures of their employers And yet they commit the same sins and are guilty of the same transgressions they scorn the Parks for Parasite finishes with a door slam of an ending exposing the elusiveness of social mobility as absolute In truth I prefer the agony of the close in Burning from compatriot Lee Chang dong which achieves the same order of anguish that Joon ho tapped into with Memories of Murder its impact somewhat lessened by the recent revelation of the real life perpetrator In the end it is infinite obsession which reigns over the resolution of the plot s puzzle laced with the poison of class envy it matters not who Ben really was Parasite more or less deals with a similar crisis of identity in which the working class protagonist eventually succumbs to the lure of the nouveau riche and their shiny new world If you pull back you ll see that this doubles for the broader anxieties of a country coming to terms with its rapid economic and social growth after civil war Winning the nation s first second third and fourth Oscar in one fell swoop is a significant boon for Asian representation in the West And as for working class representation Perhaps not in the gilded gated halls of the Academy Even in fantasy Ki woo s triumph barely nudges the status quo He merely wins by joining them,9.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5530432/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2019,Powerful,Such a powerful allegory for the increasing wealth gap in the world The scenes in the basement were chilling especially that first one The poor scurrying like cockroaches when the lights come on swimming in their own filth during that flood scene and turning against one another it was all devastating commentary on the position they re in and the struggle The rich guy who seems nice enough but just the mere smell of the poor or them not staying in their place and crossing the line he has in his mind which makes him quickly remind them of their relative positions it s a fantastic characterization and I loved how it all built up into a crescendo with the opulence of that kid s birthday party This is a message film that works on both levels as it s hard to know how it will play out and while dark it s entertaining The ending is brilliant too,9.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5298246/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2020,Is PARASITE a Tamil movie remake?,Apart from Hollywood I like seeing International movies Iranian Korean French German etc movies Parasite movie came into news because it won Oscar for best movie It is the first foreign movie to win the top most prize With that came the comparison and allegation that it is a remake of a Tamil movie Minsara Kanna May be the plot of the movie is taken from Minsara Kanna but the story is totally different In Tamil movie which is a comedy the story is about winning the family of a rich girl whom the poor hero loves and he brings each member of his family to do a job similar to Parasite movie in the girl s family and there is a happy ending Whereas in the South Korean movie Parasite is about class divide the poor family slowly plots to be part of rich family and in the end there is gory violence where the poor family kills off the rich family I have seen the Tamil movie and I was interested to see the South Korean movie with all the buzz and good reviews it garnered The Director Bong Joon Ho has built the sets of houses for both the poor family living down town dirty and dingy basement and rich family living uptown spacious luxurious bungalow The poor family are shown cunning smart clever and shrewd and the rich family people are shown stupid dumb and ignorant As the movie progresses each member of poor family finds a way in the rich family household by forging documents and sweet talks The internet is so full with stuff on how the director has taken pain in comparatively portraying small details of poor and rich life styles on the celluloid The Director also insists on watching the movie without subtitles Some audiences who may be jealous of rich people laughed at the way rich people are fooled by poor people sour grapes Inequity and income gap disparity syndrome But the movie could not drawn a little bit of smirk on my face Critics who have lauded this movie say it is rise of socialism against crony corrupt capitalism The Director Bong has made a stupid movie marketing it as an intelligent thriller and those who are liking it makes us doubt today world s sanity People who rave about this movie must be mentally sick people They are the real parasites of this world and not the rich or poor which the director intends to show here The acting is not good Th plot and twists are so convenient and predictably dumb Forcibly inserted vulgarity and terrible violence at the end just to juxtapose the lethargy of a third rate scripting and film making The Tamil movie was bad but the South Korean movie is worse Anyways the Director Bong Joon Ho is smiling on grabbing 241 awards internationally and 4 Oscars The times we live in I go with 3 out of 10 rating,3.0,5.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5535425/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2021,Weird & Wonderful,Parasite is like no film I have seen before for a very long time despite enjoying it I was questioning just what this film was There was comedy obvious drama and a little romance too but it all accumulates into a thriller It s surreal but brilliant Overall Parasite is a stark commentary on the class divide within Korea yet it doesn t paint either extreme as the lesser the evil or impose certain stereotypes The difference in lifestyle and mindset is evident yet putting these two seemingly amiable families in the same space displays the ultimate division It s difficult film to explain to another yet it s apparent why it won the Oscar for Best Film Watch it I don t see how anyone could be disappointed by it,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6545129/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2019,Honest review. Overrated,It s overrated it doesn t deserve to be in 250 at all nor does it deserve to be higher rated than 6 There is no point the first few minutes are funny then predictable You will be waiting for something to happen to justify that above 8 rating and show why it s on 250 but nothing happens It is entertaining a bit,2.0,32.0,60.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5300204/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,Tense and rife with much social commentary,This review contains spoilers Parasite is a black comedy thriller movie that is directed by Bong Joon Ho and premiered in 2019 The movie features a poor family that schemes to take advantage of a wealthy upper class family Along the way they discover that things are not exactly as they seem Parasite is a tense thriller with social commentary This social commentary is present from the first scene where the poor Kim family is making ends meet They cooperate with one another and scheme to cut corners to gain income quickly This is the first introduction to the odds that the family are up against They begin having to cut corners on their side work and bend rules simply to survive They are pushed by society to undertake these duplicitous actions in order to thrive in society It makes the audience side understand their plight if they do not want to side with them Most audience members should be able to identify the plight that the characters are undergoing The audience can understand from the way the movie is structured that the Kim family were pushed to doing these actions due to their dire straits at home The social commentary continues when the underground family and wealthy families are introduced The rich family the Parks are unaware of the plight of the poorer classes This is a situation that they are perfectly content with The rich upper class family sees the situation with poorer classes as inhuman This is reflected by both the father and mother having a scent issue with the lower class family This is brought up multiple times when they pinch their noses to avoid the smell of the lower classes This is also reflected by the son Park Da song when he realizes the Kim family all smell the same Much as the rich upper class are oblivious to the plight of the lower classes they also appropriate cultures and customs This is reflected by the use of Native American culture diluted into a form that is friendly and non threatening to the upper class The upper class is definitely profiting from the labor of the lower classes and it is clearly shown in the movie The hidden underground class is reflected in the two characters Gook Moon gwang and Oh Geun se These characters are seen by the Kim family for what they are opportunistic and desperate However these two are hidden to the upper class They took care of the rich while being completely hidden as seen by the automatic lights on the stairs This movie makes it clear that the poor class are certainly desperate and uprooting them are dangerous The Kim family are entirely unaware of the plight that they are in and they do share common cause The social commentary combined makes for a movie that has an amazingly unique and engaging plot These moments are the bread and butter to why Parasite is one of the best movies of 2019 This movie has permeance across modern society that is hard to shake The movie makes for its importance in describing the intricate problematic root causes in why capitalism leads to Parasite s societal dysfunction These moments showed climbing the ladder was expected but leads to unintended consequences The movie in general is gorgeously shot and acted The movie features direction that is inspired and adds much to the tension The movie traverses many movie genres and this is impressive in how the movie s direction can stay consistent I highly recommend Parasite directed by Bong Joon Ho Grade A,9.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8761413/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2023,Stretching its limits,Parasite directed by Bong Joon ho is a critically acclaimed South Korean film that has received numerous awards and accolades However in my opinion the film falls short of its hype While the premise of a lower class family infiltrating a wealthy household is intriguing the execution is heavy handed and lacks subtlety The characters are one dimensional and lack depth with the lower class family being portrayed as cunning and deceitful and the wealthy family as naive and ignorant The film s attempts at social commentary feel forced and preachy with the message of class struggle being hammered home repeatedly Furthermore the film s pacing is slow and uneven with long stretches of exposition and character development that feel drawn out and unnecessary The final act while shocking is also predictable and lacks emotional impact due to the lack of investment in the characters Overall Parasite is a film that is overhyped and overrated While it may appeal to those who enjoy heavy handed social commentary those looking for a more nuanced and subtle exploration of class struggle will be disappointed Despite its critical acclaim I found Parasite to be a disappointing and forgettable film,3.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8962837/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,Just a really bad movie..........,When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there s something awry This isn t scathing socio political cinema it s not black comedy in fact it s not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters It s a simple hype job The movie here is the real Parasite,1.0,85.0,154.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5513630/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2019,parasite,Cinematographically really an awesome film great actors storytelling gripping But maybe it s only me I can t make out a plot that ties all together unfortunately So it remains a bunch of snipets greatly shot clips but the story loses itself if not in the worst of all in oceandeep hopelessness it is the saddest experience leaving the theatre 9 for the pictures 1 for the story sorry no,6.0,11.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5194749/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,Not that great,I am sorry I didn t like it It could have been great the topics were valid but it was just not good I don t think it was a masterpiece at the end it was all over the place and you missed the point The story was not good either I have to disagree with the rest of the world,1.0,78.0,155.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5472142/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,Good but absolutely overrated,Parasite 7 10 Positive The premise is incredibly exciting and builds up a great game with the double lives of the protagonists in the first half The film has an incredibly ingenious plot The premise alone is captivating As the film progresses a funny comedy becomes more and more of a thriller splatter which brings a great twist to the plot The dialogues are surprisingly interesting and funny Above all the dialogues between the two families and the gap between rich and poor that arise are captivating Not only the dialogues but also the entire game and the building of emotions is perfect How the hatred of the rich family slowly increases and the disgusting behavior of the upper class is explained is fascinating The socially critical commentary that is repeatedly interspersed into the film is clever and gives the film another level The twist halfway through the film that the housewife s husband lives in the basement was a shock and brings a huge and surprising turn to the story Negative Unfortunately our protagonists are not likeable It is a group of losers and impostors who end up committing cruel acts The ending isn t perfect and the film would have needed more time to process the events The characters commit terrible acts The film doesn t glorify this behavior but still portrays them as the good ones which is reprehensible In the end they are still the victims but the film forgets that they got themselves into this situation because they wanted quick money All the deaths both within the family and the murders they committed are never dealt with The film does criticize society but in a very weak way In the end the poor are the good victims and the rich are the vain evil ones Conclusion A good and clever black comedy Unfortunately parts of it are too black so in places it forgets to shed light on the morals of the characters and never discourages bad deeds such as murder Still a good and exciting film But unfortunately overrated,7.0,4.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9374833/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2020,Shocked at the Positive Reception,I went into this movie with very high hopes So many accolades and Oscars have been thrown at this movie and while that s not the main requirement for a great movie it gives off the impression that there has to be SOME redeeming qualities about it I was excited to see a foreign language film win Best Picture and was fully prepared to at least enjoy the movie as a social commentary as many people lauded it as a powerful work of art and masterpiece a word that is used WAY too often these days So basically I hated it I got about an hour and a half into the film before my mom and I decided we had enough and couldn t succumb ourselves to watching the rest of this cartoonish sequence of events despite the fact that I rented it I could state a plethora of reasons for despising the film but to summarize my thoughts I felt that the characters were underdeveloped and acted more like caricatures than real people we encounter the film s aesthetic was not pleasing for the viewer to watch and I understand that the movie s uneasiness was the point but I was not a fan of the directing style and the strange shots and I kept thinking some bizarre creature was gonna come out and fully push this film into fantasy horror genre I just really did not like anything about it I usually always finish movies once I m dedicated to watching something but this was just impossible I get some of the messages the director was trying to make but it comes off as a complete joke to me that this film won so many awards including BEST PICTURE None of the characters were likable Absolutely none I m not sure if I was supposed to hate the rich family for just being rich and slightly conceited and root for the poor family because of their circumstances but they didn t seem to have any empathy or compassion for even other working class people like them in the pursuit to get what they wanted which came off as very cold and sad I love films that make you question who the protagonists and antagonists are and I know not all movies are meant to be uplifting but these characters were lazily written and we don t get any insight into their inner monologue and feelings The acting was very mediocre for the most part too and sometimes downright cringe worthy I truly don t know what I missed but this was just not my cup of tea or my mom s and it felt unnecessarily gruesome and strange rather than masterful and sharp Instead of awaiting the next moment with excitement and suspense I found myself cringing at the actors performances as they weren t believable and was confused at how poorly written the dialogue was Not everything that s out there and different hits the mark This did NOT hit the mark for me,1.0,31.0,55.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5741853/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2020,Astounding!,It is difficult to not spoil a movie when all you want to do is to talk about it specially when it is truly astounding Bong Joon Ho the acclaimed director of Snowpiercer brings us this amazing masterpiece a grueling story of the lengths people will go to come out of a desperate situation All I will say of the story is that in its core it s the tale of two families a very wealthy family that has everything yet they have nothing and a very impoverish family that has each other to a fault But when their worlds collide there is bound to be a catastrophic catharsis In the age of remakes sequels and reboots it is very hard to find a movie that is not only very original in its premise but that it also manages to amaze you and shock you to the very core to your very foundation The movie is very well shot and it has amazing performances specially from Woo sik Choi and So dam Park who is rapidly becoming a rising star among Korean actresses The film won four Academy Awards and it deserves every single one of them it is well paced the story is engaging it has amazing performances an astonishing photography and it is masterfully put together by a visionary director whose unapologetic take to show the ugly side of humanity makes this movie unforgettable It would almost be a crime not to rate this movie a 10 out of 10 There have been talks to make an American adaptation do not mess with greatness,10.0,4.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5509963/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2019,I am confused as to how this movie is labelled as flawless and masterpiece,I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019,1.0,119.0,232.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5305393/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,Full of intrigue.,Parasite 2019 I probably wouldn t have gone anywhere near this film if it hadn t featured on the up to date IMDB Top 250 films and personally I would have kept Snow White And The Seven Dwarves 1937 from their Top 100 list and left this one off but it wasn t a bad film at all I could see the appeal in this one because it managed to be a little bit of everything all in just one film It was clever how the Poor family manipulated the Rich family and that element to start with was quite witty but then things went in a different direction and all sorts of drama horror and thrilling styles came in to play I can only really compare it to From Dusk Till Dawn 1996 in that respect having had no idea of the twist that occurred in that one either I m not saying that there are definitely Vampires but there could be And actually anything could have happened as the story progressed with secrets and events that I hadn t even considered at the outset The only other film that I could see similarities to would be The Handmaiden 2016 also from South Korea and a film where things weren t always as they seemed either I m not sure how good the acting was in this one because I find it really difficult with foreign language films to feel the emotion and that is certainly the case with Asian stories with their exaggerated humour elements akin to Anime or sometimes even those crazy Japanese game shows where the contestants are basically repeatedly tortured in a Krypton Factor 1977 2013 style but without the health and safety people on hand I think the Rich Mum Yeon Kyo was probably a bit over the top although she appeared to fit quite well as the film progressed Ultimately what started out as quite a lighthearted and cheeky hustle film very quickly became something severe and psychotic that was very dark and twisted in some very odd directions I wouldn t say that I didn t like it but I felt that there was a translation issue although it did seem far easier to liken it to cinema of British or U S origin than others I ve watched It really would be hard to quantify as one type of film but I suppose it would be best classed as a dark dramatic comedy 635 67 1000,6.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8615032/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2020,Parasite: Is there Really a Such Thing in the Human Definition?,When people think of a parasite they obviously associate it with a lesser living creature living off of its larger more prosperous host For example fleas live on dogs and consume their blood According to society which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything At least so it says right Well what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for What if they experience an illness injury or health problem in addition to that bad economic situation which deems them unable to even work productively at least for a while What if the host that the so called parasite human is borrowing resources from is actually a bad person themselves who abuses them both emotionally verbally and physically in order to boost their egos to make themselves feel superior to the person they are helping Is there actually a parasitic human or are all people just human Take for instance someone who is born into poverty physically or mental abuse or both Are they parasites just because of this Things they had no control over Just because they are poor What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job which they cannot help they are now Perhaps most complexly what if they people at the top are actually the Parasites if there was one Isn t it true that government workers and politicians live off of taxpayer money aka taxpayer labor Isn t it true that a mega rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them Doesn t this luxurious CEO or executive suck the blood and life out of their workers by forcing them to work harder work overtime sometimes work 60 hours a week or more with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not And isn t it true that due to increase production or productivity the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees Furthermore cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks Many years ago a very startling and eye opening book came out which actually compared corporations to psychopaths All of the traits in an empirical psychopath are parallel to exactly how corporations are run and also how corporate executives operate they callously mistreat their employees can care less about their health or well being as long as they are greedily and selfishly getting wealthier and growing As a corporation becomes bigger the dichotomy between caring for a small group of employees and eventually becoming indifferent to any humanity and well being of the individuals which also includes the customers becomes starker in contrast All that matters is personal selfish gain in an overabundance unnecessary amount of riches as their employees struggle to pay their bills each pay period and have to wait two weeks often times for their checks If they lay people off or if the corporation downsizes or relocates then the employees are back to barely getting by with no check So the question again must be asked who really is the Parasite Either there are none or everyone is,8.0,5.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5481269/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2020,"Wonderfully funny, warm, surprising, and beautiful...though not ever astonishing",Parasite 2019 With the hype around this movie best in ten years I had unreasonable expectations This is a funny almost silly story with great acting and with a couple of twists that make it inventive It s also filmed photographed with gorgeous care lots of gently moving camera a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually It s an example of classic great moviemaking I thought the acting was especially sharp like the complex job the leading woman Yeo jeong Jo had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea And the rest of the cast played types that didn t tumble into stereotypes The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex but this isn t a probing complex movie actually The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads almost in a Chaplin like building of absurdities to comic tension The cameraman Kyung pyo Hong deserves credit for sure because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes racing down dingy steps a downpour in the slums and graceful geometry in the fabulous house Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting That said the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it s been getting there are more impressive movies out there in various ways Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more or made me laugh more or were more inventive I m not naming movies Maybe since this movie manages all three it s notable but I ll keep my admiration in place Enjoy it,8.0,8.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456560/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2020,"No doubt ,one of the best movies of the year",I would describe it as a modern tragicomedy that portrays the drama of social inequality and frustration because of the excessive contrasts between social classes narrated with black humor paradoxes and a hint of absurdity It is a critique of today s society focused on having on the immediate gratification on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many Its well deserved the film won the Palme d Or at the Cannes festival and the critic describes it as perfection made film P S The house is a dream of architecture,10.0,12.0,18.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5383486/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,A nearly perfect heist/comedy/horror/drama hybrid that is a testament to South Korean cinema.,If you haven t discovered South Korean cinema yet Parasite 2019 is a fantastic introduction for the uninitiated Director Bong Joon ho has been hard at work over the last 20 years helping craft films that are thoughtful and horrifying Movies like The Host 2006 and Snowpiercer 2013 give a sense of his artistic style Parasite merely takes his ability to shed light on class conflict and molds it into a masterpiece that s half heist comedy half horror drama and all suspense If it weren t for the somewhat lackluster ending I d give this film the full five stars it deserves At the base of Parasite is a conflict between the impoverished and the rich This theme could be easily applied to any country with a wide income disparity which is probably why it works so well in the United States as well as in South Korea To survive in these environments the poor must do their best to polish their image enough so that the rich will hire them Sometimes this requires an elaborate series of prepared and practiced cons to break into financial success Of course the threat of being uncovered as charlatans is what drives the comedy and suspense of Parasite My only qualm with Parasite is the uncertainty of its ending There s a point during the climactic incident where I thought the movie could end and it would be a perfect kind of ambiguity mostly because there was a finality to it Instead there s a little bit tacked on that covers the where are they now which while being an adequate way to show the cycle of dependency continuing still doesn t give a wholly satisfying conclusion Regardless of this I found Parasite to be a fantastic piece of cinema and one that I believe will stand the test of time like other South Korean films like The Housemaid 1960 and Oldboy 2003 have A nearly perfect heist comedy horror drama hybrid that is a testament to South Korean cinema I give Parasite 4 5 stars out of 5,9.0,4.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5484639/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2020,Family planning,This is where I get all smug and talk about how I remember when The Host was released and in fact I ve owned the DVD for well over a decade now And at that time I wanted to see Barking Dogs Never Bite as it starred Bae Doo na who was popular among me at the time and I d heard Memories of Murder was worth a watch but my limited attempts never found an available copy a film that now seems criminally under promoted in the UK But after the release of 2009 s Mother as I am neither a Netflix or Jamie Bell subscriber Joon ho Bong s name hasn t been in my consciousness a great deal over the last decade Until about a year ago when talk was of his latest work being really quite good tipped and then fulfilling promise to win the Palme d Or at Cannes Now South Korean cinema is all popular and that and Oscars are being won breaking new ground along the way But despite my interest in his first two feature length films I have still yet to see either The Host was an entertaining film but is somewhat clunky in parts and the dancing on the bus finale from Mother stayed in my memory but I had to re watch it to have my recollection of the rest of the film restored a tidy little film But while good he was not a director blowing my mind and after a relatively meagre last decade in terms of the volume of output I was surprised by both the hype surrounding Parasite and its ground breaking achievements Is it really all that and a bag of Oscars Well the premise is a nice one The Kims are a poor family living in a basement flat looking out at the rest of the world from street level They are more or less living in the gutter Working by pre folding pizza boxes for a local takeaway they steal wifi off their neighbours or local businesses the toilet their wifi hotspot The son Ki woo Woo sik Choi has two things going for him while completing his military service he learnt English to a good standard and his friend Min Seo joon Park a suave and sophisticated young gentleman about to travel abroad While he is away Min asks Ki woo if he can take over his role as the wealthy Park family s daughter Da hye s Ji so Jung English teacher Ki woo will be able to pass as an English teacher and as a failed college applicant poses little threat to Min s designs on Da hye Enlisting his sister Ki jung So dam Park to forge college certificates for him Ki woo goes for an interview with Park mother Yeon kyo Yeo jeong Jo exploiting her simple wealthy naivety Quickly Ki woo learns that the son Da song Hyun jun Jung also needs a new art teacher and recommends his sister for the role though denies their family connection of course Through mischief Ki woo and Ki jung soon get their father Ki taek Kang ho Song recruited as the father Dong ik s Sun kyun Lee driver and their mother Ching sook Hye jin Yang as housemaid Soon the Kims occupy the splendidly modern house as much as the Parks unbeknownst to their hosts But ousted housemaid Moon gwang Jeong eun Lee returns when the host family are away finding the Kims enjoying a night of luxury unearthing a dark secret kept within the house Complacently their cover is blown and the Kims must do what it takes to keep their real identity among other things hidden As stated The Host was an entertaining film though like any comedy can have moments where the script feels a little clunky awkward Swiss cheese Mother was a step up in overall quality with better storytelling while maintaining entertainment value With Parasite Bong has created a near perfect balance of good storytelling with entertainment value The first hour is an introduction to each of the nine central characters in what is quite a light comedy drama about con artists But throughout Bong leaves subtle references to what will become the film s climax These start off small but gradually become more frequent and when literal push comes to literal shove the bubbles rise to the surface and boil over Tension is brought in as we switch to the second half of the film when the Kims start to enjoy imagining themselves in a life of luxury another subtle hint perhaps Happy go lucky tricksters soon become criminals with Bong pacing this development well In their showhome advert for the way of life of the mega rich the Parks are not portrayed as horrible for it Yeon kyo is nice if a little slow and the Kims recognise this Dong ik is complimentary enough and the two children are normal kids Da song deserving of some sympathy The Kims are more relaxed and likeable but also manipulative and criminal in their work Here the poor appear more immoral But as things progress the Parks begin to show their disgust at those from poorer backgrounds What start off as seemingly minor comments about how Ki taek smells become more frequent references to it comparing it to the smell of people on the subway and we all know what that means Ki taek is increasingly disturbed by these comments repeatedly hearing it on a stress filled night returning home to his flooded basement apartment Dong ik refers to Ki taek getting close to crossing the line and returning from his fantasy to his reality it may be time for that move to be made Despite exploiting them the Kims initially liked the Parks but the more they get to know them the more they realise the Parks will never truly like them back The stunning view from the window of the Parks house is contrasted by the view from the gutter the Kims have from theirs with Kyung pyo Hong s cinematography telling a story in itself As the Kims are punished for their crimes sympathy grows for them and indeed their whole neighbourhood destroyed by flooding While they try to rescue their children from the floodwater the Parks casually watch over Da song as he sleeps in his teepee in their garden it won t leak it was ordered from America Both families are left scathed by the end but which do you feel more sympathy for Who was really exploiting who Bong weaves these questions in subtly throughout sucking you in Now where s that subsequent Early Bong Blu Ray Boxset we all know is about to come politic1983 home

21 November 2019,A Textbook Film Of Pretentiousness,The opposite of a singer who sings with soul is a singer who sings as if they have soul This movie was done as if it were a satire as if it were making a statement as if it has a deeper meaning Instead it s hollow at its core mean spirited and pointless It s a film for those like the idea of making a point but not having to suffer any uncomfortable truths The only good effect of this film is that it exposes the vacuity of those who praise it and their self delusion It s a barometer of the public s appetite for garbage See this film only in the context of a sociology experiment and be shocked at how far we ve fallen in our gullibility and how desperate we are not to face ourselves,2.0,52.0,103.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5271692/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2019,"A story about social class, filled with twists and turns",Bong Joon Ho is an absolute genius and has struck once again with the masterfully twisted Parasite All four of the central performances are wonderful in depicting this fantasy like film that depicts a family slowly gaining the trust of and infiltrating another upper class family Parasite was amazing in the way that it was able to present twists and turns and shift genre and tone seamlessly This film goes from pleasant comedy to a much darker film Parasite at its core is about economic class family and the parasitical relationship between different members of society and it does a hell of a job doing it This film is one of the best movies coming out of 2019 and is sure to surprise audiences with a twist that is both horrifying and surprising,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5346433/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2019,"What if you are a parasite, host or neither is...",A question in my mind after watching this movie is if I m one of these roles and what will I do Parasite presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet The depiction of bottom class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy Although rich people are kind they just can t stand the smell and life quality from bottom class people and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom class people This is humanity and there is no correct answer but we can think deeply in this issue And what if you are neither parasite nor host would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing It s very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film,10.0,14.0,20.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5125648/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2020,Why did this get an Oscar?,Now this isn t a bad movie not at all Just so overhyped which kinda ruined it with me I feel like people like this just because it s so politically right like what happened with black panther Just because it s something you believe in doesn t mean it s good I felt like it was way too long And how did this get an Oscar over 1917 which is obviously superior especially in the visual category I just don t understand why so many people like this mediocre film,5.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6231846/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2020,"Multidimensional Cinema, the next step in Filmmaking and Visual Storytelling. An impeccably Surreal-Absurdist Drama Comedy",I have watched this film a total of three times now First time with English subtitles and twice without I have absolutely no idea what this movie is supposed to mean but it feels like two social classes clashing against each other in a very strange yet interesting house I ll admit that I have never seen a Chinese or Korean made movie until now and Parasite is the first film I ve seen from Korea but the sheer artistic direction and enigmatic structure of it all is incomparable to any other film I ve seen come out of the year A very select few movies that come to mind that has a plot structure or story direction style that I can relate or reference this I can only guess what the main theme or score of this movie is supposed to mean I am listening to the music of the Blu Ray menu as I m typing this trying to decode meaning from the notation structure of the short yet extremely memorable of this song I m still trying to decipher what emotion the theme is trying to convey Could you say the film has a serious tone it is hard to say The movie definitely has a serious tone with a very strong burst of violence in the final 15 minutes of the movie s running time but the theme is surprisingly happy and carefree even joyful yet overshadowed by an ever lurking hint of sadness that never lets go The sadness melancholic feel of this movie is always present throughout despite the emotional rollercoaster this surreal absurdist drama comedy film only known as Parasite takes you on This short theme is actually very true to emotion in real life Melancholy can never fully be escaped from in so many facets of life True happiness can only be achieved in fleeting moments and sometimes only in short bursts only to fall back into a stabilised state of emotional equality that is where most people reside in most periods of life Never truly happy yet not depressed or sad Simply reasonably content The third light at the top of the stairs meaning to me is the unstoppable and indescribable drive to try and achieve a higher state of happiness beyond normal human comprehension An emotional ascension which can also be heard in the main theme is you really start to sit down and think about the music in the film and start mulling over the notes in your head and how they really make you feel How does the theme make you feel Happy Sad Melancholic Confused Joyful Maybe all at once Maybe none of these emotions are good enough for you anymore Did you ever think to yourself that you deserve a higher state of feeling that you always wanted but could never grasp If there is such thing as an afterlife or heaven how would the souls that live there feel like I would expect It would be a higher state than what most of us experience in life The rock to me is the object in the movie that symbolises the emotional weight which all the characters revolve around and are effected by which also radiates a strange gravitational like force that influences them kind of like Sauron s Ring from LOTR but in a different way The true form and meaning of happiness is something that is always in my mind when I think about this movie What is happiness even supposed to mean and who out there is brave enough to say that modern society s definition of true happiness whatever the hell that is supposed to mean is just simply not good enough The man in the basement is an enigma He is a man trying to create and send a message of how to escape the confines and prison of being trapped inside the normal comprehension of human emotion The balance between Joy Depression Melancholy Depression Fear and True Happiness He cannot accept that true happiness at least the way he feels it is the best and highest form of happiness that a human mind can achieve The three lights symbolise an upward stairway for the emotional mind Emotional intelligence followed by ascension to a higher state of feeling and sustained happiness Parasite also touches upon Schizophrenia is some parts and offers a quick window into what it might be like to suffer from Schizophrenia The definition of Schizophrenia itself is simply a breakdown between thought reason and emotion Funnily enough this movie is split between three genres Absurdist Surreal Comedy and Drama The movie feels oddly split which is a purposeful directing choice which is the most obvious thing that you take away from this movie The film could have been called Split to me and still would have not lost any of its impact but unfortunately Split has already been taken by Shyamalan Something of a parasite is formed in this movie but what it is I still have no clue Parasite IS going to be one of those movie s that is going to become exponentially better the more times you watch it which will not lose its interest charm or unique appeal with repeated viewings The film truly feels multidimensional in its direction and communication of its ideas that leaves massive room for the viewer to make their own interpretation of those so called ideas and messages in the film The movie at times has a very enigmatic feel reminiscing of certain video games like Myst Riven Portal and Abduction Parasite is an experience that is going to mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people Anyway what do I think of this movie in terms of quality The answer is simple 10 10 This to me is minimalistic yet multidimensional filmmaking at its absolute finest and I really have no issues or gaping flaws that I have to say about it It s pretty much as perfect as a modern movie gets and transcends so much that has came before it I loved it I loved every single goddamn minute of it and I don t even understand what I watched or even why I enjoyed it so much in the way I did If you didn t enjoy it that is totally fine as well It s one of those movies that is not going to be everyone s cup of tea and that is also okay But to me Parasite is the next step as we are beginning to experience a new advent in visual storytelling This does feel like merely a prototype that will be improved and expanded upon by Boon Jong Ho If anyone who might be reading this who worked on the movie well done I mean it Anyway just watch it if you have not already It will be one of the fastest and most interesting 2 hours you will have this year Watch it without the subtitles first then watch it with subtitles on Also try to watch it in a theatre with Dolby Atmos if you get the chance I currently have not but I m sure I ll see it in a theatre somewhere since this still hasn t been officially been theatrically released in the country I live in Also I want a Parasite themed rock birthday cake XD,10.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5808551/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,The Irritating Masterpiece,The blurring of the rich poor divide occurs when the poor family becomes increasingly entangled in the life of the wealthy family they pretend to serve The usage of the home as a symbol emphasizes this theme with the basement symbolizing the poor family s poverty and the upstairs signifying the affluent family s money and privilege The film also focuses on the concept of the parasitic single which refers to adult children who live with their parents and are unable to leave owing to a lack of work and financial security It also depicts the influence of capitalism on individuals and how difficult it is to break out from the cycle of poverty The film also emphasizes the topic of survival as the impoverished family would go to any length to live even if it means misleading and manipulating the wealthier family It s crucial to remember that this film is a social commentary and a mirror of present society s reality it may be uncomfortable to see but it s necessary to comprehend the message it s attempting to portray Bong Joon ho directed the 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film Parasite The narrative follows the Kim family an impoverished family of four living in a tiny semi basement apartment When the son Ki woo is given the opportunity to teach the Park s daughter they become entangled in the life of the rich Park family As Ki woo gets increasingly involved in the Parks life the rest of the Kim family begins to enter the Parks lives in various ways with each member taking on a position as a tutor or employee The film tackles issues of class struggle and social inequity as the Kim family s actions set in motion a chain of events that reveal the two families underlying tensions and secrets The film also deals with themes of greed and the consequences of actions The performances of the ensemble and the film s unusual combination of genres It was the first South Korean film to win the Palme d Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival It also won Academy Awards for Best Picture Best Director and Best Original Screenplay becoming Bong Joon ho the first Asian director to win Best Director at the Oscars The film received widespread praise for its superb acting director storyline and depiction of societal concerns and class conflict It was also a box office triumph in South Korea and internationally When Parasite was released it gained critical praise with many applauding Bong Joon directing Parasite is a complicated film that explores a variety of topics and subjects that may make viewers uncomfortable including class disparity poverty and the rich s abuse of the poor The film also addresses the concept of deceit as the film s impoverished family pretends to be someone they are not in order to get entry to the rich household Furthermore the film s finale is unexpected and may be upsetting to some viewers It s natural for people to react differently to a film and it s vital to remember that art is subjective and can elicit various feelings in different people Parasite is a thought provoking and expertly constructed film that addresses complicated societal themes in an original and fascinating manner Its unique combination of genres great performances and expert directing by Bong Joon ho make it a must see picture,10.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8827645/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2020,A melody of fine cinema,Parasite is a melody of fine cinema It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling Overall Bong Joon ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape,10.0,18.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5431403/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2019,A craft masterclass by a genius,I watched Parasite twice at the 36th Annual JFF Jerusalem Film Festival and I have to say the film is still in my head The genre of the film is absolutely different from other Hollywood s franchises trust me Bong Joon ho was right This review doesn t contain spoilers although I do recommend to not read this before you watch the film Parasite directed by a an artist himself Bong Joon ho is a social satire comedy tragedy film that like the film Us tells of two families of different status one of whom lives in the basement apartment and in unemployment condition Each member of the poor family plans to sneak into a wealthy family s estate until they are exposed to unexpected twists The film won the Palme d Or award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Sydney Film Festival at the Sydney Film Festival and in fact it deserved and won these awards Eat Straw Pulp Fiction Why Now comes the twist On the one hand Bong uses a very creative black comedy as I will describe below to improve stories of inequality economic imbalance inherent corruption and power abuse that reflect South Korean society s view And on the other hand all seven Bong films cover the genres from science fiction to police proceduralism to the small town murder mystery but they all have many things in common Such as in the films Mother and Memories of Murder Bong uses his films to reflect the problematic establishment of Korea South Korea in particular and the perfect results As mentioned this film is ignored by the genre s conventions it s soft and cruel Beautiful and hard Beautiful and tragic and a masterpiece in her classroom investigation The screenwriters Bong Joon ho and Han Jin Won use a lot of twisted sleeves in the plot to make the movie more entertaining this year Each line is delivered smoothly as if these characters seem to be real people living in this story with Jung Jaeli s classic score playing tremendously in the background The cinematography by Hong Kyung pyo distinguishes itself from a more realistic grainy style in the basement apartment to a smoother style when focusing on our rich characters This point of view causes us to look at two very opposing groups of people differently to make it even clearer that they do not belong to the same world The classroom systems did not look earthy but still perfect before Bong makes sure to simplify the lines between the two sides at certain points and cause your sympathy to jump back and forth with hectic consequences It is a film that focuses on poverty despair and what we are willing to do to take what needs to be ours The tension between supreme elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face Therefore Bong likes to blur the lines of the genre and he makes sure he hits every step in the stairwell to succeed Parasite is a craft masterclass in which the power of the story lies in the way comedy and drama rub off on each other in the proper way to ignite a bit of thriller that turns into pure horror when despair and hatred meet each other This is also not a film that built on one plot twist at the end it s completely different from any Hollywood film that makes viewers angry at the viewer who just finished watching and suspecting him This film will be remembered in the history books of world cinema and foreign cinema in particular as one of the most creative films of the year in general If not then Hollywood is completely out of control,10.0,18.0,36.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5039230/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2019,The movie you thought could never exist,When you go in unexpected get ready to be hit in the head harder than you can imagine The movie takes you in for a slow burn which gradually comforts you in its comedic and slice of life plot which then unfolds into an epidemic rollercoaster of twists and turns I intially thought this would be a gore or hardcore thriller film but it s something ethereal something you need to let sink in as the film takes jabs at the hardships and reality of both stratas of life The methodically cinematography and the clever use of sound effects and music makes every scene a work of art The plot refelects human nature and what limits we are ready to cross in order to make ourselves secure and ignore our inhibitions no matter the cost 2019 couldn t end any better,10.0,17.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5330318/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,Caution: deeply unsettling,To be honest normally I do not fancy such type of movies especially asian movies this one well it nearly kills you It starts somehow slow even boring maybe a touch of comedy but then then the second half of it is just a nightmare focusing on society and it s negative aspects This movie kept me awake for many hours at night and will always remind me of so many things like to be thankful for what you have and how to approach others Check out yourself For sure one of the true oscar winners Fully deserved,10.0,7.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5491594/?ref_=tt_urv

6 June 2020,Good but not THAT good!,The acting is great humour is funny and the first half of the movie is so enjoyable it has everything you want and is one of those that has you asking questions as to how the family can keep this going Sadly ending of the movie just takes this film downhill way too fast and the final 20 minutes or so is just odd and disjointed What happens to the wife daughter and son who lived in the house what about Min Surely he returned from his travels It s like the writer had the perfect idea all the way up to the killing off of characters and then didn t know how to tie up the loose ends They instead just play on the political message about the gaps in wealth and class which is why I think this film appealed to the Oscar s,6.0,5.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5804179/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2020,Unexpected,Everyone says the film is about social class but I do not agree That is just the setting Like many Korean film makers the audience has no clue where the film is going That is something I really appreciate In the end it is not realistic but entertaining Does the film have a deeper message Yes but it is for discussion The poorer family seems quite able but somehow unable to work Why Maybe because they have psycho problems e g father controlling his violence And maybe that is why many able looking people are poor The richer family is very nice How often are rich people taken in like that Well quite often I would say if the acting is right,9.0,6.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5485761/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2020,"Fascinating mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller",It s been a while since I watched a movie that made such impact on me First of all I really liked the story of different social classes despair greed deception pride and prejudices It is masterfully directed by Bong carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing Parasite can t be categorized in a specific movie genre rather it s a mix of dark comedy drama and thriller which is it s strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres This is movie that I will gladly watch many times A real gem of Korean cinematography,10.0,10.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5455361/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2019,Modern Day Metropolis,This is a must see film packed with tons of implied meaning tackling many social issues focussing on the wealth gap However the implied message behind the movie is also matching with a complex base level story which surprises the audience with every passing moment No I know that many people are turned off at the sight of subtitles but I hope that if this is the only factor keeping you from watching this movie I beg you to overlook it and enjoy this incredible cinematic experience I think that this movie has a really unique way of showing the gaps between the social classes that exist I find that just like Metropolis there are several consistencies between the two but at the base of this there is one single theme The rich despite relying on the working class often take advantage of them Now this movie may have gone to the extreme showing how some people just can t take the oppression and they eventually crack but I think that it was important for the filmmaker to show how social conditions set up the downtrodden to fail I absolutely loved how this movie developed and found myself watching it three times in a row ad each time I discovered a new feeling for the film So that being said I gave this movie a 9 10 because I think that with every viewing there is more to take away from this film,9.0,5.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5281921/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2020,"Not that deep, severely overrated",There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot along with comedic dialogue but that s it It s not a metaphorical masterpiece that some critics and users are saying I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants,5.0,172.0,322.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5512155/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2019,Fiercely Original,One of the things I liked about the film 12 Years a Slave was that it punctured the idea of the happy slave Some slaves had the luck to experience better living conditions than others but none of them was ever allowed to forget that they were property If they had a nice master they might smile and exchange pleasantries but the seething resentment of having a master in the first place never went away A variation on the happy slave concept still exists in the world of today I think but it s been transferred to the serving class There s this pervasive notion that those who struggle economically are happy just to be employed by those who have more Maids nannies chauffeurs doormen what do they exist for but to make life more convenient for the wealthy and as long as they re well treated and paid for their efforts what do they have to complain about This dynamic is explored explosively in Parasite It s almost impossible to talk about the film without revealing its secrets and this is one film that works best the less you know about it It s funny scary suspenseful sad sometimes all at the same time It s playful yet serious Director Bong Joon Ho clearly has a ball playing with genres and constantly upending our expectations The fun of this movie is never knowing where it s going to go next It creates a metaphor for the increasing divide between the haves and have nots in Korea specifically but the world in general by presenting us with a filthy rich family that remains blithely unaware of those who in their eyes exist to do things for them even when those people are literally right under their feet There aren t good guys or bad guys heroes or villains At times you despise everyone in the movie at other times you feel compassion for almost all of them It s a movie that is many things at once and refuses to be categorized and as a result it looks much like our modern world Grade A,9.0,5.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5208659/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2020,No words,Parasite is undoubtedly the best film of the decade and my 2nd favorite film It s not as simple as it looks It has hidden meanings and metaphors The acting the direction the cinematography the screenplay all were excellent I didn t see any flaws in them Maybe for the first time a deserved movie won the oscar for best picture So the story is basically about how a poor family makes their way to become the servant of the rich family Just like how a parasite attacks their host they attack the rich s house The whole film is filled with metaphors and easter eggs You must watch at least 2 times to understand the hidden meaning Well even if it s in korean the subs are okay and you can live up with em The film tackle the class division with a satarical tone It s a must watch,10.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5568810/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,An incredible film which doesn't reduce itself to one genre,I expected a lot from Parasite Gisaengchung since it won the Palme d Or at the Cannes Film Festival and because i really like Bong Joon Ho s previous films Still it exceeded my expectations It s a comedy Drama Thriller and Horror film in one Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public The cinematography and mise en scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang Dong But the story is something else During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller horror I m not going to say more about the plot story than that because i don t want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything This film is simply a must watch No wonder it won the Palme d Or,10.0,14.0,21.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5150941/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2020,Nothing can kill him,One side is the flooded cabin the other side is the birthday party On one side is the cold hard gymnasium on the other side is the luxurious soft back garden The money was the iron and it smoothed everything out They surf the Internet live in basements and do whatever it takes to get a job Just when you think they re bad enough the movie suddenly reverses they re not the worst there s worse If you are rich there must be someone richer than you If you are poor there must be someone poorer than you The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into groups The wall stood immovable despite the wind sun and rain Mr And Mrs Park look silly but they are getting richer The Kim family is brilliant but they still can t turn over You think a good job and a good salary will lift you out of poverty You can wash the sweat out of your clothes but you can t wash the smell out of the basement where it has melted into your blood You ve climbed ten floors twenty floors and you ve probably just arrived in someone else s basement They are worms so they have a hard life They re bugs so nothing can kill them,9.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5577106/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2019,A Visual Treat,This film was the winner of the Palme D Or at Cannes One can imagine a lengthy standing ovation being given by the elite wealthy rich attendees who wished to laud this condemnation of their ilk Clearly that is what some reviewers garnered from their viewing of this interesting film But on the other hand there are others who view this film as a balancing act where there is no clear hero or villain As such it is a film that asks more questions than it answers One thing is certain this film is a visual treat Its portrayal of wealthy society and poorer culture pays great attention to detail Spaces are wonderfully composed and scenes are so well framed it is tempting to get lost in the visual details But there is a story to tell and it is compelling even if it is sometimes confusing or even inconsistent The point of view of the director is unclear until the ending And even then one wonders about the final lines which might contradict what has gone before The best clues to the intent of director Bong Joon Ho are his earlier films like Snowpiercer or Host which feel less ambiguous,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5268390/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2020,The Best Film I Have Ever Seen.,I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review I watch a lot of films typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two Out of all the movies I watched Schindler s List was my all time favourite That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho s work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of memories of murder that film is a masterpiece I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it I just can t stop watching this film No other film has had such a huge impact on me Everything is just perfect The story is unpredictable and extremely layered Every shot has a visual subtext The musical score is haunting to say the least I fear that Bong Joon Ho won t be able to top this film and every movie that he makes after this will be compared to Parasite I highly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece,10.0,17.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5420995/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,Parasite (2019),I find the film s visual symphonic The use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations Camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed The concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience Bong joon ho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions,10.0,21.0,33.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5432176/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2022,Exceptionally Good,Not just a regular story it s with a great rhythm starting as a beacon of hope then comes reality to shake the truth out The plot makes you feel you are reading one of Shakespeare stories where everyone dies in the end but it s not actually like that What is like to live in poverty How do rich people live Do we have a choice To sum up it s a very well written plot with a great cast who performed at their best Highly recommended 29 7 2022 the same day I know that my nephew is free,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8382375/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,Probably better if you go into it without massive expectations,First I d like to say that I really liked this movie It had a plot that instantly drew me in and characters that were easy to root for It told a difficult tale about class struggle without turning the main characters into 2 dimensional heroes It even ended with an unexpected intensity that I seriously doubt anyone saw coming All of that said it underwhelmed me It repeated things over and over again which was a plot device but made some parts really drag Moreover the film s failure to assign winners and losers in its conclusion made it intriguing but also left each character unlikeable and when all the characters end up being unlikeable it kind of leaves you feeling like the time you just invested was somewhat meaningless I probably wouldn t feel that way if I had gone into it with no expectations I may only focus on the good but unfortunately I only watched it after everyone said it was the best film of the year and after it became the first foreign film to win best picture at the Oscars I can only pass along my own subjective experience and that was it,8.0,4.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5487077/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2020,Enjoyable Satirical Drama,Most people will be intrigued as to how this movie won so many awards before they even watch it Most people won t watch as they can t be bothered with subtitles It s worth it A well constructed story of a family scheming to live off another family It s fun as the story unravels with a comedy yet sinister fashion Great acting all round with a decent script remember its subtitled but you get used to that and its not that demanding to read and the acting being that good makes it very easy to follow Parasite is a refreshingly different and keeps you watching with some twists and turns that make you wonder how its going to end Its well worth a watch and you ll enjoy,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6311196/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2020,A good film for Certain Audience; Not ME,Parasite is without a doubt a well thought good movie It s clearly that it took lots of brains and talent to produce such a tape It even has a message and on realities of society and a study on social classes in Korea It addresses the issue of attitudes and the way we look at life be it positive or negative it has a huge impact In addition in general i love Asian Cinema especially Chinese and Korean films BUT saddly this not for me I did not like it Did not enjoy it Once I hit the 90 minute mark i was just about to give up Still i stayed till the end because of the amazingly great reviews Korean movies are just fantastic and this might not be the exception I have seen many online and in cinemas they are AWESOME Parasite to me was annoying depressing negative a total tale of betrayal Parasite tries to teach that you must never open the doors of your house nor your trust to others or at least be super careful could be You can watch the movie and make up your mind You might be among the 99 99 of people who loves it I am in the 0 01 who do not my humble opinion,6.0,7.0,17.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5464820/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2022,"Very Good Movie, Very Over-Hyped",This movie is very good but watching it for the first time several years after it was very popular and all over the news it s obvious that it was highly over hyped at the time it was released The director is not a genius The story is not brilliant The actors actresses were not wonderful The director focuses the movie on modern issues with class that we all relate to You have sympathy for everyone in the movie from the rich people to the poor The story isn t exactly believable but it works to get the point across The actors and actresses all did well but to say that much of the acting ranges from wooden to incredible exaggeration is an understatement So I felt plenty of emotion watching this movie and I felt strongly for everyone in it But to say that this made me see or feel anything I ve never seen or felt before is as exaggerated as some of the hype about this movie I am not born again because I was witness to this movie but it makes you think and reflect on different people that these people remind you of in the real world Maybe if you are very much like any of the pathetic characters in this movie and believe me every one of them is absolutely pathetic then watching this movie may be like an earth shattering revelation But for the vast majority of us who live a very tamped down version of the existence of one or more of these characters watching this movie is just a bit like looking in a mirror causing you to pause and think about yourself and others And that is always very good Not great but very good,8.0,4.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8509491/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2020,Now I know Oscars can be bought,This is just an average movie with a sadistic story and with a sadistic message and no morale The director here has made the villains into heroes He is trying to show the world the good decent and innocent people are the real paracite of the world just becuase they are rich The director feels that being rich and having maids cooks teachers drivers is being a paracite The villain family who is poor and cheap they do not have any morals They are souless beings They just kill and lie to make themselves enter into a good man s home and his life So here the bad people are shown as winners and good people are really nice but they are brutally killed and cheated What is the motive or such filthy storyline There is nothing special about the movie I feel that those who give 10 10 are the people who feel that everything is fair in this world to rise at top Do you want to set such example for your kids and future Put yourself as the rich guy shown in the movie who dies brutal death without any reason Do you feel the good vibes after seeing the movie,5.0,8.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5610924/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2019,"A strange mix of genre styles (social drama, thriller and comedy all in one)",The appreciation for Parasite is I think partially dependent on the expectations that you have in advance I expected to see a movie in line with The handmaiden 2016 Chan Wook Park or an older example The servant 1963 Joseph Losey where the servants gradually take over the power My expectations where also rather high given the ecxellent South Korean thriller Burning 2018 Chang Dong Lee that I saw recently Both films share the same cinematographer Kyung Pyo Hong My expectations where not fulfilled There is no slow change in the power balance between masters and servants but the cunning servants overwhelm their naive masters in a breathtaking tempo In this stage the film has a caricatural comedy element in it that was not to my taste It is rather difficult to combine the crime and comedy genres and only the Coen brothers for example Fargo 1996 are able to do this job well One can also see the film in an entirely different way namely as a social drama about the gap between rich and poor In Parasite the rich and the poor are geographically seperated The poor are living downhill and the rich are living in the upper parts of town In film such a setting has ancient origins Think about a classic as Metropolis 1927 Frits Lang The subject of the gap between rich and poor is however still actual think of the writings of the economist Thomas Piketty At the same time as Parasite the latest film of Ken Loach was released Sorry we missed you In Parasite the underdogs of society are not so honest as in Sorry we missed you and controray to the combination crime comedy the combination social drama comedy works well It makes the film less moralizing I like to mention one element in the film that is easily overlooked but has for me a symbolic meaning At a certain point in the film the masters notice that their servants all have the same stuffy smell This smell comes from their damp apartment downtown The symbolic meaning for me was that the servants are judged after their origin and not after their capabilities In this way there is no upside social potential and the society becomes static Success is inheritable The youngest son of the masters is a bit strange and likes to be in the garden when the rain is pouring Visually this gives rise to some scenes that made me think of Prejudice 2015 Antoine Cuypers,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5307786/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2020,Masterpiece,With many other films out there pointing out of the problem of wealth gap and the struggle to survive in cities Parasite stands out being different because of its comedic effects and the sudden twists There are so many moments in the first half you can laugh with ease when the family use their wits to resolve problems But under that surface there is pressure building up and the dark finally emerges from the most grand looking house I was awed by the sudden twist The cinematic effect is great I was surprised to know that the mansion was purposely built for this film There are so many details that portrays the bitter sweet life of the struggling family,10.0,5.0,8.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5503750/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2020,"Good, but not great",Quite how this managed to win best picture at the Oscars is beyond me How it won best director is truly daft especially up against the magnificent Sam Mendes It s a really good first half of character set up though they themselves are never really developed witty and fast paced followed by a let down of a second half that doesn t deliver on its midway point revelations,7.0,5.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5491951/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,Parasite is a very rare film ...,Parasite is a very rare film IMDb have it listed as a Comedy Drama Thriller These three just don t do it justice It certainly has some very funny moments but it s equally depressing and sad both in a good way as it deals with tough subjects like injustice poverty and class It certainly is a drama each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate Yes you guessed it it s also a thriller the storytelling beautifully builds up twists and works to a crescendo However the film has so much more There s plenty of argument to add Horror Romance or Crime which are all blended into the colourful narrative Plus this film is the quintessential Family film yes the families are in interesting situations but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors Now it s a long way from perfect in my opinion I ve scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91 100 using my own scoring system I have my own detailed method It s certainly true that some people won t enjoy this film Of course the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous on a variety of subjects and positions You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious hero characters with whom you may struggle to empathise especially by the end and an unlikely main plot and close Personally none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way I d primarily put this down to the direction screenplay and acting There are small moments in the film which resonate as they underpin the themes I found Parasite thought provoking and engaging throughout,10.0,24.0,39.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5413566/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,Overhyped,I ll keep this as short and simple as possible Was at the top of my watch list until I heard from just about everyone I knew who saw it tell me it was okay Bar none So why I thought do all the Critics write about how great it is Or why the score is so high on IMDb And so my curiosity got the better of me Right from jump street they pulled that silly Korean movie humor You know the kind that everyone in the States pretends is funny but really isn t The fumigation scene as one example had me say aloud Not this stupid sh I m sure everyone south of the DMZ burst out into laughter so it must be cultural or something because it s not funny Next we have the poor who in this movie are poor for a reason And yet they are savvy hustlers that turn out to be smarter than the rich family Make any sense That rich family by the way being gullible enough to fall for just about every trick in the book I suppose they just got lucky prior to all this Satire or not is that really how life works The ending was predictable of course just not in the actual way it occurred Style points here I guess It s another one of those movies that s different Unfortunately that doesn t make it good Not bad but unimpressive,5.0,3.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8035818/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,Great concept with a mediocre ending,I think it s fair to point out that this film goes off the rails at the end I m not sure why the director thought it needed a big climactic ending It s a pet peeve of mine when a writer can t think of any other way to close a character arc or plotline then to literally kill off characters who no longer serve a purpose The finale here feels forced and out of place considering how methodical and slow burning the first hundred and twenty minutes were When your themes are so simple and messages so obvious plot and characters are all you ve really got to hang your hat on And in Parasite it falls flat And for those snobs who accuse everyone who finds any fault with this movie as some cinematically illiterate fool who only watches Hollywood blockbusters I think The Servant 1963 handled this same basic plot with more nuance and emotional impact,7.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6129056/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,Amazing,This movie shows exactly how it is to live in a country full of structural violence It shows perfectly the desperation of people in need to have a better life,10.0,11.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5452827/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2020,Even worse than Us,Calling this movie dreck does a disservice to dreck Message is simple Wealthy people crazy and evil Poor people understandably crazy and evil Only redeeming quality is dramatic twist at halfway point but even this soon resolves into poor people crazy and understandably evil Watched this because I had heard it had comedic elements and it had one if you think a pratfall is funny Hopefully the only reason this got Oscar talk is to prove non xenophobic cred of the Academy Please stay away from this grossly overrated dose of depression,1.0,36.0,78.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5454853/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2020,Great Thriller,This film is amazing Mixes elements of comedy suspense and drama in a beautiful manner I forgot I was reading subtitles after the film as I was so engaged during the screening Fantastic plot twists and very interesting and unique character developments Would give 10th star if it weren t for a couple plot holes,9.0,11.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456232/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2022,One of the most important films of this era,What does this film not talk about under the scenes Increasing inequality climate change lack of compassion from some ultra rich people All such topics are touched upon Yet the film shines in the way the movie addresses all these issues The director is a master in weaving entertaining narratives throughout seemingly mundane lives He thrills and entertains us throughout the film Finally he lets us go after delivering a masterpiece of a climax You will be left thinking about this film for ages Age of Empires fans do enjoy the references about the naval ship formations in the chair arrangement of the final party Maybe The Admiral Roaring Currents fans as well haha Only one scene feels forced the one with the driver character s unnatural anger with having to play a native tribesman for entertaining his boss son The emotions here feel a bit out of place as previously the driver was more than happy to be so well cared for and no visible tension was shown between them We are left to assume that he feels bad that his dignity is hurt in the enactment Yet this feels like a mis step in this otherwise masterly crafted film Ultimately this anger boils over to the finale So I m a tad bit disappointed that the depth was not addressed here Maybe this choice was made to keep the film taut and of a short running time As a whole this film is worth watching and is almost flawless in its presentation Definitely a must watch for anyone from anywhere living in this post Covid world too,9.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8221032/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,"Original, tense and wonderfully shot",A well deserved best picture A really unique storyline that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat I am not sure I ve ever seen a movie that I d classify as a comediac horror thriller but in a way Parasite was I loved the setting love how it was shot and the dialogue was incredible The only reason I m not ranking this higher is because I didn t like the dad killing the boss I don t think the storyline ever built that up properly and it bothers me,8.0,4.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5488354/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,Too many genres,While many people seem to have enjoyed the wild mix of genres it left me emotionally detached It starts as a fun plot about getting all members of a skilled yet unemployed Poor family working for a rich family without giving away that the poor people belong to the same family Taking away from the fun is the fact that the poor family are just horrible people getting rid of the last housekeeper by using her strong allergic reaction When the rich family is away the housekeeper returns and for some reason the poor family lets her in She then discloses that her husband has lived in a secret underground bunker under the house for years after which the tension increases The last part of the movie is more akin to a horror movie with a bloodie conclusion All these tonal shifts made it hard for me to view this movie with any emotional attachment I found myself analysing the movie more than enjoying it The performances of the actors seem stale and unmotivated with very little gesticulation or similar to express emotion that might be a cultural barrier but reduced my enjoyment nonetheless The soundtrack stayed in the background and I don t remember any of it The elephant in the room is of course the allegories and metaphors that everyone and their grandma seems to have found in this movie While I agree with quite a lot of the findings considering that I have very little knowledge about south korea metaphors do not make a movie magically better While telling a simple story in a complicated way can be an interesting experiment the movie cannot stand on it alone I would not have enjoyed or rewatched Memento if its gimmick of telling a simple story chronologically backwards was the only thing it had to offer The craftsmanship of Memento was really good from both actors and crew I missed the good craftsmanship in Parasite especially from the actors If you enjoyed finding all the references and it made you think about certain topics and made you feel a certain way then that is great for you but it is highly subjective and does not make the film the masterpiece of a century A good movie can have allegories and metaphors as the cherry on top A mediocre movie does not become a masterpiece by putting in a ton of metaphors for complex topics and hoping to stand on only this one leg I might have honestly enjoyed a movie that consisted only of an expanded first section With a more likable poor family lots of shenanigans to keep undetected and a simple story this film would have not received 4 Oscars and would not have been hyped like it has been but it would have been far more enjoyable for me But thats okay movies are not just made for me a lot of people seem to have enjoyed the movie so its current form definitely has a right to exist,6.0,2.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6821346/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,Amazing,First off I feel like you either get this movie or you don t that simple There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story I don t want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days,10.0,23.0,38.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5413766/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,Parasite and Schizophrenia,An incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease Schizophrenia There is a legend reality myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of Schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water Rarely documented as hard scientific fact it actually fits in quite well with the Masterful presentation of Parasite Throughout the movie one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism That things don t quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do with the help of a young man IMHO that has has all the tell take signs of the disease overrinflated worth that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance of upper class bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of South Korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the English language through delusion Validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from Princeton University verifying his talents Similarly his Mother as the rest of the family enslaved in Making a living through folding pizza boxes In his fantasy each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class In reality would never happen and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member What could be better A symbolic rock taken but gifted in the mind of the actor from the home of great distinction must be placed in the exact location it was taken from to complete the fantasy Clues were given throughout the movie just enough to have you scratching your head on the possibility of such an incredible sequence of events that only really made sense if it was only playing out in his mind and not reality Paranoia slips in with the hint that the family they are scheming somehow knows their plans of taking over the house For example his imaginary girlfriend not looking all the way under the bed where he was hiding in one seen as he covered his eyes as to make the discovery go away because of the mental trauma associated with such humiliation and embarrassment The Upper class father s suggestion that the panties left in his car made no sense to him yet he blamed his driver of poor conduct and infidelity anyway as a most revered and trusted employee And on it goes The young boy who needed art therapy and special treatment was actually the son of the outcasts as a young boy suffering a seizure in the first grade common for Central Nervous System Parasitic infections The final revelation occurred at the end of the movie completing his story with a letter to his father that he will eventually come and save him However earlier in the movie their home and the entire town was destroyed by s freak flood with contaminated water that displaced the entire community into a shelter Yet the basement the glass and the condition of the living space filtered through low lighting was still intact as was he holding on to the completed Memoir of his personal experience that was as real to him as day and night to you and I but only rang true through his tortured thoughts from a terrible disease Schizophrenia The reader is encouraged to do a search of two words parasite Schizophrenia for more expanded descriptions of Schizophrenia and the legend of Parasitic causes,9.0,25.0,41.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5409671/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,Most Overrated Foreign Movie Ever. EXPLAINED!,Anyone that thinks this movie is a masterpiece is incredibly dim witted I ll be explaining why this is factual and listing all the silly things done by the main cast 1 Infiltrating your entire family into the rich family s house They say it s hard to cover up one lie You know what s harder Covering up a whole lot of them and that s what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly All 4 family members had to fake their identity qualifications pretending to not be related to one another when they are while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up The Kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time 2 Kevin s best friend problem Your best friend has gave you an opportunity to earn some cash to replace him as a private tutor while he goes abroad He also tells you that he s coming back and will ask the rich s family daughter out who he was tutoring He has specifically told you that he s interested in her He also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldn t What do you think would happen when your best friend returns When he comes back to find out he has lost his job had his girl stolen right under his nose by his best friend and also finds out the best friend he confided in who has broken your utmost trust had his entire family infiltrated the rich man s family working under false pretenses A Is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you B Expose you and your entire family Apparently Kevin must have thought the answer must be A Anyone care to tell me The answer is B They would be exposed Who would have thought about that right 3 Dining in the rich man s house like you own the place Also with your whole family without a care in the world Yeah let us make a mess of this table get the wine get the snacks let s leave a it load of evidences that we had a party here Oh crap the rich man family is coming back Help I left so much mess here what do I do now 4 Fool me once shame on you Fool me twice shame on me Fool me thrice guess I m going to die Kevin why are you such a fool Your first mistake was not having the foresight with your best friend problem Second mistake was exposing your entire family and being held hostage by the hostages you were supposed to hold hostage Third mistake the most fatal mistake of them all why did even go back into the basement You had both of them trapped under There was no reason to go back You wanted to redeem yourself What did you want to do Kill them To silence them forever Well you failed miserably caused the death of your sister and almost got yourself killed I mean of all things you brought a rock you even dropped that rock C mon There s only so much incompetence I can tolerate from one character I could go on and on The rock and its supposed symbolism that doesn t exist How the ending went down the absurd morse code But I m tired tired of people over glorifying thinking this is masterpiece when it isn t of people explaining the hidden meaning of symbolism in different scenes that doesn t exist Like how going up the stars means ascending in social status how Jessica sits on sofa because she had a higher social status How the toilet being the highest point in the house is supposedly a symbolism All in all I don t actually think the movie was all that bad But grossly overrated Definitely not deserving of any Oscars that it has If you think otherwise you ve been factually proven wrong,1.0,49.0,86.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5512413/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,Parasite will leech into your heart.,An instant classic It s a rollercoaster of emotions that makes the heart pound and the breathing hitch Parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble Somehow these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the top The performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film Dialogue is very engaging and riveting it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all The story is well executed and well paced there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes The editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the film s atmosphere of tension and ease The statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night Overall it is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one of the parasites I am happy to have in my life,10.0,18.0,28.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5432236/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2020,Probably the first proper review..,Let s start with that I ve seen a lot It s all public In the most cases meta s score given to a movie shows a better rating a more realistic one compared to imdb I ve seen 1917 I was sick of that people don t even know what cinematography is The whole movie was made like Rope except that Rope had an amazingly interesting story 1917 had nothing in it Paths of Glory was in many terms a lot more realistic Long story short I didn t like 1917 at all I had no idea why it was even nominated Then I saw the Marriage Story As soon as I realised Adam Driver is in it Star Wars guy I just wanted to not like the movie because I don t like the new SW movies at all Then it turned out it was amazing He was very good the movie was very good I liked The Irishman too but the Marriage Story was superior Then came the awards and Parasite won I saw it has a score of 8 6 and I know the director He did a crime movie which I liked Memories of a Murder That one was very good So I just watched Parasite too It was interesting but maybe I ve seen too many actually good movies so I do not blow my mind just like that The characters were ok and maybe that s all The story was just interesting There was nothing special about it It was an original story but it won t make it good It has nothing to tell us It s pretty much like a half written mess If somebody works for me for years I won t fire him her just because a tale someone told me I would atleast question the worker Atleast At this point the movie was very unrealistic The smell factor We can t smell it But all that food as whiskey on that table has a strong smell You can clearly see under the table I just had no idea how is that realistic They were all given good wages and still they didn t take a shower or anything like that They did all smell bad Sooo unrealistic and because of it the father s motivation made absolute no sense No sense at all Especially in that situation It felt like they had to end the story somehow and they chose this way for some reason Other factors of the movie are no special neither Roma stands on 7 7 and is by far better in every aspect Currently I ve rated over 2500 movies I write scripts I m working on to direct one of my works myself and I have to tell you that this movie was just OK and I have really no idea why would anyone give it a score of 8 or higher If I would write and direct a movie like this I would be not satisfied Not at all For me it was 6 5 as it was interesting Also it s genre is drama thriller There was not a single second in the movie that was comedic,6.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5590672/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,A movie that stays in your head for weeks and weeks.,I ve never seen a movie do all the things that Parasite does and manage to do them so well It s a comedy thriller horror and heist film rolled into one meticulously directed and beautifully edited It remains entertaining while dealing with heavy topics on the nature of class and wealth While the movie takes some unexpected turns in tone it never feels disjointed Most importantly Bong Joon Ho has a way of relaying his social criticism in a nuanced manner so that the theme of wealth disparity doesn t devolve simply into the poor vs the wealthy narrative we see often in these types of dramas Rather he layers multiple shades of gray into the morality of characters giving them humanity and therefore a stronger verisimilitude to real people in current society It makes the movie s appeal universal After watching the movie I was floored It was the only thing I could think about for hours afterwards Even now I keep discovering another layer of interpretation behind a dialogue or scene And there is a lot to engage with when the film direction is so detailed Each shot and each line of dialogue is a result of careful storyboarding and writing Even the background details such as the brick walls and the litter by the Kims basement are painstakingly styled and arranged by the set designers And the result at least in my summation is a near perfect execution of a great film,10.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5498380/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2020,Seriously Flawed,It is incomprehensible to me that this film is acclaimed and possibly heading for an Oscar The primary flaw are the subtitles The dialog has been translated by a poor cousin of Google Translate and NEVER reviewed by someone who speaks English Grammar is out the window Literal word translations miss the meaning Subtitles are often flashed up so quickly that a native English speaker doesn t have time to read them The result of this subtitle travesty is that the plot is very hard to understand particularly the mid movie plot twists The overall plot is clear by the movie s end and decidedly unremarkable The cinematography is excellent The actors seem competent but reminiscent of Jackie Chan Overall rating a one of course the Hollywood sophisticates will disagree Don t bother watching this unless you understand Hangul,1.0,25.0,91.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5422370/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2020,"Intense, thrilling, unexpected.",This film was a lot I mean that in the best way possible It was the first movie that I watched in a long time that genuinely wanted to make me stand up take a deep breath and scream WHAT THE This is one of the first films I have watched in a language other than English with subtitles I thought that I had this movie more or less figured out at the beginning but it escalated just so damn quickly and turned from a comedy heist film into a pretty messed up thriller drama Like when it all started up I was like oh haha funny comedy about a family scamming their way into the household of a richer family using entertaining and complex tactics yay and then about halfway into the movie my brain just did a hard reset which went something along the lines of WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MOVIE This film is so beautifully original and well crafted and throughout the entire thing there were so many levels which spoke truths about classism and the rich poor divide Bong Joon Ho is brilliant at creating an air of deadly suspense and i was on the edge of my seat the entire time Only after you finish the movie do you realise just how potent and genius that title is who truly is the parasite Wait it s both of them The cinematography and the clean modern feel was beautiful visually and juxtaposed strikingly with the horror I kept seeing And almost all the time especially in the second half I had no idea what was happening and I had no idea what came next And oh the suspense the way it was built gave me that sinking feeling in my stomach that something was about to go horribly horribly wrong People have got to get over themselves when it comes to subtitles and discover the great foreign films such as this that are out there Sasha,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6285491/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2020,"One late parasite, many doubts about what awards should mean",After 30 minutes you should notice this is not a proper comedy as something bad must happen Now a lot of spoilers please do not read the rest if unwanted Poor married and loving couple with two children get all of them hired by a rich family To accomplish this they use false identities lie and deceit what involves accusing previous servants also poor and weaker of evil deeds and behaviors Although they all have no job and don t even know how to fold pizza cardboards they magically excel in their different roles as language teacher fake fine arts psychologist high end car driver and maid cook housekeeper The rich man owns a successful business and both he and his not so loved wife are basically naive notwithstanding that they have an issue with poor people s sweat and soap The situation turns difficult when the previous housekeeper reveals that she has her husband hiding in the basement what damages the staging of those who are not even shy about using the foster home as if it were a stable So the joke is over and now they kidnap torture and commit murder When the tortured gets released a massacre begins The poor irresolute dad gets finally angry because the rich dad thinks of his own son first and kills him Then he flees and takes refuge in the basement becoming the only real parasite he lives on what he can steal which the previous occupant did not The circle is closed when his son decides to do what apparently the bourgeoisie commonly do study work get rich and buy the house to free his father Note everything would have been better from the start if he or anyone else in the family had taken that path maybe hitting them with a not so deadly stone would had it done The idea that this is an allegory about something seems to make no sense Inequality and injustice implies that someone has no opportunity to improve or it is denied but it is not what happens here If we try to look for any subsequent message we would get some quite implausible ones For example a Poor people are cunning envious and even murderous by nature but this is untrue and not the case for the laid off servants b Rich people are bad and mean as don t care about the poor but they would not be so so naive worry about their children or give jobs to people who needs them c Poor people are allowed to commit unspeakable acts because it is their right to defend themselves from the power of the rich but there is always someone poorer and richer than you then you would be able to hurt someone s while tolerating being hurt by other s d The exploitation of man by man explains some inconceivable acts but only from the perspective of a decadent bourgeois morality what would imply that the final solution is the absolute independence of the individual transforming him her into a freelancer whatever the society where he or she lives and nobody applicable also to film writers or directors should hire work assistants or home employees even more as they are probably poorer and will cheat due to some particular exploited s moral rules Of course the son would hire no one but enslave his parents In my opinion this plot is just a sarcastic farce much closer related but not comparatively valuable since Aristophanes to Shakespeare Lewis Carroll the Marx Brothers Naked Gun Monty Python The Simpsons Shitt s Creek and so on That solves many of the prior questions as irrelevant But with a vengeance many viewers empathize with the mere criminals or their mean strategy simply because of this world s uneveness and or they anticipate or been told that so is the right thing to do Some others like me will just retain some worthy scenes and dialogues and forget the rest as a failed attempt And hopefully future reviewers may enlighten us with much better insights The Oscar not the story made it indispensable at least to alert the jurors to be more mindful Without such a prize my rating would be one notch above,4.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6116072/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,"Absolutely amazing, a masterpiece, but that ending...",I just finished the movie and it s truly a masterpiece from the combination of drama comedy horror to the detailed portrayal of social inequality If I could point out just ONE thing I didn t like is how they toss the writing right at the end So the kid says he s going to get rich and so he does After the movie was making a clear statement of how difficult it is for the poor to level up I just found that particular part to be too easy But other than that it is a superb film,9.0,4.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5462326/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2021,"Sensational, for the wrong reasons.",If this was the best picture of 2020 then it doesn t say much for the rest It starts off ok a comedy but slips into a darker shade of comedy After about an hour it is getting well into black comedy and the last 20 minutes it becomes a slasher movie I don t think I have ever watched a film when I have wanted to stop watching with 10 minutes to go Very unrewarding,4.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7649462/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,It's ok to stand out from the crowd,I am content with myself that I find I am literally the only person on the planet who hated this movie I found the acting amateurish at best and the script was so wooden it s amazing they didn t carve the read sheets onto tree trunks Not gory not suspenseful not entertaining boringly predictable 2 hours of my life I won t be getting back,1.0,32.0,70.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5475462/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,Overrated,Parasite reminds me of those novels you sometimes read in English class or a literature club ala Ulysses and you had to appreciate all the intricacies themes and symbolism or risk looking uncultured But those novels missed something really important that gets lost in all the circlejerking about the symbolism and little details whether or not its actually interesting to read Whether it provides a good story good dialogue good characters Similarly Parasite is a movie rich in themes and symbolism What I particularly liked is the mature exploration of class dynamics Its the obvious central theme of the film and its done very well I dont think anything in Hollywood could ever manage to explore this theme with such nuance and maturity This movie is also a really good work of art The direction is top quality and it effortlessly goes from comedy to family drama to horror to thriller and then finally ends in a Tarantino esque finale But the actual plot of the film The dialogues the drama its all mediocre at best What really happens in this film What makes a viewer curious interested surprised How do the characters develop how does the plot develop where and when is there interesting dialogue that pulls you in In my opinion the overarching script of this movie is not particularly strong when you evaluate it in terms of core storytelling And worse it doesn t use its runtime well in order to tell whatever it wants to tell And while a film critic might be impressed by its symbolism and the way it shifts in tone and genres I think it actually detracts from the viewer experience if the primary aim of the viewer is to see an enjoyable movie I m far from someone who merely enjoys popcorn fiction There s a reason I hate Marvel movies But I also think that a movie has to strike a balance I don t think Parasite did that I think it has benefited from collective overhyping that is partially a result of the heaps of praise by critics and partially because it is a decent movie released in a time of popcorn movie trash,6.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7860651/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2019,Parasite,Joon Ho Bong is a true master of story telling The concept of Parasite is tremendously original yet feels simple and close to life and as the story progresses unexpected twists and imagination are around every corner The entire film is well chiseled in every aspect The use of color and the overall cinematography editing of the film is top class not just for an Asian film but for any Hollywood blockbusters Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no doubter masterpiece At the end of the day the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn t exist anywhere else in the world and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale,10.0,8.0,24.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5017174/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2023,I LOLed,I m just laughing at some of the one star reviews on here They actually admit fast forwarding through parts of the movie and then complaining that the movie made no sense or had no direction Big LOL and that s why you have to be careful of some of the reviews here Even some of the 4 and 5 star reviews makes it clear these people did not watch this film or partially watched it with one eye on their Instagram feed or simply don t know what they re talking about Well it won Best Picture of the Year at the Oscar s becoming the first foreign film to accomplish that and well deserved So much for the few low reviews This movie is a rare moment in modern cinema considering how bad movies have been in recent years coming out of Hollywood South Korea may singlehandedly save American cinema by reminding them how to make a spectacular movie Let me be clear it s the best movie of the last decade Period If you re a serious person and love top tier cinema then this movie is an absolute must,10.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9030183/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,Best film I've ever seen,Had a free screening at our campus What I like is that it could have been mean spirited at any point but it seems to have compassion for every party involved no matter their transgression you understand and sympathize with them This is way different than current day films such as Knives Out or the other nominees where the social critique involves mockery and derision of the villains I wonder if it s the difference between hollywood white privilege vs korean cinema coming from an entirely different position of the socio economic hierarchy,10.0,22.0,39.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5439404/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2022,Brilliant,There are few words to say about this masterpiece this is a movie that in my opinion is simply wonderful The plot is wonderful with continuous twists and variations the direction is perfect the shots are one more beautiful than the other so much so that even the smallest action scenes are more than understandable and the soundtrack is beautiful but certainly not memorable however beautiful The performances are perfect but unfortunately I have to make a small criticism but not to the film itself if you have to watch it try to watch it in the original language because the dubbing at least in Italian made me not a little disgusted Finally I can only say that everyone must see this movie before they die,9.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7917865/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2020,"Hits Every Mark It Sets For Itself, And Falls Into None Of The Possible Traps. Justly Celebrated.",Metaphors can be a problem in any piece of storytelling if the creator becomes so wedded to the metaphor that it al becomes either too obvious or too forced and the narrative collapses under the weight of the meaning being attached to it Simply describing the central metaphor of Parasite in the way it speaks to the film s theme of the rich poor divide might make it seem that it s obvious but it works deliciously The plot is all sleek smooth lines akin to the architecture of the house in which most of the film takes places the metaphor is easy to grasp but never simplistic Indeed this is one of those rare works of art that neither romanticises the poor nor demonises the rich and it goes even better by excusing no one from their sins It also switches genres deftly from the delicate comedy of the first hour to the comedic drama thriller of the second half Other genre tropes are cleverly employed especially hinting at aspects of horror and science fiction nodding more than once to HG Wells War Of The Worlds amongst others The film moves gracefully to a conclusion that s startling and that also seems somehow written in the stars in the hands of an inferior artist it would be schlocky and clumsy here it simply works as it s intended to Similarly the film s epilogue avoids sentimentality and manages to pack an emotional punch That the film achieves all this within a seamless whole that is at once perfectly constructed but still humane and truthful is the reason is this film is so justly celebrated,10.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5923810/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2019,wars of the classes,We ve only been through the middle of 2019 but I think that I can mark the fact that I experienced the cinema event of the year or at least one of the important events of the year in movies This is the film by Korean director Joon ho Bong Gisaengchung Parasite It has already received Palme d Or at the Cannes festival and this time I believe that the jury s choice is extremely appropriate Parasite is a profound and complex cinematographic work which does not hesitate to ask painful questions about the huge differences between the social classes and the deep prejudices that divide them in today s world but it does so in an elegant and expressive way with images and characters who have a chance to remain in the memory of the spectators for a long time causing them to reflect but also engaging them with a captivating story At the center of the story of the film are two families from today s South Korea located at the two extremes of the society The Parks live in a spacious and luxurious villa full of works of art and surrounded by green landscape He is the CEO of a large company she is a spoiled housewife the kids a girl and a boy are even more spoiled They are all surrounded by servants drivers tutors for children The Kis live crammed into an unhealthy half underground flat The parents are unemployed their children are smart young people but with little chance of overcoming their social condition because of the poverty The homes of the two families play a significant role in the story the luxury and order of the Parks villa hides secrets while the claustrophobic disorder of the Kis family home is similar to that of the family in the movie Shoplifters of the Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda The destinies of two families accidentally intersect when the boy in the poor family becomes with the help of forged references the private tutor of the daughter of the rich family As relationships intensify cultural differences seem to diminish the less fortunate family being equal or even superior in adapting to life and in the cultural interactions Until about halfway through the movie the audience is watching a social satire in a light style a kind of rich family vs poor family story And then everything changes A few weeks ago writing about another Korean film I noticed that many of the films that came from there defy genre cataloging and combine different styles into original and surprising mosaics Parasite is yet another example in this regard We have here manifested social satire melodrama humor love among teenagers horror in the Gothic style comments on art a natural catastrophe neo realistic poverty and soap operas wealth Stanley Kubrick and Yorgos Lanthimos are quoted The natural tendency of the spectator to take the part of the oppressed in the class conflict that takes place in front of us is put to the test by the events that happen on the screen Parasite is an excellently acted movie filmed in style a story with many ramifications and meanings which will not be easily forgotten by the spectators and which gives them material to think about the society and the world in which we live,9.0,7.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5049194/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2019,SO GOOD!,Although Bong Joon Ho s American movies have been subpar his Korean movies still continue to be must see especially on the big screen His direction and attention to detail is something to marvel at Every scene has a plethora of minuscule features hidden in plain sight of the background which most certainly was not put there by accident If you have seen Joon Ho s other film you would know that Bong punctiliously puts all of these portend in the back drop of his scripts Honestly this is one the few movies in a long time that I can appreciate the emotions it put me through after watching it I can t stop thinking about all the excitement agony disturbance turmoil and sorrow that was brought upon me Bong did a tremendous job creating the atmosphere with the music and complexity of his characters It certainly deserves the Palme d Or I haven t seen The Lighthouse yet and all the praise that comes with it I hope Parasite gets an Oscar nomination for best picture but I m most certain it won t because it s an international film bunch of cowards This film is a great social commentary of the economic gap between the rich vs the poor a common theme for Korean movies At the beginning the Kim family seems to be like hearted and content on being good people Later on after making money beyond their wildest dream they slowly started to change For example before when the drunken guy was peeing in front of their house they were content on keeping to themselves and let him be After the money had been rolling in they decided that they had enough status to throw water at the drunken guy and kicked him out Not to mention that they were willing to kill the maid and her husband just so they can keep their image My favorite scene is when the sister is sitting on top of the flooding toilet smoking a cigarette For some reason that scene just resonates with me She had been putting on this act for so long and just found out that her home had been flooded Her home the place where she can drop her act and truly be herself is now gone So she sits there on top of a toilet that s now bursting with back flow of fecal matter and septic waste She takes a puff from a lit cigarette in between her fingers hoping that for just one minute she can drop her guard The dad tearing up as he carries what little belong he has left from his flooded home was my second favorite scene of the film He had for the longest time wanted the rich home and forgot where he came from and what a home is to him From what I just said above I feel like an unspoken character in this movie is the rich house Everybody strives to get to the house for no other reason than their selfish greed and appraisal for a higher status The basement is where you can go and hide to get away from your mistakes The son after he gets out of the hospital went back to the house to check on I presume the girl They are all drawn to the place As a cinephile I was pleased to go into this blind The less you know the better and the more suspense you will feel There are so many layers that keeps getting uncovered at each act The twist and turns in the third act is worth the price of admission alone The only drawback I have for the US release is the film was very limited in my area It wasn t too bad for me but from what I read other people said that the closest theater playing Parasite for them was over 50 miles away I know that not a lot of Americans care for foreign films but you are really doing yourself a disservice by demarcating yourself and not seeing it,10.0,4.0,8.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5215063/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,A realistic movie without being necessarily realistic,The movie is very well planned if the viewer isn t watching closely he or she may lose a few details that make this movie so great The movie makes people feel every type of emocion and makes you understand different types of realities I really recommend and better to watch it without any clue of what is about to happen,10.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5496234/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2019,Equal parts of every emotion - so simple yet so complex,PARASITE was the most unique movie I saw in 2019 The Lighthouse High Life and The Beach Bum came close but this took the cake It was kind of like a mushroom trip mentally in the sense that it manages to make you feel a little bit of every single type of emotion without diving fully into any of them It manages to weave in and out and being humorous intriguing and disturbing consistently and somehow seamlessly all while somehow feeling very simple and extremely complex at the same time It s a film that is fully progressive in a structural sense And it leaves you with the right amount of minor questions and wonders Quite a fascinating and accomplished movie worthy of the hype for sure This BONG JOON HO is truly a crafty movie smith His THE HOST was my favorite film of 2006 upon seeing it OKJA was a lot of fun a couple of years back and this easily lives up to those two if not surpasses them This is not a movie I could watch over and over again because it is very much a producer of slow burning anxiety yet it is a near masterpiece if not a thorough one Recommended,9.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5285912/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2020,Class Division and Lack of Empathy - Is It Innate?,Bong Joon Ho s tragicomedy that is a comedy without clowns and tragedy without villains Ho 2019 is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite making sure to land both class realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting meticulous production design and breath takingly purposeful cinematography Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes refreshingly the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child no such barrier is present and they are on the same side Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans,9.0,11.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5448386/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,"Parasite, A movie that gets under your skin.",Much like it s creature name sake Bong Joon ho s Parasite is a movie that latches on to you and won t let go The story of Parasite revolves around a poor family that cons a rich family into hiring them and once the poor family becomes integrated to the rich family the selfishness of the poor family starts to threaten everything Multiple times in the film We are shown scenes of the humiliation abuse and the depravity of the poor family the scenes themselves have a sense of morbid joy as they are so well shot and it feels so earned that its hard to look away The shots are there to tell a story and not used as gratuitous fillers for shock value Parasite is a movie that challenges us to rethink how we live our lives and just how deep do we affect those around us,9.0,11.0,16.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5432229/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2020,Nothing Extraordinary,I m not really sure why this film is so incredibly well regarded I feel like it was hyped up heavily pre Oscars based on momentum buzz but the end product has me confused because there s absolutely nothing ground breaking here Was it the fact that it was filmed in South Korea Maybe people are so used to the K pop fluff garbage coming from SK that when something of actual artistic substance is produced via their pop culture it gets blown out of proportion when compared to their usual fare Let me say now Parasite is in no way a bad movie It has something to say the plot is decent and it is well shot But the plot line and story itself isn t really saying anything new or different that hasn t been done via Hollywood in the past I also felt like some of the performances weren t A material probably why the film wasn t nominated for any actual acting awards The main male child and dad did good enough work the daughter and mom and the members of the rich family Not so much Basically throwaway performances Again not a bad film but if you are looking for a revolutionary vision and message keep looking,4.0,5.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5483615/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2020,super unpleasant and creepy,Yes this movie is well filmed and well acted yes if you have the time and interest you can speculate about what the movie might mean as an allegory i m sure the theory and politics of the movie are admirable BUT 90 of the film is simply unpleasant to watch none of the major characters is likable much less heroic no one succeeds or even grows every character is amoral one small example out of dozens a young man going overseas to college gifts our penniless protagonist a job tutoring a wealthy 15 year old girl in return for the promise to keep her away from dating til the student returns from overseas and the girl turns 18 our hero without a moment of hesitation betrays his friend and starts a romance with his student i read that get out originally ended with the hero dying that jordan peele added the rescue after preliminary focus groups said they hated the movie parasite feels to me a horror movie like get out without the redemptive ending or think inglorious basterds without the redemptive ending,3.0,17.0,48.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5402226/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2020,A Perfect Film,Parasite is done exactly how a perfect film should be The exposition introduces the characters their personality and characteristics their significance and what they mean in the context of the film in a way that is interesting well paced and fresh I deeply cared for the well being and outcome of all these characters and found myself taking their perspective and cheering on their misadventures It s a difficult task to get an American audience to connect with an impoverished Korean family but Bong Joon ho does it perfectly The narrative element is used more to paint a conceptual picture giving us insight into the ambitions and motives behind the characters The film takes long winding turns Viewers who go in expecting an easy watch or a simple lesson are going to get much more than they anticipated The film also does well to never put itself in a box At times it is comedic often thrilling very dramatic and sometimes even horrific It has highlights in all categories of appeal I have nothing bad to say This is the first film I ve watched where I was sure that every moment was done exactly right,10.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5956363/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2019,"Inventive, original and well acted",What is it with foreign movies they just seem to be able to pull a new idea out of the bag and deliver it with aplomb and this social commentary of Korea and the world in general is no exception Different culture different ideas and way of life perhaps but this movie applies equally to West as it does East and pulls out all the stops to deliver an excellent nights viewing Very well acted and produced this just goes to show that there are a shed load of new ideas out there if one is just willing to look for them,8.0,3.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5101761/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2020,a very capable film maker here who needs to get himself a decent script writer,One of director Bong Joon Ho s favourite cinematic ploys is to mix up the genres I remember being most unhappy watching his earlier Host 2006 when a perfectly acceptable horror film was interspersed with social comment on the various family members back home There are great films and great genre films and I can enjoy both but they are different animals Mr Ho seems to want to do away with the thoughtful script and writing needed for the former and use a mixing of the genre to make up for lack of depth With Parasite we have for about an hour a very decent story building even if it is becoming more and more far fetched The big surprise certainly surprised me but not as much as the change that then befall the film and my mind began to wander as all the seriousness fell away We have a very capable film maker here who needs to get himself a decent script writer Writing is clearly not his forte and his urge to slip off piste needs in my opinion to be restrained so that his wondrous cinematic chemistry can cook away without losing the plot,7.0,3.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5492956/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2020,"Clever premise marred by conventional, sappy ending",I became mildly interested in this movie when a student mentioned it in my horror film class However I became skeptical when the film went all mainstream by snagging the Best Picture Oscar I was right to be hesitant This movie has some strengths including its cinematography and stunning musical score but its story line goes wildly astray in its second half Here we have the story of an impoverished family of freeloaders who ingratiate themselves into the lives and home of a wealthy family Just when it looks like they ll get away with their scam everything is threatened by the return of the family s fired homemaker At this point the movie careens into thoroughly unlikely territory that is slightly reminiscent of recent horror movies like Get Out and The Hostel There are indeed moments of high tension such as when the family has to sneak out of the house when their hosts are sleeping nearby A Noah s Ark level rain shower and flood is good for its special effects but does nothing to advance the story The movie s maudlin ending is the weakest part of the film By the time the movie reaches its denouement the audience doesn t like what remains of the family and doesn t give a fig about its Morse Code messaging To me the ending seemed haphazardly slapped on because the producers didn t know how else to end this work Anti climactic to the max,5.0,4.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5499115/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2019,A Good Satire about Social Class,Parasite is a very enjoyable film There are no heroes in this story just tragic anti heroes The first half of the film is a convenient build up to a spectacular second half It is a satire that pits the have and have nots against each other Morality is lost somewhere in the need for survival It s a enjoyable film with an unexpected ending Definitely worth a watch for a Cinema lover The subtitles are not hard to follow for a Non Korean audience I dropped it from 8 stars to 7 because of some voice over narration towards the end that was very different from the tone of the rest of the film,7.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5243395/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2019,What a thought provoking story,This film tells the story of a family that stops at nothing to achieve what they want in life This is a really good story that keeps me at the edge of my seat even though there is nothing adrenaline inducing The suspense is quite chilling and I jus cannot wait to find out what will happen in the end It is a sad and thought provoking story which begs for much deep analysis and soul searching,0.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5280133/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,Parasite,Parasite 2020 15 Director Bong Jun Ho Starring Kang ho song Sun Kyun Lee Yeo Jeong Jo Woo sik choi so damn park Jeong Eun Lee Hye jin jang Ji so Jung etc Overall rating 99 100 Parasite is based on a poor Korean family who thanks to their son tutoring a family s daughter con there way into a rich family s life but not everything is great as it seems WOW what a movie one of the best films and some of the best directing I have ever seen so many good things to talk about here so let s get started here First of all the performances and the Kim family were very interesting Everyone s performances here was fantastic and I am surprised the actors are not getting more recognition here Everyone did a very nuanced and excellent job at showing the cleverness of the characters and how far the characters will go not to get found out I also found the Kim family very interesting I loved how they were slowly one by one making their way into the house and the whole family had completely different personalities which I also appreciated Next the film built tension really well and used gore effectively This film balanced so many tones well but I think it balanced the tenseness very well Due to being confined to the house for a large majority it was very claustrophobic for the characters And some of the camerawork when the family was hiding was truly fantastic and made you feel tense in general but also for the characters involved They also used gore very effectively as well It wasn t overused but it didn t need to be but it was used enough to leave an impact in the perfect way They happened more out of nowhere which was excellently executed and very startling Next the films cinematography and set pieces were fantastic Wow this film was an absolute feast for the eyes whether it was the attention to detail through the camerawork or using normal props like peaches or tents in a completely different way this film was just so detailed and masterfully filmed it was insane to watch The set pieces were also fantastic I loved the deliberate sharp contrast between the rich and the poor house and both were explored very well the poor house of the Kim s was extremely cramped and they gave you a good visual representation of what living in the slums would be like but the contrast of the rich families house was fantastic it had so many different components to it and each part of the house was explored well it was a great playground for some fantastic and cleverly put together scenes My next two positives would be the humour and the fantastic final act Parasite had a fantastic comedic undertone to it that worked really well the dynamic between the Kim family really worked and they had some great comedic moments together that reminded me of my own family in places similar to the gore it wasn t overused and I am glad it wasn t as otherwise the film wouldn t of worked as well but it was used enough to get a few good laughs out of me I also have to commend Bong Jun Ho for a truly fantastic final act that was completely unexpected I didn t know what was going to happen which was fantastic and left me wanting to know what happens next and where they ended up going with the film took me by complete surprise but in the best way possible huge respect for Bong for his masterful directing here My final two positives that really made the movie phenomenal was its exceptional script and deep and truthful themes about the class divide in today s society Wow I think this film had the best script I have ever had the pleasure of hearing The amount of amazing comments on society and clever ways to develop the characters I was in awe of the films cleverness The films messages about the class conflict in today s society were so insightful it really made me stop and think which is what a good movie shall do How the film portrayed the naivety of the upper class and how unaware they are of the struggles of the poor was excellent The ending was also showed the harsh brutality of where the poor is places in society and that is sadly underneath the rich which was really impactful for me I gave this film 99 only because it took me a fair amount of time to realise the true message of the film instead of straight away But there was just so many little messages that were conveyed so well it really made you think Overall parasite is one of the best films I have ever seen with masterful directing cinematography screenwriting and performances which leads to an exciting rollercoaster of a film that will leave you shocked and make you think more deeply about the state of the world class system,10.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5518099/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2021,"IMDB raters,you did it once again !",TLDR Worst movie I have ever seen without a dobut Plot There is a poor and a rich family The poor family lives in a small apratment somewhere outside of the city while the rich family lives in a big mansion The son in the poor family somehow becomes a teacher of the daughter of the rich family although he is uneducated and not qualified for that job That simply makes no sense to me Then he gets the job for his sister who becomes a psychologist for the rich s family young son while also not being qualified for the job and he presents her as Jessica who used to study in America and not as his sister The movie becomes pretty predicatble and naive at this point everybody can realise that they will eventualy get jobs for both their parents and that their goal is to kick the rich family from the house which is really shallow plot if you ask me Then the daughter of the poor family leaves her underwear in the car what makes the father of the rich family fire the driver and you guessed it he hires the father of the poor family as a new driver although he doesnt have any recommentadions i don t count fake recommendations here And then the poor family founds out that the maid is alergic to peaches and they get her sick As a big surprise the mother of the poor family becomes a new maid What a deep movie so far As very smart criminals they let the old maid get into the house and she visits her housban in the basement where he has been living for four years Yes you have read it correctly he has been living in the rich s family basement for four years without anybody noticing it Then the poor family and old maid her housband get into a fight instead of cooperating thogether in order to steal as much money as they can At this point I asked myself can it get more shallow than this Then there is 50 ish minutes of them fighting and hiding in the house without rich family noiticing that they are there And finally the husband of the old maid who is btw insane what is disgusting comes out of the basement and tries to kill people what is very badly acted REWIEV The plot is so shallow predictable and stupid Rich family is fireing their employers without any real evidence of them doing something wrong but just because poor s family members told them so And then they are employing the rest of the poor family memebrs mom and dad without them having any job experience nor recommendations I understand that the poor family members are suposed to be the villains here but they r not interesting vallians like president Snow in The Hunger Games or Darth Vader in Star Wars or Joker in Batman seriesThey are not vallians they are just parasites They are not even smart criminals but rather stupid ones like burglars in Home Alone First 30 minutes of the movie were OK ish and i would rate them 6 10 but after that it gets super predictable and shallow There is also a guy in the basement who is pressing the switch with his head which is really really disgusting I wish there is option to rate this movie 0 10 and turn back time so i can not watch this movie and live my life for extra 2 hours in total This is one of those movies that makes me want to live the Earth and find a new planet to live In my opinion how this movie has 8 6 rating and has won Oscar is bigger mysteria than how the univers was created I am so disgusted by this movie that even though I made my imdb account back in 2013 I decided to write my first rewiev,1.0,7.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6653606/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2022,It's uuuh... long... And VERY overhyped.,So I m curious this won awards with all of its plot holes and terrible ending Can t decide what tone it wants to have can t conclude a story instead doing the most open ended ending in the history of endings Starts mini plots about people getting into a relationship that you d think will lead to something but instead just leaves it all hanging and thus leaving me hanging after watching it for over two hours And frustrated And this won awards and is so overhyped Let s back up The concept is nice and simple Parasite doesn t stand for yet another zombie movie but rather a social parasite a bunch of manipulative poor people slink their way into working for a rich family and eventually even living in their house It s a decent comedy fairly original but it s just soooo loooong Over 2 hours that feel like 5 and a lot of it is just boring talk that should ve been cut Because if that was done this would ve been a great comedy Not ha ha funny but still quirky and weird enough to bring a smile to someone s face But it s long not that funny not that well written borders on kid show style comedy and since it also doesn t have a single likeable character I can t say I loved it I know idiots will write about metaphors and what not even though this movie is basically beating you across the face with what it s about there s no metaphors don t expect anything too deep Or deep at all The ending was pretty predictable and shall we say NOT GOOD AT ALL so yeah I didn t really get much laughs out of this it wasn t very interesting and it ended in a way that made me feel like I really wasted my time there,4.0,6.0,21.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8716278/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,Detritivores,Oscars best picture Cannes winner lauded and acclaimed and a good and engaging film from beginning to ending Good in most respects but mainly it has a catchy hook An engaging premise A peculiarity in its treatment of subject and theme I would not agree that such novelty of idea makes by itself for an award winning finished film and certainly in this case I am fairly confident that the film as a whole is much less than the vigor of its animating conceit it s reason to be made Ancient issues of human inequality of life invested with a catchy and up to date arrangement is a neat idea hardly groundbreakingly original in world cinema but it s a neat idea Essentially a pursuit in dramatic film of the degree to which upstairs downstairs conditions the life choices circumstances and outlooks of people caught on opposite sides how it warps and differentiates lives lived to ultimately decide whole human lives without their own input This have and have nots and how the other half lives drama is not new and indeed it has precursors in western and eastern film and broader fiction The manner of this drama is in two stages firstly the ingratiating invasion of the rich households retinue by the Kim family eventually completely usurping the established retainers and then secondly the heightening of the old household staff reappearing and ultimately revolting against their disposition all transpiring almost entirely under the noses and beneath the awareness of the upstairs haves the Park family That s it That s the best idea The enervating treatment of an old dramatic theme of rich and poor It s a good film in its runtime reasonably written except in certain unbelievable characters and relationships an insistence on a highly risky full assault on employment opportunities by the Kim family that I baulked at whilst watching and a missed opportunities to illuminate the host family of upstairs the Parks The acting was usually reliable although few actors were required to display much range in their performance A major problem was scenes of drinking drunk acting was unconvincing Direction and editing were certain if uninspiring Technical virtues included a sympathetic use of sound design and a well chosen pallet of colours plus an interesting main location at the Park s house Certain limitations in writing include the Kim daughters character who I found utterly unconvincing and unbelievabile as presented she is intelligent resourceful outgoing manipulate skilled and also beautiful young female and single and yet none of this seems remotely relevant to the young woman we meet at the films inception was she being kept in a freeze dried bag until the day before the narrative opens How can she exist in her environment without these character details having very pertinently pressed upon her life As the film proceeds she serves to help other family characters but otherwise she is a doll in a costume after that The Kim mother is barely recognizable as a full human character with genuine characteristics and a independent life Her marriage is seldom testified to is it good to bad or bad to good how do they feel to each other and about each other what little closenesses do they share unique to them I dunno Compared to the Kim men the two females are badly nourished as characters and conspicuously so in the case of the daughter The Park s family hints having real human people in it but by the end of the film even the husband who seems quite human at times is left uninteresting and unconsidered The idea that they have a real life with skeletons in cupboards was absent Only the phrasing of the husband to relate about his main encounters with the Kim s father to his wife with phrases about crossing the line and subway people seemed to expand their humanity There are 3 marriages featured in the film plus a teenage relationship and only the third and final couple of the displaced housekeeper actually seem to have a lived in married life that feels like it proceeds the story concerning the film The full attack upon maximum employment by the Kim family seemed to me to be an extremely ungainly insistence for the film to impose on my disbelief but it had to do it to develop it s plot line Finally in passages the film hints at metaphorical depths such as its talking about light it s use of rain storms and catastrophic floods underground dwellings and the rock scholars stone These metaphors interact with the upper class airy people and the ground dwelling lower class people but here I would have appreciated some second unit type environmental photography to tie the human story with the metaphorical levels with the films physical reality I d have accepted an extension of the runtime to achieve this extra footage on the edit In summation I rate at a lowish 6 10 and I would reserve my agreement that this film deserves such rewards as it has garnered for what is basically a neat idea for a particular treatment of standard themes and subject matter which is amiably delivered on screen but suffers from varied failures in execution in the writing,6.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5513945/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2020,"Analysis/Opinion: How much should you respect the freedom of the rich to hoard their wealth, when you are living in uninhabitable circumstances?",The vague incisions that are carved in your mind as you navigate through the elusive metaphors within the movie become clearer as the plot develops and unwillingly grips you with a truly unique plot charismatic characters sagacious dialogue and unexpected events that last from beginning to end The complexity of the plot resists in helping you answer questions like Who has the higher moral standpoint Who deserves to get the upper hand Is the Kim family truly malevolent If you were in their position would you do the same Do you feel compassion and sympathy for Ki Taek even after killing Mr Park The movie accomplishes a feat that most movies nowadays are not able to every single character is complex enough to merit forgiveness understanding and redemption One character despite all the deficits and obstacles is attempting to survive to be able to get an education wealth and prestige be secure financially and equally valuable as the Park family is he is trying not to be a parasite Another character is freer and careless even self destructive acceptant of that fate that life has bestowed her A bit more lost but ultimately only guilty of attempting to have enough money to help the family In the entire movie you cannot find a single instance of sadism or even malevolence from any of the parasites They are fervently trying to survive and equipped with sufficient cunning to achieve their goals and can you blame them After an hour of receiving the earnest nature of the message of parasite I recognized that the movie is not particularly expressing a message about meritocracy If there is a central element of this movie it is social mobility or the lack thereof The Kim family was attempting to survive yes they deserved better circumstances maybe but their main juncture was the fact that they are attempting to progress and elevate themselves in the social hierarchy social mobility Anyone with a modicum of empathy can empathize with the ruthless suffering of the lower class or underrepresented the Kim family The director tries to demonstrate in creative forms the insensitivity of the wealthy class to the precarious nature of the poor The movie is basically a metaphor of class struggle with comedic dramatic and violent gestures How much should you respect the freedom of the rich to hoard their wealth when you are living in uninhabitable circumstances This is in straightforward terms the dilemma of the movie I am going to be your parasite because you do not respect me nor help me quite the contrary you think I m lesser than you dirtier than you and smellier than you As a parasite I will inhabit your body and nourish myself taking advantage of you while possibly murdering you It s a harsh message but a real one Many people are living in untenable conditions while the wealthy class excuse themselves with meritocracy while they enjoy their opulence In the movie as the Kim family understands the crude reality of social mobility they eventually become desperate violent and homicidal The inhumane elitism of the Park family becomes more apparent even after traumatic situations happen This is one of the morals of the narrative Elitism will usually triumph against the working class and the myth of social mobility proliferated in class struggle might have to be debunked with bloodshed and imagination There is a line in the movie that expresses the other moral really well If I had all this money and freedom I would probably be a good person Heck I would probably be a much better person than Ms Park Finally Ki Taek reflection after escaping the flooded house is the last moral of the movie You know what kind of plan never fails No plan No plan at all You know why Because life cannot be planned In this case Ki Taek reflects on his situation and tries to justify his failure by habituating his son to a life of no strategy plan or ambition He wants his son to love him but in his desperation he is also habituating him to failure make them believe that chaos and degeneracy is their only option and they will attempt to live happily within their exploitation,10.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5556791/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,A fine example of cinema enjoyed as a collective experience,Parasite is a film that represents that cinema is best as a collective experience From the beginning until the end of the film the audience was silent without being distracted immersed in the reality that the film presents The script in terms of structure works like a clock the characters the scenarios the conflicts are raised and each element will influence what happens next The staging is magnificent an exact combination of photography editing and direction that manages to maintain attention and tension in each sequence the way in which each member of the family is gets work at the house the sequence of the arrival of the family after the camp the children s party of the climax They are very well executed sequences and together they manage to maintain a rhythm as I have rarely seen this year in the cinema The message of social class difference is clear but very in your face especially when what happens after the storm is evident My only buts are that there are parts of the plot that feel forced to cause impact and although they work they are not entirely convincing And that in the cinema I seek to leave inspired not with my head down and this film is very entertaining but ends up overwhelming the mood Even so for provoking that community experience in a movie theater through the extraordinary use of cinematic language it is worth the recommendation,8.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5371628/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2019,Geography Classes,A lot has been made of the social commentary the message of Parasite but I think the picture is effective because the message is not overly blunt and because the structure largely geographical supporting it is congruent Plus it s unpredictable genre mixing entertainment otherwise That s not to say the social commentary isn t obvious though and rather nihilistic There s ambiguity and complications as to which characters are the parasites While one suspects that our sympathies are supposed to be with the lower class Kim family they are the ones conning the upper class Parks In one sequence to deter detection they even hide crawl and slither about like the insects that infest their own home But then the Parks often come across as a vacuous family of privilege who tend to hold their employees in contempt In effect they re all parasites even the former workers that the Kims replace by tricking the Parks into firing them Every major character tries to exploit or debase others in some way or another The Kims get others fired forge their own qualifications and take advantage of the Parks trust Conversely the Park parents mock the smell of Kim Ki taek and they pretend to be slumming it for sex roleplay Their daughter is more interested in her tutor as a boyfriend instead of as hired help and even the young son misinterprets a cry for help in Morse code and is a fan for the cultural appropriation of Native Americans The only other Bong Joon ho movie that I ve seen thus far Snowpiercer 2013 is more heavy handed in its depiction of class In it the rich exploit the poor it s as straightforward as the continuously running train Parasite is more steeply layered The upstairs downstairs class stratification is reflected in Seoul s geography The Kims live in a semi basement in a crowded urban area We only ever see them arrive home by descending stairs whereas they ascend them to work for the Parks in their luxurious suburban estate with a backyard While it rains at the Park s home that of the Kims is also flooded by sewage including feces raining on them from the toilet A drunk urinates outside their window and even tries to literally piss on them at one point Others of poverty turn out to inhabit spaces even lower in a hidden bomb shelter below another flight of stairs This further references the larger line of demarcation separating North and South Korea which itself mirrors Mr Park s condemnation of crossing the line Even the hope of upward mobility is represented in the landscape by a stone Besides reflecting the message all of this geography also serves the narrative What begins as a black comedy and con artist film with actors playing actors turns into a mix of suspense thriller and old dark house horror beginning with one stormy night Characteristic of the haunted house subgenre there s already the aforementioned secret bunker and there s also a ghostly mysterious assailant and the figure of the youngest Park s supposed trauma reflected in his artwork There s even fantasy in the Kims son s dream of upward mobility and a grand guignol finale It s also a well composed picture with an exciting score and amusing performances And to top off this multi layered message movie there s the Morse code messaging Messages inside a message genres upon genres actors within actors characters within characters haves among the have nots all underlined geographically,9.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5314185/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2020,What a crazy and brilliant movie!,This movie is fantastic The name of the film pertains to our main characters in the film as well as two others we meet later on There s a lot going on for this film in terms of the political and societal commentary it utilizes We see with the opening the setup of this as the main family is impoverished and is literally living at the lowest level without being underground They struggle to retain what most would consider basic necessity nowadays like wifi and do odd jobs to regain that and have a simple meal Fortune strikes though as their son gets an in with a rich family to tutor their young daughter eventually working their way deeper inside until all four are working different jobs for this family All this is achieved because the mother is easily manipulated and prefers recommendations when bringing workers into their home rather than documentation This ties into the difference between classes However our main families newfound means of financial potential is put in jeopardy one night when the former house cleaner returns She rings incessantly needing to retrieve something in the basement Which we find out is her husband revealing the main family is not the first to get an in with the rich family Her husband had actually been living there for years to escape loan sharks and was receiving food and residency unbeknownst to the family above The raised issue of these two different families leeching from the wealthier comes to a head when the rise is discovered by the former housekeeper She and her husband are subdued and shortly after our family save for the mother is able to sneakily escape This leads to a brilliant scene of our family descending back into poverty Going lower and lower showing just how different these two worlds are I loved this scene It was so clearly thought out and it brilliantly enacted There s so much to love about this film and it deserves so much of the praise it s been getting It s clear that Bong Joon Ho is passionate about the work he does Definitely give this a watch its worth your time and money,9.0,5.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5483167/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2020,Wonderful,I was just stunned as the movie ends The plot is both unreal and real at the same time So unreal so creative was the plot and so real was the depiction of sheer poverty and how that could possibly deconstruct people s moral The way some scenes were shot shows clearly the power contradiction of characters as when Ki woo was entering Parks villa the surrounding was just pushing towards him I really like some of the details of the movie s plot especially when the Kim family fled back home in the pouring rain probably looking forward for their shabby but at least rain free dwelling only to find out the basement flooded The scene when Ki jeong bled to death was also heartbreakingly realistic No tearful words of goodbye to her father like lots of drams movies have done the girl was just whining about the pain and asking her father to stop pressing on the wound The scene when the Parkers dog carelessly went to eat the kebab sticking to Geun sae s back was also amazing I might be over interpreting but that scene seemed to be expressing that when a nobody like Geun sae dies nobody would care not even human s best friend Unfortunately I was not able to pay much attention to the actors expressions when watching the subbed version And although I have no trouble understanding the subtitles the white words sometime just blended into the scene and I couldn t read them Maybe I ll watch it online someday and figure out what I missed,10.0,9.0,14.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5484088/?ref_=tt_urv

who is now living in the bunker which he decodes Still living in the semi basement apartment Ki woo responds to his father vowing to one day earn enough money to buy the house free his father and the family will be reunited The film s title is a double meaning it can refer to the poor family manipulating their way into the lives of the rich family or the rich family themselves in terms of labour leeching off others to do to the work it could also refer to the sinister character beneath the house This film works well as a satirical and intricate examination of class conflict and as a film of two halves The sneaky set up is a savage social commentary with an impoverished family conning their way up and then it completely shifts gear with a darker tone and surprising moments that will get under the skin It is the first film from South Korea to gain Oscar nominations it became the first foreign language film in history to win the top prize at the Academy Awards beating big contender 1917 from Sam Mendes and the first to win Best Picture and the foreign language category together At a time where the lack of diversity is debated this film will hopefully pave the way for changes it

9 November 2019,Highly effective blend of genres,I can t remember watching a film that covers as many genres as Parasite Gisaengchung and does it so successfully This is a highly entertaining film that starts off as a comedy drama and gets darker as it goes along becoming a rather sinister mystery thriller with some highly effective horror elements Most films that try to cover multiple themes end up messy but Parasite never felt in danger of that At a time when the film industry seems to be increasingly short of original ideas something as fresh as Parasite is always welcome The comedy genre in particular just seems to be made up of the same recycled jokes this film is funny while being completely different to anything else out there at the moment and that alone is quite an achievement Parasite is great highly recommended for those growing tired of the usual stale Hollywood productions,8.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5245609/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,"Brilliant Class Study, Contrived Plot",Parasite tells the story of the down and out Kim family The son gets an opening with the wealthy Kim family working as an English tutor Piece by piece the other members of the Kim clan scheme their way in such that all four of the Kim family father as driver mother as housekeeper son as tutor daughter as art teacher therapist end up working for the Parks though the Parks don t know of the relationship between them Part often hilarious black comedy part love story part thriller all class commentary Parasite really is a genre defying film And it s genuinely enjoyable The film highlights the class divisions between the Kim family and the Park family particularly in the incredible contrasting storm scenes the Kims have their house upended the Parks host a backyard camping adventure What made the film work so well in my opinion is that most members of the Kim family do not act as good people They lie to get their jobs they steal from the Park family and they re willing to frame and undermine the existing help in order to get them fired even though those people are of the same struggling social class as the Kims There s no class solidarity here just doing whatever it takes to get ahead I stop at 8 10 though because I can t get beyond the feeling that the whole basement setup was a contrived device to move along the film and or unsubtle metaphor There s a secret underground shelter beneath the house that the Parks don t know about and where the housekeeper has been storing her husband for half a decade The owners never get wind of this perhaps because they re oblivious to the help who are quite literally beneath them The people living in the bowels of the house feed off the inhabitants up top like a parasite And we know that a parasite that goes untreated just might kill its host Get it It s a great film definitely worth watching But watching it after hearing all the hype Parasite just didn t hit me as a 10 10,8.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8415483/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2020,Parasite film review (2019) by Screams and Whispers,Synopsis Kim Ki woo lives on the edge of poverty with his family They steal WiFi from their neighbors work on minimum wage jobs and live in a basement apartment Kim Ki woo s life changes when he gets an offer from his friend to work as an English tutor because the friend was going to study abroad The friend is infatuated with the girl and wants his friend be around during his absence to avoid others being around his crush The young man accepts the offer changes his name to Kevin and starts tutoring Park Da hye who quickly falls in love with Kevin Once among the Parks Kevin develops a different plan he want to get his family into the Park family Will he succeed to get his poor family into the Parks If yes will the Kims the poor family become as rich and privileged as the Parks Parasite by Bong Joon Ho is the film of the year It won the Palme d Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival Apart from its numerous accolades Parasite won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Picture Best Director Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature film This is the first non English language film to win Best Picture Award It won as the Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Golden Globe Awards It won the Best Film Not in the English Language and the Best Original Screenplay awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards A bell sounds right at the beginning of the film is there to verify if all the speakers of the theater function properly or not The bell is there to be compared to the plurality of voices a society produces Like the bell there are many others symbols in this film that deserve to be studies closely The food in the film often symbolizes the same notion of up and down The noodles the cheaper food are made for Kim family while the beef the expensive one is for the Parks The rain in the film plays the same role as the food It emphasizes the opposite perceptions that individuals from two different social classes have about the same thing and how that same thing influences them differently Water symbolizes the reality and the stone symbolizes false hopes Water always goes down and not up and can damage those who live down the poor This was the case when the strong rain came and damage the Kims house Parasite foreshadowing the scene where the fumigation happens the daughter attempts to close the window but the father tells not to because it is a free extermination Everyone starts coughing except from the father During another occasion the daughter says that she fit in well with the Parks but ironically she is the first to die When it comes to the father he is the only one to continue his life in the basement just like he was the only one who was not afraid of the smoke When it comes to the Indian theme it is a foreshadowing for the fate of the Parks family Bong Joon ho doesn t portray the rich as villains neither the poor as victims The borderline between the bad and the good is opaque we do not know for which character we should cultivate the most empathy Deep down they may all have the same insecurities and worldview with very slight differences apart from the smell because they all smell the same according to the Parks Is it because of the subway or the soap they use or the basement smell It is just a metaphor the smell symbolizes the poor By the way during birthday festivities the father of the Parks family is killed by the father of the Kims family following his disgust towards the smell of their first housekeeper s husband One of the highly used symbols is the concept of up and down or high and low for class representation Parks house is located at the highest point of the town The upper class family of Parks rarely looks down on the floor They always look forward or up which means that their house s employees hide easily under their tables in the ground floor or elsewhere if when they feel that hiding is necessary The notion of parasite is recurrent and questions what exactly it means Who exactly is parasite the poor or the rich Are there any parasites What if everybody are parasites One of the most important points of this film is the fact that people fight against each other Even those who are down fight mercilessly for keeping their place in the Parks s house even if it means living in the basement They lack a lot of solidarity Parks son has an obsession with native Americans For his birthday the native american theme is highly used It represents a surprise just like the Kims discover that there is a family living rights in the basement of the Parks s house the Europeans had discovered that there were native Americans living in the newly discovered continent In both cases the result was the war and or the fight Moreover during the festivities Kim Ki woo checks if the other family s father is in the basement taking the stone which was given to him by his friend as a symbol of success symbolizing the hope for a better future with him The stone is only used to smash someone s head and never brings success The closing scene shows Kim Ki woo In his letter to his father Kim Ki woo says that he will work until he could afford to buy the mansion and adds All you ll need to do is to walk up the stairs These expressions summarizes the myth of social mobility and supports social determinism,10.0,19.0,32.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5478422/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2023,8.5 average is a little too high,I likes this movie I don t believe it did anything wrong but it s also not better than many other films that are 8 on IMDB I thin it just got a little overhyped there hasn t been that many great films in recent memory I would put this one on the same level as Knives Out or for example a great film all around entertaining thought provoking funny easily digestible and memorable but even with all those positives I would not say its better than for some examples The Departed Whiplash Casablanca Good Will Hunting Lawrence of Arabia Wolf of Wallstreet even Three Billboards etc Although to be fair there are many films with an 8 average that should not be as high as they are either like Joker and even som 7 s that deserve to be 8 like Tenet it was just a little hard to grasp everything with 1 view and no subtitles or Babylon which was crazy but it was also beautiful in it s own way Anyway I am getting a little off the rails but the point is that when I saw it as number 36 in IMDBs top 250 it feels unfair for many other films that may be a littler harder to digest for the average person but have a lot more substance Is it a good film Yes it is a great film definitely recommended for just about anyone but is it top 40 of all time No perhaps top 40 of it s decade at best but as someone who has watched a lot of films I seriously doubt it would even be top 100 maybe top 150,8.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9259502/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2020,Don't Read This Review Unless You've Already Seen the Film,I liked this film even though I consider it overrated There were several things that I found stupid while watching the film The idea that someone is living in your home and you don t know it is not something new in Korean cinema It has been explored before in Kim Ku Duk s 3 IRON Having worked as an English teacher in Asian countries for two decades I found offensive the notion that someone with no credentials and no English skills will be able to pass off as an English teacher Sorry folks rich people are not that stupid The same thing applies for the dad when he buys the Benz The director seems to have forgotten there is something called background check and tax declaration This film is nothing but pure fantasy The ending where the daughter dies but not the son reminded me of the ending of The Host In Asian cultures the male offspring is more important than the female therefore its okay to sacrifice the girl if it ensures the survival of her brother The director seems to respect tradition instead of opting for a messier finale The final scene where the dad is trapped in the house is quite stupid and does not make any sense It s more like a scene from a metaphysical horror film The movie kinda fails as a depiction of class struggle because the rich people in this film are more likeable than the poor You can t help rooting for the rich folks because they re the victims although if you re one of those antifa types you will most likely disagree The fact is that in Asian countries there is no class struggle It has been replaced by the Let s Get Rich mentality No matter rich or poor everyone is equally greedy however the low class peasants are generally looked down upon not because of their origin but because of their lack of taste,7.0,4.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5411870/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2020,Disappointing,Like many of the Users reviewing this film I had high hopes when I rented it I thought it started out well Unlike some of the reviewers I kind of liked the family of grifters especially the daughter In fact my initial rating was 10 stars however as the movie continued the stars began to fall by the wayside If the movie would have been about a family of grifters who use imaginative ways to imbed themselves into the lives of a rich family and then develop a storyline from there this would have been a likeable if less imaginative movie Unfortunately the plot veers significantly away from this by first introducing a weird and unbelievable character living in a basement fallout shelter and then turning violent and bloody for no apparent reason It s too bad as the movie started out with so much potential and some truly comic scenes i e leaving the windows open for free fumigation and the little boy s surrealistic paintings which are nothing more than scribblings And no don t tell me that I need to have a better understanding of the socio economic conditions within modern day Korea to truly appreciate this movie It s not my job to educate myself in order to appreciate a movie It s the movie s job to allow me to appreciate it If it doesn t do that it s a waste of time,1.0,11.0,24.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5521493/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2022,Incredibly Overrated,I wanted to watch this thing after all the raving reviews and now I m angry because I hated this movie I couldn t stand the main cast the rich family was actually quite pleasant I wanted to know more about them they seemed like nice people Boring long and it wasn t nearly as funny as everybody says While it did had some nice shots mainly during the flooding scenes the rest is the same locations over and over I don t even remember if it had music A lot of stuff hapenning was way too far fetched Apparently this family of people who can t fold a pizza box becomes a team of master scammers in a week and then proceed to make the most absurd decisions ever nonstop fueled by greed and resentment The reason behind Kim s final crime still eludes me I know it has to do with the whole crossing the line and odor thing but come on that s his breaking point It s not even like Park Hoon said it to his face he actually kept it for himself when he could ve just fired him at the spot I simply never felt like he was actually a bad guy he looked like an honest hard working family man I simply couldn t see the discrimination from him when he actually hires everyone without even checking their backgrounds and is willing to pay them handsomely It s not even like he exploits them or anything Many lines seemed to be there for no reason At the end Kim expresses remorse for his crime yet we never see him redeem himself nor repent in any other form like turning himself in Then why leave the line there Same thing happened when the mother of the kid tells the story of the ghost At this point we know is the guy living in the basement so what s the point of the story now Wouldn t be better to tell it before that revelation so it comes as a bigger surprise What was the whole point of the Morse code from the husband if the kid never tells anything I get that it helps with the resolution but Kim could ve gotten to that idea by himself I think it s beyond overrated it has way too many holes it s boring and the message is just not that deep I m so tired of the whole rich people are evil because they have money and therefore do evil things stuff Just take your Oscars and get away from my face,2.0,5.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8536949/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2019,"Money is so kind, and money can iron everything",1 General review South Korea has been leading for 30 years on the road to pursuing art and resonating with the audience The traditional view is that literary films are films that are more reflective of profound thoughts but they also mean a good and tangible experience Commercial films are just the opposite Nowadays the Korean film industry has already had a work that combines depth and perception At this time Chinese movies are still drifting away in the mud of money 2 The appearance of breakthrough represents more mature thinking The film depicts mainly class differences and divisions But the most core breakthrough is the opposite of good and evil In the traditional film of the reaction to the class the rich are always portrayed as rich and poor and the poor are always diligent and kind The film is the opposite The rich man is a hard working woman who has a family and his children are not awkward the poor are savage and sneaky The reconciliation of this character image shows that the film s creative thinking is more mature and it is no longer necessary to deliberately highlight the theme through class opposition And through more realistic role positioning with the plot to communicate with the audience 3 Understatement and into the wood This film is used to distinguish the class the most important thing is the smell You don t need a luxury shoe bag you don t need to travel Shopping just such a label that has been neglected and yet vivid has become a finishing touch What is the smell of living in a dark and damp basement for a long time The film gives a more appropriate description cooking the taste of the rag This distinction does not help the audience not applaud The whole film did not deliberately render the hardships and hardships of the poor It s just the smell with the long ladder in the rainstorm the sewage filled in the basement it seems to be understated but it is three times As a negative example you can compare the Taste of Money 2012 I believe that everyone will be able to feel the shackles of spilling the screen how boring 4 Calm is the biggest gap After completing the division of the two classes by smell how to show the gap between the two classes The director gave a unique answer calm When the male master stood at the window and looked at the hilarious party on the grass outside the window he could not help but tell the difference between the two classes calmly The version of the poor is given from the father s mouth People should not have plans and they will not go wrong without planning This kind of contrast is not obvious when you look at it but when you are fine you understand the difference in attitudes between life and the scorpio between the two classes 5 Performance icing on the cake The performance of the two actors of the father and mother in the film can be said to be the icing on the cake Song Kangxi In the basement and driving the deliberate expression of self esteem can make the audience feel the inferiority of the inner character of the wrapped person and thus can end the anger and stab the president This is the anger of the little man who was dismissed In particular the one that turned back after the president of the thorny center was full of confusion confusion and helplessness Zhang Huizhen s mother when she was drinking in the rainy night had a very wonderful performance The expression was in a few seconds from scare to anger to fear of the last laugh and every trembling of the face muscles was a play 6 Not perfect there are also disadvantages The whole plot is divided into three sections The plots with some fine details can be trimmed in the middle and the main line is not helpful In addition I don t really like the end of the film Father escaped from reality and how do you know when to pass information Reuniting the sun seems to be a reflection of the darkness of reality but the actual painting is superfluous 7 Written at the end There is a stone in the play that symbolizes the flow of class which was eventually discarded by his son For the contemporary society poverty is the only disease Stone is not an antidote,8.0,3.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5067727/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2019,mind blowing,I don t know whether if it s just me but each member of the parasitic family reminded me of some or other person that we would have met in our lives and even to ourselves It is one of those movies that has brilliantly captured human greed and class discrimination on screen The film starts out portraying the Kim family their love for each other amidst all the poverty and difficulties and their omnipresent desire to grow rich A lucky stone introduced in the beginning and running throughout the plot probables resonates with a classic human trait clinging to the narrator throughout the plot The all too powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon One of them leading to the protogonists running away from the affluent Park s home after an eventful night This scene is potrayed too realistic that it produces a sense of helplessness in the viewers This juncture in the movie was too overwhelming for me the brilliant but subtle portrayal of the darkness clouding into their lives and the classic reminder of actions gone too far makes you feel for them The transformation that the narrator s father undergoes after this night and his subsequent actions is a powerful blow to the socio economic casteism that is present in our world A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon,10.0,17.0,26.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5353498/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,Parasite,Bong Joon Ho s chilling satirical masterpiece addresses the age old theme of social class Much like Bong Joon Ho s previous work Snowpiecer 2013 the question of why some people are seen as lower and some people are seen as higher class is asked The film also explores what we have to sacrifice to change social classes under a capitalist system The narrative follows the Kims a poor family who con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family the Parks Their easy life gets complicated when their deception is threatened with exposure What follows is a fascinating spectacle which is sometimes operatic in nature and a sad reflection of modern life Although it is all set in South Korea the story works so well because it is universal and could have been set practically anywhere It could be argued that there are no villains in the film just people however it is anything but a soap opera It is a commentary on the human condition Nothing is black and white just shades of grey Parasite offers a way of seeing the world which feels unlike anything most Western audiences have seen before However there are still some films which it does bear some stylistic similarities to Hitchcock comes to mind with films such as Psycho 1960 and The Birds 1963 There is also a twist in the tail which does feel slightly Hitchcockian I could also see traces of films with a more biblical and spiritual quality to them such as Paul Thomas Anderson s Magnolia 1999 The acting was convincing throughout with stand out performances from Kang ho Song and Sun kyun Lee which puts the audience on edge The spider like way Bong Joon Ho directed his cast to move added to the sense of uneasiness The writing is spot on with some razor sharp wit which combined with the direction made for some side splitting moments However as a contrast to the more humorous points in the film there are moments of real sadness and pain The contrasts beautifully represent life because what is life if not a series of contrasts,10.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5493662/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2020,A different kind of infestation,A Korean film that seemingly sweeping up at the awards seasons It can t be that good can it Did the judges not see 1917 Is what I hear you cry as you even read the title of this review From the mind of Bong Joon ho comes a drama about class and home invasion but truly can it be THAT good Lest we forget this is the mind behind the uncompromising vision of Snowpericer and the unsettling onslaught that was Okaj but even still it can t be better than Joker Right There is a surreal kind of desperation that follows you while watching Parasite you want to see the ultimate fate of our protagonist sooner than is given The real tilting point of the movie comes around the halfway mark when a troubling discovery is made this propels the film from contemporary melodrama into an all out descent into madness this is where Bong Joon ho thrives In the chaos in the distress this is where Bong Joon ho forces us as an audience to be Parasite has a rare kind of delicacy to it as if Bong Joon ho doesn t want to upset us too much but what s to keep us unsettled He wants to make us dread for the next turn of events and as the final curtain falls you know you have just seen a masterpiece However I am unsure if this would not be better suited to a stage production rather than the grandiose of a film The movie has nothing in it which makes me feel like it must be seen at a cinema but perhaps that is to its ultimate asset A film that transcends how you view it and is outstanding on its own merits The most adequate comparison I can make for Parasite is a Shakespearean play The film has moments of levity and comedy blended in with horrible and tragic scenes and is divided into acts It has deep pathos and there is something overall cathartic about the whole experience This is the first film of Bong Joon ho s that is set in a reality which is current and we as the viewer inhabit despite this there is still a surreal and other world quality to the proceedings not unlike Alice In Wonderland Bong Joon Ho beckons us through the looking glass Perhaps Parasite s strongest suit is its characters who are exceptionally well balanced there is nothing as obvious as a villain or hero in Parasite No the film leaves this up to us as the viewer to pick out who we feel was correct in their actions most Make no mistake Parasite s is a world filled with fallen humans To make such deep characters takes a lot of talent and each of the actors give performances that could have easily lead to their own awards nominations Parasite is a true master class in film making while totally different from everything else on the market genre and even world it might just deserve all of the awards it s getting Yes even THAT one 10 peaches out of 10,10.0,4.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5490662/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2021,A potentially great film with one MAJOR flaw.,I don t want to bash this film it had a lot of very good qualities Nice cinematography well edited good sound design good art direction and decent acting I ll go as far as to say the story was a very good premise and had incredible potential BUT No story is complete without good character development and this is where this film fails CATASTROPHICALLY Here it is in a nutshell WHO CARES Besides the imposter family protagonists being of low economic status the writers make almost no effort to make this family likeable in any way shape or form They are all pretty much detestable scumbags right out of the gate There is ZERO conflict of interest or moral dilemmas as the family goes about their con games you know the kind of writing that would normally draw the audience in and generate sympathy for the protagonists as they make their poor and ultimately tragic decisions In any good tragic tale the audience should feel conflicted in their emotions when the protagonists meet their ultimate fate but this film achieves none of that at least in my opinion I was literally rooting for their downfall through the whole film Honestly how do you screw that up It s classic 101 storytelling Honestly if you feel sorry for this family in any form during this film you re probably a sociopath and the fact that this film is held in such great regard is very concerning,4.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6670119/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2023,Another attempt at pretentious social commentary,Parasite 2019 is widely renowned by many members from the film community At first glance it appears that they are genuinely praising the movie s artistic quality but the truth is they are merely praising its supposed profound social commentary and propaganda In a society where people prefer to stay in echo chambers and repulsing those who don t fit the status quo it is no surprise that this motion picture is highly acclaimed given that it appeals to the ideologies of Marxist lunatics today by making the audience feel sympathy for the poor characters and contempt for the wealthy ones The movie doesn t necessarily condone the main characters actions as it still portrays their crimes in a negative light But that leads us to another issue the movie wants us to think that their crimes are the results of genius planning even though their plans are only made possible because of some stupid plot point that requires us to suspend our disbelief It just goes to show how much the film is trying to insult the audience s intelligence by thinking they d buy into it In summary the director Bong Joon Ho seems to believe that class and status indicate one s character as evident by his attempt at portraying the main characters in a positive light despite them being a bunch of lazy and conniving criminals Perhaps the only redeemable quality of this film is its cinematography which admittedly is quite beautiful,2.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9155993/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,Bong's Magnum Opus,This is a film that blew me away the first time I saw it That being said this is a film that demands a second watch if not more because there are so many little details that you either miss or they don t sink in the first time you watch the film Moreover it should be specified that this time I was viewing the black and white edition which beautifully highlights the film s production and style it adds a certain layer of unease to the picture When we first see the Park s house shrouded in shadows and darkness we know full well what s to come and it s almost like the film knows that too The house is beautiful and it s astounding that the lower level and the interior is built from scratch the second level being CG not that you d notice The house when looked at in black and white can almost be seen as a gothic castle from classic literature or some of the early Universal horror films But what I really find unsettling is the iceberg aspect of the house it s almost too spacious and it feels much bigger on the inside than it does on the outside it s a maze of materialism which is a stark contrast to the semi basement that the Kim clan live in another benefit of seeing the film in black and white is that it accentuates the differences between the families who are all parasites in their own right the Kim family infiltrate a household and live off of the hosts without them knowing while the Parks have to rely on everyone in their family to function It s also worth noting that there are enough chairs around the table in the Park s kitchen to sit everyone and yet there is still a very clear rich poor divide Ultimately the Park s disconcerting house makes the architect Namgoong one of the most interesting characters in the film despite the fact he s never seen apart from the odd photograph that decorates the house I m not entirely sure if I feel the same way I do about this version of the film as I do with the colour version simply because the black and white cinematography helps to present the film as an unconventional horror film about the ignorance of the upper classes greed fate and the ambition of those below them One of the most blatant examples of the rich living in ignorance is when Park s wife is shopping for Da Song s birthday party and she remarks that the rain was a blessing we now this not to be the case as we saw the Kim s semi basement flooded with sewage water and many more families having to sleep on the floor of a gym It s a subtle indication that if the Park s are simple enough to not see the problems of society below their castle on the hill then it s unsurprisingly that they wouldn t notice it happening in their own household At a base level there s nothing more terrifying than the thought of someone an intruder living in your house without you knowing Thusly there was nothing more horrifying than noticing the light sensors turn on as Nathan Park ascends the stairs of his home as we know what he does not that there is a parasite living in the hidden basement operating the lights via a system of switches This is one of the reasons why the film has to be seen more than once as it s even better going into it knowing everything that s going to happen The subtle references Park makes to Kim about his former housekeeper eating enough for two come off as a joke upon first viewing but the second time around that off hand remark cannot be viewed as anything but deeply sinister The last thing that can be commented on is fate the importance of the scholar s rock and viewing Ki Woo Kevin as the film s main character Each member of the Kim family is unsatisfied with their surroundings but the only one who actively seeks to change their position within society is Ki Woo Kim is content to adapt to his surroundings Chung Sook is cynical and only tries so hard to make a change while Ki Jung has skills of her own and has worked in the past to earn money for herself The siblings are the schemers but fate intervenes to the aid of one while abandoning the other The scholar s rock which is said to bring material wealth to the owners is a constant in this film as the Kim family sat encircled around their table the rock is seen in the background as the camera pans around the family it has a domineering presence within the film somewhat like Chekov s gun as the rock will be used as a weapon and the family will pay a price for the material gains they so briefly held The rock is almost like a plot device as Kevin is undoubtedly the possessor of the rock as seen when he clutches it to his chest in the gym following the flood he is the one who makes the Faustian deal as the materialist lifestyle he strives for comes at a price a la the monkey s paw tale While the ending is left somewhat ambiguous despite the fact that director Bong Joon Ho states the likelihood of Ki Woo earning enough money to buy the Park s house in the future is practically impossible I feel different looking at the ending this time around It almost seems too easy to look at the sequence of the Kim family reunion as a ghost scene much like the family reunion scene in The Host another work in Bong Joon Ho s filmography To me it would be a much more satisfying and still horrifying ending that during the climax the three surviving members of the Kim clan are reunited but the Faustian consequence of Ki Woo s possession of the rock meant that he gets everything he ever wanted to be rich but it comes at the price of the death of his sister the mental torture of his mother the captivity of his father and all of the other bloodshed that occurred at Da Song s party You can look at the ending in both ways with this in mind if Ki Woo purchases the Park s old house and is now a member of the elite was it worth the price And if this is just another ghost sequence and it never happens was any of it all worth it in the first place A taste of what it was like to be rich was very costly to the Kim family A price that doesn t discriminate as it was the hamartia that led to the fall of the Parks All I can say at this point is there is no limit to the number of times that someone should watch this movie It s a masterwork that ll get better every time you see it,10.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8267026/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,A masterpiece.,The visual style and mood of 2019 s Parasite is perfect The editing the cinematography and the story all perfectly coincide with each other This film is the perfect example of every single part of a piece of art fitting with its other components With the precision and perfect aspect of the rich family is the perfectly omnipotent framing camera movement and composition of every single shot The static nature of the camera for most of the film shows how normal and static the status of the family is in contrast with the family that starts to work there The family that takes the place of the housekeepers driver and tutors are shot with more fluid and quicker camera movements to convey their status and attitude I could talk about this film for days so I will finish this review by discussing the ending The emotional nature of the families connections to one another is perfectly encapsulated through the last line and the last scene The emotional relevance of such a run down family now down on their luck and half killed is touching and perfectly fits with the beginning of the film The very last shot conveys this perfectly with the same shot at the beginning being the same one that is at the end,10.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5509349/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2021,"If The Movie Was Made In America, Everyone Would Think It Was Average",It s a Will Ferrell comedy Yep a Will Ferrell comedy Poor family outsmarts a clueless out of touch rich family and takes over the house is absolutely a Will Ferrell comedy plot Ignore how beautiful the movie looks the poor family s cramped dirty house and the rich family s pristine futuristic house Ignore the fact that it s a foreign film There must be a least a few people who LOVED the film because it s in a different language and liking the film makes them smart If this was a Will Ferrell movie or a Steve Martin movie and it had the same dialogue and zany schemes you would think the movie was average Or maybe even terrible One scene included the daughter leaving her underwear in the rich parents car to trick them into thinking the driver had sex in it Maybe the Will Ferrell Steve Martin comparison is a little bit melodramatic My point is if you set aside the fact that it s an immensely well made foreign film on a technical level Parasite is weak when it comes to characters and storytelling There are no memorable characters in this movie except for maybe a character that showed up near the end of the film but only because he was so over the top A perfect example is the poor family They re basically the same person For the most part the rich couple are the usual snooty dimwitted suburban snobs we ve seen in plenty of mainstream garbage comedies Most of the story is just the exchange between the poor family and the rich family The back and forth between them was interesting but definitely not Oscar worthy It s a bit difficult to rate the acting if the movie is in a different language As far as I can tell the acting was just okay No groundbreaking performances Just people sitting or standing around and talking with a few wacky comedic moments Oh and there s a murder at the end that feels out of place Obviously movie isn t terrible The visuals were incredible The scene where the poor family s neighborhood was consumed by a flood was gorgeous I enjoyed the film but I wouldn t say it s the greatest film ever,6.0,4.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6673475/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Ironic psycho,Ki woo being crippled by something that really started this movie is very ironic and sad at the same time Something that really excited me in this movie is the cinematography and the turning point of this movie from the funny joke to the absolute psycho mode Can t get enough of the idea of this movie how everyone from success ended up being that one they were trying to get rid off This movie comes off like a great art with absurd soundtrack that still sounds good This movie is near 10 it could be more artistic from the cinematography point but still a must watch,9.0,2.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7497658/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,brilliant cinema,Greetings again from the darkness At least once per year a movie really hits a sweet spot something that is fun to watch and not really like anything we ve previously seen Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho s latest film is this year s cinematic surprise It s filled with interesting characters social commentary a unique setting a creative and twisty story and enough tension that we are left stunned as the end credits roll There have already been a few excellent movies this year and this is surely to be a memorable addition to the best of 2019 We first meet the Kims a family in poverty living in near squalor in a basement level apartment with one small window That window is at street level and allows a bit of natural light to leak in and also provides a too clear view of drunks targeting the window as they relieve themselves The family keeps the window open for free fumigation as the city sprayers drive past in hopes that it will get rid of the pesky stink bug infestation yes there is symmetry to this later in the story The Kim family consists of Dad Kang ho Song Mother Hye jin Jang teenage son Kevin Ki woo Woo sik Choi and 20 something daughter Jessica Ki jung So dam Park and they react strongly when they lose free hi fi access from a neighbor s system The family seems to make just enough money for their next meal despite somehow underperforming at their family job of folding pizza boxes for a local vendor Fortunes begin to change for the Kims when one of Kevin s friends ask him to take over tutoring a teenage girl for a wealthy family in town This sets off an ingenious and sometimes quite funny chain of events that result in all four Kim family members working in some capacity for the Parks the aforementioned wealthy family The Park s home was designed by a famous architect and it is a stunning modern hillside home with lush garden and a window that stands in stark contrast to that little window in the Kim s city apartment Mr Park Sun kyun Lee is a 1 tech titan married to a high strung woman who is an eternally anxious and over matched mom a fantastic Yeo jeong Jo Their two kids are lustful teenage daughter Da hye Ji so Jung and hyperactive young son Da song Hyun jun Jung It s fascinating to watch how this family of schemers infiltrates this gullible and vulnerable upper class home and how they so are easily trusted thanks to photoshop skills Google and a street wise understanding of how to read people The script co written by the director and Han Jin Won explores the co dependency as the rich depend on the poor for service work and the poor depend on the rich for jobs and a living wage Given the film s title we soon realize that a host may have more than one parasite at any time something that plays out in what has to be the wildest film twist of the year thanks to an all out performance from Jeong eun Lee as the Park s long time housekeeper The social and class commentaries are spread throughout and in addition to the window comparisons you ll also notice that the walk is uphill to the Parks home and downhill and flood risky to the Kim s apartment There are multiple layers within the stories and within the individual characters What begins as a devastating social satire morphs into a wild and crazy time of violence without losing its general theme A comedy of familial con artists bursts into a violent class thriller the price to pay for unearned comfort The film is not just unpredictable it smacks us with a jarring twist Bong Joon Ho has become a well respected filmmaker for his previous work THE HOST 2006 MOTHER 2009 SNOWPIERCER 2013 and OKJA 2017 This latest elevates him to a whole new level The film is darkly humorous and unpredictable with excellent performances throughout It s also quite something to look at Cinematographer Kyung pyo Hong works his magic and it should be noted that the Park s home is a complete set built solely for the film I challenge you to notice this I sure couldn t tell The film won the 2019 Palme d Or at Cannes Film Festival and it is likely headed for many more accolades,8.0,2.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5242751/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2020,Disappointing,Was expecting a great movie about social inequality I find I usually agree with the IMDb rating But this movie was NOT about social inequality or class status It is about a down on their luck con artist family Completely understandable the boy lying about going to University to get the tutor job his friend recommended him for But morality is thrown out the window when his sister lies about the schizophrenic zone on the kids painting Totally unnecessary and cruel to mislead a parent with mental illness fears But then the family lies manipulates and scams two people to get fired Deplorable Do people do this cause they are poor No it s cause they are criminals There are criminals at all social levels So this is NOT some type of movie about social inequality How disappointing but as a movie about scam artists it was entertaining how clever and shameless they screwed over two workers But true to form the scam is threatened to unravel,6.0,11.0,16.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5507602/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2023,An interesting and fresh take,Parasite directed by Bong Joon Ho is a dark satirical film on wealth and inequality The low class families in the film are much like parasites forced to feed off others in order to survive However like with parasites the Kim family couldn t help but to gluttonously take advantage of their situation until the only way out was through drastic measures What I found most interesting however is the end of the film The son seems to have a change of heart and decided to create his own fortune rather than rely on others Wether or not he succeeds in this is up for debate but I found that to be a twist on the movie that really made me think,8.0,2.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8777488/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2020,"""The Parasite Case""",With a light comedy tone and a very insightful vision Bong Joon Ho begins an agile story about social classes their differences and paradoxically their similarities with great sharpness he also analyzes the legitimate aspirations of social promotion But at what price From this thesis many themes and subtopics emerge simulation lies threats which lead to stronger ones revenge hatred Bong Joon Ho brings such control of his film that he even turns technologies cellular into one more protagonist who will always be present throughout its history So far so good but the climax of Parasite its conclusion and its end depart from its very interesting beginning the director seems to want to change now the tone of his comedy towards drama and or terror only to end up losing control of his narrative with a grotesque denouement Consequently the film reduces its intensity and interest with which it started becoming confusing and anticlimactic A case of parasitosis that quickly went viral and spread to Hollywood itself who began to distribute prizes Casting includes Kang ho Song Sun kyun Lee Yeo jeong Jo Woo sik Choi So dam Park Sarcastic sequence of the confrontation with the old housekeeper who uses the cell phone to threaten as if it were a weapon,7.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5619903/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2020,Dont believe the hype,Highly overrated I was really excited about that film Now i am disappointed and wondering why people are so blown away by it Its okay to watch on a sunday afternoon but not more at all I get that there is an underlying critical depiction of the korean two class society that i as a middle class western can not really understand but the storyline seems to far fetched and the behaviour and dialogue of the protagonists are not convincingly crafted Maybe again its the korean style but nonetheless it wasnt convincing Actually i waited for it to end,5.0,6.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5535478/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,A social commentary of the highest order,As many other reviewers have mentioned Parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing There are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the end Take for example Crossing the line the rich dad keeps bringing it up He wants his staff to know their place That family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes Sure it was easy yet deceiving to infiltrate their household so cunningly but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upper class folks they were serving Even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesn t fit in despite the daughter s fondness for him she might even be in love with him or she s just infatuated The basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches The upper class family lives in an incredible house high up in what I presume is Seoul When their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all The party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair The poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around In fact the very man he drives around is disgusted by him This is a great movie that touches on many subjects I highly recommend it,9.0,21.0,35.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5422409/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,PARA-CRAZY,This is a fun different movie But to be totally honest as a lover of Asian cinema not that different For example Thirst by Park Chan Wook is off the charts different But an ok if somewhat erratic sloppy dark comedy nonetheless Full of unexpected twists and turns Some plot points go nowhere unfortunately Quite a bit of focus at one point in the movie is on the fact that the previous housekeeper s face has been beaten In fact the question is specifically raised as to what happened and yet never answered WTF A quirky look at the class divide I found the wrap up at the end a little long and unnecessary and honestly found some of the final scenes discordant Switching to a narrated jumpy set of scenes with a dream scene thrown in for good measure It all seened very amateurish Which is sad because the first 3 quarters were great The individual buttons for the individual stair pendant lights Really A ridiculous prop to build in the morse code prop which in itself was trivial and silly Also the master architect designed his escape bunker to resemble a horror set with no egress to the outside world Very very incongruous and illogical Oscar worthy I definitely don t agree but there you go An amusing non Hollywood movie but so so when compared to its Asian peers A great opportunity for the less educated Hollywood elite to show how politically woke they are,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5508517/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2021,Tremendous Achievement for the Oscars,Looking back at the previous Best Picture winner which was literally one month before the corona pandemic it s still remarkable that the South Korean black comedy thriller film Parasite even won such a prestigious award in the first place Marked as the return of Snowpiercer Okja director Bong Joon ho in his native country the film gained international recognition for being the first South Korean film to win the Palme d Or at Cannes and for being one of the highest rated films in recent years So now that s been a year since its historical landmark it s time to see if the movie s status is actually worthy of all the praise The film follows the poor Kim family who start off scheming to achieve employment from the wealthy Park family and end up infiltrating their household by disguising as separate highly qualified individuals That alone is all that can be stated about the movie without detailing too many narrative points for as seemingly simple of a premise as this is the whole movie goes in so many different directions The first third establishes the state of low income poverty the Kim family is in therefore making their desire to make money off of the upper class From then on the film becomes part commentary of the rich being infiltrated by the poor As Bong Joon ho himself stated the film s title is derived from how the rich will end up leeching off the poor and how the poor may potentially take advantage of their positions The Kim family themselves are so charismatic especially the intelligent son Kim Ki woo and the witty sardonic father Kim Ki taek that even if you didn t know they were a whole unit you would buy them as their individual personas and be none the wiser at all However from the movie s second act onward the plot ends up becoming a lot more complicated than your average liar revealed story While seemingly darker and more messed up than the film s initial comedic tone it does paint a thoroughly fascinating picture of what might happen if the ultra aristocratic landscape sucked the less fortunate in with it Given the major theme of class warfare that is explored throughout the feature one can imagine how passionate Bong and co writer Han Jin won are towards the subject matter yet clearly not entirely one sided as they do portray poor sides as legitimate people of different circumstances The Park family are likable in their general concern and safety of their own children in addition to their home except that they happen to be unaware of how their own privileged well being may affect others However their own obliviousness to what goes on with the Kim family ends up adding into the film s themes of the social economic gap hurting some and benefiting others The ones below have to suffer while the ones above get to have all the fun Now given that the film is part comedy and part thriller the pacing does actually make the shift between each scene rather poignant Given how differently the Kims and Parks live with one living in a murky semi basement apartment around a low income town and the other living in a higher class fancy house with a gorgeous forest the film knows how to convey a realistic amount of sardonic humor and horrific pathos based on what goes down in their lives The gritty yet down to earth cinematography by Hong Kyung pyo and subtly jarring music by Jung Jae il also play big parts in the intentional tonal shifts with a lot of high tension coming after things seem a little good for the Kims or a little too bad for the Parks Also given that most of the production design was actually built from the ground up instead of the crew using already existing architecture the film s themes of how real estate is generally utilized end up giving more character to the poor and rich sides of Seoul I guess if you re going to play around with sets they need to be your own There are few movies that depict the economical segregation between classes as surreally profound as Parasite and that s what truly makes it worthy of its Best Picture victory Even if there are other incredible foreign language films that have tackled these issues in their own ways it s not often when they get as much attention as this one although I m sure there are plenty of great ones on this movie s level too So if you re yet to see the film and you re curious as to why it s been immensely well received give it a go yourself It sure is one heck of a thrill for anyone regardless of their class,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6936483/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2021,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),The stage curtains open It takes a lot for me to invest into a foreign film where I have to watch it with subtitles and I will usually pass unless it is an exceptional film The last such film I can remember watching was the 2007 Spanish supernatural film The Orphanage which I did feel was exceptionally good So when I read the reviews on Parasite and seeing that it had won Best Picture I decided to go ahead and take the plunge and I m so glad I did Our story starts with the Kim family struggling financially and trying to make ends meet when the son Ki woo is given the opportunity to tutor a rich family s teenage daughter Taking the job Ki woo begins to manufacture reasons to trick the privileged family into hiring his father mother and sister in various capacities while they pretend to be complete strangers to each other The scheme is going well until one of the former house employees returns to the home requesting to be let in because in her haste to leave she had left something important behind When they allow her inside that is when it all begins to unravel with very unexpected results I absolutely loved this twisted film Despite the subtitles I was completely sucked in and found myself grinning with guilty pleasure at the predicaments that this opportunist family was placed into in their efforts to keep their devious plan from being discovered The outcome was not what I expected but completely satisfying The pacing was excellent the acting above average and the cinematography solid The film featured a strong use of lighting and colors that adds to the feel and atmosphere effectively This is one of the few foreign films well foreign to me that is that I would highly recommend without hesitation It is well deserving of its praises and well worth the time invested into it I have added it to my own collection and am looking forward to watching it again down the road A high 9 stars out of 10,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6785314/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2019,Who is the Real Parasite?,A few moments into the movie you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries dystopian science fiction as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh empathise grin and sit at the edge of your seat By winning the Palme D or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters Which brings me praise Kang Ho Sok who plays the father of the Kim family making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family s semi basement house and polished expanse of park family s uptown villa The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in while enhancing the drama While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages It communicates class divide makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves and makes you question who is the real parasite in the movie Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves,10.0,13.0,20.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5202670/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2020,Poor is the new great (it seems),I watched Parasite with an open mind I deliberately avoided reviews far too many fake ones out there and even the trailer After sitting through it a film that in all honesty made two hours seem like three then coming onto IMDB to see what others thought I m astonished Let s begin with the positives though cinematography was good acting was okay ish and that s about where it ends The negatives are considerable though A weak script which often made little sense or logic more plot holes than Swiss cheese ridiculous scenarios that defied belief and an ending that completely falls off a cliff edge and leaves the viewer wondering why they wasted two hours on this drivel In reality I d probably rate it a 4 10 but as at time of writing Parasite sits at 8 5 10 which is farcical given how weak this film is I m giving it a 2 to try and restore a bit of balance and common sense I am gobsmacked at how many on here are rating this a 10 and can only presume that it s down to a complete lack of quality movie experience or more likely that some are so oversaturated in the endless stream of CGI comic book garbage we ve all been subjected to over the last decade that anything ANYTHING that strays from the rut immediately garners a flailing of arms and lauding of Best film EVER Thirty years ago this film would ve been where it deserved towards the low end of the barrel but in today s distinctly subpar cinema offerings it s now being tipped as on Oscar possibilty Utterly ridiculous For those of you who are praising this film as the best thing since sliced bread go and get yourselves a film education A good place to start is Claude Berri s marvelous Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources to see how it should be done Films you actually don t want to end rather than praying for them to finish one hour in,2.0,5.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5467799/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2020,"Didn't deserve best picture, but still a wild ride",The 2020 best picture winner is a sleeper hit that started to get some buzz last summer translating positive word of mouth into Oscar gold in February Parasite may be the first foreign language film to win the honor but it s fair to say it isn t the best foreign language film to make an impression on audiences Still there s no denying the cultural impact Bong Joon Ho s dark family thriller has had since making the rounds at film festivals and theater chains The two families at the center of Parasite s plot deserve much credit for what they were able to deliver a gripping thriller that also serves as a social commentary on modern South Korean society Aside from the acting the execution of the plot filled with more twists and turns than you d expect from a best picture honoree is top notch And then there s the climax talk about a series of events that were not expected Understandably this earned Ho a best original screenplay award and for that Parasite did deserve the recognition While it is not the highest quality film released in the past year Parasite is a edge of your seat original effort that borrows some of the best elements from previous releases in the genre and takes things to another level,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5550849/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2019,8 star rating for this?,I have watched some Korean movies part of which I genuinely liked but this one how this gets an eight star rating is beyond me I have to admit that those have been some of the longest two hours that I have spent in a movie Theater The movie is neither funny it might be the dubbing but I have maybe chuckled twice during the whole movie nor shocking unless You haven t seen movies before it was filled with exclusively unlikeable characters it was absolutely predictive drawn out way too long and ultimately was just one big boredom Yes it covered different genres but other movies did the same just much better,3.0,41.0,104.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5196996/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2022,A masterpiece,Parasite deserves all the praise and awards it has received and more It is really refreshing to see a truly deserving movie receive this kind of feedback The director Bong Joon Ho had already revealed himself with his previous works as an extraordinary artist and one of the excellences of South Korea which is a truly capable market in terms of filmmaking While I recognise that nothing is perfect the flaws in this movie are really hard to find Every element of the movie is well thought out and detailed and you can see that it was made by someone with great love and respect for this art Direction acting editing and screenplay are flawless and the message comes through powerfully and well constructed I do not think it is excessive to call Parasite one of the masterpieces of the recent years There is not much to add except how the director has really given us a gift with this gem,10.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8573563/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2021,"Good , over hyped",I enjoyed this movie however my expectations were so much higher than it delivered based on the hype Its good but not top 50 good I feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something cool exotic Ask yourself how this film would have been received if set in US or UK and in English I feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy farce Definitely worth seeing don t let the hype set your expectations too high and you ll enjoy it for what it is,7.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6570450/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2023,9/10,I think the film does a good job of exploring the theme of class The Kim family is a poor family who is constantly struggling to make ends meet They are forced to take on menial jobs and live in a cramped basement apartment The Park family on the other hand is a wealthy family who lives in a luxurious mansion The two families are worlds apart and the film explores the ways in which the Kim family tries to exploit the Park family s wealth The film shows how deception can be used to gain power and influence but it also shows how it can backfire Good film for anyone who enjoys dark and twisted comedies or for anyone who is interested in the themes of class and deception,9.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9321850/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2021,Surprise after surprise,I had heard so many things about this film that I was afraid to watch it People were extreme about it and I wasn t sure I wanted to have that kind of experience I m not into over the top stuff At any rate it so happened that I rented the film and because I live in Japan and have a Japanese husband I knew we d be watching it with Japanese subtitles So I read the script in advance and I have to say the script was brilliant It was a page turner It was in fact I think better than the actual film Nonetheless the movie was a unique experience and I had never seen anything like it It starts a bit slow and you think Okay and But it quickly gains steam and starts running That said there were still moments where I thought Get on with it Especially the scene of the parasite family eating and drinking in the rich family s home as if it it belonged to them That went on and on and on Also the entire story hinges on two events one is believable the other is questionable The first one is when a friend of the parasite family s college age son tells him to take over as English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family because he s got a job or something and he will come back and marry the daughter in two years or something This didn t really make any sense because if he really wanted to marry the daughter he could have already put things in motion Instead he passes this job off to his friend Granted the parasite son was extremely handsome and soon the daughter falls in love with him The parasite son is very very clever and through him he manages to get the rest of his family his sister his mom and dad all jobs working for the rich family It s best to watch the movie to see how this unfolds That said the rich family seemed awfully gullible but on the other it is conceivable that the things that happened could actually have happened Basically this is a black comedy and there are hysterically funny moments But there are also shocking moments and mid way through a huge plot turn that dictates how the rest of the movie plays out All actors were uniformly good the rich family s young son was not given much to do so his acting ability can t really be judged but to me the best person in the story was the first maid Lee Jeong eun She was really brilliant throughout and I don t understand why she wasn t nominated I didn t see The Joker but I did see 1917 and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood both superb movies and also The Irishman which I detested So of the 3 that I saw Parasite was definitely the most unique I m not sure this is a film I could watch more than once but on the other hand it might be worth studying Very clever very different Yes a bit slow in the beginning and some questionable moments but overall two thumbs up,8.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7438133/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,BRILLIANT,This movie is a perfect example of the homeless crisis in Korea While it does show the differences of the lives of the poor and the rich it doesn t turn out how you would think I walked into this movie thinking it would show how greedy rich people are but boy was I wrong This is really a unique survival movie but not the type where a plane crashes or a man falls while cliff climbing This is a survival movie of how our society can be evil instead of a particular group of people and how hard it can be for the poor to survive in modern day society in some locations I am not going to spoil it but it really changes half way through with genius directing cinematography and music 10 10 movie believe the hype,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7835214/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2020,The other face of reality,Parasite is a movie that has been recognized and given really good reviews anyways to me it wasn t the best movie ever This movie was different in the sense that it played with your mind having a story unpredictable Parasite is also a reflect of society our worst fear is ourselves and the system we have constructed We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren t able to see the risks until you loose it all That s why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want The movie in general was really well made the way Bong Joon Ho thought about every scene and detail is surprising,8.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5509457/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2022,MASTERFUL PRODUCTION. OK STORY.,It is undeniable that this is a master at work The movie is very well shot acted edited It is undeniable that Bong Joon Ho led the warship masterfully through the abyss of the genre I do believe that should be pointed out However the reason the movie is a 7 not a 10 is pretty much because the story is simply okay The movie shines at its best when it goes into the grey areas talking about rich people being so nice because they are rich not making the movie about the idiotic correlation between wealth evil Yet it falls short on that regard since this is what this movie ends up being about Poor people smell bad rich people will point in out Simple Regressive Wrong,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8768670/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,Depth and metaphors weren't abundant like suggested,This movie has lots o technical merits from writing to music to cinematography and editing directing and acting The story is interesting and weird but in a good way It was different and fun funny and suspenseful But the implied suggestion that there was depth inside of the movie was not very accurate since the movie never really identifies exactly who the parasite is in the class dichotomies common sense would assume it s referring to the poor people living in the basement or that just finagled their way in but if the movie was really trying to be artistically grey or ambiguous it didn t do a good job of portraying the wealthy as that bad of people For example the only thing the wealthy did wrong was imply minor drug use and make fun of the way the man smelled and frankly who doesn t like good hygiene They weren t overly mean about it They were paying the man good money and were professional and nice to him And for the drugs well there are all kinds of drugs and it s not uncommon for any classes of people not to experiment once in their life if not more So if the film was trying to suggest rich people are equally abhorrent as the poor people in the movie it didn t really stand out No to extrapolate that kind of conclusion one would have to step back from the movie and just analyze the title itself Parasite and then evaluate speculate and rationalize on their own in a way the movie only grazes yet doesn t facilitate Since the wealthy family is simple hard working and earned their wealth and all they are trying to do is make their children happy and healthy there is nothing wrong with that They earned their money through hard work The other poor family was mostly lazy Sure they had some bad luck with the economy but they weren t seeking work until the son started the whole scheme To say that both families were Parasites based on what was shown would conclusively be erroneous as a result However since the movie does raise the subject perhaps not the Parks themselves but apparently wealthy people can be parasitic yes they may earn their wealth despite having a leg up head start in the world with wealthy families themselves but that doesn t make them perfect or overall good people They can abuse and exploit poorer people or in this instance they can feel no empathy for a family like the Kims whose circumstances were originally based on bad luck or the byproduct of the bad economy In other words the film doesn t really portray the concept accurately but yes there are wealthy families worse than the Parks who despite their money are also Parasites Not sure the movie was trying to metaphorically or ambiguously hint at this but it didn t do a great job of it although it does raise the subject It was a good overall movie though nonetheless 8 10,8.0,3.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476065/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,Parasite Really Bites,Parasite bites in a good way It bites you and doesn t let go ever Parasite is a Korean film with sub titles that tells the story of a poor lower working class family that is struggling to get by Father mother son and daughter They all have the important survival gene that poor people need to get by street smarts improvisation and slick with words When the son gets asked by a friend to substitute for him as an English teacher to a high school girl in a rich family the plot takes off Through outright lies and trickery the poor family weaves its way into the lives of the rich family becoming very intertwined in various ways The father is the ring leader but he is happy to let his kids get things started He tries other ways to earn money none of them very successful But the kids break thru and the family thinks they have hit the motherlode with the rich family Until the tide turns and soon they are fighting for their new lives Everything leads up to a brutal ending that leaves you stunned sad breathless but still a little hopeful The director does a clear job of showing that the rich family has no clue what it is like to struggle to survive They live on a hill in a huge house designed by a famous architect while the poor family lives in a basement apartment that would fit into one of the rich family s rooms There is a terrible scene during a heavy rainfall that highlights the plight of the poor The director strongly shows you that the rich family worries are about things that the poor can t even conceive of worrying about because they are struggling to survive The rich vs poor dichotomy permeates the film in every scene This film is about survival and about the struggles of the lower class vs how the rich live in their own world that can t even stand the smell of poverty You see that theme played out in several different scenes The cinematography does a great job of showing closeup facial expressions and camera angles so you are in the scene either in the poverty or in the rich Certain scenes were too dark and I could not easily tell what was happening This made me think of Transformer movies where robots fight but you can t tell who is who or who is winning The absolute star of the film is the rich family s wife She is a terrific actress Her character is the epitome of the deluded wealthy who have to find problems where there are none and who is easily tricked out of her money But she doesn t care because money is like air to her The acting is really great by everyone I didn t see the point of introducing a Romeo and Juliet like interaction It seemed like that was thrown in there Otherwise the story was biting and keeps you wondering what is going to happen how can this possibly work out Parasite is worth your while Great story Great acting Tough ending Enjoy,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7701508/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2021,eccentric - not for everyone,Like many korean movies this is flush with good actors and great visuals but the story is twisted at least there is a certain amount of sanity from the wealthy family strangely enuf while the desperately poor family at the heart of the film are so depraved that i thought they deserved their station in life the first half of the film showed this miserable family displaying such skill and intelligence and adaptability that it didn t seem possible they were the same people seen at the start of the film i quickly got bored waiting for the axe to fall and their plans to go awry but it took many dreary minutes for it to happen the second half was action filled and tense and chalk full of unexpected moments if the story had moved more quickly to this part i wouldn t be so down on the film but it didn t it s 2 hrs 12 minutes much of it in the accompaniment of unpleasant people who don t all get what they deserved,5.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7475915/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2019,"A clever, very modern tragicomedy.",I m not sure I would have seen this film without my wife s prodding and it s partly because of the title It s accurate enough to the storyline but as an English word it s a bit creepy in tone I think it needed a somewhat different translation from the original Korean But on to the film itself obviously it s a labor of love for Bong Joon Ho who s the writer director and producer I didn t know any of the actors beforehand but they are all just fine and they do a great job at making each one have distinct personalities among a fairly big cast of speaking roles I also like that in our theater we got subtitles rather than some clumsy dubbing and the subtitles are the best and most accurate I ve seen in recent times For lack of a better term I would describe this as a tragicomedy A slum dwelling family of four in an unnamed Korean city live by their wits on odd jobs Through a series clever little twists they find a way to gradually insinuate themselves into jobs as servants to a young rich suburbanite family who never suspect what they re getting The young family are indeed rich enough to pay a whole coterie of servants including a driver tutor housekeeper and nanny but they re not uber rich like the Crazy Rich Asians they actually do work hard and have their own issues Not knowing any better I ll take it for granted that their ultra modern Western style home and garden are realistic depictions of that class For about the first half of the movie this plotline is played for a good deal of humor But then through another series of twists this house of cards comes down and things go sideways leading to a rather shocking final scene Quite a lot hinges on the maybe improbable presence of a hidden underground bunker and a key character introduced very late in the story no spoilers There turns out to be more than one parasite at work and it s more than just the young rich folks who don t know what they are getting into It s a complex multilayered story 2 12 run time and the director throws quite a lot at us But there are no wasted or unnecessary scenes A prominent example is during a freak torrential rainstorm The rich folks on the high ground as we notice for the first time just sit inside their beautiful garden while the poor slum dwellers cannot save their pathetic basement flat from being washed away complete with raw sewage in the streets It s excruciating to watch and this is where the message hits home Basically decent people are forced into doing things they shouldn t do by their own circumstances and there is in the end nothing they can do to escape The message that class determines destiny was quite a bit more overt in Bong s previous effort Snowpiercer but it s present here too throughout At the end everyone is left damaged but we re given a wistful little coda that holds out just a tiny ray of hope That s only human,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5330383/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,"Not a Fun Watch, Not Interesting, Not Quality",Parasite is a shockingly overrated film that provides no likeable characters for the audience to root for If anything the most likeable people are the wealthy family being taken advantage of This can be forgiven movies with bad people as leads can still be good but Parasite is a depressing and often ridiculous ride There are completely unrealistic twists and turns and the final bloody actions of the main character seem unwarranted and mildly out of character I left the theater feeling like I had not only wasted time but was put in a bad mood from the overly bleak nature of the film I know I am in the vast minority here as every other person I have talked to loved the movie but to me Parasite was not just unworthy of a Best Picture award but was an terrible movie,2.0,3.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6998963/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2019,I've never seen a movie more deserving of a 10/10,Edit After the Oscars craze i felt compelled to talk about the good but overrated comments that I see more and more Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art It s very easily digestible by the masses as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel DC audiences can enjoy However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors They re subtle enough though that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect Those who seek an important and complex message can find it and those who seek a 2 hour entertainment can also find it Therefore we have the good but overrated phenomenon I ve just recently been introduced to the S Korean film industry After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S Korean films I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I ve experienced with Korean cinema so far Just for reference the Korean movies I ve seen so far are basically crime drama mystery movies with my top 3 being 1 Parasite 2 the Chaser 3 Memories of murder But there are many that I ve yet to watch What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world b funny with respect to the story and the characters and c weirdly they felt like they weren t trying too much I don t know if it s just me being sick of all the Hollywood s trying to be super cool act but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics And I find that very hard to do it really is a thin line I am so excited to have discovered S Korean cinema and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non Hollywood film industry as I was So regarding Parasite If you haven t seen the movie yet and considering watching it GO WATCH IT Don t read anything else Don t research and ideally don t even watch the trailer This movie stuck with me for days after watching it I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate What an experience it was My spoiler free thoughts This movie is a master class in film making and cinematography All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle nothing was thrown in your face I would almost describe it humble in all its glory This movie even if you watch it on mute has still a story to tell you Absolutely genius All praise to director Bong I don t remember the last time I watched a film and didn t check my phone at all during it I would say most films even the best ones have some filler shots meaning they have some kind of low energy points Parasite had me hooked throughout every single minute of it In other words you will not get bored It s so surprisingly entertaining through all its aspects and genres Dark comedy mystery thriller drama They blend so good and seamlessly that it s almost hard to pay attention to them because the plot just unravels so naturally that it just seems normal to change the whole mood of the movie Have you any idea how hard it is to do that how complicated it is But somehow Bong managed to make it look easy and natural When I was a kid I remember watching the Olympics with my dad I mostly enjoyed watching the divers I remember saying to my dad how easy it looked and how I could probably do it too shame on my sweet innocent self I know And my dad responded with something that stuck with me Whenever you think that something that somebody is doing looks easy that is because they are freakishly good at it and it s actually almost impossible to do by anyone else and that they have failed and cried and almost gave up probably a million times So respect to the professionals This movie reminded me of that Something extremely difficult that seems easy and effortless,10.0,13.0,20.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5266253/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2020,Real class warfare with a touch of Hitchcock and Billy Wilder.,I must confess to a long time bias against sub titles like many lazy Americans I felt like having to read while I watched a movie was just asking too much Then a few years ago I sat down and viewed a DVD of the fully restored SEVEN SAMURAI and really understood what I had been missing out on for too long especially when it came to Asian cinema So when Bong Joon ho s PARASITE won the Best Picture Oscar I didn t feel any of the dread at having to listen to a foreign tongue while reading along with the screen that might have come a few years back Now after watching last year s Best Picture on Blu Ray I say that for me PARASITE is so good I wasn t aware that I was reading anything after a first few minutes Set in South Korea the film works both as a thriller and at times a comedy of manners along with a strong social commentary theme I could see strong influences of both Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder in the script which centers on two families the Kims and the Parks The former are stuck in poverty living in a cramped basement apartment while the latter are quite wealthy living in a spacious house attended by a housekeeper and chauffer When the Kims son manages to snag a job as an English tutor to the Parks teenage daughter the family has a foot in the door and soon the rest of the Kims under false identities have infiltrated the household taking over the jobs of therapist to the ADD afflicted younger son housekeeper and chauffer finagling to have others fired from the last two jobs in order to obtain them for themselves The Kims are soon enjoying a newfound prosperity at the expense of their obliviously self absorbed employers But their deviousness has consequences and when the former housekeeper shows up one night when the Kims have the Parks house all to themselves the story takes a turn no one sees coming Giving away anymore of the twists the story takes would be unfair needless to say this is one of those films that goes in a lot of unexpected places There were some things that really stood out for me in this film One was how well it works as a suspense film liberally borrowing the situational irony that was a hallmark of Hitchcock a scene where three of the Kims have to hide themselves in the Park house and attempt to sneak out while Mr and Mrs Park go about their intimate business is a great example of this along with Hitchcock s patented voyeurism Characters practicing deception was one of Wilder s signature themes with the consequences of such deceptions playing out in the finale Second was the theme of class warfare how the Have Nots with their cunning and guile easily manipulate their supposed Betters while the latter feel wholly invincible in the superiority their wealth has brought them making them easy marks Third was how well the characters are written The Kims commit reprehensible acts in a cold blooded manner yet they really do love each other in a way that makes it impossible to totally condemn them Even the fired housekeeper who is revealed to have a skeleton in her closet is motivated by love for a family member I love films with complicated characters who are more than what they appear to be The screenplay written by Bong Joon ho and Han Jin won is a masterpiece of storytelling especially in the way they introduce a plot twist late in the second act that has only been slightly foreshadowed and how they get so much story out of small everyday things like a food allergy the Morse code that a Boy Scout learns and the musty scent of a damp basement This puts me in mind of Vince Gilligan and his masterful TV shows BREAKING BAD and BETTER CALL SAUL Lastly if there is a theme to PARASITE I would say it is that no matter what the difference in culture may be human nature is universal The acting especially Song Kang ho Jang Hye jin Choi Woo shik and Park So dam as the devious Kims is exceptional But real star is director Bong Joon ho who won the Best Director Oscar for his work My choice for Best Picture would have been ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD but I can t be too bummed out when my favorite lost to a movie as good as PARASITE,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5555988/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,Probably not something you have seen before - in a good way,O What I enjoyed most about Parasite is the complete culture shock from a Western perspective very few people will have seen a film like this The mannerisms of the cast both the rich socialites and the lowly main characters is unique to this film along with the settings used throughout the movie This not only delivers novel cinematography but combined with this unique story Parasite is worth watching for the experience alone The acting is strong right through the story with some excellent framing and shot shaping to emphasise certain points By the end you can see what got Bong Joon ho nominated for all these awards and you would have to agree he probably deserved to win most of them too,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6518812/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2020,A very bland and overrated film,At this point and I beg you if you are not going to read all of my arguments don t just downvote this so that others won t see it Parasite has become highly overrated It has got a lot of stuff going for it in a masterclass manner such as the editing and beautiful production design as well as just people s curiousity it being an acclaimed foreign film suddenly sky rocketing in attention worldwilde But overall the story is bland It is extremely unrealistic especially at the end Like I suspended disbelief with a lot of stuff in this movie to enjoy it and it s fine we all do that sometimes When that certain character was still alive at the end being able to go out unnoticed by police or really anyone and understand and perfectly read a huge monologue made by morse codes from a lamp The amount of just the right timing and ignoring common sense in terms of movie logic and even character logic It s insane You can suspend disbelief and have a good time but that is beyond ridiculous And to be frank it was unneccesary The point the movie wanted to come across was already made at the climax so giving us two long final monologues arguing them again was more than not needed It s also shallow with its message and missing the point of having something specific to say At the end the message becomes something like plans are not good you ll fail if you re from a low social class either way Yet in the beginning their clear laziness yet cunning way of corrupting the rich family is what got them into this mess Not that lacking a plan and staying the same feeding off of others would ve made it better It s really just that the plan they did make was unbelievably insane and not very long term sustainable So what is the point and message again and how does it count here I m sure you can spend hours yourself coming up with some different things which are taken out of this scene and this scene and make sense but the movie is just too unclear and too unspecific to really get it across overall as a story Especially since the situation these people make up and weren t even forced into is not really related to how low class people actually deal with stuff such as their place in opposition to the higher class There s been cases of this but it just doesn t fit with the point and have any moral or commonsense value It seems more than anything than an attempt to make us feel pity for people who were low and somehow got themselves even lower Which making us feel pity succeeds but please pity is one weak goal for a story when you leave behind the actual fight to get past it Then what is the journey For one I don t like the Joker comparisons but in this case the main character in that movie tried to get out of the pity before he became corrupt hence making a point of the hopelessness no matter how he did the right thing he would ve ended up like that This It felt like Suicide Squad writing in the way of moving from one point to another an explosion here and a twist there enough to keep you from figuring the whole movie out but when one sequence is introduced peach sequence you quickly figure out that the end of that is going to be the whole family taking over and these sequences keep happening over the course of the entire movie Surprise oh so this is what s happening Surprise oh so this is what s happening And it doesn t make for much organic fluent storytelling overall or delivers a message along with it although the smooth and undeniably masterful editing and rhytm will try and convince you of that The symbolism is also very in your face and sometimes outright stupid The whole going up and down stairs thing to demonstrate class system etc is cool enough especially watching it as a brilliantly mood grabbing visual although obvious and seriously unavoidable considering it s just how you go down into a basement and rich people houses usually just live on the higher grounds Throwing in a rock and leaving the audience to come up with something to say about it is to me disrespectful I ve looked up so many interviews with the cast and Bong himself but they don t seem to know or care about explaining it themselves they never dig into the actual symbolism they just go here this is symbolism it s great right and go to the next thing they love but appear humble about in their movie A lot of saying that there is symbolism and meaning in everything yet being very hollow about it or it s something that is obvious and you d do in most movies to get a point across Then I looked up audience interpretations of everything from the rock to the weather and dialogue and there s nothing mindblowing nor very impressive about it Especially that rock and what they do with it in the movie it s just wow thanks makes sense A lot of people are praising this movie so highly yet it s a very decent film without anything too much to say and an unbelievablity factor that s offensive at last I don t know why people praise it so highly If it s just the momentum it s been building up Rated 22 movie of all time over Silence of the Lambs The Green Mile The Usual Suspects and a dozen of other classics which put so much more obvious work into their scripts and therefore the solids of their movies Winning Best Picture and Best Director over 1917 a cinematic war piece you ll simply never see at the same level again and Joker a movie that was actually clear with its message that there is a certain hopelessness in class systems no matter how hard you try It literally makes no sense except for the momentum and everybody downvoting and ignoring anyone who has got anything negative to say about it Scary stuff Parasite worked on multiple levels but to me the writing simply tore much of that apart It s very sad that other masterpieces were almost completely or completely ignored at the Oscars while something like this gets away with not only the biggest prize of them all but also several other big ones Best Director and even Original Screenplay when there are major issues in all of those departments That said the Oscars are known for doing what it takes to stay relevant and out of too much danger as well as voting with sometimes anything but commonsense I hope that in time people will calm down step down from their high horses and actually take in some of this And I really hope that some of the other movies which didn t get the same amount of attention and praise at the Oscars will live on greatly A sad disappointment Thank you sincerely if you ve read this much I appreciate it

3 May 2021,"Interesting plot, good acting, very weird and almost completely devoid of everything I love about Korean Television",In the last few years I pretty much exclusively watch Korean television apart from a few good Chinese dramas and this is why Incredible story telling brilliant acting and an ability to create a story where warmth kindness humility villains tragedy and decency are skilfully blended into a story that takes you on a journey with enough realism and fiction to leave you satisfied and happy They don t have to be rom coms it doesn t seem to matter what the genre most of course not all leave you not just entertained but are thought provoking too With this in mind and all the hype and awards this film received I felt that I should watch it I can take weird some parts of many K dramas are a bit weird but in a good or at least tolerable way It wasn t that I didn t understand what the writer was trying to convey I just felt it was all over the place with no actual storyline K dramas are not like US or UK dramas they are basically one long film divided into episodes which allows complex characters touching and thought provoking moments and interesting story lines to develop For this reason the film felt really short to me I m so disappointed The acting was good but I felt the sofa scene and ending in very poor taste not to mention the unbelievable recovery of the son I think I will stick to my well selected K dramas and definitely avoid this writer from now on Don t judge all Korean television by this drama unless of course you loved it which surprisingly many seem to,5.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6876415/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,Definitely overrated for some obscure reason,Here is why I think this movie is overrated The characters are unconvincing Given that they all have an eye for exploiting other people for money how did they become so poor in the first place unless there was some kind of sudden divine inspiration And is uncouth behavior all the working class would like to achieve once given the opportunity to become rich Although the movie seems to be compassionate with the poor as a first impression it does the au contraire from a class perspective The naive and gullible rich are defrauded by the covetous poor Shouldn t be like the rich are covetous so they have become rich The acting is mediocre if not bad compared to other Korean movies such as Handmaiden or 3 iron All in all it is a so so movie which nobody will lose anything if not watches,5.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6543497/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2019,An Ongoing Metaphor About Class Struggle,GRADE B THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IN BRIEF Brilliantly directed Parasite is a dark satire about class warfare that burrows into your moviegoing pleasure and doesn t let go JIM S REVIEW Korean director Bong Joon ho is a very versatile talent whose work is always visionary and highly personal but not always successful due to his penchant for overstatement His film subjects most always deal with social issues and oppressive forces against the common man Yet his films can range to a host of genres from horror film to surreal sci fi to political satire One cannot easily pigeonhole this director and even his lesser films which become borderline contrived still contain powerful messages about greed consumerism and class struggles Parasite may be his best film to date It is a thrilling and complicated tale that keeps the moviegoer guessing its outcome The film starts out as a dark comedy then suddenly veers into pure satire before finishing its journey as a crime story It is an exhilarating ride Dare I say very twisted metaphorically speaking The literate screenplay by Han Jin won and co authored by the director contrasts two Korean families the Kims a clan of poor grifters living in squalor in a sub basement apartment doing menial low paying jobs just to get by and the Parks an affluent and dysfunctional family that take their wealth unwisely for granted The Kims work their way into the Parks lives through their lies and deceptive action all resulting in tragic events The script cleverly weaves The Kims greedy scheming against the Parks naivety and shallowness to a crescendo of mayhem and violence The film does have one too many anti climatic endings and needed a bit more concise storytelling for stronger impact but Bong Joon ho masterfully conveys his raging vision of the working class and the elite at war The cast is wonderful Song Kang ho is the impoverished patriarch and Jang Hye jin is his shrewish wife Choi Woo shik is their idealistic son and Park So dam is their wily daughter They battle Lee Sun kyan as a haughty businessman and Cho Yeo jeong in a scene stealing role as his fragile and dim wife Strong production values reinforce the sharp divide between the classes Visually the dirty and cramped cluttered apartment contrasts dramatically with the sunlit contemporary Architectural Digest prototypes created by designer Ha jun Lee Cinematographer Kyung pyo Hong lenses the two settings lighting one home in dark umber hues and claustrophobic low angles while using bright intense lighting to imply the stark formal symmetry of the other dwelling in order to establish the imbalance of both families Parasite is insightful and excels in its execution Bong Joon ho creates lasting images that correspond directly to his narratives His film has much to say about the ongoing power struggle between those who have and those who have not Simply put it is one of the year s best films,9.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5243893/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2020,Socially and politically conscious film that mixes various genres masterfully,Bong Joon Ho the South Korean film director producer and screenwriter is known for using social themes mixing genres and including black comedy with sudden shifts of tone in his filmography Although Parasite 2019 is the first movie of his I got to enjoy Okja 2017 and Snowpiercer 2013 have been on my watchlist for quite a while I should seriously consider watching them when I ll have the chance One of his trademarks is that his films are socially and politically conscious and he displays that strong subject matter while using black humor and bold saturated colors He s only the second Asian director to win the Oscar for the best director the other one is Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain 2005 and Life of Pi 2012 and the first one of Korean descent to do so and I want to discuss the success of Parasite and why the movie is highly appreciated by most of the critics Writing nasty but lovable people isn t an easy task but Parasite executed this trope perfectly The movie follows the Kims a poor family who makes a living by taking odd jobs such as folding pizza boxes Things turn around as the adult son Ki woo gets recommended as an English tutor for a teenage daughter of an upper class family the Parks That s when the long con started to take motion soon after Ki woo sets up his sister Ki jeong as an art tutor for the Parks youngest son then both of them land their father a job as Mr Park s chauffeur and their mother a job as the housekeeper while keeping the fact that they are related a secret to the parks This mischievous behavior would be fraud during most cases but over here you just couldn t help but root for the family as the way they set this whole plan in motion is impressive to say the least The other thing this movie managed to accomplish is displaying something that isn t common in popular media The plot of a low income family infiltrating an upper class family is unheard of to me and this new experience is a part of what made this movie great Other than that the other great factor is the way multiple genres like family drama dark comedy a political thriller and horror are used here that question us what to expect from this movie and where the plot will lead The serious major switch in the genre comes as the Kims have successfully infiltrated the home of the Parks and they take advantage of the upper class family s absence to live in the mansion as if it was their own Much to their surprise the previous maid returns to the Parks residence and reveals that her husband has been living in their secret shelter for several years Conflict arises between the Kims and the previous maid and her husband with Kims being held hostage The situation quickly gets out of hand as the previous made is left in a critical situation back in the secret shelter where her husband is tied up and the Kims have little to no time to clean up this whole mess as the Park are returning in a jiffy This whole sequence that consumed the middle of the movie was the tensest part of the movie that shifted the mood of the movie while complimenting the plot masterfully Bong Joon Ho is no stranger to burying political and social comments here and there in his films Seeing how the poor family and the upper class family view some issues you can notice a drastic difference which perhaps influenced the decision made by the father figure in Kim s family Ki taek After they narrowly escape being caught in the Parks residence they return to their home which is ravaged by the storm and everything is flooded They re forced to spend the night in the homeless shelter while the Park sees the storm as a blessing as the next day is beautiful and they can make an impromptu party for their son They don t even think about those damaged by the storm and the Kims are all invited to the party either for work or entertainment purposes All is going according to plan until the husband of the previous maid gets out and goes all out on Kims After he stabs Ki jeong the youngest in the Park family faints as he has seen the husband of the maid before thinking it s a ghost there was a whole sub plot around this than I skipped over and Mr Park wants to take him to the hospital pronto barely even thinking about the stabbing of Ki jeong Ki take makes an unexpected decision and stabs Mr Park out of the blue Now thinking about it a lot of factors that we re going outside the plot lead to this decision but it was more due to the social injustice than the actions of Mr Park before the incident At least I d like to think that s what leads to the result Overall everything comes together perfectly in this film What Bong Joon ho accomplished here is a story with multiple layers that is entertaining without sacrificing its social commentary and themes of classism social justice capitalism and greed not only in South Korea but the whole world It begins as a simple heist film unlike we have ever seen before but it soon expands into multiple genres and takes a lot of unexpected turns I want to applaud everything the acting cinematography music use of horror tropes and all the messed up stuff that I m not totally sure I understand yet it all works together beautifully to bring an unforgettable experience,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6336609/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,"Parasite has a unique originality, unmissable, strong, intriguing ...",We can say that it is a film without a defined genre even though it is practically a rule within the seventh art to have a definition if the plot is a comedy drama suspense adventure or any other parasite breaks this rule in a stupendous way We have a good photograph we have Oscar worthy performances a breathtaking suspense with heavy scenes like falling down the stairs and stoned on the head sometimes with some comic relief but nothing compares to the script and direction In a current cinematographic world without originality we see a parasite which we see a father of the family ki taek song kang ho unemployed killing a parasitic insect which we can think of as if it were a spoiler from the end but in reality he and his family end up playing this role deceiving and lying in order to suck financial power and gradually take over the upper class family home With a direction that manages to place all these gender elements mentioned above in a single work in a masterful way placing more abstract and intriguing motifs like the stone carried by the English instructor son how to place the upper class house on top and when the family parasites he needs to return to his home in the flood and he descends all the time as if he were returning to his former social class with the vomit in a toilet and exploding the water outlet in the other toilet all with magnificent edition But nothing compared to the script exactly everything fits here all the motives of all the characters being an upper class family with one child paying more attention than the other for having had a trauma of having seen a ghost the daughter alone and sad that he has an emotional need being taken advantage of by the son of the parasitic family instructor of English who takes the opportunity to integrate his whole family with functions as a driver housekeeper and arts instructor we see that there were parasites in the family they just stayed and switched places Parasite has a unique originality unmissable strong intriguing and makes us hope all the time that the parasites are not discovered,10.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8575840/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2020,Bong Joon Ho did it again.,From all Asian countries South Korea is definitely the country that releases the best Asian movies I ve seen plenty of good movies from South Korea but Parasite must be the best one thus far I was surprised and not it won all those Oscars but to be honest Bong Joon Ho deserves those awards He made quality movies before like Snowpiercer for instance so it was only a matter of time before he got recognition In Gisaengchung Parasite the acting is very good not the typical loudspeaking Korean where it looks like they re always mad at something so for that alone it s worth watching The story is catching well written and keeps you at the edge of your seat for the entire movie The difference between the poor and the rich the envy the jealousy the scamming it s all very entertaining It never felt like a long movie because it s just well made and it s a refreshing story not one of those stories that has been done over and over again I m glad it won the Oscar for best foreign picture totally deserved,9.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5561444/?ref_=tt_urv

15 August 2019,No one does it quite like Joon-ho Bong! [+84%],It s safe to say the Joon ho Bong is one of the greatest original storytellers of our generation The man s filmography speaks for itself Barking Dogs Never Bite Memories of Murder The Host Mother Snowpiercer Okja and now Parasite that s the kind of portfolio to be proud of Now let s talk about the movie in question here Parasite is a darkly funny social satire that paints a subtle yet not so subtle picture of different social strata On one hand we have Kim Ki taek the brilliant Song Kang ho an out of work driver who lives in a dingy apartment with his wife Choong Sook a mighty effective Jang Hye jin and his two college age kids Ki woo and Ki jyeong On the other we have the well off family of Mr Park that comprises of himself his wife Yeon Kyo and his two children Da Hye and Da song A series of events leads to Kim ki woo getting employed by the Park family as Da Hye s tutor Then we come across the master plan executed by Kim Ki woo to get each one in his family employed by the Parks This stretch of street smarts versus rich naivety while engaging and funny still seemed like it was missing the element of twist commonly associated with Bong s films But what awaits you beyond the first hour is utterly inventive It s indeed twists and thrills galore with performances by every single cast member rising to the occasion Parasite as a film should claim a rightful genre to itself It s a masterful blend of so many genres comedy family drama plenty of it survival thriller satire horror rarely and many more The social inequality trope isn t used for stirring extra sentiment Instead Bong cleverly plays around the concept and shows how intelligent film makers can tell a story revolving around every section of the society without pandering to either Most of all Bong s attention to detail is impeccable and this pays off in several scenes The film boasts several scenes not moments scenes altogether that are worthy of further discussion The subtext is impressively underplayed with the second hour leaving no stone unturned The climax is the best thing about Parasite as is the case with most of Bong s movies and it makes a giant statement both in terms of storytelling and as a cinematic finale Parasite is the kind of film that needs multiple viewings a second or a third viewing will reveal even greater context about each of the meticulously created characters Also two thumbs up for the production design and cinematography departments for making everything in the film appear so very real Verdict This time around the monsters are human and they re more than fierce A MUST WATCH,8.0,3.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5060938/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2019,Strongly Directed by Bong Joon-Ho,There are more strong film makers in this world than are just sitting in traditionally English speaking Countries like the U S England One of the strongest and a Director that I will watch WHATEVER he is Directing is South Korean auteur Bong Joon Hoo His previous efforts THE HOST OKJA SNOWPIERCER amongst others were all led by intriguing stories interesting people and strong visual imagery so I was very excited for his newest effort PARASITE I purposely did not find out too much about this film for I wanted to be surprised by what was unfolding in front of me And I was rewarded greatly by another intriguing story with interesting people and strong visual imagery In Korean with English subtitles PARASITE follows a lower class Korean family that go to work for a high class Korean family and brings us on a journey for BOTH families And that s all I m going to say about it for to reveal anything else would be to spoil the surprises along the way But as is often the case with these types of stories it is the journey not the destination that is the treat of this film Bong Joon Ho regular Kang ho Song stars as the Patriarch of the lower class family who seemingly is lazy and allergic to work but that is not really the case Woo sik Choi is the son of the lower class family that connects with the daughter of the higher class family and Hye jin Jang is the matriarch of the lower class family and they both bring sensitivity and strength to their roles But for me the real star of this film is So dam Park as the daughter of this family who turns out to be the heart and the brains of the operation Director Bong Joon Ho brings his usual flair to the proceedings not letting his camera shy away from the seemy underbelly of this society but not lingering on it either moving the surprising plot along at a fast enough pace to keep you guessing throughout I see a lot of films so when I run across a plot that I couldn t tell what was going to come next it is satisfying And satisfying this film is Some are calling it an Oscar Contender and I don t think I would go quite that far the film does drag a bit in the middle But if you can handle reading the subtitles you ll be entertained indeed by the fervent mind of one of the better Directors working in film today Letter Grade A 8 stars out of 10 and you can take that to the Bank ofMarquis,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5251647/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2020,"Over-rated, but an Entertaining Black Comedy !",Parasite is a fine example of Korean cinema and an entertaining cross generic piece with overt Hitchcock influences but the best film of 2019 and the best screenplay Well I m sorry I don t think so Not by a long way It s very professionally made and the main themes of class conflict social inequality and wealth disparity are hard to miss But that s the thing for a film that s won an Oscar for best screenplay there s precious little subtlety or nuance on show Mrs Park is simply depicted as an air headed social matriarch with Mr Park who s supposedly had the brains and initiative to start up a successful multi national company not much better The Kims on the other all seem exceedingly bright sharp as tacks in spite of their living conditions which can only be described as basement third world in a first world economy I m not doubting the existence of the banjiha but seeing the Kims continually lob up to work so fashionably and immaculately dressed in clean pressed clothes and so intelligently well spoken hardly rings true This is before and after their abode and presumably their wardrobes have been entirely flooded with sewage For me all the best storylines generally have more distinctive shading of characters and behaviours not the absolute stark contrasts between the haves and have nots on display in Parasite And I need to emphasise here that I m talking about intelligences too not just material possessions and finances A film such as 1917 dazzled me in places to the extent that I was wondering how they managed to do such and such a sequence I was entertained by Parasite but never enthralled by what many critics were and are still saying is a near perfect picture I can t agree with this sort of summation Having said that I must confess to having a leaning towards seeing the black and white edit that is supposedly going to be on offer later this year I am intrigued to see whether a look at that might alter my perspective somewhat,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5529820/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2021,An average rating is an insult to the word average,Let me say from the outset that I love films that are extraordinary They take you out of your comfort zone full of surprises and have a totally new slant on the art of film making Well unfortunately Parasite is none of these things There are very few films I have actually walked out of the cinema before the end out of pure boredom Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Junior was a notable lowlight truly truly awful Well Parasite has just joined this illustrious group I m not going to criticise or question the sanity of people who say this is a masterpiece That s up to them But I genuinely just don t get it Awful acting boring dialogue no direction this film has no redeeming feature in my humble opinion Hence the title of this review this film isn t average it s way way worse than that But go see it yourself you may love it Just don t try to convince me that this is anything more than a total snore fest,1.0,20.0,40.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6823248/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2019,Parasite (2019),There is a real insurmountable hype surrounding Bong Joon ho s latest film Playing only in one theater in NYC and it was sold out all weekend Luckily I was able to go see an early showing of this film on my day off The hype is real I enjoyed this film and was glued to the screen for the entire duration of the film Its funny smart violent and socially timely Whatever you do please go see Parasite as it is going to be one of the best films of the year and is one of my favorites already The film is about a poor family who live in a shabby basement and need money and struggle to survive An opportunity comes for the son of the family as he forges documents and gets a job as a private tutor for a very wealthy family Soon the rest of his family begin setting up situations where each of them get hired for the family The family keep their identities hidden but soon come across dark situations and they must go to great lengths to protect their secret and their new found wealth Bong Jonon ho s films are usually very well shot and there is no difference here Everything is so pristine and each small detail tells a story The script for this film is a mix of comedy and thriller and it works so well The leading family in this film are desperate and in poverty so you want to identity with them but then you realize that this family do some terrible stuff for their own greed even if it means hurting innocent people The film goes into the depths of exploring class differences and the gap between the wealthy and poor It doesn t matter the country this is just ever present everywhere Its underlying and subtle at first but the theme resonates especially through the patriarch of the family portrayed by Song Kang ho I m trying to find something to criticize about the film but am struggling to find things I didn t like It is a fairly long film but it zooms by because of how entertaining it truly is This is of course the final season of the year and Oscar season is in full swing Parasite should really be up there with a Best Picture nomination and I d say is a strong contender for being the best film of the year Its so mesmerizing in all regards I might need to check out more South Korean films as I greatly appreciated Burning last year I m gonna reiterate go and see this film 8 5 10,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5189161/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2020,Breaks the boundaries of just a movie,Parasites are a social movie whose main theme is a discussion about poverty In the main role a family of poor people who get a job in the house of the rich At first glance it seems that the name Parasites obviously expresses the author s opinion about the main characters But then you realize that the main characters are shown with great love and the author would not like to call them guilty But the rich family is not exposed as antagonists they are naive kind people as much the main characters as the poor It is not possible to call the third family parasites Then who are the parasites I would say that the parasites in this film and this is what makes movies valuable to me are rather States social statuses Poverty as well as wealth are parasites they set boundaries they deform people and people are not really to blame people by their nature do not seek evil they are only victims If we talk about the plot and the overall feeling of the picture it is dynamic and interesting the dialogues are cute the plot is constantly developing and growing and resembles Kafka in the sense of growing and growing absurdity In General the film is a Comedy it is easy to watch through the whole picture there is a light humor and irony from this the ending becomes surreal it is even more felt that all the characters are victims Also in the film there is an extremely pleasant and easy symbolism Very interesting is accompanied by the movement of the plot and characters of the symbol of water which at one point becomes a flow a symbol of the smell which becomes smell the use of characters for foreign words the idea of plan which gradually develops one of the characters the stone that brings wealth and relationship of the hero with him This gives room for intellectual play and a more complete immersion in the picture and situation It is impossible not to say that the film is damn beautiful and flawlessly shot I would like to say something about dialogues sometimes they are so vital and interesting that it takes your breath away I liked the ending very much apparently the author still comes to the sad conclusion that no matter what poverty can not be overcome you can not cross the boundaries that the characters are trying to break 10 out of 10,10.0,6.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5491268/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2019,Among the best films of this decade!,If Memories of Murder did not solidify Mr Bong s place as one of this century s greatest artists then this film certainly did I cannot remember the last time I saw a film this great in theaters By a full 1 5 stars this film has replaced Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as my favorite film of 2019 Of course that is subject to change but I can t see this being beat any time soon Parasite is a film about which I think I should say as little as possible Knowing nothing about the plot going in was a great benefit The film has so much to say about class about wealth about family about society It is all so focused and direct The movie never meanders or wanders off to other topics It is excellently paced and has fantastic editing The script is so well written both in terms of dialogue progression of the plot set up and payoff reincorporation and commentary The film looks fantastic as most of this director s other pictures do The music is pretty great very well timed and sometimes used for comedic effect The acting is great too Song Kang Ho is great as usual but the younger actors and the women do great as well I especially loved Jo Yeo Jeong s performance I think watching this in theaters is definitely worth it if you can manage I loved this movie I think it is a pretty accessible foreign film My showing was pretty full and the next two showings were sold out entirely I m really happy that people are watching this and I hope to God that the movie gets the Academy recognition it deserves 9 5 10 could be a 10 on the second watch,9.0,16.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5237898/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,An odd movie ... but good,I can t help but think that if I were Korean I d somehow catch more nuances and details and end up appreciating this movie a bit more I kind of wish Bong Joon Ho called it something else Since he s done several well received sci fi themed movies I couldn t get it out of my head that maybe a sub plot in the movie involved sinister parasites Nope it s purely a metaphor And that s still fine I liked the movie and was interested to see how it developed But I wouldn t say it was spine tinglingly suspenseful shocking or fully engrossing There were a couple of plot twists that took the movie in new directions However I don t think Ho was able to fully capitalize and leverage the twists after the moment had past The story is unusual but I didn t find myself having any thought provoking ideas after the show was over No doubt it still was interesting to watch the story of two families from different socioeconomic classes interact It kept my attention throughout it s 2 hour runtime but I d still call it good not great,7.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5229800/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2021,A Film With Real Characters And Human Interest,After hearing everyone go on about this film for almost a year I finally caught it last night and was blown away by the craft Parasite was clearly made by someone who loves cinema and puts a lot of thought into shaping characters and plot The first half of this film is as close to perfection as anything I ve ever seen We are introduced to the very human relatable Kim family forced to hustle due to their extremely limited means The steal wifi and fold pizza boxes for money And then they get a foot in the door to gain various types of employment from a wealthy family who need an English tutor I won t spoil the plot any more than that but this film buzzes along from one exciting and interesting event to the next in a way that s logical humurous compelling and occasionally dark The first hour or so is the set up and the second half of the film is a murky thriller that borders on horror Some people find fault with the second half of the film and I will say it has some very minor issues with shifts in pacing and some slightly abrupt exposition EDIT just watched it a second time and the pacing in the second half is fine I just didn t take it all in well the first time around but these are minor quibbles and not enough for me to deduct a point The film had such a likable warm centre that I simply don t want to take away from it In terms of meaning I saw Parasite as being about the extreme difficulty of upward social mobility The son of the family is shown climbing stairs to a higher social station only to descend them again later on in the rain The Kims stare up at the world from the window of their semi basement abode and enjoy better surroundings on a higher level later on but seem destined to return whence they came It also deals very explicitly with the lack of solidarity between members of the working class during conflict You get the sense too that the movie is saying that being good or bad has little to do with where you land in society The Kims do bad things but you completely understand why they do them The rich family they land jobs with the Parks actually seem like nice enough people although they ve allowed themselves to become detached snobby and insulated against the feelings of others The Parks don t have to hustle and lie because they re already well shod and well fed and the director makes sure you realise this that people hustle and scheme at times when they re desperate not because they re terrible And that if you re lucky enough to be doing well you can afford not to get your hands dirty it s implied there is an element of luck in the Park family s success because they are depicted as pretty naive and gullible and not as wildly talented geniuses the father is apparently doing well in a good company but on the whole they come across as fairly ordinary or even doltish Anyway I rambled on about this movie but I enjoyed it so much I want to encourage anyone who hasn t seen it to check it out One final word the acting sets and music are all fantastic and the movie is great to look at,10.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6687998/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2020,Will the real parasite please stand up?,We see a family that gradually starts to feed off of a privileged family which is clear But at the same time it showed us how it is actually the opposite the privileged depending on the lower classes in a very disturbing way The rich generic family needed a help for almost everything in their life For tutoring the kids and much more than just tutoring academics for making food for supporting the mother who actually has no idea on how to live her life or form an opinion for driving the father etc and even for the dynamic between the husband and wife It showed that most of their conversations were about the help This is in fact what most of the very privileged people do in society is depend a lot on the people doing work for them and not see them as actual beings with their own families and lives It is a form of usage that goes very far and the usage of the underprivileged in a very disproportioned power structure creates a co dependant relationship E g The man adoring the master And many times it costs a lot for the underprivileged The poor classes have no choice but to invest so much time in someone else s family instead of in their own because they need the salary The upperclass knows this very well and abuses their power for this The dynamic of the poor family in the movie was very enjoyable and pulled me in the movie The story started out very interesting but to me it fell flat towards the end It could have been so much better with a better storyline Im not saying I want a happy ending and definitely am not a lover of clich s I just wanted it to develop more It feels that right in the middle of the development of the story it suddenly went flat A nice movie i don t care about awards its all politics anyhow a good one time watch and maybe a rewatch to revisit the crazy antics in the beginning and middle of the movie Favourite character the poor dad,7.0,3.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5503136/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2020,Masterful,Parasite is a masterpiece worthy of all the praise and awards it has received The title alone has about 4 different meanings depending on your interpretation of the story So metaphorical as a certain character says multiple times Every single performance is brilliant from Kang ho Song Woo sik Choi So dam Park and Hye jin Jang as the Kims to Sun kyun Lee and Yeo jeung Jo as the parents of the Parks to everyone in between In fact there isn t a single area that the film falters in Production design editing score cinematography they are all top class The script by Bong Joon ho and Jin Won Han is superb covering a spectrum from dark comedy to social commentary The direction by Bong is absolutely brilliant too However my absolute favourite thing about the film is the seamless tonal shifts The film covers most genres that you could think of from comedy and drama to thriller and even horror and it does all of this without feeling out of place for a second Some of the tensest scenes I ve seen in a film are contained here and they are utterly brilliant No matter your interpretation there s a clear message here from an examination of money or lack of and beyond The movie is spectacular and will undoubtedly go down as a classic,10.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5511329/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,Parasite arduous at times,I found Parasite problematic to watch The subtitles were often difficult to read and were put on too fast Some were posted white on a light background That was hard to read Subtitles take away from the visual of the film and in this case the visuals of what was happening were paramount The good part in my opinion was the social commentary of the disparity between rich and poor The difference is extreme The poor were depicted there living in filth and squalor The way the poor live in Korea not being able to get jobs is mind numbing I have read that many in Korea live as the pictured in the film The film showed effectively social class dichotomy What happens to the rich when the poor invade their home surreptitiously is ultimately extreme violence It is nothing short of mayhem especially at the end Not sure if it would be everyone s cup of tea I don t think so Reading the subtitles was difficult and I had to bury my head to avoid watching the violence I think it should not have gotten best pic In my opinion the Irishman was gypped in spades,5.0,4.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5504043/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2019,Chilling commentary on the class system.,I went into this this film only knowing the premise An unemployed family worm their way into getting jobs in a wealthy families home This film starts off fun and it is very satarical it then takes a very dark turn The direction is amazing and dialogue is very funny and twisted The acting is top notch but the real star of this film is the Korean director he wrote directed and produced this film The music and compasitions of scenes are so well thought out You really didn t know what was coming next That is so refreshing and exciting as a film goer This is a really strong commentary on the class system and what you would do if your deseperate to live the high life Its hard to review this film without giving too much away I will say be warned the violence is not for the faint heart hearted If you love to be entertained and watch something different this is for you This film will not be forgotten come Oscar season A masterpiece of cinema 4 5 stars,9.0,4.0,21.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4985812/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2020,Academy gracefully anoints the rightful King...,I always respected Academy for their independence and the best professional group of critics in cinematography in the world They didn t hesitate to award Parasite with 4 Oscars in the most important categories I watched Parasite over and over again since Cannes award The progression of the film storyline is amazing as every episode links each other seamlessly but with more deeper tensions The intermission was when Mr Park s family was away for camping Director Bong probably wanted to provide the audiance a moment to enjoy relax but with the thunderstorm the fatal second half deploys This movie embraces all genre I would call it neo genre by Bong and detailed beauty of the social diversity unfold to its extream I have a habit of reading reviews before choosing films and especially I read most of the reviews just before the Oscars announcement Most of the IMDB members left 8 10 mostly 10 but after the awards I can see unexplainable reviews 1 or 2 with non sense I know it s out of jealousy and lack of understanding for the Korean films Hope you watch Parasite again and rethink,10.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5474750/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2021,Probably one of the best films of the 21st century. For real.,There are times where we really deserve a good thrill from a good movie If you re looking for one then Parasite is one hell of a cinematic ride to take Bong Joon ho s direction calls back to the brilliant direction a master like Hitchcock would provide which would be full of unique visuals and stellar composition And since I m on the topic of masters I am convinced that Director Bong Joon ho will go down as not just a master of the directing craft but also of the screenwriting craft The screenplay which he co wrote with Han Jin won is full of not just so many twists and turns but filled with so much genre bending twists that there s never a moment where you feel the trope is overused Both Bong and Han clearly know how to write a screenplay that is just as effective as say a screenplay like the one for Chinatown Then comes the performances of the cast This film is a prime example of casting done right Song Kang ho plays Kim Ki taek the father of the poor Kim family desperate to break the boundaries set by classism and infiltrate the luxurious home of the Park family with Lee Sun kyun and Cho Yeo jeong playing the father and mother respectfully Every single actor in this films shines like cinematic gold in their respectful roles So if you like films that are original imaginative thrilling and oh so brilliant acted written and directed then please Give Parasite a go I promise you will be in for a surprised A really big one,0.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7270185/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2023,"Objectively as possible, it was super boring",I was excited to finally see this movie with all the rave reviews awards and hype behind it but man it was so boring that I found it difficult to make it through to the end The main reason for me is because there was no character development More specifically there was nothing in any of the characters that made me care about them so the whole movie is just things happening and nothing at stake from a viewer s perspective Nothing that happens is particularly shocking or twisted either I might even say that it s fairly predictable Going back to my main point didn t care for any of the events that happened Even if I didn t know about the hype beforehand I can objectively say it was just a boring movie For me anyway,3.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8934804/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2019,One of the Best of 2019,I m a fan of Joon ho Bong s films although I haven t seen one of his most famous films Memories of Murder I was very excited to see this movie with my wife who uncharacteristically was interested in a foreign art film There s a lot going on in this movie so I am afraid my own exploration of it here will only scratch the surface of what there is to say about it I ll only briefly mention the cinematography which is just wonderful This is Joon ho unleashed from the bonds of entertainment that are part and parcel with a film that is released on Netflix Okja or in American theaters Snowpiercer Here he can luxuriate with height imagery ranging from subterranean staircases to winding city streets descending into the slums in order to sub textually communicate ideas to his audience and he does it with subtle panache What I think the average movie goer will appreciate most about this film is the dichotomy of humor and terror in the characters acting script and general feel of the film It is certainly the most jarring turn of atmosphere I have seen in a film this year and one that I like to imagine every one who watches this film will enjoy and experience as a true revelation The themes of class struggle and survival all writ large in this film From the beginning where we see the poor as they seek to find the means to sustain their lives by abandoning their true identities to be whatever the rich want them to be in order to glean scraps from their table to the dismissal of the poor for even the hint of an offense rather than actually getting to know them and their place to the desperation of people being asked to sub exist and their eventual reaction this film stuns by not only displaying the benefits of a life linked to a wealthy person and the happiness that some find there but also watching that happiness turn to despair as time passes The humor and joy that is in Parasite is truly experienced by the audience so that the turn feels true as well when the rug is pulled out This isn t a horror movie with a dash of humor or a funny movie with a sprinkle of violent class struggle It is both one of the funniest movies I ve seen all year and the terror inducing in the same way as the best atmospheric horror that 11 50 at your local cinema can buy All of this is interesting but if done too heavy handed feels preachy or propagandist Luckily Joon ho knows how to restrain himself from such blunt force methods as having someone scream something like Soylent green is people or You maniacs you blew it up boy did CH ever corner the market on that By restraining himself it allows the audience to come to conclusions ask questions and discuss amongst themselves without the feeling of manipulation It respects the audience enough to say I m not going to tell you how to think but check out this funny crazy and fantastic situation and let s hear what YOU think I imagine there are a host of other interesting reading of this film and that is what makes it so fascinating and gives me some degree of comfort when I call this movie more than a movie It is Art Not everyone is into art I am If you are too than you should definitely be searching this movie out supporting it thinking about it and discussing it I know I was thinking about it for days afterward Weeks now I guess,8.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5282869/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2020,"A good movie, but not Oscar worthy",If you consider the Oscar as a prize for movie making quality and not a political sham then Parasite did not really deserve the highest praise However it was a good movie Everyone acted really well and the underlying social commentary that is so common in Boon Joon Ho s movies was very strong while telling the story of a family of poor people who scam their way into the employ of a rich family and start leeching of it The divide between the rich and arrogant upper class and the very poor is made obvious by this dark movie with occasional comedic undertones Bottom line movies about poor people scheming to get money fast are too common in Romanian cinematography Probably that is why this movie didn t really impress me too much It is a good movie and very well made but the story was just meh,8.0,2.0,17.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5481213/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2019,Extremely well-crafted but could be tired at times.,I was bombarded by ppl recommending this movie to me so when I finally saw it I was a bit underwhelmed or you can say I was overhyped before The main complaint I was not blown away by any element of the movie I know that s a high standard but with a score of 95 it should do exceptionally in some aspects Instead this movie did just pretty good in all of them Movie about class struggles might be new and exciting to US viewers but is I don t want to say cliched a pretty common theme in East Asia Juxtaposing two closely related group of characters with some uncrossable divides that ultimately result in conflict that reflects on the society itself is also a tried and true storytelling device Execution of the movie is professional and top notch Almost all actions by the characters have meticulous setups some of them a bit in the face which on the bright side shows the movie was extremely well thought out and executed Yet it simultaneously takes away any true element of surprise a bit over crafted I d say which is a bit ironic in a highly choreographed dark humor genre movie but bear with me Character arcs are well justified but predictable was most impressed by the detailed and vivid portrayal of classism through a non visual medium smell The juxtapositions of the underground v above ground the pre and post discovered housekeeper and the weather changes vs the mood of the characters was effective but a bit on the nose Last the cinematography was beautiful the tone was unique and well balanced and the performance was amazing Overall a highly polished and accomplished movie Yet I failed to see much ingenuity It felt like the director hides behind his craftsmanship to avoid showing the audience his true self,9.0,5.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5315815/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2020,Was it worthy of an Oscar?,I haven t left a review on here for ages but I thought I would have to say something about Parasite as I had to see it on the big screen following it s Oscar win I had expected Once upon a time in Hollywood The Irishman or Joker to win best picture or maybe Marriage Story as the outsider When Parasite won it was a shock but I was glad that a foreign film had won an Oscar even though I had not seen the film It had to be a great piece to get an Oscar so I was keen to see it I saw the film yesterday and have to admit that it was a good film however I don t believe that it should have been an Oscar winner against the others it certainly was not a better film than any of the others I have mentioned The first half was good a good black comedic story about envy scams can t say any more without spoilers The second half it drifted into being really silly and became a farce as the script became more and more unbelievable It is a film that has to be seen so it is worth the price of a ticket Maybe I was expecting too much of it I am giving it a 7 10 but it could have been a 10 10 had they kept it real,7.0,3.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5495450/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2020,Good moive? Yes. Oscar worthy? Nope.,As I watched the Academy Awards gala and wondered who and what would win in each category I never in my wildest dreams thought of or considered Parasite But that is just because I hadn t seen it beforehand and didn t know if it was that good as they say But I guess I didn t consider it to win anything much because in my opinion there were so many wonderful movies represented this year and especially for the Oscar for best movie There were so many gems and yes I had my favourites that I was rooting for I was extremely disappointed when I found out that Parasite won best picture And then I felt bad and thought to myself well it is not right for me to judge this movie without even seeing it maybe it is genius and excellent and so much more than the Joker or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood So yesterday I finally got around to watching the much praised Oscar winning Parasite The first half of the movie was abysmal for me Maybe because I just didn t quite understand how to feel about it how to relate to it and was trying to think where would the story go There were some good moments and I liked the camera work the angles and a few comical incidents But mostly I couldn t wait for it to get to the point I know some people said exactly the same about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as well that it was boring during the first half But in that I don t agree I was fully enjoying the director s vision in that the actors the dialogues everything But in Parasite I couldn t really find those things to enjoy I am not saying the acting was bad but I also cannot say it was excellent in some way The second half got interesting for me I liked the way the story progressed how things started happening how people showed their true colors and how human nature is sometimes just awful And there were a fair amount of suspenseful moments where I actually held my breath a bit and wanted to find out how the scene is going to play out So this is all good this is what a movie is supposed to do entertain you The ending in my opinion it was good not mind blowingly excellent and morbid also not a bad thing but makes you think and analyze So all in all it is hard to even give it a score that I am sure of At first I thought I will give it a 7 because as I said at least half the time I was interested and invested on the storyline But I guess I am a bit biased since I am still a bit shocked about the whole Oscar thing and it irritates me a bit In my opinion a Best Picture movie should be amazing with a wow factor with outstanding directing and acting storyline it should have it all it should be the best of the best that there is Compared to all the nominees for that award I just don t see how Parasite would or should win and why it did I guess I ll never know,6.0,6.0,21.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5480619/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2019,A good supper with sugar and spicy flavor,I liked this movie Actually when i first heard it s a joint collaboration of Joon ho Bong and Kang ho Song again it was a must watch And then I was observed with the film s roll once I started watching it How climax crawled from a creepy space to reveal itself was fabulous The film shows a slum family with obvious big dreams from all its family members while a totally opposite side of hyper rich family with lost kids and bizarre wife Film showcases smooth turns and in a real well crafted way of how those Four family members occupy their positions in new Employer s house within few days Apparently things all go well until an unexpected situation turmoils everything Story I would say did ended OK Maybe I expected something more out of it but that s OK Now why come 8 10 Their are a couple of glitches which apparently din t convinced me Like for example Why wasn t a single scrutiny done of the remaining fellows other than Kevin He gave so good impression through his way of teaching Da song that everything was cool after I would have appreciated more if some more work was done Like before hiring a new employee his her SSN or some other proof submission is atleast required Ya they could forger those proves too but again did they I think people in today s world especially Rich are more superstitious and overcautious Wouldn t they want anything like that or atleast give a hunch to get some background check Or their friends could have opened their eyes Once Kevin gets recruited within a few days like within a wink of your eye all the other problems in old workers start forthcoming A nanny cum maid working from 4 years never showed a single sign of TB in her whole stay and all of a sudden she started Coughing and splitting blood Again I won t say its not impossible but i wasn t much getting into it Means isn t the onus on me to alteast listen her up Those two above points were thin thread if broken the whole climax is gone into toss Anyways above expectations for Director s creative work cinematography chilling thrill and a different aspect of story,8.0,2.0,8.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5069612/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2019,Perfectly Done Political Satire,PARASITE The new Bong Joon ho film that may be the best he s made and a hopeful contender for the best of the year First of the dialogue is brilliant With it constantly working on multiple levels first making you understand and care about these characters then learning dribs and drabs of their schemes and finally subtly setting up dialogue which is then brilliantly reincorporated to fuel emotional powerhouses of performances within the explosive finale This is all whilst it being incredible natural and just out right human there are so many instances of character inflection which tell you so much about each and every person on screen Especially when some of the characters later in the film are playing characters themselves lines here and there are clearly said by either themselves or the character they re pretending to be and because of their fantastic set up you re able to immediately tell when they re being themselves or not on the turn of a dime It manages to always perfectly balance it s comedic elements with the serious mystery thriller ones always knowing exactly when and how to incorporate the two into the lives of the characters to create an amount of emotional connectivity to a film I haven t experience all year The political satire and themes on class struggle are too fascinating they re intrinsically baked into the narrative and backstory of the characters without ever being in your face or obnoxiously telling you what to think so when they are brought up for a narrative beat or for you to get an emotional read on someone you re free to interpret and analyse them as much or as little as you want Joon Ho has at some points made the political ideologies a bit too apparent in his films which has come across as almost lecturous in Okja 2017 and Snowpiercer 2013 Thankfully this has never been detrimental to the final product but I think the political statements within Parasite are here to create a better emotional connection to these characters rather than blatantly tell you about the political climate you already know about By making you care about all these different and unique characters and using the political themes to set the stage for the story when the themes on class struggle come to a head within the narrative you for one actually care about them because they re affecting character s you understand and like and secondly they re then far more interesting to delve into and think about because the film never asked you too Even if you were to purely watch this without wanting to think about social satire it s still an unbelievable film It takes you on a mysterious thrill ride with some of the most interesting and unique characters put to screen this decade the story goes to places you would never dream it would and the soundtrack will be stuck in your head for days after you see it It s a mile a minute masterpiece from one of the most exceptional auteur directors working today and was more than worthy of taking the Palme d Or 10 10,10.0,13.0,32.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5034317/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2020,Woah,After watching Parasite it s hard to describe what I felt when Kevin finished writing the letter for his father The film itself is entertaining to watch it keeps you thinking and when you look for the deeper meaning within you find a hard theme to display on a screen yet done brilliantly in Parasite In my opinion the movie is a direct metaphor for dreams and even for the concept of the American Dream In the film the Kim family is struggling from the beginning they have dreams especially Ki Woo Kevin and his sister Ki Jeong to go to college When Kevin heads out to his job interview with the Parks he tells his family that he doesn t think of the forgery of the documents as a crime He is just getting these documents before time because he will go to college His sister also seems like she wanted to go to college and seems frustrated that she couldn t because of their situation At the end of the film Kevin imagines himself overcoming and finally having money after he went to college He then would be able to buy the house where his dad would still be trapped in the basement room The sad part about this is that Kevin really thinks he will be able to save his father but because of what has happened he won t be able to An interesting metaphor used inside the film is how the levels in the different houses represent the social classes For example to get to the Park s house the Kims had to walk up a hill and to get back to their house they had to walk back down a long way Even inside the Park s house this can be seen with the hidden basement room in which one of the parasites lives The film for me started out almost as a comedy all of the sequence in which the family works together to fire the Park s workers in order for them to be hired is great and I really had fun watching it Where it all changes is when the two parasites face off against each other to stay on the surface literally and figuratively while the losers are thrown back inside the basement From this point the whole movie changes dramatically and it all goes downhill as represented by the flooding of their apartment What really seems interesting to me is how when the Parks were at their highest point dining and drinking acting like they own the place is when their downfall begins This probably represents how in many cases the social class lines are set and those below don t belong above Mr Parker is the one who is above all the others he is the man of the house In two occasions Mr Kim tells Parker that he loves his wife to which the first time Mr Parker responds we ll call it love This probably shows that in truth he doesn t love her and the only thing that he really loves is well money and power In an intimate scene between the two at a point Mr Parker looks even uncomfortable adding more to why I believe he doesn t love her at all When the Kims first meet the Parks they think between themselves that they are nice people and look at them as their equals This all changes in the scene where they become trapped underneath the table and overhear Mr Park telling his wife how Mr Kim smells like radishes with great disgust as if he weren t even human at all This greatly upsets Mr Kim as if this smell makes him less than them Later this explains the reason for him killing Mr Park in the final act of the film Overall the film is complete and a realistic portrait of a struggle between classes and a commentary on how not everyone can accomplish their dreams because of how our society is built It has various moods that I honestly really liked from the comedic to the dark and psycho parts of the film The thing that this film has made me think the most about though is the dreams part because that can come like a brick to the face to know that what you want the most in the world might not come to you,9.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5505430/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2021,"Overrated, contrived, not credible attempt to address income inequality",Pros A very good interesting 1st half and fantastic cinematography Cons Descends to unintentional farce in 2nd half Plus entire premise of movie is flawed as South Korea is a thriving economy The family is intelligent presentable makes zero sense that their only option would be folding pizza boxes Esp the son as he knows English he d be in high demand The family was so clever In setting themselves up in the luxury house But then why did suddenly turn dumb by not realizing the rich family s camping trip would obviously be cancelled in that huge storm and by letting the former maid in to have the run of the place The idea of that guy living in the basement was just stupid and esp that the father suddenly turns into a murderer And what s with that undoing thing about the family smelling bad They knew enough how to get over on the rich folks but didn t know it s a good idea to use soap and deodorant Obviously Park s wanting to make some big point about unjust income inequality but points like that are better made by not using dumb and ridiculous situations and a main premise that makes no sense,5.0,3.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6502635/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2019,This film has everything !!!!!,The only reason I watched this film was because of the great reception it got at film festivals this year and word of mouth from the indie film scene I m not going to lie I don t watch a lot if any non English language films don t ask me why I don t know However after seeing this my world has been opened to the possibilities of other films that could be out there Bong Joon ho has directed a bloody fantastic film from start to finish it is impeccable I don t have a fault just praise His camera work throughout the film is ever changing there is so much uniqueness to it I really don t think I ve seen a film like it before Coupled with some gorgeous cinematography the film is amazingly beautifully shot outstanding I m not going to name names with the performances for a couple of reasons firstly they are all incredible for their own reasons and also the fact that I have pretty much no idea who any of the actors are That last point is actually a major positive for me because I didn t seem them as actors I just saw them as people on the screen there wasn t the movie star or famous face that I had to get past in all english language films there is a I m familiarity with those actors It can sometimes take a while to buy into their performances but by not knowing any of them it meant I bought into all the characters and their relationships straight away The story is horrific but not in a gruesome way this is the definition of a smart psychological thriller period The story of a low class family of con artists who invade there way one by one into the lives of a upper class family is genius the film definitely deserves its english title That is the central message of the film i think class and the gulf between the classes in society Its not just spoken in the dialogue but subtly played on throughout the film building towards a climax at the end Trust me the end of this film is breath taking and extremely clever But not only the end there are so many twists and turns throughout the film that it always keeps you guessing especially the basement The film has everything tension comedy drama seriousness addresses societal issues family relationships sad endings and happy endings Plus a lot of Kubrick esque stuff throughout However it is definitely its own film by a long long way I am speechless after watching it and cant wait to watch it again 90 out of 100 it is simply brilliant from start to finish Bong Joon ho has opened my world to foreign language films my naive little British brain has been blown up This film as well as its actors deserve all the acclaim and awards attention they get,9.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5278452/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2020,Flee Circus,How courteous is the Japanese He always says excuse it please He walks into his neighbour s garden And smise and says I beg your pardon He bows and grins a little grin And brings his hungry family in He grins and bows a little bow So sorry this MY garden now That verse by Ogden Nash itself a satire may well contain the nucleus of Parasite a movie in which nothing is sacred and anything goes I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst Most viewers in the West of course were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language if for example I am watching say Uncle Vanya sitting next to a native Russian speaker and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances So it was with Parasite but what remains is highly enjoyable,8.0,1.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5540462/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2020,Karma,I agree with a lot of the reviews for Parasite Parasite is a wonderful work of art that is open to many interpretations One interpretation that I haven t read yet which I found throughout the film is karma The poor Kim family struggles to make it in life However the Kim family cuts corners i e they lie manipulate cheat etc And as the old saying goes you only get what you give in life and that s kind of why the Kim s are where they are The Kim s are good people in some way as Mr Kim demonstrates expressing his shame about the driver they got fired The Kim family has a conscience and they have some values as most of us do However if you cheat lie deceive it will always come back to get you i e the scene in Parasite where husband Park and wife Park are on the couch thinking of the underwear and they start sexually going at it while Husband Kim and daughter and son Kim are hiding under the table listening to this How awful that must have been for father Kim to hear that with his children right next to him How embarrassed husband Kim must have felt at hearing he smells terrible from husband Park in front of his children and how their was nothing husband Kim could do about it as he and his son and daughter were hiding under the table The metaphor being that most of us in life can do nothing about it But the Kim s did manipulate and cheat their way to the top therefore their karma came back to bite them And oh how it bites the Kim family in the very end And it bites the Park family too As the Kim family uses the Park s the Park s use the Kim family for cheap labor which in turn is a metaphor for the class war and for the war of employer vs employee and how we all except such crummy wages and demands as a part of our society In one scene Mr Kim says no plan is the best plan Which is the same as the old adage If you never have any expectations then you will never be disappointed Also you could look at the stone like the story The Monkey s Paw Just like in The Monkey s Paw the stone brings the Kim s good fortune but at what price Parasite is brilliant on so many levels that it s really a film you need to see two or three times to take it all in It s a film that demonstrates that there is always someone worse off and Husband Kim gets his ultimate karma by taking the place of the person who was worse off than he was Karma It will always get you And Parasite demonstrates this beautifully Wonderfully acted and spiritually directed in the genre s most clever form Parasite is not only a must see it is a film you will not forget,9.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5390166/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2019,"A quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea",Parasite is a South Korean black comedy directed by Bong Joon ho Snowpiercer OKJA Based on a screenplay by Han Jin won and Bong Joon ho it is a quirky yet surprisingly well made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea In Seoul the unemployed Kim family led by Ki taek his wife Choong sook son Ki woo and daughter Ki jeong try to get by in their cramped basement apartment One day Ki woo s friend suggests to him that he take over as a tutor for the daughter of the rich Park family while he travels abroad Over time the rest of the Kim family start taking jobs offered to them by the Parks at their large mansion while masquerading under fake names so as not to give away that the four of them are related and eventually start to reap the benefits of the Park s swanky lifestyle With its unique Korean style Parasite has just the right balance between dark comedy and family drama that it never bores its audience It s just so much fun seeing how each member of the Kim family were adjusting to their new lavish ways in a house that doesn t even belong to them This feels like a commentary on societal class in Korea in how each citizen likely has their own perspective on how to live in the moment Even better is the ending which I will not spoil but what I will say is that it concludes the story in the best way possible If you watch one Korean movie this year make it this one,9.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5158008/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2020,Brilliant first part of the movie,I believe the director should have kept this movie light hearted and funny despite the serious topic at hand notably that of inequalities in South Korea The final 50 min were not all that good in my opinion and the violent behavior of some of the main protagonists defies logic It s probably deserving of all the accolades because no better movie was released in 2019 I think Shoplifters 2018 palmes d or is as deserving if not a better picture than Parasite,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5799343/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,Morally grey,Despite the fact that at first glance the film seems quite simple drawing the viewer s interest and slowly moving to mostly comedic elements after the first hour the situation changes fundamentally We get to know better both of the families and it becomes clear that there are no characters to root for no good guys of the story The film focuses on crossing the line which has multiple meanings and is manifested in different ways during the viewing I don t want to spoil anything so I definitely recommend watching this closely and then re visiting this film after some time since it has a lot of brain fuel to keep you busy thinking about it,9.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5384979/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2019,Unexpected Twists!,Bong Joon Ho once again delivers a great film with unexpected twists along the way Parasite is a film about a poor family of four that slowly but surely worms their way into a rich family by mostly luck and subtle persuasion The son becomes an English tutor to the rich girl the daughter becomes an art therapist to the young boy who can t sit still the father becomes the driver for the successful man of the house and the mother becomes the housekeeper for the rich family It s a family affair of course and things are well for a while as their employers are none the wiser Then the old housekeeper comes back and it s revealed that she has been keeping her husband in the basement for about 4 years Then well Things go downhill from there There are death and murders Some accidental some purposeful But in the end I think they had a semi hopeful ending,9.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5288521/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2020,I can see why it won Best Picture,The Academy is generally hestitant to give the Award for Best Picture to a foreign film and this movie was in fact the first movie with foreign language to win Best Picture Did Parasite deserve it Yes yes it most definietly did The direction is amazing there is so much meaning and symbolism conveyed through simple imagery This of course ties nicely into the script which I think is exceptionally well written The characters are wonderfully three dimentional and the contrasts between the rich family and the poor family are pretty interesting to observe and think about This movie s greatest strength however is the way it portrayes the differences in the lifestyle of the two families and how the moral boundries differ from person to person Watching the plot unfold is endlessly entertaining and engaging The movie also manages to juggle all the symbolism with a pretty straight forward story line and how it manages to be powerful and funny at the same time is beyong my comprehension The one thing I didn t completely like about this movie was the ending Not that it was bad in itself but the way many character arcs were scrapped annoyed me a little I know that that was the purpose to showcase how plans fail and all that but I still wanted a few characters to get better conclusions to their arcs That is practially my only real complaint though and it s not nearly enough to ruin this fenomenal film It is almost the complete package it s a wonderful mix of comedy drama and thriller and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes movies,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6353729/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,"A send-up--but of what, or whom?",Maybe this film makes a statement about class as some claim It could just as well be a statement about films or the film industry Nicely produced and well acted the plot was almost entirely predictable but the climax seemed contrived though the denouement was interesting Somehow American Beauty came to mind That s about all I ve got having just seen it,7.0,3.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5475622/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2020,If you are going to watch a foreign language film this is it,I ve never been a fan of watching sub titled foreign language film It may be in part explained by not really associating with people who do enjoy foreign language films Anyway with it s success at the Oscars Parasite seemed to be deserving of a watch so saw it on the big screen a couple of days ago Stylistically it seemed very similar to a Tarantino movie to me The characters were gripping and the dialogue was excellent Would have been so much more enjoyable if I understood Korean though The movie explores the tensions in the class divide which is obviously a universal theme which everyone understands The sets are excellent and so realistic you can imagine how you d feel yourself yourself in the scenes It s well worth a watch and if you don t share my dislike of subtitles you ll probably love this movie,5.0,2.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5508877/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,"Best Movie of the Nominees for the Year, but Not Perfect",This won BP because it was the best overall movie based on all of the nominees It had good acting directing original screenplay score and cinematography All of the other nominees were good in only one or two categories maybe three But this movie checked all the boxes If you only wanted acting you see Joker or Irishman if you only wanted visuals and cinematography then you see 1917 if all you wanted was acting and set design then you see Once Upon a Time if all you wanted was actresses then you see Marriage Story Bombshell or Judy But if you want the whole package then this was the best movie of the nine nominees as a whole and that s why it won When voters vote the ultimate winner is also decided by how many 2nd place votes a movie gets so the winner will gets lots of 2nd place votes in addition to the 1s and that s finally why it won,8.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5475533/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2020,Disappointed,Parasite has been on my watchlist for about a year now I went in with exceptionally high expectations given the glowing reviews and high ratings Having watched it earlier today I can confidentially say it was the most disappointing movie I have watched so much so I felt the need to write a review It s a movie that simply doesn t live up to its hype whatsoever Not only is it a poor representation of the class divide that exists in many parts of the world portraying a lower class family in a degrading and deceitful way but most if not every scene that was meant to be suspenseful was just outright anti climatic to the point where I was like oh is that it To make things worse the movie was 2 hours long 2 hours that I will never get back,1.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6303788/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2021,Greatly overrated and thoroughly mediocre,I don t have that much to say about this movie It s too plain and mediocre Nothing special about the story nothing about the characters The plot twist if you may call it that is weak at best The decorations were built with great attention to detail but they don t create any striking image Except maybe the elevated toilet But do you really think a toilet is enough to earn the praise that this movie gets The parallel events that happen to the two families are very obviously parallel you don t even have to watch the movie to see it The title of the movie yeah we get that who is actually the parasite very subtle haha Ironically this doesn t get more obvious after watching The moral Well dubious at best I hope they were not trying to justify the murder by the distaste to the smell of the people on the subway But in this case what is this movie about It s kinda empty has nothing to say The actors play fine nothing above or below average Then a few words about humor This movie is listed as comedy Yeah it uses some typical comedic moves like the impostor family hiding below the table But none of those are funny Most of these moments are just cringeworthy I don t know if the director was going for this emotion and even if he did it successfully I m not appreciating it As a comedy this film is far below mediocre So what s the big deal about Parasite,5.0,4.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6495293/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2020,This review is for those who failed to understand the movie.,The truth is that the movie is about not 2 but 3 different class of society The Parks the true upper class Represented by wealth huge house Abundance of sunlight concerned with only First world problems The Kims the lower middle class represented by unemployment Half basement house lack of sunlight Concerned only with their struggle for better lifestyle The Ohs the true lower class Represented by hunger Deep basement Absolutely no sunlight Concerned only with their survival For the first half of the movie we see only two classes Parks and Kims and it shows how Kims are leaching on to Parks for their well being like a Parasite But later when the third class is introduced as Ohs audience begin to believe that actually Ohs are true Parasite as they offer nothing in return to Parks for what they steal As we approach the final quarter when the hits the fan the perspective is switched again to show that Parks the luxury class are the true Parasite they depend on the society for their lifestyle and pleasures but don t even give respect to the once they depend on This is the true revelation The movie brilliantly shows how cruel is each class towards other Pay attention to how the Kims react when they find out their is another class below them They also show no sympathy to Ohs and they hurt them and leave them to die of hunger As depicted in No plan is the plan scene Another thing to pay attention is the scholar s rock it is truly metaphorical as it is a symbol of hope as shown in the scene it was introduced Ki Woo shown to be always hopeful as he is shown clinging on to the rock even when their whole house is flooded and they are turned homeless overnight and in the end it this rock hope that hurts him the most and yet he is hopeful that one day he will buy the house to free up his dad This capitalistic world is at balance when each class is happy with where they are but it starts trembling down when the lower classes try to move up the social ladder The scene where the Kims get taste of upper class luxury is where it starts to get ugly and when the true lower class try to rise the whole society shambles Ultimately everyone loses something Lowest classes losing everything the couple dies Middle loses half of what they have the daughter dies and father is imprisoned and the upper class only loses a quarter of their family This movie has so many layers and so much depth it is best understood if you watch it three times from three different perspective of each class,9.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6276681/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2023,"Overrated, very predictable for the most part",The hype around this film is staggering As the film unfolded I predicted all but two of the things that happened It just seemed like such an obvious stream of events other than the surprise half way through and the Tarantino Lite ending There s an almost complete lack of sympathy for or empathy in almost all of the selfish unpleasant characters Maybe that s the point but if you want a film where there s someone to root for this isn t for you Although you can see the point the film makes writ large from an early stage it does a poor job of making you think the downtrodden deserve any sympathy,3.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8893926/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,Sick movie,Parasite is a parody of sorts that crosses genres comedy drama horror I rather liked the first part but then the film de generates into what could be sick territory The film touches on some important social issues e g class struggle relations among the various social classes and has accomplished actors as well as great cinematography but that does not in itself make for a great movie This movie does not succeed as a comedy drama or horror The descriptors that come to mind for me are repugnant de generate immoral or at least amoral and having an eat the rich mentality Perhaps you shouldn t pay too much attention to my ramblings however The film after all is rated well into the 8 s and won four Oscars Makes me think of the Colosseum in Rome which apparently was quite popular in its day,1.0,6.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6290072/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,Not what i expected from an Oscar winner.,First half of the movie was really boring Second half was kinda interesting though An the ending was really really bad for my opinion The other thing that was annoying is that the actors over played at times and the worse of all was the actor who played the boss lady She was over playing and it was really annoying I don t know if those were the directions but I did not like it at all In conclusion not an Oscar worth movie not a masterpiece,6.0,6.0,18.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5480043/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,Amazing!,This is one of the best movies I ve ever watched I went into it not expecting to like it or even watch the whole thing but I was pleasantly surprised The acting writing and directing were all perfect but the end scene kind of overstayed its welcome,9.0,4.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5488583/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2020,"Theme: Rich people are stupid, poor people are clever",The acting was great on the part of the con artist family Mrs Park was just pathetic Her character was played like she had an IQ of 50 I thought the story line as a whole was clever but the very end was predictable I knew exactly where the father Mr Kim went I didn t like that he stabbed Mr Park I didn t think that was in character and it wasn t deserved The poverty of the other family was not the Parks fault Their wealth inequality was just circumstance and they were at the worst just ignorant I couldn t root for the poor family because I didn t feel sorry for them They could have used their wits to make better more honest choices to try and get ahead Instead they chose to dupe people and take advantage of them I liked that they showed the son at the end sitting in the apartment saying someday he will have enough money A happy ending like the one they teased wouldn t have been fitting,7.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5629953/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,A perfectly cromulent film,The obvious question which might not have an obvious answer is who or what is or are the parasites in Parasite Maybe it is easier to determine who or what is or are the hosts The first hour plays as though Adam Sandler had directed a Korean version of Upstairs Downstairs a tale about the poor serving or parasitically suckling upon the rich separated vertically so those on high do not or even cannot observe the filth of the lower classes as they struggle to acquire the most basic necessities such as a good and free wi fi signal The second hour plays as though Sam Peckinpah had directed a Korean version of Upstairs Downstairs a tale about desperate times and desperate measures uncertainty about belonging and a lesson about the fleetingness of a good situation The mood of Parasite runs somewhat tangentially to that of A Serious Man a slightly anarcho nihilistic tone that despite anyone s good or bad intentions or even lack of intent entirely there is a dark hole tugging at the back of our brains whispering sweet somethings of impending unavoidable and utterly passionless doom Given this background one might argue that there is no message no meaning to a movie like Parasite At the least it is an investigation into whether a host or parasite can change its behavior for the better or for the worse,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5284937/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2020,where's the redemption?,Well made movie but i suspect there are a lot of phony reviews posted here to gain an Oscar win I liked the acting and story line However there needs to be some redemption despite the political statement of classism Cruelty can be a means to develop a plot into something more transcendent I didn t grasp any of that just a descent into hell Too much over the top sensationalism,3.0,14.0,34.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5471871/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2022,99/100,Parasite was a wonder to behold The movie contained wonderful cinematography throughout from glorious smooth long shots to excellent handheld work The film s superb visual architecture and design conveyed layers of meaning accentuated by an incredible cast And ultimately though what Parasite has to say might not be anything new class divide and difference isn t exactly a fresh topic the way through which it conveys that story is absolutely superb It s not reinventing the wheel it s just making a really really good wheel And in the end though what stood out above all was the sheer attention to detail,10.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8500368/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2020,The GOAT! 4 oscars is not enough...,I don t often watch Korean movies or drama but this movie was FANTASTIC There are a lot of things that makes my mind blow starting from finding the WiFi signal The plan they made as a family to find a living To survive in this life that don t have any mercy Every word Every sentence was covered by gold I think that Jessica was right when she said we must find a solution that satisfy everyone and her mom agreed too I think if Jessica gave them the food then probably we would see a very different scenarios instead of going there with a big rock I like how Kevin planned his life such an ambitious guy even if the certificate was fake He wanted to join that University He wanted to marry that girl in the future never lost the hope trying his best to find his father planned to save money and buy that house that s what life is all about Another aspect realy shocking was That woman opening the window in the car when she was not wearing shoes It really bothered me because they were not judging them because of what they did but because of their appearance I think there are sooo many things so interesting Go and see the movie That s all,10.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5949600/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2020,"Waste of time, DO NOT WATCH",This movie will literally make you wonder what you re even watching A con artist family ruins another families life and the father kills a kind husband and father of two for no reason Those of you who think this was about classes or crossing the line have 0 moral compass and couldn t tell their arse from their elbow Do not waste your time watching this dirty con family destroy another s like psychopaths or rather parasites,1.0,6.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6165240/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,"Status envy breeds evil, with redemption found in repentance than in genuine moral conviction.",So the 996th title for me was Parasite where status envy breeds evil with redemption found in repentance than in genuine moral conviction Personally I consider cinema artful when it lays by the wayside experiences that are commonly available to us and thereafter presents a narrative that defies such common experiences Poor people smelling funny was one of the reasons some of my national law school acquaintances wouldn t ride the delhi metro something that agitated me but far from such behaviour being a morbid distaste for the poor as the film s leftist reviewers would point out it s merely an outcome of their socio economic realities where their lifestyles are cocooned It s nothing that is maliciously intentioned That s why Parasite failed to enthuse me as much as it seemed to have enlivened reviewers to become a concert of uniform appreciation I take that to be more a sign of the Marxist class consciousness becoming mainstream in our times than a sincere and objective appreciation of the cinematic mode It should be said that the rising popularity of such class consciousness could have made it possible for both such a theme to be adapted for the screen and for the reviewers to overlook the lack of artfulness Far from shocking and emotionally riveting ending that induces gasps as per The Guardian s film reviewers the film lazily climaxes through a chaotic ending and tries to paper over the dangerous rationalization of poor people engaging in lies deceit and violence against the rich Criminal and unethical behaviour is not warranted against anyone irrespective of any markers of personal identity Half way through the reel the film did issue a poser another one of the common experiences I spoke of earlier whether niceness is a result of being financially well off As answers to that poser the poor husband and his wife held opposing views in a binary However the film does not even try to portray any tension in any of the characters with respect to that binary The characters were straightjacketed into fixed outlooks on life with the poor father redeeming his crookedness only after being at the receiving end of pain Without further deliberation or exposition of that poser one would tend to think that it was inserted more for effect than as part of a well thought out thematic tapestry In fact I find it shocking that review after review imagines the film to be an exegesis of the growing inequality class divide and immobility of social classes It shouldn t happen that bad or criminal behaviour is passed off as justifiable under any circumstances not so especially in a democracy where political equality is unshakeable and which guarantees a form of equality that is more powerful and capable of overcoming barriers to class immobility through modern welfare states and well functioning institutions,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6803861/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2022,Parasites Meet the Wild West,This Oscar winning best picture film can best be described as a far fetched dark comedy An impoverished family living in the slums of Seoul gradually integrate themselves into a wealthy upscale family one by one through a web of lies and deception They manage to get the help fired then surreptitiously plan to get themselves hired in their stead The plan works fine until complications arise with the fired longtime former housekeeper chef showing up to take care of some unfinished business She discovers their plan and threatens to expose them All hell breaks loose and this very funny comedy drama suddenly goes in another unexpected direction This is entertaining cinema well acted directed and written I would wholeheartedly recommend it,7.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8061094/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2020,Plot holes,I heard glowing reviews about this movie and decided to watch it I was expecting to be wowed but was left disappointed There are way too many plot holes in the movie The Kim family is a poor family living in a small basement apartment and yet Mr Kim is able to drive a Mr Park s Mercedes Benz with ease and grace without any proper driver training or prior experience in handling luxury vehicles he had to visit a dealership to check out its controls before taking up the job Mr s Kim who also has no prior experience as a house keeper appears to be acing her job The same goes for the Kids too they simply ace at their fake jobs Not to mention the thankless nature of Mr Kim who instead of being thankful to Mr Park for having employed his entire family ends up killing Mr Park This movie certainly did no deserve an Oscar for best picture,5.0,2.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5473659/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,For those who are justifying the second half !,I heard a lot about this movie as one of the best So I saw it in 2022 I know it will be less read by readers since it is already past 3 years from 2019 but still I will be writing genuinely about the movie I rated 7 due to a reason and I will try to establish it rationally The movie I felt was good well built well crafted flawlessly upto the erotic scene But then it suddenly change its course of execution It could have been better if some subplots were added to make greed and frustrations a bit highly intense Few edges were touched but not developed which makes it far from being a masterpiece The second half seem kind of very different and it should have been developed along the same line It felt like off track The taek s family lived a life of lie in the park s house just for the sake of material life It leads to the tragedy where park s family also have a share Where is the morality of good vs bad If taek s family is humane then they shouldn t have been grasped by the lies They had a family They had everything but still succumbed to materialism Mr park on being asked if he loved his wife replied with a thought It didn t flow out clearly from heart It implies something dark which clearly didn t occurred in taek s family though So both families are materialistic but the director seem interested in the parks If park s family were humane then they should have been cautious in inquiring further about taek s family It only has a minor reference and didn t developed in that way It could have been better if the liars were red handedly caught and delivered an everlasting message of virtue They were rich and didn t succumb to traditional call where we all are fellow humans It shows the rich were good but goodness didn t get sparked Both families are shown to be inhuman Its alright still but it shouldn t have ended like it did in the 2nd half The great potential was very brutally wasted But it didn t establish any of it Finally I understood from the 2nd half that the movie is just a raw representation of south korean society where capitalism is the driving force It divided human beings on the ground of materialism And the society is in turmoil The difference of lifestyle the greed of people the jealousy one has for other the rise of inhumanity etc are the by products of capitalism If this point was always the case then the storytelling would have been in that direction from the very beginning But it only sparked in the 2nd half Anyway its not a bad movie and is watchable but will have issues in the second half where the events turn ungripping Not the best but good representation of humanity being divided into privileged and underprivileged Finally the output when they get mixed and that too without the help of tradition or religion A 72 100,7.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8031144/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2019,Intricate storytelling,The manner which the story is being told here combined with some very intriguing characters make this one of the best movies of the year A lot about this film is very well done from the acting to the shot composition I also love the social commentary undertones The ending is a bit unnecessarily violent but overall this is a very good movie I would say,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5290833/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2019,"Parasite by Bong Joon-ho is like a Hollywood, almost-shallow version of Burning by Lee Chang-dong",Parasite by Bong Joon ho is like a Hollywood almost shallow version of Burning by Lee Chang dong The acting is jarring and obnoxious until you get used to it the characters and plot are one dimensional the praised twists by the trailers and critics aren t exciting but shallow and even almost predictable The scenes that are supposed to be thrilling like the scene in which the rich family comes home earlier than expected from the vacation to the horror of the parasites are ridiculous in a cartoonish way without anything of value to contradict it The cinematography and shots are constantly almost awkward in their cheesy ness and obvious structure The film belittles its viewers as well what only takes away from its own intelligence by feeding them with a spoon its meaning immediately explaining in words what was already told in visuals which more often than not was completely unnecessary and dense None of the characters make any truly moving progress and even though the director claims in his movie there are no good and bad guys he mostly failed to translate this sentiment into the film itself by making one dimensional static confrontational characters No matter how aesthetically calculated cinematic shots are if there is no core deep meaning in the film to back them up they re worth nothing Moreover you can t calculate emotion The visual storytelling of the shots in the film is so obviously calculated almost mathematically with barely no internal intuition or feeling And it only makes them awkward as if the director only now graduated film school and wanted to show off everything he was taught without much experience which isn t the actual case for Bong Joon ho It seemed like the director tried to achieve what Burning succeeded in obtaining with addition of supposed to be impressive high budget visuals music and show but failed Burning is a fantastic example to a mind and emotion intriguing film full of thrilling twists and turns true dark and concerning aura and human characters that touch the core of your being which doesn t belittle it s viewers and taken straight out of the heart Burning is what everything Parasite attempted to be without success Bong Joon ho thought too much and ended up with barely anything of actual worth Lee Chang dong listened to his heart and intuition and graced us with a beautiful well crafted masterpiece which in its humble and quiet progression spoke volumes and echoed in the viewer s mind and heart Bong Joon ho s Parasite is a perfect example to a film which is all bark and no bite In one word disappointing,5.0,37.0,98.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5105961/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,Ok I guess...,This film is an ok film It has some funny moments some agony moments and a little drama I can t say I had a hard time watching it But I really can t understand how people lost their minds The poor family with all these lies get a very nice job with good money Yet they still don t move out from the basement they decide to continue living in there and not moving out to start living a better life They even throw a party to the mansion and thinking how they can take more from the rich So am I supposed to feel sorry for them at the end The movie doesn t imply that the rich family are greedy or they stole money from others for themselves Mr Park seem to working pretty hard to be in that position and to earn his money They pay well the working staff and even extra is some occasions Of course they seem to be discussed by the poor but they don t offend them in any way throughout the film So to me they are more likeable than the poor family Overall is a good movie but that s it I literally don t understand the hype,6.0,4.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7714494/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2019,Don't Leave the Window Open,Life in the dregs is unpleasant One must learn adapt and get their hands dirty just to maintain life s basic necessities All the while one must cope with the knowledge that there are those that will look down on you because of circumstances that whether deserved or undeserved can chip away at ones spirit All societies have their strata and one method of survival at the bottom of the rung is to cling to those at the top Such relationship can be mutual but it can also be parasitic I assume anyone reading this can guess the kind that forms the base of this movie Director Bong Joon Ho does not need me to sing his praises but I will say this Memories of Murder is one of my favorite films of all time He has created a host of other good films as well see what I did there and Parasite is no different His direction is a compelling and methodical dissection of two worlds One if for the poor where they live surrounded by concrete and wire and below peeing drunkards The other is a beautiful triumph of architecture surrounded by trees and sunshine a house worthy of a success Parasite was a roller coaster of a watch that never lingered Keeping the viewer engaged the movie shifts tone at various points and the direction never misses a step As the two worlds collide thanks to the machinations of the downtrodden I was kept of the edge of my seat not quite able to sense what was coming next Accented by some fantastically comical scenes towards the beginning the movie manages to maintain a sinister tone Performances blend into scenes as characters playing other characters dance around and play off each other seamlessly It feels grimy and unsettling to watch both because of the conditions the poor are subject to but also at the levels they will stoop to There is something violative about watching a family s intimate space be invaded The forecast does not look bright for any party involved The picture painted here is detailed and rich and full of superb performances especially from the youngest members of the poor family As for criticisms I have very little Did I love it as much as Memories of Murder No but that is more a result of this film while feeling extremely relevant in this day and age hitting on a tone that has been explored to high heaven before the haves vs the have not That is not to say Parasite has nothing new to say although that case can be made it just lacks a certain kind of rawness That being said Parasite weaves through its plot with frighteningly good execution Through all the twists and turns we the viewer witness how one s class can sticks to them like a smell unyielding and betraying any fa ade they put on Sometimes you have to get dirty before you can get clean And then sometimes people just never quite find a way to fit into their circumstances There is much here to like and I recommend it wholeheartedly,9.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5278809/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,A disturbing story of class struggles,In the opening scene of Parasite a family struggles to get the WiFi signal in their phone Ki Woo gets on top of the shelf and manages to catch the singal This scene describes the entire film a family of poor people trying to reach the top They devise a cunning plan and the entire family gets into the house of a rich family fooling them in the process What follows is a story that sometimes struggles to maintain a brisk pace The film is loaded with metaphors Beneath all those metaphors is the concept of disparity between the poor and the rich The rich oblivious to the plight of the people who work under them continue to lead a life sucking on the blood of the poor This is shown in the scene where a man hiding in the basement of the house of Mr Park switches on the lights in the stairs everyday when Mr Park comes home Mr Park however believes that is the work of the motion sensors There is even the fight among the poor to get their hands on the wealth of the rich The entire second half of the film is not about the tensions between the Parks and their servants It is between two groups of servants of the family each trying to suppress the other The idea that the Parks live in a house unaware of a man living in their basement is an allusion to the perpetual simmering tensions between the working class and the affluent The final moments of the film are a complete mess with violence and bloodshed Critics of Joker should have spoken about this too The hate the poor have towards the rich is more pronounced in this film than in Joker Leaving aside the social commentary the pacing of the film is very irregular There are scenes that bursts with energy and freshness and there are those that test the patience Also the reason why Mr Park gets killed is obscure May be Kang Ho song was pushed to his limit May be Mr Park crossed the line which Kang Ho song didn t May be he was anguished when his daughter gets stabbed May be it is the combination of all those reasons Parasite is a disturbing film that will leave an indelible mark on you Still the screenplay loses its focus in a many scenes,7.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5470246/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2023,Was a 10/10 until the very ending.,I do think this was a very good movie Honestly I would love to rate the movie higher Like the title says it was a 10 10 until the very ending I loved the characters and the set designs The dialogue was very well scripted and the acting was great Everything leading up to the very intense crescendo of the party and the stabbings was beautifully done It was a slow burn that kept you guessing about what would happen Again I think this is an excellent movie The only reason for my opinion that it s only a 7 10 is because at the very ending the movie basically says hey just work hard for a couple of years and then you can get out of poverty just a short couple of years and all your dreams come true I guess I feel like the very ending made the rest of the movie feel kinda pointless Maybe the was the intention Just my opinion here,7.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9279011/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,MONSTER IN THE HOUSE (And Fakery Afoot),Crime doesn t pay Just ask the sociopathic poor Kim family featured in the dark tale PARASITE an overrated B B slasher film dressed up as high art the latest runway walk sporting the Emperor s new clothes First the perps hoodwink a nice wealthy family taking out the nice poor chauffeur and loyal kind poor housekeeper along the way then make life a living hell for a third nice family Ouch Don t get in this ruthless mean family s way or you ll be sorry I am I liked the movie s opening shot Painterly Black writing appears on the right window pane of the Kim family s semi basement hovel For a while everything was going OK I liked the first act Then WTF Talk about bad choices What an artistic intellectual sense and sensibility nose dive Tough to give this harsh and disappointing mean spirited flick higher than a 7 Because even if I give it a 7 for FORM nice production values acting and visuals but an achievement of FORM at best only slightly better than the architectural quality of the deluxe modernesque house that PARASITE features as the main stage set of its story I can t give the movie s STORY more than a 6 Which averages a FORM STORY score of 6 5 That s about where it left me when I left the theater pleased on an emotional and artistic level about 6 5 a bad taste in my mouth feeling played But at least I know what all the hyperventilating groupthink hype s about But then the filmmaker didn t give himself the awards The overblown fanfare isn t his fault He just wrote directed and made the best movie he could And a 6 5 isn t a bad score or in any way derogatory in my book especially for a story that feels like a stage play more than a motion picture For me any movie that gets a 7 is darn good So Enjoy See PARASITE over and over if it s your cuppa tea and you find the movie relevant to your life your vision of the world your artistic aspirations and work Different strokes for different folks But here s the thing Actually all we know for sure is that PARASITE may not have been and most likely wasn t the majority of the 10 000 Academy voters first choice for Best Picture but somehow still managed to eke out a win for that misleading category PARASITE may have merely been the majority of the 10 000 Academy voters second and third place choice for Best Picture thanks to the complex preferential ballot system Google it pushing PARASITE over the top to KO works that may have gotten more first place votes How else can we characterize this non transparent balloting paradigm based on non disclosure of the balloting results than Fakery Afoot Or to steal a line from THE GENTLEMEN F ery Afoot The Academy won t tell us the truth How many first place votes did PARASITE get How many first place votes did the other 8 nominated movies get Why won t the academy show us the math We can handle the truth Instead the Academy treats us like sheep preferring to keep us in the dark misleading us relying on our gullibility and the necessary illusion as they see it in their screwed up marketing way that PARASITE was the top vote getter for 1 film Maybe But unlikely I ask the Academy to prove me wrong Show us the math Truth be told who knows other than The Academy s Threshold Guardians how many other so called Best Picture award winners since 2009 when the Academy expanded the number of nominees from 5 to as many as 10 won an award not for what we re led to believe Best Picture but for a category that would be more accurately named Top Consensus Picture Or oxymoronically and moronically Top Second and Third Place Picture Or how about Most Preferred Picture Academy Awards are a self promotional corporate crap shoot fueled by politics social trends self interest personal biases PR hidden agendas mass mind meld and money PARASITE simply reflects the latest Academy enabled intellectually dishonest connection between the secret and screwy preferential balloting system results and the name of the award the fake connection between what goes on behind the curtain and what goes on in front of the curtain in the merry land of Oz In other words to use an analogy Like our federal elections for President the Best Picture award doesn t go to the popular vote winner The award goes to the Electoral College winner But in our elections for President though we might not like the set up and feel it s unfair at least we know how the system works it s fully disclosed and the vote tallies do not remain behind closed doors My hunch PARASITE true to the meaning of the word ironically enough benefited by deriving nutrients at the expense of other movies I suspect that PARASITE landed the award for Top Consensus Picture Most Preferred Picture not by leading in the number of first place votes but by siphoning off lots of second and third and maybe even fourth and fifth place votes thereby outflanking films of more surpassing quality like LITTLE WOMEN 8 0 and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD 8 75 Again I ask the Academy to prove me wrong Show us the math I don t know which force feeds us a bigger Monster In The House PARASITE or The Academy of Motion Pictures At least PARASITE s ugly monster roams the house out in the open Aside For Best International Film PARASITE oddly beat out the brilliantly written shot and acted truly modern and original artistically and socially astute no false note gritty LES MISERABLES 8 5 I haven t yet seen Almodovar s PAIN AND GLORY also nominated for Best International Film but I m guessing I ll like that more than PARASITE too And by the way how did the Academy manage to overlook the remarkable unnominated edge of your seat film wonder UNCUT GEMS 8 5 too cutting edge Not good enough to make the empty 10 slot Really And you got robbed Adam Sandler PARASITE not only trots its monster the downtrodden Kim family out in the open painting the family with a thin brush hiding nothing and therefore leaving little if anything surprising to foreshadow reveal or shock us about their inner life history motivations and what makes them tick besides inept pizza box folding manipulation high jinks and greed PARASITE also does another thing really well which goes hand in glove with the story s two dimensional nefarious family PARASITE reminds us that pressure reveals character and the arc of the parasitic self serving Kim family s character is simple None Nasty family starts out F d and poor Nasty family hits the jackpot through fakery and fraud but hits a snag Nasty family turns violent then becomes poor again and more F d than before Unrepentant Unchanged And all an empty way for the filmmaker to set us up for some nasty gratuitous horror and gore I was almost ready to accept the poor family s mooching off the rich family as an inspired metaphor for capitalism mooching off society doing whatever it takes including lie cheat steal smile swindle and kill to parasitically feast off our commonwealth But then capitalism wouldn t likely end up back in the basement One final thought PARASITE tells a story about rich and poor that goes beyond the obvious economic one The story takes place mostly inside of a house A house is a metaphor for human character Character is a house You have your interior and exterior I speak as an architect when I say that in terms of the quality of architectural design the house has a rich developed interior but a poor undeveloped exterior And I speak as a screenwriter when I say it s the opposite for the quality of the character design PARASITE s characters have a rich developed exterior but a poor undeveloped interior They are little more than paper thin characterizations The movie s building architecture and character architecture are reciprocally related creating a kind of symmetry conflict clash but not a pleasing kind because in Story Architecture what matters most isn t the quality of the stage set design but the quality of the character design And that s where PARASITE fails most glaringly as a work of art The filmmaker created a monster patching together a subpar exterior building architecture and subpar interior character architecture to create a FORM STORY 6 5 Frankenstein,6.0,5.0,14.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5477162/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,I thought this movie was overrated,I liked Bong Joon ho s The Host didn t care for Snowpiercer and while I thought Parasite was decent I definitely don t consider it the best movie of 2019 nor did it live up to the hype I heard beforehand I however don t think there s some conspiracy by the Academy Awards or other American institutions to put international movies above American ones for some sort of social justice and I m perfectly OK with them choosing an international movie if they just think it was the best movie of the year There s been a few years in my time where I thought a non American movie was better than the American made ones that year I was initially excited to see the movie especially after hearing some hints of what it was about and that it was a dark and stunning psychological take on people of different classes I think class disparity is a huge problem in our country so it felt very relevant I also love dark psychological movies but unfortunately after seeing this I realized it wasn t that dark and wasn t that psychological While it explores class disparity neglect and cruelty there s so many problems with both the protagonists if you can call them that and antagonists if that s really what they were The movie s biggest flaws are mostly in presentation but some of the situations and actions of the characters are preposterous and feel very contrived It s a riveting watch is fairly well acted and directed memorable and has interesting situations but too many times I had to suspend disbelief to an almost comical degree The movie does have dark humor which I appreciated but I think some of it is unintended This reminded me of Snowpiercer as that had so many preposterous situations that I couldn t help but laugh I think this is almost a signature of Bong Joon ho which worked well in The Host but not so much in these other two movies I haven t seen Mother so I m not sure if it s truly a common or intentional thread in his movies I ve enjoyed a lot of Korean movies but I think Joon ho may be overrated at this point I also think some of the violence is unnecessary and for shock value and gets a bit overly explicit and some character s reaction to it is a bit odd and from my perspective a bit unbelievable and sometimes comes off as contrived It seems in these more odd situations Joon ho is trying to make some sort of statement or point which OK I think I understood but I also don t like things like that being forced because they don t flow naturally with the storytelling and feel more wedged in I don t know how political the movie is intended to be but whether I agree with the points or not I d at least like a movie to have these ideas flow well and not be ratcheted in I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy Korean cinema topics about class disparity terror horror drama and maybe even just something different to the typical American movie norm It is well produced and generally well directed the characters and situations are memorable you ll be shocked but ultimately if you re anything like me you ll be disappointed but glad you saw it too,6.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6488782/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2020,Great movie,Parasite is an awesome movie I would totally give full 10 star but towards the end it starts to be a bit overescalated and in genreal I didn t like the end of the movie I was not sure who actually the parasite was the family or just the guy in the cellar Who was actually supposed to be the hero bad and good guy in the movie somehow I feel the movie tries to make me like the family and forget that they are actually the bad ass,9.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5513229/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2019,"Good Idea, but...",I have to admit that the main idea of this Korean film is very good It is different from the majority of the films I have seen but for me it was inadequate The first 40 45 minutes are the main part of the movie You understand what is going on The rest of the movie is just a repeat of the first 40 minutes It becomes boring The acting is just good Nice effort,3.0,21.0,84.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5107601/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2022,Parasite brings a movie lesson.,Parasite brings the real meaning of putting together simple elements to compose something amazing The film brings that development sequence which serves to ask ourselves what the characters will do what will happen to them what will be the consequences they suffered after these acts In addition I believe that the feature always wants to make it very clear that there is a suspense involved that something will happen that this work contains suspense and terror In the midst of that for me that scene of the boy calling his parents because he can t sleep and Kim is on the floor was kind of rude Of course in order to convey a feeling of fear and suspense it is something that requires depth in the spectators The film is a masterpiece No wonder it won the Oscar for best picture of 2020 You know what kind of plan never fails No plan ever succeeds No plan Do you know why If you make a plan life never works out the way you expect,9.0,4.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8585796/?ref_=tt_urv

No way.,If people are really this starved for quality movies I am not surprised what with the second rate retreads Hollywood is doing lately However the actors are all surprisingly likeable despite the content and actions You feel for them and their situation but at the same time I feel the director portrays wealthy people in a very unfair light It really is the immoral ones who are impacting others lives with their actions not the wealthy family Overall this is worth a watch but it is not worth 8 6 stars Ridiculous,5.0,8.0,33.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5429321/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,Not my Movie of the Year,Of the films in contention this year I think I would have given Best Director and Best Picture awards to Quentin Tarantino and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD a sly revisionist take on Tinseltown at the far end of its Golden Age I can see that PARASITE is highly original and filled with ironical social commentary but Best Picture Nah It s hard to write about it without spoilers but it s a tale of two Korean families one rich and living in a hilltop mansion the other struggling in a grimy basement below the bottom of the same hill Crafty as well as envious the poor people slowly a bit too slowly IMO infiltrate the lives of the rich folk When the plutocrats take off for a camping trip things start to unravel The theme of the working class subverting the Upper Crust was brilliantly explored in Joseph Losey s THE SERVANT 1963 which did not morph from Social Drama into Horror territory I think PARASITE has to be judged as a horror movie since that s where it ends up Set against the standards of Class A horrors like PSYCHO and THE EXORCIST I would not put PARASITE in their league Good yes and clever beautifully shot and edited and acted but not up there with The Best Sorry,7.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5496962/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2020,Parasite,Holy crap this movie surprised me a lot At first the movie seemed more of the tone of a mild comedy with not much of suspense happening But then holy shiz nuggets it starts to get more tense and then so much crap happens at once I can see why this won best picture I was engaged and no moment was dull It really sets how unequal classes of the rich and poor are and the truth of it just hits hard when you realize it Please watch it is a must,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6136305/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2019,Bravo,Captivating thrilling appalling stomach wrenching These are words used to describe Bong Joon Ho s Parasite At first a seemingly witty and somewhat vulgar comedy it slowly evolves into something much more The movie is in Korean with English subtitles While some subtle cultural differences are noticeable this movie can be enjoyed by Korean and American audiences alike The movie centers around the lower class Kim family consisting of a man and a woman and their young adult son and daughter In the beginning they are just scraping by assembling pizza boxes for meager pay and living out of a less than desirable underground apartment in a run down neighborhood of urban sprawl Then one day their fate changes the son s friend who is about to go overseas to study hands off to him his job working as an English tutor for the high school aged daughter of the wealthy upper class Park family The Parks reside in a remarkably modern house designed by a well renowned Korean architect Think the Frank Lloyd Wright of Korea The house is gated and surrounded by beautiful luscious greenery a far cry from the run down apartment of the Kims The Park family closely resembles the Kims in its composition a husband a wife a son and a daughter However the children are much younger The young Kim upon providing a falsified college transcript is hired on the spot by the remarkably naive lady of house The house goes on to become the main setting for the rest of the rollercoaster ride that is Parasite One by one through their crafty use of deception and by playing a few dirty tricks the rest of the family succeeds in invading their way into employment in the extravagant Kim household The family rejoices in its new circumstances having made this elegant house their sanctuary and having turned their financial situation around by milking the cash cow of the Park family However this sense of wealth and prosperity proves to be ephemeral as the dark secret of the house soon after is revealed in a torrential whirlwind of events This movie made me somewhat envious as to the Kim family s unity My brothers parents and I have never been as close to each other as to what I witnessed in this movie Even if the motivations of the Kims are ill willed I couldn t help but to empathize with the family Their crude behavior is quite entertaining as well From my own experience I have never had to face poverty in the way that they did Perhaps because of this my family is not as close to each other as theirs The inequality between upper and lower social classes is a major recurring theme throughout the movie While at times a bit over dramatic in its stark contrasts the movie s cinematography is ingenious through its use of space It is quite clear that the Park family s house is unnecessarily large but it never feels quite as luxurious or over the top as a mansion This concept of space lends itself to another major factor the Park family s socioeconomic privilege and inherent disregard towards people of the lower class especially observable through the actions and mannerisms of Mr Kim This is a pertinent and powerful theme which makes the movie all the more interesting and intriguing Similar themes can be observed in Warner Bros and Todd Phillips recent box office smash hit Joker Sadly there will always be the haves and the have nots for better or for worse and discussion regarding the capitalist system in which the people of South Korea and we in the U S reside could go on for days The film s soundtrack is very tasteful The beginning section of the film is accompanied by pleasant percussive sounds As the plot thickens the music grows in intensity mirroring the looming atmosphere of uncertainty Stringed instruments such as violins and cellos become much more prominent and are cleverly implemented to express sentiments of unease and for a peculiar ominous effect All in all Parasite is a very thought provoking journey which takes the viewer to unexpected places As a sociological commentary which will surely be looked at differently by different people this film may not be particularly agreeable with everyone who views it I do not wish to spoil anything but I will say this it is not for the faint of heart This film is an accomplishment in the international Korean film industry and its commercial success will hopefully lead to more Korean movie screenings in U S movie theaters I hope the movie will make people here who were not interested in learning Korean or any other foreign language for that matter more motivated to embrace the amazing and fruitful process of learning a new language Above all I am not necessarily aware of anything I wasn t already aware of after having watched this movie and I don t believe it to have changed me or my beliefs It also leaves a few unanswered questions Overall it was an indulgent aesthetically pleasing and even at times surreal experience I would definitely watch it again

1 January 2020,"Predictable, Teenage Rate Movie",The story is not believable at all and also so predictable The director couldn t work on characters and that is why we don t care about them at all there is no sympathy It is a teenage level movie I laughed throughout the movie but not because it is funny I was laughing because the story was so naive However from the rate he has got so far I can say he knows people even around world to make such a bad movie but get credits and who knows awards So disappointing to see what credits and stars he has got for this kind of movie There is a lot of holes in this one such as stabbing the rich guy for nothing Just not treating well If the director would like us to believe it he should take much more time on this character In the first 30 minutes at most we can predict even the final Ok the director doesn t focus on this but what else he gave us My suggestion do not waste your time on it,1.0,51.0,127.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5371433/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,Its Top For What It Really Is!,Parasite first don t expect something beyond your thinking Connection between human and money this is top in drama category Oscars Worthy Hmm yes it is what i liked most directing and screen play is no doubt amazing especially the script that doesn t lose it s value the original script that doesn t fill any senseless scenes of the movie and doesn t leave any real plot holes showing the prespective from three different familys having an exciting emotional and unexpected series of events from the three sides surprising ending delivers the plot twist but what i was expecting from what i heard never reached the shocking moment that i was waiting for something much more than what itself is but it just delivers the conclusion of the sensitive story an ending with a point that leaves the viewer with sad feelings wonderful scenes so much detail is given to every scenes if you like drama you will truly enjoy this it will always be top in my recommendation for drama category every aspect of it is given the performance of a premium movie highly recommended for drama fans 9 10,9.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5514560/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2019,Wow!,That was my reaction Parasite starts as a sardonic black comedy about the relations between a poor family and a rich one in present day Seoul before veering off in an entirely unexpected much darker almost surreal direction The protagonists are the impoverished Kim family Dad is a Micawber like optimistic fatalist who has failed at numerous jobs but always expects something to turn up Mom is solid and practical a one time high school track star who keeps things together The mid 20s daughter and college age son are smart quick glib and nervy willing to do whatever it takes but they don t seem to have found their footing They don t always agree but they stick together The Kims live in a cramped squalid basement apartment in the kind of neighborhood where drunks piss in the street The scrape up a little money folding boxes for neighborhood pizzeria none too competently As we meet them they have just lost free wi fi because the neighbor upstairs has passworded her router Dad advises the kids to hold their phones up and move around the apartment to see if they can catch a signal They do up on the ledge where the toilet sits That s Dad s strategy for life in a nutshell Deliverance arrives in the form of Son s high school buddy Min now in college Min has a gig tutoring English to the 15 year old daughter of a very rich family He s going to study abroad for a year and he wants Son to hold his place till he gets back Min intends to start dating the girl when she s old enough and he figures Son will be a harmless substitute Son did well on the English part of the college entrance exam and Min assures him that he can bs his way through The rich family named Park live in a gorgeous spacious modern mansion on a hill formerly the home of a renowned modern architect who has since moved on to bigger things in Paris The father is the kind of Korean global businessman who has been the subject of an admiring profile in the New York Times Mrs Park is described by Min as slow which isn t quite right She s an oblivious but nice lady more ornamental than useful who depends on a middle aged housekeeper and who dotes on and spoils her hyperactive 8 year old son You might call her street dumb The same is true of her husband who knows his way around business but is not as worldly wise as he thinks he is The Parks are insulated from the realities of everyday life by a thick cushion of money and they think the world works the way it s supposed to Park is always concerned that the family servants don t cross the line into familiarity He and his wife assume that anything American is automatically first class and to show their sophistication they pepper their Korean conversation with scraps of English the way Miss Piggy uses French With the help of a diploma forged by Daughter Kim on Photoshop Son aces his interview with Mrs Park and gets hired to give English lessons 2 or 3 afternoons a week In short order he and the girl are also making out when Mom s back is turned Son sees the boy s weird paintings pinned up on the fridge He suggests to Mrs Park that the boy could use art therapy and that he just happens to know an American trained art therapist Mrs Park swallows the bait Daughter Kim bluffs her way through the interview with a combination of arrogance and art therapy buzz words she s picked up on the internet and in short order she s having regular sessions with the little boy Now that they re through the Parks gate the Kim kids manipulate things so that the chauffeur gets fired and is replaced by Dad and the housekeeper gets fired and is replaced by Mom They never let on that they re all related The Parks don t have a clue When the little boy notices that the new driver smells just like his art teacher Mr Park brushes it off because all the people who ride the subway smell the same At the halfway point this has just been an amusing and quite enjoyable story of the clever scrappy poor putting one over on the clueless entitled rich The Kims are making a very good living off the Parks and eating better than they have in a long time Of course we know that the Kims will somehow screw up this honeypot and be threatened with discovery and disaster Things do spiral out of control but in a completely unexpected way I can t say how without a major spoiler let s just say that the Park mansion conceals some extraordinary secrets and that the injuries that the Kims have inflicted come back to haunt them Their struggle to stave off detection starts as slapstick but gets more and more desperate and it builds to a climax that you don t see coming but is completely foreshadowed and leaves you wrung out Definitely worth it One sidelight for American viewers Mr Kim and one other character have each gone broke in the Taiwanese Cake business I googled that It turns out that there is a pattern in South Korean life of fads giving rise to a large number number of opportunistic but undercapitalized small businesses that fail when the fad runs its course Taiwanese Cake was one of them the equivalent of the US cupcake fad of 10 years

7 August 2019,A little confused as to how this movie is so extolled worldwide.,I would like to start out by saying that I am a Korean American college student studying at an American college and have plenty of experience watching Korean movies including some great ones by Bong Jun Ho himself such as The Host Memories of Murder and more A few months ago when the trailer for Gisaengchung Parasite came out I was really hooked the trailer gave off that eerie vibe remotely reminded me of Midsommar by Ari Aster which I found really intriguing Seeing all the positive reviews on multiple websites hearing that this film won at the Cannes Festival and understanding the genius of Bong from his previous films I had very high expectations Here are some of my main points to why I don t love this movie 1 Acting The first 10 15 minutes were rather painful to watch Perhaps it would hit differently for foreigners watching with subtitles but the unnatural lines and the poor delivery made it really hard for me to focus on the characters I think the poor acting performance gets better throughout the film but the Jo Yeo Jung mother of rich family s acting just felt too out of place and cringey Perhaps that was the point to make it look awkward and artificial especially with the sprinkling of English words to poke fun at the rich class and their pretentiousness I understand this is social satire but the execution was not very convincing If done properly I feel like it could and should be subtle yet piercing I would have had to hated her guts wanting her to die or her close people to die but I was barely filled with such emotions She treats her maid a little too well and her tone just isn t all that condescending or demeaning Seemed more like a typical Korean woman freakishly obsessed with her children s education not a greedy disgusting woman who doesn t deserve her wealth and privilege 2 Poorly written Predictable Plot I don t the writers tried too hard writing the script for this movie especially in the beginning where Park Seo Jun the tall smart dude who used to teach Ki Jung the daughter of rich family refers Ki Woo son of poor family as a private tutor Ki Woo seemed too smooth with it not to mention their entire family even though it is implied that he has never done this before in the scene where he drinks with Park the ex tutor The film makes it seem like Ki Woo and their entire family are expert con artists who screwed up rich families all their lives That transition was just too abrupt and unconvincing with very little build up Now I want to talk about my main point and perhaps my main pet peeve about this film predictability The element of surprise and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats is what drives us crazy and get excited questioning every scene line action of the characters However many aspects of the movie were predictable I felt like I was always two to three pages ahead of the script throughout the movie how Ki Woo will soon bring in her sister after getting the job and thus bring in the entire family how the rich family will soon return from their camping trip due to the thunderstorm to screw up the poor family that threw a party in the mansion ish house I also do not understand how the sex scene on top of Ki Tae dad of poor family and his kids hiding under the table contributed to the plot I wish they focused more on the class struggle the main theme of this movie and develop on that The rich dad is the guy who is remotely the obnoxious successful man who disdainfully looks down upon the poor bc of his hate for Ki Tae s smell which is later the reason Ki Tae kills the rich dad but I feel like they could have painted him with a more obnoxious cunning and elitist personality I didn t want or need the rich guy to die at the end meaning that I wasn t in Ki Tae s shoes as much as I wanted to and was supposed to due to lack of character development and build up 3 Execution The theme of this movie is banal but that doesn t matter because I believe execution and delivery are essential elements in story telling To bring up Breaking Bad as much of a masterpiece it is the plot although extremely well executed and developed isn t all THAT ground breaking A poor depressed guy turning the tables around rather dramatically is a recurring theme in movies American dream movies super hero movies and more I am not discrediting Breaking Bad in any matter The show s plot is unparalleled not because of where it started but because of how it developed How Walter became a criminal mastermind How Jesse became so vulnerable How the tables have turned so drastically In Parasite there is no development nor shock value especially as to how the poor family will tear apart the rich family perhaps so because of the title haha I don t feel connected to the poor family Their motives are weak and unfounded they are mere criminals now I can t say that their financial struggles is deserved or not because that is a whole another issue but there is just too little build up Like I said they just seem too smooth of criminals who s been in the field for decades Conclusion I have been chewing on this ever since I finished watching but it could be that Bong didn t intend to hit on the points I made like he didn t feel like he needed to add a strong shock value or that the poor family needed more build up But overall the plot was too predictable and unconvincing I saw little pain and suffering of the poor I wanted to see more jealousy and contempt towards the inequality perhaps make the rich dad a corrupt CEO Not just a regular man who s in the tech industry I didn t feel bad for the poor family nor did I feel disgusted by the rich family I didn t think that the rich dude needed to die I definitely don t think this family didn t deserve that when in fact I should be triumphantly cheering for Ki Tae to just go out on a killing spree Him hiding in the basement was also very obvious Would have been cool if they didn t reveal that and just show the malfunctioning light blink at a certain pattern indirectly letting the audience know that Ki Tae who was supposedly gone missing had hid in the basement Showing not telling done exquisitely in No Country for Old Men Instead Bong put a longnarrative in the end which was not inspiring shocking nor meaningful Bong just had the actor explain the whole thing in paragraphs Proposal Biggest Regret Where I think they really could have taken this movie off was when the rich family cancelled their camping trip and came back the family finding out about how the poor family was stabbing them from behind and thus the rich family just mercilessly oppressing the poor family with extreme measures That is the only part where I was curious about what was going to happen I think that was where Bong could have given us some insight into the cruel unfair and corrupt capitalist society that he is supposedly trying to criticize and writing this satire about Just some thoughts Although I am in the never ending search for good movies I am no expert I was just confused at how ppl thought this is Bong s greatest

29 February 2020,"Korean movie, winner of the Oscar for Best Picture.",My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library I wouldn t normally be drawn to a Korean movie with English subtitles and with a name like Parasite but because it won the Oscar recently for Best Picture it seemed like a worthy viewing Well we found it very worthwhile The story is pretty novel it focuses on a family of four dad mom son and daughter all living in a basement of sorts in a slum area and scratching for enough money to buy food each day Definitely a lower class existence but also seemingly bright and well educated By good fortune the son is asked to become an English tutor for a teenage girl when his friend the current tutor is heading off to college When he shows up he is fascinated by the fabulous home of this upper class family the dad is a big executive and wealthy The family hires a live in maid a driver and tutors for the two children Quickly the tutor sees an opportunity and eventually all four of the lower class family members cooperate in a scheme By different approaches they will cause all the hired help to be dismissed being replaced by the various members of their family but hiding the fact that they are in fact family members In essence they become parasites sucking money off the wealthy family Of course things don t go smoothly for long and things get really mucked up after the former maid returns to retrieve something she left in the basement As I watched into the second half of the movie I was wondering how all this would work its way through and found the filmaker had a very interesting approach in the very end not everything is resolved and one can decide what eventually happened Really good movie the dialog is pretty quick at times and you have to read subtitles pretty quickly but overall it wasn t too big of a task,0.0,0.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5517466/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2020,Best Picture of the Year. Really??,Since many critics and the Academy are swooning over this Korean film I was compelled to go to the theater pay my admission and be ready to read English titles for over two hours I kept an open mind and found the first third of the two plus hours to be interesting Mind you none of the characters were especially likeable the lower class basement dwellers or the upper class snowflakes living in the architectural digest modern mansion The lower class family were the true parasites smelly low class leeches looking for and finding every possible way to become what they weren t classy After the son the daughter the father and then the mother managed to become tutor analyst driver and cook the plot thickened and to me went off the rails A hidden bomb shelter a husband living in that tomb for four years a biblical rain storm miraculously not causing anyone of the submerged characters with hundreds of electrical wires floating overhead to be instantly electrocuted cell phones to continue to work after being equally submerged Not at all believable And then The skies cleared and a gala lawn party was planned at the modern mansion Here s where I could see Jordon Peele becoming royally pissed Wasn t all the crazy knife wielding and weird stuff done in Get Out Yes it was So the Academy voters had to make amends for not giving Peele the Best Picture Oscar Instead they gave it to this two plus hour Korean gab fest I left the theater feeling absolutely empty Not moved not caring but wondering just why did the performers all have three names Avoid if you haven t already given your valuable time,2.0,12.0,45.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5477525/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2020,Incredible Situation of Social Drama,When I started watching this I thought well here is a caption film and I haven t watched one in a while I fully expected that because of the captions I would lose track of the story Then as I got into this film I realized I was being drawn into the social fabric of South Korea I appreciated it more and more as the film moved on We have a desperate family living in a basement The son has a friend whose leaving for college in America His friend asks him to tutor his girlfriend while he is away at school because he trusts him The girlfriend has a wealthy upper middle class family So on his classmate recommendation he gets the job Then the son finds he can get his entire family jobs with his new employer as well So pretty soon the desperate family is all working and getting involved with the employers family The social consequences of this become more and more complex as the desperate family is not telling their employers they are all related to each other The wealthy family has many issues of it s own as well Character development here is excellent and key to this as their relationship becomes more and more complex Everything is going well until one week end when the middle class family is taking their youngest son camping for a week end Then we find out some dark hidden secrets of their house as their employees decide to have a party at the employers house Then the employees find out about a dark hidden secret in their employers house and everything starts falling apart for both families I don t want to get too technical here because even though I warn for spoilers I would rather the complexity of these social interactions are better if you see them for yourself than my getting too detailed describing them This is great writing and direction of a very complex social order story It teaches the viewer about South Korean Culture and South Korea in a way that is unexpected but very welcome While the results of everything coming apart might not make some viewers happy the way it happens when things come apart make total sense There is some mild adult material here but it is done milder than many R rated films All the cast fit their roles and get plenty of chance to act They really make the viewer feel what is going on and where complex relationships have to wind up The title is a give away in that the desperate family does become parasites to the wealthy family The way it happens is what makes this movie special Kudos to all the folks who have given this movie awards It deserves all of them The film takes the viewer into a different world and does so in a unique manner,9.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5713978/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2019,"Wow, just wow!",Parasite can be summarized in a single word WOW Director Joon ho Bong brought us the incredible films Memories of Murder The Host Mother Snowpiercer and Okja and now Parasite Starting out as a comedy the film soon reveals itself for what it truly is This brilliant script has an ingenious set up morphing into a full on devious thriller Initially innocent the antagonist family s plan soon becomes evident as they infiltrate the lives of an unsuspecting wealthy family At first through subtle seemingly innocent actions but becoming increasingly more sinister as their plans fall into place The film has a few interesting twists Kang ho Song is excellent as usual He is an incredibly versatile actor I ve seen him in comedies action movies horrors and thrillers and he simply never disappoints The setting in the big mansion is really awesome versus the dilapidated neighborhood the antagonist family comes from The behavioral differences are also very effectively illustrated Although some moments might be considered too convenient to be realistic the execution thereof is excellent making this yet another classic unforgettable Korean thriller,8.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5221905/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2020,Incredibly powerful and detailed.,Parasite was one of the best films of 2019 It engaged the audience by building tension slowly throughout the first half then having everything come crashing down throughout the second half as if in slow motion One of my favourite aspects of this was that as Mr Kim says in the latter half of the film there was no plan to their actions This way the audience doesn t know what s happening until it s over and that might suggest that the Kims don t either Still the rush that I felt when I figured out pieces of their plan is difficult to find in most films Two examples of this are when Mr Kim poured the hot sauce onto the tissue to trick Mrs Park into firing her housekeeper under suspicion of tuberculosis or later in the film when they hide under the table from the Park family I m pretty sure I audibly gasped when Mr Kim lifted up the tissue with blood on it An important thing to note is that the film though made in Korea represents the futility of the American Dream in a way that I ve never seen before When I say American Dream I mean the ideal that if you work hard enough you can become rich and successful Both the Kims and the Parks I would say are living in fantasy worlds of this ideal The Parks believe that they ve worked hard to get where they are and therefore deserve household employees who don t smell like a basement The Kims on the other hand hold the belief that working hard will someday get them where the Parks are figuratively and literally No one believes this more strongly than Ki woo the son of the Kim family This is shown throughout the film from even before he first gets the job as an English tutor when he s trying to get a job with the pizza delivery driver Once he gets the job he believes it s his way out and he can save enough money for college The worst part about this is that he still holds this belief at the very end of the movie when he writes a letter that he has absolutely no way to send to his dad The letter describes this exact ideal if Ki woo works hard and goes to university and makes money he can buy the house his father is hiding in and literally be where the Parks were at the start Since he s already been rejected from college multiple times and South Korean real estate is crazy expensive it would be impossible for him to achieve this goal but he still believes he can This is in my opinion the saddest part of the movie Since this is how it ends it leaves the viewer contemplating whether he could actually achieve his dream of saving his father which makes the film much more powerful,9.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5498532/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,Won Direction,The Best Picture win for Parasite finally convinced some local cinemas to me to give it a whirl Though I enjoyed it I m not sure I know genuinely know enough about South Korea class systems to be sure that I fully understood it Also I apologise in advance for butchering South Korean Nomenclature in the next paragraph Kim Ki Woo Woo sik Choi lives in a subterranean apartment with his family One day he is offered the chance to tutor English to Park Da Hye Jung Ji So the daughter of a wealthy family Spying the opportunity to exploit the family Ki Woo brings in his sister Kim Ki Jung Park So dam as art tutor to Da Hye s younger brother His father Kim Ki taek Song Kang ho replaces the family s chauffer and most importantly his mother Park Chung sook Jang Hye Jin replaces Gook Moon gwang Lee Jung eun as the families trusted housekeeper All is going well for the Kim family until one night when the Parks are away the former housekeeper returns and requests access to the basement to collect something she s left behind I enjoyed Parasite a lot The performances are great Kim Ki taek is probably the standout but there really is nobody who lets the film down The direction and cinematography are excellent I enjoyed the story and particular not knowing exactly where the film was going to go I d seen The Host before so I know that Boon Joon Ho is capable of taking his films into B Movie territory so I had all sorts of potential horror science fiction plots in mind I don t feel like the film suffered in the second half although I accept that for some the switch from a confidence trickster movie to more of a revenge thriller might be a bit too much for some My problem was that I really don t know much about how South Korean society works I m assuming that he film is parable about the tiered levels of class and money in Korea That the Parasite of the title can be considered both as the Kim family scamming money from the Parks and the Parks living of the labour of their lower class employees But again I feel like I m guessing this rather than being sure That doesn t really affect my appreciation though of an excellent film and a worthy best picture winner this year,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5526250/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2020,I clearly don't follow the trend !!,I often watch Korean movies and they do have a style that is proper to them I really appreciate what the Korean artists try out with the cinematographic art This movie has created a lot of hype in the industry even got an Oscar by watching the cover and the title i didn t want to watch this movie But then it got recommended by a very close friend of mine who s working in Korean affairs I gave it a shot and i was right i didn t like this movie To me i didn t find the humour amusing although quite a lot of Korean movies are really good with humour The story itself was pathetic however that is the point with a title like Parasite The end which for me started at the point they were getting hammered was overly long and messy All that being said though the actors are really good the screenplay is most times well done although too many close ups but frankly it is overhyped I think this movie responds more to those being bourgeois,4.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5568172/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2021,Decidedly reactionary,In a hurry I finally saw Parasite and it wasn t sooo great I was not convinced by his grotesque black comedy style certain repetitions some too long scenes his low blows and some formal gloating And the worst a lot of concern about the MESSAGE the characters are almost puppets at the service of a message but a message that came out moreover frankly reactionary Visually brilliant,7.0,1.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6439840/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2020,It's a big NO from me!,I can t believe I watched this film till the end I kind of understand the metaphorical view of the director There s no connection between scenes In the first 20 minutes I tried really hard not to feel bored but I didn t make it Frankly I don t understand why this film was nominated not for an Oscar but even for the last of the awards Total waste of time,1.0,9.0,22.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5566798/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2019,Good Enough,There is a big hype about this movie and for a good reason Unlike those popular films that those days create a buzz because of the action plot and the big names Parasite is more about the social message that it wants to pass through than a likable story that will appear to the masses So overall Parasite is good If you like movies about real people that are not afraid to show the raw reality and social injustice than watch this one It is a roller coaster of emotions with lighter more comical moments and more thrilling suspenceful moments And the film combines them masterfully and everything works well together The performances were top notch as well The story finally was well paced and interesting,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5226141/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2022,The poor and the rich,This is basically a film about income inequality in Korea Sure this can pretty much apply to most of the developed countries around the world but the interesting thing is that many of us don t realise that income inequality also exists in Korea which is why I suspect the film was set here as opposed to the United States or even Australia The film opens in what is known as a half basement basically a form of lodging where the poor people of Korea live Here we have the main characters earning a living folding pizza boxes and hunting for a wifi connection to leech off which is one of the reflections of the parasite in the film The idea of the parasite is an entity that is living off the life force of another and in this film we have the family slowly move one by one into the house of the wealthy Parks who we don t know why they are wealthy they just are However one of the twists in the film is that we eventually discover that they aren t the only parasites that are living off them Mind you it is interesting that the Parks are portrayed as being incredibly naieve which is the state of mind that is required for the parasites to survive If we knew that we had parasites living off of us then we would no doubt act to get them removed even if they weren t necessarily doing us any harm In a way the Kims are con artists they need naievity to be able to survive which is why they end up targeting the Parks This becomes clear when Mrs Park chooses not to review the certificate but rather relies entirely upon the recommendation Mind you this is the essence of being able to succeed not so much that you have the knowledge the skills or the certificates but rather that you have the connections In fact having worked in the corporate world where companies do tend to encourage people to recommend friends and family no doubt because it is much easier to go through the employment process than to employ strangers though of course people whom I have spoken to tend not to like recommending friends especially since they end up getting burnt The ending is interesting though and while it seems that there is no particular reason why Mr Kim ended up stabbing Mr Park if you dig a little deeper you find out why Mr Kim s daughter had just been stabbed but he is not concerned about the life of a girl that seems to be dying but rather the life of his son who has just fainted so he orders his driver to let her die as opposed to saving her Stairs play an important role in the film as you ascend stairs to get to the Park s residence but you descend stairs to get to the Kim s residence and further there is also the bunker hidden under the house where we discover that it is the dwelling place of a man who happens to be hiding from the loan sharks Sure he was successful but when things when wrong he had to descend the stairs which references his descent into poverty There is also the idea of smell and that there is a rich person smell and a poor person smell Mr Park references Mr Kim as smelling of the subway which suggests that only poor people use the subway while the rich people have somebody drive them around Sure it probably isn t the greatest film out there but it does certainly raise the issue of income inequality The thing is that the Park s aren t necessarily bad people and this is certainly nothing new parasites have existed throughout human history where the poor have relied on the rich for their survival but then again the rich also relying upon the poor for their own status and lifestyle,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8005791/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2019,Unexpected,PARASITE RATING 4 7 5 Heard a lot about this movie so i finally decided to check it out The name implies a possible horror movie hell even the main poster feels horror ish In reality it turns out to be a twisted dark comedy that comments on the disparities between rich and poor families and even how the gap between them keeps widening You re following this dirt poor family who struggles to just get by However there s no doubt that they all love and support each other Miraculously the son gets a job tutoring English for this rich family s daughter despite not really having the qualifications At this point the son starts scheming up ways to get his family involved in taking advantage of this rich family and hilarity ensues The first half of the movie is a straight up comedy as this poor family takes advantage of the rich family that clearly doesn t know any better My theater was laughing up a storm regardless of the subtitles Reviewers and the director keep saying that a twist happens in the 2nd Half which should be kept secret However i thought it was just par for the course and was not surprised at all when the supposed twist happened As you enter the 3rd Act things start getting kinda serious and questions start being raised about who s in the right You have a rich family that s out of touch with the world around them On the other side you have a poor family doing whatever it takes to survive There s even a small discussion about how easy it is to be nice when you have tons of money This movie has layers upon layers in what it says about the rich and the poor Where Joker held up a mirror to society and said You are to blame for what happens Parasite presents the good and bad between the families and kind of asks the audience Who s worse Yes the rich family has it easy and seems to have it all together but they fake almost everything about their life and are borderline disconnected from each other and society while even looking down on others and not realizing it The poor family is tight knit but you start to wonder if they keep each other down because of how close they are Even when the idea is presented that the brightest family member could easily transition into the rich lifestyle the movie makes you ask if they should as that world has a tendency to chew people up and spit them out There s even a moment where someone in the poor family tries to make an emotional connection with the rich family after going through a traumatic life changing experience only to be reminded that they re nothing more than a lowly employee Honestly this movie is great It can be interpreted in so many different ways and you wouldn t really be wrong no matter what you took from the movie This is a high recommend from me If you hate subtitles suck it up because this is a movie that s definitely worth watching,9.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5218831/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2021,Dangerously depressing,This film made me feel so depressed I would actively discourage anyone from seeing it who feels down at times I do always try to be as positive as I can when talking about anything but this film made me feel so hopeless that I don t have anything positive to say about it It left me in a really dark place and I wish I had never seen it No one will like seeing this film critics may have given good reviews but none of them could say they enjoyed the film It makes you feel so depressed that since this is something I do struggle with it affected my mental health after watching this The quality was really disappointing I predicted everything that was going to happen at every point in the story and none of the main characters felt anything approaching realistic as they were extremely one dimensional and horrible from the opening moments with a completely age inappropriate relationship involving one of those characters throughout the film But most of all this is a film which is completely rotten to its core The worst film I have ever seen Avoid it if you want to enjoy yourself,1.0,4.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7346518/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2019,The Have and the Have-not,While set in Korea the main theme of this movie is as universal as the most basic of human nature as in Se7en 1995 We saw the same sentiments played out in the French Revolution the Have not getting even with the Have In the French Revolution it played out as revolution and guillotines Here in Parasite it plays out as a multiple con job turned ugly no decapitation mind you but with blood and gore to match There are two remarkable things about this movie The first is the change abruptly at the mid point in tone from farce like comedy to horror like thriller The other thing is the matter of course approach at both Neither the comedy nor the horror is laboured or deliberately crafted While the plot may sound outlandish the delivery is so natural as to make it believable A great deal of credit goes to the splendid cast The movie opens with a crispy introduction of a cheap family in every sense of the word Out of a cramped basement riding on a lucky break the four members successively and successfully con their way into the household of a slick ultra modern luxurious mega estate First the son becomes the English tutor of a na ve girl at puberty He quickly gets his sister a job as the arts tutor of the girl s little brother The father and mother with the sibling s cunning plotting soon replace the existing housekeeper and chauffer The couple that employ them are unsuspicious if not entirely gullible At this point nobody can fault you for thinking that the title refers obviously to these four Then comes the twist at midpoint When the masters take their kids on a camping trip the parasite family live like royalties albeit transiently But it turns out that they are not the only parasite because there is one that fits the description even better living in the bowels A sudden visit from the discharged housekeeper reveals a secret she has been hiding her husband in a secret basement unknown to the masters Then when the camping trip is cut short by foul weather all hell breaks loose While people may call this movie different things the crux of the matter is the revelation of the resentment the Have not harboured towards the Have,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5249995/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2020,Great film,Surprisingly easy to watch It s a film on many levels starting as a gentle comedy morphing into something a lot more macabre Seeks to provide commentary on social class in Korea as well as a nod to the political environment of having a non friendly neighbour in the North The title is brilliant,10.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5494985/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2020,Successful and rare Story,This film finally has an action that has never existed before And that s exactly the best thing about the film A thriller story between rich and poor that is pretty well written As such I personally found the staging to be rather standard But the end is worth it in my opinion The film is rather calm but the end is all the more shocking and blatant The acting is solid The poor family is easy to find even though it embodies evil The development of family behavior is scary If you know the core of the story at the end the film title makes a very good sense In my opinion Parasite wasn t the best film of the year But worth seeing Mostly because of the story,8.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5942206/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2023,Wow,This is not really a review it should be taken more as a collection of impressions of the film A film that wants to make a huge social criticism and does it very well for the first part and also for the central part and then gets ruined a bit in the final which makes everything too hasty and obvious for some things but also extremely incongruous for others Let s talk about the plot which in general is brilliant and wants to tell the disparities between rich and poor but also how people can be fooled in a great way if you know what to do and when the film seems to have finished surprising it still manages to bring out something that keeps you glued to the screen So to conclude wonderful movie but I didn t like the ending,9.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9239734/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2020,Unique and full of surprises! 8/10,Review Were do I start with this film I really didn t know what to expect because every time I asked someone what it was about no one could explain it and now that I ve watched it I can totally understand why I deliberately waited for the UK Steelbook release because I was hoping that it would come with an English dubbed version which it didn t so I wasn t happy when I saw I had to read subtitles all the way through I can honestly say it wouldn t have worked with a dubbed version because of there expressions and tones Now after the first 15 minutes I didn t know where the movie was going and I personally thought that the rock was going to have some mystical and magical powers but it s SO cleverly written and full of surprises throughout and I m glad that I didn t know what was going to happen The acting is top class and with the storyline being based around 2 families in two houses it proves that you don t need a massive budget to produce something special A lot of people think that 1971 deserved the Oscar for best picture but after watching this film it beats it hands down for its originality acting and pure suspense The amazing twists and turns mixed with comedy and emotion was put together extremely well and you couldn t help but feel for the family who used their brains to get out of the gutter There are little touches of genius like the smell aspect of the storyline and the way that the dad could turn on a switch of a button which all come s together by the end of the film Anyway I fully recommend this movie to all moviegoers except for kids of course and I hope that people will give it a chance because you will be surprised with the outcome Brilliant Round Up This movie was directed by Bong Joon Ho who also brought you Barking Dogs Never Bite in 2000 Memories of Murder The Host Tokyo Mother Snowpiercer and Okja The only movie that I have seen from his previous work was Snowpiercer which I wasn t that impressed with but this film was unique and a touch of class It s not often that I agree with the Oscar s panel but in this case I did It won 4 awards including Best Picture Best International Film Best Writing and Best Directing at the 2019 Awards Ceremony and it s the first Non English film to win an Oscar in the Best Picture category Truly Deserved It covers all genres which is extremely rare and the message about different classes is relevant to what is happening around the world today Budget 11 4million Worldwide Gross 257 5million Genre Comedy Drama Thriller Cast Kang ho Song Sun kyun Lee Yeo jeong Jo Woo sik Choi So dam Park Jeong eun Lee Hye jin Jang Myeong hoon Park and Ji so Jung 8 10,8.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6048286/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2020,An amazing movie!,Parasites uses a family of four to find ways to parasitize the exaggerated acts of rich people slowly showcasing the opposition and impending crisis of the upper and lower social classes of the Park and Jin families due to wealth Both films start with joy and end with sorrow and the starting point for these social events is money,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5635667/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2019,Dark approach from a lighter style discussing a heavy theme,Parasite probably is one of well advertised Palm D Or recipient when it is commercially released in my country even some of our famous directors like the movie However after watching this movie my friend is confused because she can t point a finger about what s the topic of the movie Advertised as tragicomedy Gisaengchung probably doesn t have a firm genre to stand with since dramedy is heavily used in the first half before continue the movie with more thriller solution In the surface we understand what s this movie about A poor family starts to leech on a rich family without told that they are one Some scenes provide laughs and eerie feeling but it s not escalating until the second half when more bloody scenes are showing but not with much explanation Since the second half aren t that long I found that as an audience we must dissect the nature of the action making a real difference than the light first half When thinking I slowly understand that this movie is a rich vs poor act that have to be buried because it will makes chaos The chaos gives a dark approach to the theme but sugarcoated with some tragic and comedy nature of the movie The dissecting itself what maybe can t swallowed at one time like my friend Unfortunately upon having the realization this movie doesn t give me that much impression like the others say Nevertheless it s still a highly recommended viewing option,8.0,3.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4976301/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,Very interesting,A movie with much gravitas and profound social issues We can expect much more from this prodigious director and the stars of this phenomenal movie Kudos to AMPAS Hopefully the Oscar for this film will open the flood gates to more foreign films that have been historically relegated to the Foreign Film sub category at the Academy Awards,10.0,13.0,40.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5478634/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2020,Tragedy,Who is the antagonist This question popped into my head after I finished Bong Joon Ho s Parasite and as I read some snippets from Bong himself He consistently refers to the film as a tragedy and as I wondered who the antagonist was I remembered that in Greek tragedy the fall of the hero always stems from a flaw within themselves Then the answer clicked The antagonists are the Kims So the Kims are a poor family of four struggling to make a living in Seoul and conning their way into life s niceties In the opening scene we see them clamor up to the corner of their bathroom where their toilet is elevated above the rest of the room to steal wifi after their upstairs neighbors put a password on theirs The son Dong Ik gets an offer from a friend to cover for him as an English tutor to a daughter of a wealthy family Dong Ik uses his position to get one for his sister as an art teacher therapist for the younger child a position driving the patriarch for his father and the position of housekeeper for his mother The first two positions are simply open and require nothing more than convincing the mother of the house to give them a shot but the house already has a driver and a housekeeper And that is where the con takes another level Ki Jung leaves her underwear in the car when the driver drives her home creating the impression when the patriarch finds them that the driver was having sex with women in his car He gets let go replaced by Ki Taek Dong Ik s father To get rid of the housekeeper requires more planning since she had been with the house from the house s previous owner They end up having to take extreme measures which include convincing the mother of the house that the housekeeper has tuberculosis and triggering the housekeeper s life threatening allergy to peach fuzz The Kims are not good people They re deceptive cruel and dishonest The Parks on the other hand are a mixture of detached thoughtless and unfeeling They re not really good people either They dismiss the driver without asking him about the underwear fully believing the worst of him based on a single piece of evidence while discounting all the time they have spent with him They cast off the housekeeper without even asking her if she actually as tuberculosis The key is that both groups are their own destructive forces It s hard to get into how that manifests late in the film essentially past the halfway point without digging into spoilers so I ll speak in generalities It s the Kim s duplicitousness that gets them into the situation that undoes them It s their lies that keep them from finding solutions that will actually work On the other side is the Parks whose thoughtlessness and lack of feeling brought in the destructive force into their homes to begin with There are no heroes or villains in this story only flawed people who can t grow The movie is filled with imagery as well From the scholar s rock that Dong Ik carries around meant as a symbol for wealth to the constant vertical motion of the characters There s a large sequence where a torrential downpour hits the city and the Kims after having been trapped in the Park s house because of their presumption that the richer family would be out of town all night run down the hills of Seoul to their half underground dwelling that s been filled with water the toilet spewing a black substance because of the messed up pressure The Kims left their window open that allowed the water in Would they have left it open if they hadn t spent the night at the Parks residence The rain isn t the fault of either the Parks or the Kims but it affects both families very differently Atop their hill in their mansion the Parks simply watch it from their window appreciating the aesthetics The Kims get wiped out and end up abandoning their home to sleep on the floor of a local gym along with the others who were displaced It s an interesting and highly entertaining look into the class differences present in South Korea It s alternatively extremely funny horrifying and even touching It can be all three in seconds and it ends up working because the tone never really jumps It s evenly and expertly filmed with an eye towards black comedy and tragedy mixed into one package,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5711294/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,"I don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film",Despite hearing about this from day dot I thankfully managed to avoid knowing anything about this other than it s title director and subsequent success Boy am I glad because it s quite the ride No doubt about it Parasite is a high quality film It wasn t at all what I had assumed it would be like it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting and that s a positive Yet it s still pretty dark It s a great mix The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out the ending is particularly nuts The cast do a fantastic job especially the main quartet Song Kang ho would be my personal standout I enjoyed watching him throughout Choi Woo shik is very good too as are Park So dam and Jang Hye jin All of the onscreen talent do terrific though from Cho Yeo jeong to Lee Jung eun I don t have any negatives for this it s a brilliant film From the cinematography to the dialogue to the locations to the humour You name it this produces it on an impressive level Not that I need to say this given I m seemingly one of the last few who hadn t but you must watch this,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6223763/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2020,Parasite leeches onto societal dissociation to create a thrillingly hilarious satire on capitalism.,Rich people are naive No resentments No creases on them It all gets ironed out Money is an iron Those creases all get smoothed out by money The Kim family residing in the secluded darkness of a semi underground basement apartment acquire limited income Jaggedly folding pizza boxes for an independent takeaway chain with the already low paying income reduced as a consequence of poor workmanship They much like the bottom feeders of South Korea s working class division struggle to survive Consuming rotting food Hijacking neighbouring paid Wi Fi services Residing in potentially diseased sub urban streets Ultimately aspiring to achieve the lofty heights of upper class formalities Conceptualising the popularised term Hell Joseon a critique on the current socioeconomic declining trajectory of South Korea As the Kims tucked into their minimised dinner son Ki woo s university friend gifts the family a scholar s rock Traditionally granting the bearer a promise of wealth Swiftly after he offers a proposition to Ki woo To continue his vocation as an English tutor for the elegant daughter of a wealthy family the Parks Ki woo ponders fabricating a plan that would seize this opportunity for beneficial gain A chance to relish in the opposing scale of unequalised capitalism After a successful lesson Ki woo insists his awareness for an art therapy teacher at the behest of the gullible Choi Yeon gyo for her son Ki woo unbeknown to the Parks invites his sister Ki jung to provide these lessons Gradually the Kim family one by one assimilate themselves into the lives of the Park family pretending to be unrelated The poor draining the wealth and opportunism from the rich Before tackling this critically lauded feature which has now grown to be one of the highest rated productions of all time in such an inconsequential amount of time the black humour of director Joon ho s filmography acted as preparation for what was to be expected Providing critiques on sociopolitical endeavours that overburden an OECD nation Predictably yet efficiently Joon ho s darkly comedic satire on class conflict manages to succinctly tackle the enragement of allocated resources that supplies social inequality and wealth disparity through the microcosmic insight of two opposing families Not just in prosperity or affluence but in temperament A reflection of late stage capitalism where the enticingly inviting wealthy superfluously ignore the difficulties of life for the remaining population Youth unemployment at the expense of extortionate higher education fees Affordability for shelter and essential food items rapidly dissipating along with the lower class The Kims perpetuate these foreboding crises utilising fraudulent and forgery crimes to attain the standard of living that many aspire to achieve Yet beneath the sharply hilarious foundations of Joon ho s screenplay which confidently satirises the naivety and credulity of opulence whilst embedding thought provoking themes of affirmative contemplation and economic disassociation is a visceral vision of palpable colonialism The Parks original housekeeper Gook Moon gwang imitating North Korea s dictatorial leader whom openly yearns to invade South Korea mimicking the voice and mannerisms of a propagandist news reporter Before engaging in a fight with the Kims for social dominance a microcosm for the poor fighting the poor The Parks son Da song frolicking in the freshly sprinkled garden in an Indian outfit memorialising colonial occupation Whilst these are included as surface level replications the contextual substance beneath these depictions hark back to the economic order of capitalism The poor decline and the rich rise The latter viewing the former as parasitical microbes feeding off of their principled success Staircases acting as prominent motifs to accentuate economic disparity with Kyung pyo s clinically precise cinematography emphasising their thematic purpose through extensive shots from banished basements and luxurious lounges Coincidentally Joon ho intelligently avoids assigning protagonists rather viewing the perspectives of both social classes as unethical divisions of society with the upstairs downstairs ideology implying this viewpoint Each cast member supplying bountiful amounts of energy and deliverance in depicting the social divide Kang ho and Yeo jeong especially with their eccentric portrayals of two parents from each end of the divide The onscreen chemistry between Woo shik and So dam also enhanced the close familial bonds within the Kim family working as a crime syndicate rather than individuals Every technicality and thematic endeavour was on course for perfection From Jae il s orchestral score to Jin mo s precise editing All Joon ho had to do to truly finish with finesse was solidify a resonant conclusion For a moment with Ki taek rampantly abandoning Da song s birthday party he did Fade to black A statement on everything that was depicted previously was conceptualised in these final moments Perfection Alas the feature resumed and it kept going The aftermath of the party narration included and the proceeding weeks unfortunately quelled the outstanding momentum that preceded the lavishly wrapped conclusion In spite of the proposed incalculable unlikelihood of the climactic fantasy scenario heavily inferring the inescapable boundaries of the proposed coup de grace for a particular individual it was too immaculate Heavy handedly providing implications in a film that astoundingly dealt with nuanced subtextual thematic representations However despite the agitated reservations for Joon ho s embellished ending Parasite is a dramatic journey that is boundless in scope Seamlessly blending genres through prosperous performances and luxurious direction Joon ho fully realises the dual meaning behind the feature s title through sheer confidence The poor infiltrating the wealthy and the rich leeching off of the working class labour Society is self parasitical No grand life plan will change that You know what kind of plan never fails No plan at all,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5793520/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,Bong-Kers!

5 June 2023,it was ehhh,The ideal way to experience South Korean auteur Bong Joon ho s award garlanded international box office smash Parasite is with as little prior knowledge as possible The film is a remarkable experience that makes modern movie going such a joy and the author saw it for the fourth time last week and is now eager to view the black and white version that Bong recently unveiled at the Rotterdam film festival Parasite is a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum told with the trademark genre fluidity that has seen Bong s back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery via monster movie to dystopian future fantasy and beyond The Kim family headed by father Ki taek Song Kang ho and mother Chung sook Chang Hyae jin have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard scrabble entrepreneurism When son Ki woo Choi Woo shik is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home tutor a rich schoolgirl he gets his gifted artist sister Ki jung Park So dam to forge a college certificate bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family Ki woo newly dubbed Kevin is a wealthy businessman who lives in a luxurious house above the slums of Seoul His wife Yeon kyo Cho Yeo jeong tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son Mr Park Lee Sun kyun is at work while his wife Yeon kyo Cho Yeo jeong tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son Mr Park relies on hired help such as tutors a chauffeur and most importantly a devoted housekeeper Moon gwang Lee Jung eun Ki woo discovers that his own family could easily fill these roles and hatches a plan to inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks Parasite is a melancholy ghost story disguised by generic mutations It is a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul It is played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and Han Jin won s multitonal script,8.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9101619/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,Can I say train wreck?,Well I guess I am just a consumer who doesn t know movies but I thought this was a bow wow Unrealistic too many subplots and little respect for cause and effect Take for example the flood the next day they were all dressed like Jeff Bezos in pressed and clean clothes If you saw the scene of the flood no way Not that it matters but the movie portrayed the actors as people I hope to never meet Maybe the older housekeeper I would like and her husband Do you believe the underground setting as even close to something that is really not me I was impressed with the visuals of the movie Nice angle shots and perspectives Good framing and all the yada yada stuff you should expect from films these days I just don t see this as a stellar movie I also did not like the feeling it left me with for South Koreans yes it is a movie and I hope it only represents a portion of the people in this country but this could really be an issue If this movie represents only a small portion of the people what is the relevance if this type of culture is pervasive enough to make a movie which meaning then there is an issue with this society in my opinion I hope it is just a shock and awe movie in a format to surprise people draw them to the theatre or dare I say the streaming services After all Friedrich Nietzsche is gone and maybe this movie stands in for him wouldn t that be good The movie Nietzsche would make see it now I hope the South Koreans are not really like this Oh by the way nice house except the dungeon After the awards I am surprised the number of people who in general conversation mentioned they turned the movie off part way through Maybe the ying and the yang of what constitutes quality and how we view societal relationships is the real discussion here and the perspective we all bring I have to say it made me think but after all said and done as a movie did not fulfill what I had heard and I did not really care for it Watch this movie you may really like it happy for you,4.0,3.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5488517/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2019,Rear bushes,The window looks like a movie screen At the outset filmmaker Bong Joon ho immediately evokes Alfred Hitchcock s Rear Window the 1954 mystery thriller about the man in a wheelchair who diagnoses a neighbor s murder plot against his wife from across the courtyard of an urban apartment complex On a subtextual level photographer L B Jeffries James Stewart is a voyeur he glimpses scenes from ordinary people s lives that were never meant for his eyes Film theorist Laura Mulvey in her essay Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema linked with moviegoing with voyeurism We like to watch more or less is what Mulvey surmised When Lars Thorwald Raymond Burr the surveilled man does nothing integral to the cover up of his wife s murder Jeffries naps with his body faced away from the mini dramas unfolding in each apartment square Ki woo Choi Woo shik in Parasite the 2019 winner of the Palm d or at Cannes would rather squint at a tiny screen as demonstrated by the camerawork a downwards tilt in which we see the young man staring into his phone instead at the world outside from the sofa of his family s semi basement apartment Just like everybody else Kim Ki Woo would rather watch a movie on a five inch screen instead of the communal experience you get from traditional movie exhibition But Bong for the sake of contrast replicates Hitchcock with four voyeurs not just one watching a man urinate in their alleyway a nod perhaps to Italian neorealism Later the same man returns to relieve himself but this time Ki woo s college friend Min hyuk Park Seo joon defends their garbage area with thrown bottled water Both projections of liquid the water and retaliatory pee are subjected to slo mo transforming narrative into spectacle Ki woo is unemployed So are his parents and older sister To pay the rent they fold pizza boxes they copy the woman on the pizzeria s website This repetitious task may look mundane proletarian and unsexy but there are people with fetishes and these fetishists with a predilection for androgynous looking women who convert cardboard into boxes are voyeurs too The Kims don t use Microsoft cell phones but if they did the Lumia would run Windows an apt description of what Jeffries sees from his vantage point open windows which run in diametrical opposition to his rear window Mulvery recognized that the photographer with a leg cast was a peeping tom Jeffries ogles a woman he identifies as Miss Torso Georgine Darcy who does calisthenics in what looks like a proto sports bar The moviegoer identifies with Jeffries the moviegoer also likes to look at women in various states of undress in the dark The male gaze as she coined it because of wireless streaming no longer in filmic circumstances is no longer confined to a theater seat the female image went mobile and saw light The woman who is good at making pizza boxes has no control over her own image Min hyuk tutors the girl of a very rich family Ki woo s old high school buddy needs a replacement somebody he can trust while the English speaking student attends college abroad in America To get the plum job Ki woo can t show that he s overawed by his luxurious surroundings At the Park family s domain he has to be Ki woo in italics an actor a cool customer Yeon gyo Cho Yeo jeong the girl s mother insists on observing Ki woo conduct her daughter s first and potentially last college preparatory session When Da hye Jung Ji so errs on a practice test question the tutor grabs this rich girl s wrist with two stern fingers and reprimands her for lacking confidence which in effect levels the playing field for Ki woo by being the man made out chutzpah not money Ki jeong Park So dam Ki woo s sister hired as an art therapy teacher for Da song Jung Hyun joo the Parks young son is even bolder she banishes the micro managing mother from the room Yeon gyo would never guess that this pair of young adults live in the ghetto If she knew how disparate the socioeconomic gap between both families were both Ki woo and Ki jeong would probably be fired on the spot Along with the meditation on voyeurism Parasite shares with Rear Window the depiction of class consciousness Although Lisa Fremont Grace Kelly a Manhattan socialite gives L B Jeffries an inferiority complex this strained relationship withstands the photographer s emasculation because the female fashion tastemaker a seeming first lady of haute couture believes that there can t be much difference between people and the way they live In Parasite however it s not just class consciousness it s class warfare since money matters to both the Park and Kim family alike Park Dong ik Lee Sun kyun an information technology firm CEO talks repeatedly about lines that the help can t cross The chauffeur Ki taek Song Kang ho Ki woo s father overhears Dong ik telling his wife that he smells an odor which could be more metaphoric than literal In Parasite all the compromises to fit in are made by the Kims whereas in Rear Window it s Lisa who has to change slumming she does as exemplified by being interested in the book Beyond the High Himalayas for the sake of the fragile male ego She has to remake herself in L B Jeffries image of an ideal woman That s not how the world works anymore All the splendor in this rich family s house turns the Kims into parasites The window at the Park residence looks like a movie screen too and this window is in the backyard a rear window Nothing but green grass a perfect lawn with tastefully chosen plants and flowers at its borders But then after the Park family comes home from a camping trip ruined by rain Da song pitches an Indian tent transforming the performative soundstage into a western Now there is a genre film waiting to happen a western just like how Rear Window turns into film noir when he realizes the machinations of Lars Thorwald The point of view shots in the Hitchcock film all come from Jeffries perspective the audience never sees L B from Thorwald s vantage point In other words Hitchcock doesn t employ the shot countershot when Thorwald understands that somebody is watching his every move Joon ho on the other hand shows the Park house interior not as a POV shot but as a reverse shot an omniscient one in which only the real audience not a diegetic audience of one sees the melee between the Kims and Moon gwang Lee Jung eun the former housekeeper and Geun sae Park Myung hoon her husband who lives in a bunker secreted away within the house Although Moon gwang and her imprisoned husband share the same class status as the Kim family the ex housekeeper who once doted on the house s famous architect judges not just her former employers but the help staff as well for being philistines Moon gwang narrates a flashback scene in which we see herself and Geun sae not just inhabiting the place like riff raff but experiencing the living room as aesthetes With a great sense of nostalgia and loss in her voice Moon gwang describes the sunlight when it hits the glass the reflection then casts a lovely glow upon the entire house It s coded talk for celluloid A reminiscence that is starkly contrasted to the mis en scene in which the aesthetes and philistines fight over incriminating digital footage on Moon gwang s cell phone You can watch Rear Window on a cell phone Ki taek tells his son You know what kind of plan never fails No plan at all Because life cannot be planned Lisa goes off script Stella Thelma Ritter L B s housekeeper tries to stop her after they discover no evidence to support foul play when they dig up the courtyard flower bed She climbs the exterior staircase to Lars Thornwald s apartment Lisa crosses the line echoing Dong ik s words but in an extra diegetic sense as she

results in the conviction of Lars Thornwald Conversely in Parasite the lay of the lawn is sandwiched between a rear window and quite pointedly rear bushes where Ki taek and his boss hide dressed as Indians for Da song s birthday party Unlike L B Jeffries his cross generational counterpart Ki taek despite being positioned as a voyeur among voyeurs his wife and children never was the spectator because the relationship between spectator and subject is a fluid one always interchangeable the two positions Technology transformed the world into a movie screen The Park family is an aggregate of Lisa but unlike the clotheshorse Dong ik the IT CEO especially believes that there is a difference in how people eat talk drink laugh and wear clothes In the chauffeured car Dong ik sits in the rear

10 March 2020,About class boundaries and human division,Ever since his first film director Bong Joon ho has been interested in class divide And nowhere is this more apparent and poignant than in Parasite where a low class family of four down on their luck infiltrate an upper class household each posing as a separate helper One is a tutor to their daughter another a driver and so forth And that alone would be plenty entertaining and fascinating Each of the four members of the Kim family are a fully realized character brimming with personality hopes and aspirations Sure what they re doing is questionable and even immoral but the film is told from their point of view and you can t really hate them for trying to reach for those stars It s not like they re hurting anyone Initially But then the story takes a turn and suddenly it s deadly serious fiercely intense and full of high stakes and suspense Before that twist Parasite was already a great film but afterwards it became a masterpiece It also helps that Bong is a splendid director Each scene each shot is measured beautiful and poignant The whole film look amazing but I especially enjoyed the scenes where heavy rain is falling Such an impactful scene For the rich it s just a night of rain drumming their roof Kind of relaxing actually They don t have to worry about it But for the poor it s a night of nightmares floods and loss For them it s the end of their lives as they knew it Parasite earned it s Best Picture Oscar and I m so glad that the Academy is finally acknowledging these foreign films It s a film full of heavy themes brilliant acting moments and enough content to keep you wondering for weeks Heavily recommended,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5540937/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2019,Hidden in the Shadows,The comparison of the poor Kim family to parasites is not clear from the beginning Their underground apartment does stink and yes bad enough they have to look at a drunken guy pee in front of them during dinner No job no hope no direction the bland and quiet acceptance of their status quo at the beginning makes me wonder how they resonate with the film title However step by step through perfect acting schemes the well thought out ploys they make a dream of living off of the Parks come true thereby transforming themselves into parasites Throughout the period when they enjoy the improving living standards from eating in the dungeon to a treat dinner with the drivers to the actual pizzas whose boxes they were making to earn bread and butter etc All this time I struggle with the heartbreaking fact that at least three parties 1 the Parks 2 the previous driver 3 the previous maid were all innocently suffering from the Kims wrongdoing The lack of apologetic thinking is absolutely horrifying Yet when the class difference is so drastic I am not sure whether they are too be judged After all what other options do they have without a morally sound means to access anything else other than their smelly dungeon It only became more intense when the previous maid showed her true parasitic self together with her husband Money is an almighty iron that straightens out all wrinkles on the surface yes but it is exactly this dangerous monotonic pursuit of money and money only that has cost three families their chance to make peace with what is given People with money are always nice It sounds almost absurd and I can think of millions of counterexamples yet the director sets the story up exactly this way in the film I think I dare thinking outside of the film context it is rather that the people who do not have money sometimes cannot afford to be nice Either way when the cutoff of wealth is base line subsistence it is clear that dignity is at risk What is the dad s plan It sounds like a family who are so good at planning scenes to act out in fact have not a clue about planning long term for their lives Is planning also out of reach for a lot of the poor It turns a bit positive when the boy sets himself a goal to one day make enough money to buy that mansion but is that enough Or is it rather another episode of self deceiving wishful thinking only,9.0,5.0,8.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5279365/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2020,A Black Comedy That Takes a Sinister Turn,Parasite Overall a very enjoyable movie This started out a black comedy and by the end morphed into something more sinister We were shown a close knit nuclear family scraping by to survive in a slum type basement dwelling They were all universally hard working inventive and inspired to get on in life however it was inferred by the script that these attributes were not enough for any social mobility and that any advancement within Korean society was wholly dependent on the possession of family money from the outset The Director introduced several themes and ideas that he tossed around never quite landing on any definitive conclusion We the viewers were the mouse and the Director the cat It did strangely have the feel of an Almodovar movie perhaps this style was an influence Lastly the obvious intention by the Director to infer wealthy people are parasites due to wealthy inequality was handled badly as it is these very wealthy people that provide currently any wages or opportunity for the poor The real parasite is the Korean government who collect the taxes and make the laws and have clearly failed to create welfare structures or free education to promote a better society and social mobility What would happen if all the wealthy people left and there was no tax receipts and communism has certainly not proved the answer What was good The family bonds were well established they were all in this together This very much held the movie together This was very much a simple linear story and most refreshing in its delivery There was for the first two thirds of the movie great dramatic impetus we were all gripped and I could certainly feel quite an atmosphere in the picture house The acting seemed competent from the entire ensemble but it was difficult to judge due to the barrier of the subtitles The subtitles were nuanced and comprehensive and seemed entirely natural The cinematography was great and the camera made us feel very much the fly on the wall and very in keeping with this kind of story The musical score was great What was problematic The Director inferred that wealth and opportunity were the way forward and a wholesome aspiration for advancement for the family but then went onto infer wealth corrupts and perhaps the mere possession of wealth was obscene this is muddled thinking as it cannot be both as the same time It was inferred that wealth isolates and anaesthetises you from the realities of other people lives but the script so over simplified this observation it became irrelevant We had insufficient character separation they are were just voices of the Director It was inferred that oppression leads to revolution I agree but the family were not oppressed at the moment or indeed previously they were on the way up so revolution and this instigation for a bloodbath was flimsy I enjoyed this movie it lost its way in the last half hour and arrived at little redemption or conclusion It really had little to say on the human condition however it s great strength lay in its inventive comedy With regard to awards I would nominate it for best foreign language movie and give the award to Pain Glory by Almodovar,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5434845/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,Why the adulation?,To beat Scorsese Mendes Tarantino and Philips AND to beat The Irishman Once upon a time 1917 et al I really was expecting this to be something special I saw it with an afternoon audience who were mostly in their twilight years and the majority of comments at the end expressed puzzlement that this was the best picture of 2019 Lack of laughter during the performance implied that the film missed its mark as a comedy Perhaps its role as a satirical social commentary of the gulf between the poor and the rich in South Korea might have been hitting targets but surely that would only be appreciated by a minority audience Personally I felt that Ho had been given a box set of Ealing comedies made by the likes of Alexander Mackendrick Charles Crichton Robert Hamer and Henry Cornelius and simply transferred the tone to a South Korean environment Of course the influence of Hollywood s wild man Quentin Tarantino had to appear in order to appeal to a modern audience and of course it is there in the second half I can only imagine that nowadays the voters at Cannes and the Academy are made up of people too young to remember films such as Kind Hearts and Coronets Whisky Galore The Lavender Hill Mob and Hue and Cry Otherwise they would have realised that what is being exhibited is not new and different but is a retread of old classics I ve watched ho s The Host and Snowpiercer and can t help but feel that he has potential but is not the maestro some usually sensible film critics claim For one thing he needs to tighten up the pace of his storylines and keep to a central theme without going off at a tangent There is also a whiff of patronisation here which implies that everyone in the industry were surprised that a South Korean could come up with a global hit The moneymen are surely thinking that this is not a breakout hit for Ho but a breakin hit into a lucrative South East Asian market Would it be the same hit if it had not been awarded Best Picture I doubt it very much,4.0,8.0,36.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476486/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2020,A comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains,Writer director Bong Joon Ho The Host Snowpiercer Okja has been on a roll of late with thought provoking genre films with underlying social commentary From river monsters to end of the world tales to a pig like Totoro Bong is not afraid to take seemingly popcorn concepts and work them into a smart film that has arthouse and movieplex crossover appeal With Parasite he takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected wifi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley side windows When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother hiding that she s his sister and lying about her credentials as well Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening To tell more would spoil the fun but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker What s most interesting about the film is asking the question who really is the parasite Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants The answer is that it could be either or most likely both Bong s thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course much as it happened in his prior film Snowpiercer Bong sums it up best himself when he was described Parasite as a comedy without clowns a tragedy without villains If I had a complaint about the film it s that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film s message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have nots Parasite is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience meaning that it s a story that could not have been told in any other medium and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5684874/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2020,Oscar worthy.,Parasite South Korean review A lot has already been said debated and critiqued about this film which wowed not just the jury at the Cannes but also walked away with four Oscars this year including Best Picture the first non English film to do so As for my take on it two scenes stayed with me long after the movie ended One is the Kim family relaxing in their employers the Parks mansion after they go on a picnic The Parks are unaware that the driver housekeeper tutor and translator they hired are all one family the Kims having cunningly manipulated them to seek employment Talking about the scene Father Kim remarks that their madam is a nice lady Rich yet Nice To which his wife corrects him saying She s nice because she s rich In yet another amazingly conceived scene the Park couple is now lying incidentally on the same drawing room sofa and Mr Park observes how driver Kim is a well behaved guy who doesn t cross his limit yet he hates his stink He smells like an old rag In those two scenes writer director Bong Joon Ho makes a solid statement on class divide which may not be seemingly apparent but exists and thrives universally at mind set level Parasite is a highly relatable drama blending comedy in to serious situations culminating in to a cracker of a bloodied climax Infact it won t be an exaggeration to say that it explores myriad human relationships like no other film and leaves you wondering at the end who exactly is the parasite here Watch it online on Amazon Prime The film has English subtitles Regards Sumeet Nadkarni,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5603596/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2020,Classism exists. Period.,It s a beautiful film but it says nothing about class struggles and upward mobility that hasn t already been covered I say this from a Western perspective so I cannot speak to how the film was felt in South Korea But as a Black American I was bored I think the film s resonation with White American audiences speaks to this point even more It won the Oscar because it is a criticism of Korea not of America We sit at a safe distance and revel in the bravery of the film because it allows us to ignore our own flaws It is by no means a bad film Just not a particularly interesting one,5.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5737629/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2020,That everyone goes wild for this shows America's quality of movies,Great watch could watch again and can recommend if you re okay with subtitles What in the world Why was everyone SO HYPED about this Yes its good but its not even Get Out good We follow an awful family of financial parasites the movie should have been called Parasites much more apt and while I didn t necessarily see the twists coming they were so natural that they weren t surprises so much as they were just things that made sense I don t think Americans are able to gauge good quality of entertainment see any reality tv show While this is good it shouldn t have taken America by storm like it did This should be a bar for movies to reach and honestly it shouldn t be so hard to get on the same level as this movie we just lack originality and substance over explosions and punching The main thing that makes this movie good is that there are no heroes from the very beginning it is established that the protagonists are awful but those with and those without and it doesn t seem to matter how you get what you get as long as you get it And while Americans are going to go wild relating to wronging their peers to get by the focus is on take from the rich so a crude lens is going to justify their actions when its still legally and morally wrong but there is a capitalistic mindset that just sees the survival and the gains as a win This movie has some depth and substance to it that you don t normally see from America and this is one that is worth the read,8.0,0.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5817218/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,Outstanding Film,First off what an achievement the Academy don t like to budge easily in their traditional ways so being the first non English speaking best picture winner is extremely impressive Very well deserved too The film itself is fascinating I ve never watched something that dips into so many genres it manages them all brilliantly in its own chaotic way I especially enjoyed the thrilling dramatic moments and the humour The family had both my sympathy and my frustration they were dreadful throughout most of the film but you could argue only as a product of the world they find themselves living in The film dives deep into the extreme ends of society and it is fascinating viewing how they collide Highlights include when Mr Park complains of the smell showing his true colours despite him being nice enough externally Special mention to Mrs Park who s naivety and obliviousness was very believable The ending was excellent and I somehow found myself rooting for the family once again Overall a true masterpiece Don t be put off by the subtitles,9.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6512091/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,ONE HELL OF A FAMILY,Parasite 2019 is a brilliantly executed cinema experience with an auteur level direction by Bong Joon ho With a terrific performance and engaging storytelling Parasite is a film about common people with their painstaking effort to survive in the current social climate A wonderfully crafted screenplay with its unnerving twist and turns defies my moviegoing experience But some choices made in this film personally affected me and saddened my heart,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7696245/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2020,sooo bad that it is good?,Parasite is a rare movie the kind of movie that compels one to sit and admire the hype around it the film maker had faith in the audience s stupidity levels to appreciate whatever garbage he felt like throwing in the movie I saw this movie back in October 2019 much before its hype and while the first half of the movie is intriguing it takes a downward spiral after that with its foolish plot Spoilers mix of cliche indigestible scenarios e g infiltrator family becomes uncannily cunning and smart as they take up one job after the other a man staying in the basement for years unnoticed infiltrator family s overboard feast while the owners are away and guess what home owners return right at the moment who could have predicted that the people living in the basement using morse codes via a light bulb for looong messages but the owners never bothering to fix the light bulb and then there is the climax scene with killings purely weird unbelievable and nonsensical While overall the movie is ok esp in the first half but it definitely doesn t deserve the attention that its getting This is explained in director s interview where he says he spent 2 3 years on writing the first half and the second half and especially the climax he wrote in 2 3 months as if he was possessed high IMO Such an attention is a disgrace to the other good movies out there over all these years that never got nominated won an oscar Its a dark joke on other movies,2.0,7.0,17.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5495226/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2021,VERY METAPHORICAL AMAZING FILM,This film is great It is good at what it tried to be The performances are good but a bit overreacted in my opinion that s the only drawback this film has The shots camera work is phenomenal The directing is great and the storyline is perfect This is a film where the second time you watch it the better it gets There are so many themes in this film and objects that are placed on purpose to convey a message This film is manly about crossing boundaries and the status difference from these two families Smell also plays a big role in this film Smell is a way that the rich family differs from the poor family The rich family see them as parasites Great film not overhyped and a entertaining watch,9.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6780481/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2023,It's a film unlike any other,I hadn t seen this since it was released and I am amazed how I didn t remember the ending correctly and that the plan hadn t quite worked out It s a film about a lot of things but a simplistic description is that it s about a family of poverty one by one overtaking the lives and home of a family of wealth hence the title It s a film about class structure greed selfishness criminality liars the spoiled love envy and more It s part comedy drama sci fi thriller horror and as implausible as hell but the ride is great fun It s brilliantly constructed by Bong Joon Ho with a flawless cast It s beautifully shot and it is historic due to it being the first foreign language film to win a best picture Oscar This is a highly original and wonderful film but I m not so sure that Oscar didn t belong to 1917 another brilliant piece of filmmaking,9.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9091948/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2020,Very interesting movie,A very different film Parasite is one of those movies that you ll probably not watch again Once you ve seen it there is really no need for further viewings It s not entertaining enough It has some pretty good twists but there not like twists in Us Sixth Sense or Book of Eli where on second viewing things make so much more sense It s more of a twist like in the first Saw The movie is also a little slow The first half is funny though and it s always very intriguing Good acting great cinematography and a good ending I understand all the hype the movie has and I think it s a good movie but in my opinion it s not phenomenal,7.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5463501/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2021,"deep, complicated, all in one",I liked this movie for being very deep and complicated in story while not being so much unclear It just explains us realistic and possible real life complicated situations Emotional funny realistic serious religious moral teaching but negative Also interesting insight into Korean culture and behavior The only thing that makes this movie bad is that it is too negative and especially negative ending Teaches us about instability of life greed desperation survival crime Worth an oscar at least because of its depth or because of seriousness of topics or lessons Not good to watch for those sensitive to scary and difficult realistic situations like getting hurt imprisoned etc,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6437714/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,Brilliant !!!,NOW THAT S A MOVIE Everything from the opening to the closing was quite the spectacle This is a modern day masterpiece Masterful Cinematography Bong s a genius when it comes to building up tension in this film Everything from color grading angles and mise en scene were done with intention providing a treasure trove of symbolisms that draw up a larger social commentary about the state of poverty in Korea The best part of this film was its ability to bend genres serving up comedy and drama so naturally,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5718039/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2023,This film surprised me,SCORE 10 10 Nothing really could have prepared me for what was going to happen in this film The more I watched the more the story unraveled itself and the more invested I became It s one thing to use gimmicks and cliche elements to heighten the suspense of what is going on but the way the story is told provides that suspense alone I was in fear of my own life when the Kims were in danger of being caught The acting performances all around were amazing and it was really easy to get sucked into the world of the story was being told even though it was in a different language That really surprised me It is very common for a movie title to be telling of the story being told but this was especially the perfect choice Parasite An organism that lives in or on an organism of another species its host and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other s expense One by one each of the family members from the Kim Family were able to infiltrate the house of the Park Family and secure full time positions by sabotaging the people who previously occupied their roles It was genius well thought out and went off without blemish As their plot unfolds the characters start to experience adversity and unexpected surprises none more unexpected than finding the previous housekeeper s husband in a secret underground passage way under the house That was insane The ending was chaotic and perfectly fit the tone of the movie Although it may have been slightly predictable that the father snuck back underground after the incident I love how they used the Morse Code light to help his son discover his whereabouts Ki woo and Ki teak have a profound discussion about plans and how the best plan is no plan because if you make a plan it never works out that way I thought it was ironic as Ki woo ends up putting a plan in place to be able to buy the house after getting his life together in order for the Kim family to reunite and live together once again minus Ki jung who tragically passes away This movie was spectacular,10.0,0.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8948022/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,It is just OK,I can understand there are a lot of people who really enjoyed the movie It has good pace there s a lot of tension and some unexpected twists But honestly I cannot understand why so many people think this movie is a masterpiece despite it flaws And it has many flaws unfortunetly most of them are in the story itself For me they spoiled the movie I was asking myself questions almost from the beginning of the story Why a smart young good looking english speaking guy cannot find at least decent job How his sister without experience or art psychological education manages to conduct tutoring to the boy with whom as his mother said couldn t stand any art teacher First lesson we can see even the boy bowing to Jessica did she hipnotize him or smth How she knew about trauma the boy had The fathee could drive modern expensive car without proper experience or training They were poor so he does not drive at all and as he said his only experience with merces cars were during short work as a parking worker How he could play experienced driver How it is possible a woman without proper experience knows how to run modern house and how to behave as a housekeeper for a rich family And how she could prepare a dish she did not even knew the name of in just 8 minutes while being drunk and in a kinda hostage situation There is a scene with the Da Song sitting in a tipi writing the message of HELP that the husband of the former housekeeper is sending with morse cose via the lamp The movie never addresses that later Why the boy did not inform parents about that And why nobody cared about strange behavior of a lamp and strange patterns of the flashing light How it is possible the rich family did not know about a dungeon under their house and a man kept ther for 4 years There are just some of the questions I had Main two ones are why a family of so resourceful inteligent and determined people live in a basement in a poorest of districts With their talents they should be or on the top or in prison Second ending suggests we should sympatize with a father and his son I have no idea how we can do that they cheated murdered and caused some innecent people to lose their jobs and reputation honestly there were no people in the movie I would like or had any sympathy for,7.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5489294/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2020,Peach of a movie,Movie night with Iris Korean Cannes Oscar doesn t disappoint Bong showing himself to be a cinematic master Parasite doesn t quite take place in our universe but nor is it a fantasy world This is the ugliness of class conflict shown bare The parasites are every character in this film rich leeching off the poor who in turn retaliate by attaching themselves to the underbelly of their rulers Much of the story isn t told in words but in the utilisation of space and the way people occupy it The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame perched awkwardly on furniture so they can all fit Whereas the Parks always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame The narrative will literally take you into uncharted territory with a fantastic conclusion Brilliant movie,9.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5938110/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,"Technically perfect, but the plot is weak",Went and saw the film in a theater after it was re released because of the Oscar win And like many reviewers here I am baffled as to why this movie garnered so many accolades from Cannes to Hollywood It is brilliantly filmed and well acted but when it comes to its script I can think of many more efficient more subtle less simplistic movies tackling class warfare with the purpose of entertainment Indeed Italian comedies of the 1960s and 70s were masters in that field and they did it with fearless gusto caustic laughs perverse subtlety and no artificial twists like in Parasite I can watch over and over Bread And Chocolate 1974 with Nino Mandredi or any Ettore Scola movie of the same period try Ugly Dirty and Bad 1976 for great fun I don t think i will remember Parasite in 3 days,5.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5498626/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2020,Clever and amusing but...,This was a clever and amusing dark comedy until it went way too dark and kooky about two thirds of the way into the film The first two thirds of the movie very enjoyable if somewhat of a clich view of the social classes in South Korea It was much more disparaging of a low class family though It portrayed them lazy slovenly dishonest amateur con artists waiting for their next victim It was funny if you don t take it seriously I wonder if the director actually wanted you to believe he is saying that this is a depiction of a typical lower class family in South Korea His portrayal of the upper class family was also clich if a bit more muted and of course overly simplistic The horror slasher ending segment seemed like a completely separate movie I think it was totally unnecessary and thrown in for shock value only I understand that the characters and the plot around the dungeon husband and his enabling wife was also added on to the story s a weird twist The twist of their predicament was amusing if not pretty far over the top I suppose was a hint of the really crazy stuff yet to come It really went downhill for me when they tied up the couple throwing the former housekeeper down the stairs It looked like she was dead And then it really started to go off the rails when the Parasite son went into the dungeon with the rock to do what Kill the couple in the dungeon Come on From there on it was bloody ridiculous It just seems to me that the director was just not satisfied with making a fun dark comedy and had to add a silly teen slasher segment for shock value Best picture It certainly was not a great year for quality movies but there were other films that were overall better than this,7.0,4.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5478971/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,An excellent film of three halves,We came late to the Parasite party watching it a year after the brouhahah and it does live up to the hype Despite the universal praise the film received I was somehow reluctant to watch it but I am very glad I bit the bullet the film was satisfying informative funny sad and beautifully made It s a film of three halves part Roma part French comedy of errors part Shakespearean tragedy The Roma elements introduced us to Korean culture which was a refreshing insight to lifestyles I knew nothing about The comedy of errors elements are genuinely funny and very well scripted with sass and wit and portrayed and directed with excellent timing The tragedy is shocking but never out of kilter with the rest of the film I ll say no more in case of spoilers suffice to say it somewhat vindicated my earlier reluctance to watch the film but I am extremely glad I overcame that reluctance It is a 10 star film given 9 because realistically I doubt I will watch it again even though it is an excellent film,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6825793/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2020,"Silly Script, Silly Message",A low class jobless loser family unexpectedly turns out to be a bunch of devilishly refined intriguers who invade like parasites an innocent high class family Many irrealistic turns The end is both pathetic and ridiculous The script is both psychologically and socially inane What a shame that Kim Ki Duk the great Korean director has never won an Oscar and this patchwork has All the high class characters are just humane and all the low class ones are corrupt I m very surprised reading in reviews and criticisms that this film was leftist or critical about capitalism and inequality in any way It wasn t The message is the old high class commonplace that wealth makes you noble and poverty ignoble No question about whether creating such inequalities wealth and poverty systematically was noble or ignoble It s just natural condition y know that s life a great struggle with winners and losers The happy end of the film is that one of the parasites finally decides to make money so everything will be solved I m afraid that this message was the reason why the brave new winner people loved this movie so much and also why they have all misunderstand it,3.0,3.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5582733/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,"Afterall, what is the parasite?",First of all all this opinions are personal and can only be applicable to this especific movie From now on I will open my mind how I perceived the movie and how it touched me not necessarily being a universal truth So read it with open heart Photography of the movie is brilliant as well as the story line unfolding Before jumping into what I think is crucial I just want to remark some romanticized false assumptions employed in this movie Life it is just not like that 1 rich people is happier than the least well off 2 richness comes out of nowhere so those people can party all the time 3 every mechanism is valid to get poorness behind such as scams or tricks In the other hand I wanted to remark some authentic premises 1 Yes Richness is loneliness 2 Yes too much money destroy relationship between people Capital is a relationship solvent 3 Yes scarcity does not allow people to reach their potentials 4 No not all poor man is willing to dedicate himself to honest work and therefore avoids the burden it brings as challenges 5 Yes people established in life do rely on strange arguments as long as they converge to the goumetization of life style 6 Yes all people want to feel special somehow special 7 Yes simplicity is key for happiness Some thoughts on the characters 1 One family represents scarcity first two levels of Maslow s pyramid what caught my attention was that despite of being poor they were not dumb The boy could have being a genius of design the girl a successful artist Instead they deliberately opted for schemes and dishonesty They laugh virtually all the time validating each other s mish mashes They struggle together and they are happy to share meals together Poorness in the movies is always romanticized put in a box where everything is excusable To me what defines poorness is not the lack of resources or money it is thinking the whole life by half This means understanding how the world works what are the underlying rules and how to fit on the scene 2 The other family represents richness the top layer of Maslow s pyramid They went beyond the average Abundance excess distance amidst family members the need to seek everything specially tailor mad for them what I call GoT gourmetization of things consumerism Have you notice how few lines between these characters are there Compare the number of lines among poor family members vs rich family members Maybe God lives in what is common collective Sometimes I there is a natural intrinsic trend to attribute to richness what is often there Let us see why To provide to the family the father is almost always away It is not shown on the movie although I assure you he has many many problems to tackle on a daily basis Being rich does not happen by accident it is more like being placed on the top of a pyramid of marbles As the time goes by if one is not careful the marbles start to spread all over the place It takes a lot of effort to put them organized again The mother is trying to protect the kids with the weapon she has Daughter and son seldom touched their parents There is a hidden cost on the mentioned topics The cost of absence which is never depicted in movies 3 The housekeeper it is a symbol of order She manages to close some family gaps Always attentive she keep the ball rolling with excellence Of course later on the movie we realize she is also interested on serving because of a personal condition 4 The man on the basement could be seen as ghost and glory Ghost because of subconscious issues we might carry in life Glory because he live with little and even though is respectful to those who brings him subsistence 5 The children might be seen as the ones suffering the consequences of social contrast On one side the overwatch and undercaress Remember the boy receiving the walkie talkie Might be the concrete symbol of father son distance on the other side the being close to their parents whoa re incapable of showing a constructive trail Some other core elements on the story line 1 The smell it is a way to show arrogant and pedant rich might be One of the reasons why the driver stabs the father of a family 2 The special club for VIPs demonstrates how fragile are the rich family taking decision on shallow perceptions Being subject to any kind of narrative 3 The houses represent contrast 4 The stone symbolizes superstition something that will not make dreams come true Also when analyzed the scene on which the boy is stoned it denotes the tragedy of poor how it can come back to those who bet chips at it The wrong way 5 The booze a psychological help to make rich life bearable 6 The party more than being the stage of gore violence it is a stage where one rich family demonstrates its power id est status ego vanity to other ones 7 The knives the killings with knives give a more personal and physical aspect to the attacks something the guns cannot emphasize It was necessary to the characters to drown their own hands on the victims and provoke the blood shed In conclusion at a first level of reflection the parasite is the poor family invading the house by applying weapons are sensible to On a more deep analysis and I do not even know if the director intended to do so that is the beauty of any kind of art I think the parasite is the alienation the way people stop seeing other as human beings This the major common fact orbiting each and every character It allows the social shock to occur it allows the contrast to become laughable it allows greed to flourish it allows precocious endings and loss of opportunities,9.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5509423/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,Brilliant,Another rewatch and this time it s another Bong Joon Ho incredible work The first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living This wouldn t work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script The second half was where the themes became apparently clear The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society Through the conversations we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes and how fed up one can feel The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle which made the script even more masterful Overall arguably Bong Joon Ho s best work 9 5 10,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7140820/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2023,Entertaining and shocking twists,Parasite stands as a cinematic tour de force a film that transcends genres and defies easy categorization Bong Joon ho s directorial brilliance is on full display in this Korean masterpiece a compelling and thought provoking exploration of class divisions that seamlessly weaves together dark humor suspense and social commentary From the opening scenes it captivates with its meticulous attention to detail and visual storytelling The cinematography by Hong Kyung pyo is nothing short of breathtaking capturing the stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the opulent luxury of the Park residence Each frame is a visual feast contributing to the film s immersive experience The narrative unfolds with a gripping precision as the Kim family struggling in the lower echelons of society cunningly infiltrates the lives of the wealthy Park family The plot twists and turns with a surprising and relentless momentum keeping the audience on the edge of their seats Bong Joon ho s screenplay is a work of art seamlessly blending elements of comedy drama and thriller into a cohesive and engaging story Central to the film s success are the stellar performances from the cast Song Kang ho leads with a nuanced portrayal of the patriarch Kim Ki taek navigating the complexities of his character with finesse The entire ensemble including Choi Woo shik Park So dam and Lee Sun kyun deliver performances that breathe life into their multifaceted roles creating a palpable on screen chemistry The movie is more than just a suspenseful thriller it s a profound commentary on societal inequality Bong Joon ho skillfully uses the Kim family s strategic infiltration of the Park household as a lens through which to examine the stark contrasts between the haves and the have nots The film prompts viewers to reflect on the systemic issues of class disparity and the lengths individuals may go to escape the constraints of poverty Beyond its social commentary it also explores the universality of human desires and the consequences of unchecked ambition The characters while navigating their respective socio economic challenges grapple with themes of morality identity and the pursuit of a better life In conclusion this is a cinematic triumph a film that not only entertains but also challenges and provokes thought Bong Joon ho s masterful direction coupled with outstanding performances and a richly layered narrative makes it a standout in contemporary cinema This Korean gem deserves every accolade it has received marking a pivotal moment in the global recognition of the richness and depth of Korean filmmaking,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9424838/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2020,Everyone already knew that rich people are stupid. Why make a whole movie just about this?,I think it was a film director who said that fiction is asked to make sense when reality often doesn t This film must be very real because it is absolutely senseless Where does the parasite family get the fancy clothes and the cultured and educated ways Where do they learn from one day to the next to behave like refined people How do they foresee the reactions of the parasite victims to the millimeter and not fail in their plan Wait by the way where does the plan come from The plan is never created never plotted simply the sister takes off her panties by the way a hundred dollar panties in the car and everything is already organized and everyone agrees That s nonsense to me There is only one thread which must have seemed interesting to the writer which is the smell but then nobody pulls that thread and it gets lost Everyone already knew that rich people are stupid Why make a whole movie just about this It reminds me of those movies from the 1940s where the woman protagonist to fool someone only had to dress in men s clothes hide her hair and put on a false moustache I think that globally people s credulity is at an all time low and all those who consider it a masterpiece should start reviewing Cantinflas filmography They would find several films in it with themes very similar to this one,2.0,6.0,31.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5427983/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2020,An incredible movie with one of the best plot twist ever realized,I was very hyped about this movie since the trailer was released I did not know what to expect The story is brilliant and I never once felt bored the more I was going on with the movie the more I was intrigued by it and I wanted to know what would happen in the next scene Character development is amazing every character has his own personality they have their own psychological profile and you can immediately bound with them because they look humans Kim a young boy part of a poor and unprivileged family one day receive a job offer from his friend to work as a private English tutor for the daughter of a rich korean family The guy that starts to earn a lot of money will then involves his family in order to earn even more money and be without debts The entire family manage will work for them In order to obtain that they will use illegal strategies These strategies are so well conceived by the movie that even me felt tricked at a certain point The cast did an amazing job by being so expressive a good performance that for sure helped to win the so earned Palme D Or to Cannes Festival Parasite is a movie that will put you on front a of different moral dilemmas and sometimes you don t really know which side to take For sure one of the best movies of the year Make yourself a favor and watch it is really worth it,8.0,0.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5376359/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,"Unconvincing, over the top, and overly-political",I lost interest in this film as soon as the poor downtrodden family who I assume the audience is supposed to feel sorry for I didn t they were criminals suddenly became criminal masterminds and were able to outwit the rich pompous bad guys rich family The plot wasn t remotely believable In fact it was laughable see above Overall the film was mildly entertaining and certainly different but the plot was entirely predictable unconvincing and overly political In the end I found myself actually rooting for the rich family The poor family were bad people Being poor does not excuse immoral behavior They demonstrated little to no remorse for their actions and them being poor didn t change my perception of their wrongdoings They were con men They lied cheated and conned their way into temporary luxury and in the end it all predictably backfired I didn t care for any of the main characters and whatever political message this film was trying to convey it s important to remember being wealthy in and of itself doesn t make you a bad person and being poor doesn t give you a free pass to do bad things,3.0,105.0,269.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5064119/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2020,"OK, cinematic and suspense but not really entertaining",My impressions are following It is quite dragged Despite being curious about how everything is gonna end we had to stop and watch the last 30ish minutes of the movie the next day I was not sleepy just fed up with watching it The major flaw in the plot as I see it is that 4 extremely capable and adaptable people are living in an basement starving and struggling to survive Another thing is that the husband of the first housekeeper would have died starving in the bunker without even attempting to go out and get himself some food despite the fact he was not locked in if his wife had not showed up after many days to check up on him finding him all weak and hungry And how did Chung sook manage to clear all the mess so that the Parks did not notice anything if not when they arrived then when they woke up in the morning The movie has quite a suspenseful plot nicely done but asides from that it is just not entertaining enough And here I found myself divided on one side really wanting to see what is going to happen and on the other side just dying from boredom because despite of all of the happenings it is simply just not entertaining As for the cinematography I liked the movie It is nicely filmed nothing spectacular but fitting and suitable to the plot I especially liked the flood scene when Ki jeong is sitting on the toilet that was hyper realistic and remarkable Altogether okayish I would give it a 7 star rating,7.0,6.0,18.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5479438/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,Keeps you on the edge,I had no expectations before watching Parasite it s truly one of the best films of 2019 My love and affection for this film is just like every other great movies I ve watched The film also takes a dig at meritocracy the humor in the film is quite outstanding Kang Ho Song has played his played his character with near perfection and the narration is just as good All in all this is just a masterpiece,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5581810/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2020,One of the best movies of recent times,It says it on the trailer you expect this movie to be one thing but it turns out to be something else This film shows an excessive amount of multilayered symbolism and all the ideologies portrayed in the film mainly revolved around the central idea of class distinction At first glance the theme may seem quite simple but then you start to understand the true nature of the film The film is filled with finesse in terms of direction Every little thing has a meaning behind it and all the credit goes to the director Bon joon ho for depicting things so beautifully The title parasite suggest how a parasite in the film underclassmen devours the host But the movie shows how even in something so nether there are feelings and emotions present The part where the blood falls onto the pale bread is a masterpiece in my opinion as it perfectly summarizes the movie and it has such depth of meaning behind it I was trying not to give away too much and that is the reason the review seems quite awkward but honestly i do not words to describe Bon Joon ho s depth of thought and make sure you add this film in your watch list right now,9.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5510692/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2022,Incredible,The narrative of this film is so unique The first act may seem slow but then the narrative develops in a very original and believable way the script does not just develop a few things everything has a convincing explanation The film deals with issues of contempt for different social classes and since the upper social class is not at all interested in the problems of others they only live in their bubble while the world falls apart this is portrayed in a crude and realistic way by showing different representations of this The character development is extensive the acting is good the editing is good and the third act is very shocking and unexpected It deserves all the awards it won it is a very good film that is worthwhile and has a lot of quality with a well executed original concept it manages to captivate the public s attention all the time,10.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8056274/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2019,Incredible Slow Burning Thriller and a Social Satire From Joon-ho Bong,Parasite is a film that is so well crafted so well told and original that I was left thinking non stop about it for days Parasite is a film that you should know as little as possible about before watching as it weaves such an interesting and compelling narrative that will have you hooked in minutes It is occasionally funny often tense sometimes shocking and always interesting Within ten minutes of watching the film I figured out that this would be a slow burning film where the tension rises until everything comes to ahead and it did not disappoint The film isn t shot in a flashy stylish way but it is still beautiful to look at and is shot superbly and subtly The acting is good across the board with all the main cast getting moments to shine The characters are all well thought out and three dimensional all having their own desires and motives Parasite also has a strong social commentary to make that I wont discuss for spoilers sake but is not heavy handed and is slightly present at the beginning before it hits you hard towards the end This film is so close to perfect but is let down by its ending If the film had left the ending more ambiguous and finished 5 10 minutes earlier I would have given Parasite a ten After seeing the film there is no question on why it won the Palme d Or at Cannes and is one of the best films of 2019 by far,9.0,6.0,24.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4989324/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2020,The self-portrait you think you watched was actually a gorilla,Just saw it blown away like everyone else As I walked out the theater door I started reading the film reviews that I d been avoiding in order to dodge spoilers I was met with yet another shock Instead of finding others peeling their jaws off the pavement at the miracle of Bong s ingenious and politically powerful satire of a satire film all the reviews seem to stop at ground level maybe half basement run down 1960s Seoul apartment level you ll understand that if you ve seen the film and they never cross the line to descend into the full on hidden underground BUNKER level of what Bong is doing with this film I m reading review after review all authored by viewers smug that they were sharp enough to deduce the film s subtle commentary on economic inequality and the evils of consumerism WHAT Idiots That commentary was NOT subtle It was obvious to the point of being ridiculous Bong has made fools of you although I don t think that was his ultimate intention He made use of the satire genre to throw fresh light on another subject and it s a subject that has been overdone by everyone especially westerners in the arts in international politics in every possible aspect It s that whole pesky North South thing that all 77 million KOREANS north and south have to deal with In support of this there are dozens of scenes worth citing But the most glaringly obvious one is crazy little DaSong s backyard overnight during a brutal rainstorm He s in a mini teepee he s obsessed w US indians who are used as code for americans throughout the film w his floodlight walkie talkie His parents are sitting on the couch in their grand living room watching his antics through the huge window that frames their backyard like a big screen TV Dad Do you think that tent will keep the storm out Mom We had it made by americans so we should be fine I m sorry that backyard IS the DMZ with its floodlights and speakers The kid is the crossing line between N and S Korea During the brutal murder scene the climax of the film the guest tables for the party are laid out like combat lines around the DMZ teepeet that was made in america so we ll be safe And the whole scene the b day party when Park Sr is instructing Driver Kim both wearing american native headdresses on the role he is supposed to play in the fight scene they re staging around the teepee never has an actual Native American man been cast to play a Hollywood role where he looked more like an american stereotype than Kang Ho Song did in the scene where the camera paused on his sad irate face in that ridiculous headdress Kang Ho Song s character represents THE AVERAGE KOREAN not north not south that has succeeded living through the last 600 yrs of Korean history At the end of the film he s a KOREAN who just needs to walk up the stairs or cross the DMZ line into the world South Koreans are making for themselves now that they re economically capable of buying the national house I swear I could write a 300 pg thesis on this film but I ll just leave it at this since Bong won the Oscars N Korea s dear leader Kim Jung weasel has used the film as propaganda supporting the idea that South Koreans have been forced into capitalism by americans and would really prefer to be like supposedly less consumerist N Koreans There s therefore an EXCELLENT chance that at least some form of the film will be widely viewed in North Korea And Bong is hoping that North Koreans will unlike western reviewers be smart enough to deduce the REAL content of his message Fave very telling quotes Brilliant That s a gorilla isn t it It s supposed to be a self portrait pause Oh yeah of course it is Opening my eyes for the first time in a month I saw a detective who looked nothing like a detective Then the doctor who looked nothing like a doctor spoke Clue in fools this film is NOTHING that it appears to be to the average internet keyboard warrior reviewer who thinks he s smart enough to have decoded Bong s anti capitalist message AND R Brody s attempt a review in the NY Times is particularly pathetic and misguided Just sad,10.0,4.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5477462/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,Terrific Satire on Social Classes,I am not typically one for being big on foreign films however given the notoriety of it winning big picture and all it could not be ignored And for good reason this was simply just great movie making It has so many elements such as comedy drama and hold your breath suspense And a very original story While watching my wife stated this almost seems like a much better version of Jordan Peele s Us which I would agree with I feel like both movies try to deliver the same message though Parasite is far superior in doing so This was satire at its finest as the film looks at two very different families one being rich and the other being poor These two social classes will clash but just as you think to have it all figured out a huge wrench is thrown into the plot and it goes from crazy to ludicrous The tension is huge throughout because you don t even know who you re cheering for There s no defined bad guys or good guys all have their qualities you commend but also flaws Every character is beautifully acted as well Not at any time was I bored The characters and story lock your attention up while you wait in anticipation on how this whole wild situation will turn out,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6114269/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2020,"Well made and acted, but...",generally interesting if you bookend the acts and scenes Interesting that it s coming as a series as it seemed more suited for such As if there was more to see which would make it more compelling I ve had that recently where a meh or neutral film would make a better series For instance the whole process of the poor family getting themselves jobs took up too much time for a movie Although they re introduced quickly and likeable I didn t get the full sense if they were just struggling or were grifters My guess is grifters But I shouldn t be guessing Tell me The second half when the former maid shows up felt very manufactured Why d they let her in The underground bunker was original but how we got there was more trying to write itself out of a corner Both would have worked in a series though The maid turning the tables on them was fine once you were in the underground space but arriving there was forced Then the rich family returning was a bit much Plausible but a bit much When the maid is kicked down the steps I thought she was dead from the head wound So it was odd when the poor husband said Thank God when he checked if she was breathing after seeing the blood on the back of her head Conversely being that she was bleeding but still breathing he didn t take it seriously enough The element of the rich father saying the poor father smelled like radishes was a set up for the ending but it wasn t enough When it came I didn t buy it The sex scene between the rich couple was awkward and unnecessary I did see the motivation of the underground man attacking the poor family But like I said before I didn t see why the poor father would attack the rich man And it was obvious where he went afterwards Not sure why the mother and the son were prosecuted as I didn t see any direct evidence against them The underground was still unknown to the police Confused if the rich man died The father s morse code attempts were very awkward much less the son seeing them A big stretch In the end it was very well made but whatever the message was muddled Clearly suggested classism but only touched on it at best I ve seen Bong Joon Ho s Snowpiercer his segment in Tokyo The Host Memories of Murder and Mother Surprised there was so many when I looked him up Thought about the same of those well done but not seeing the hype,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5541011/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2022,How'd this turkey win an Oscar?,Long before Parasite ended I had to grit my teeth to hang on till the finish I had diagnosed Bong Joon ho with ADHD The film is like a random collage of different ways to approach the story slapstick hard hitting social commentary mystery comedy of manners tear jerker or thriller There s a lot of good acting but the psychological climate keeps changing before you can start to feel any connection with a character s situation It reminded me of Thai movies 50 years ago where every production had to cover all the bases romance crime thrilling chases and lots of hilarious well meant meant to be hilarious comic relief This wasn t as much fun At the end I had no interest in what lay wait for the characters after the finale but I was very happy I only rented the film,0.0,5.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8701835/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2023,a masterpiece,Parasite a masterclass in storytelling and social commentary is a cinematic gem that deserves its place among the best Its strengths are plentiful from its razor sharp acting particularly the standout performances by Song Kang ho and the ensemble cast to its impeccable cinematography that seamlessly blends humor and tension The film s hauntingly captivating score and visually stunning scenes add depth to its narrative While it may have a few moments that could be perceived as slow Parasite s brilliance lies in its exploration of class divide and human nature making it a thought provoking and utterly compelling cinematic experience that merits its 8 10 rating,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9330820/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2020,I think a bit of virtue signalling has surfaced here...,Please stop with all this best film ever made rubbish No one can see your profile you re anonymous it s pointless It s not bad I have no idea how well its acted as I can t speak Korean And I m guessing neither can most here They could be hammy as heck for all I know It s quite original and certainly well scripted It s also a little far fetched Well a lot actually Listen it is good Is it gonna make you rethink world cinema ridiculous term Not if it was never on your radar,7.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5493808/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2020,Twofer--sort of,Parasite is certainly not boring and the cinematography is exquisite Is it a masterpiece I am not convinced The work is multigeneric with the first half bearing nearly no resemblance to the second half I suspect that those who found the first half appealing would be albeit surprised not necessarily pleased by the second half On the other hand people who found the first half to be too slow and perhaps even boring may have loved the action packed second half I see the influence of Tarantino in part 2 and the Cohen brothers throughout which I have been noticing more and more in recent films Good but not great given loose ends and dubious stereotypes and nonsequiturs Great films are perfect with everything fitting together so that nothing can be removed without making it worse This creation in contrast is more sensationalist While it is surprising and no one could guess the ending from the beginning that is mainly because of the shock effect of scenes such as the sewers spilling out all over during a torrential rainstorm And of course the complete switch to an entire different genre,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6362437/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2021,Just a masterpiece,This thriller from South Korea shocked the world in 2020 when it became the first non English language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture The plot of the film is also one where you wouldn t necessarily think it would appeal to the Academy a poor family of four living in the underground struggles to survive When the son gets the opportunity to work for a very wealthy family their situation suddenly turns around As a result events turn upside down Contrary to other mainstream films in which the main supporting scheme is usually clearly followed through in Parasite the entire cast shines at the same high level All of them act in absolute top form and give their so different characters that certain something If you had to pick a stand out it would be Kim Ki taek as the father of the poor family His performance is subtle and funny for long stretches but once he comes out of his shell he impresses with a lot of wisdom and unpredictability But the real hero of the film is director Bong Joon Ho Known in his home country for years as a borderline brilliant filmmaker he has given Parasite an aura that few could replicate Not only is the ensemble of actors spot on but everything else from the stirring music to the beautiful set designs and well chosen dialogue he has done everything right with this film Parasite s success should never have come as a big surprise Bong Joon Ho s masterpiece is one of the most complete films of recent years Especially the fact that the film initially resembles a comedy and only then lives up to its actual genre of thriller is a unique approach In parallel there is also the influence of other genres such as drama mystery and even some action It remains to mention the social criticism that Parasite tries to communicate over its entire 134 minutes The class differences in South Korea are portrayed very well Sometimes discreetly but mostly transparently and very clearly This is especially thought provoking when you watch the film repeatedly and become more aware of this fact Wonderfully acted grandiose direction and many genres colliding Parasite is perfect and rightly the best film of 2020,10.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6450139/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,Like a detailed mini series rolled into one movie,I have watched Parasite twice and still have to watch it again to get into how deep and detailed this masterpiece is This movie got me looking into Korean cinema and what a country of rich story tellers and new styles in film making Distrust of wealth and authority What we brutally see is a lifestyle that relies upon hired help tutors a chauffeur and most importantly a devoted housekeeper A family who works for the wealthy family decide to move in as if this home where there own For me Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed and impeccably photographed generic mutations Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co writer Han Jin won s multitonal script it s a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul,9.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8561932/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2020,A society metaphor,This is a film you either love or despise due to its portrayal of social desperation If you don t like this film you may have missed many artistic cinematographic aspects related to the whole story and the subliminal messages within it about an unfair elitist society It can be considered a grotesque film that keeps you watching and expectant of the unexpected till the end which is so thrilling because it combines the sublime with horror at the same time As Nolan implied in Inception one more time we come across with a film that incite us to be chasers not of dreams but of our own reality in this case at any cost,9.0,4.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5491964/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,A fully deserving Oscar winner,In all honesty I d been putting this off for quite a while After watching it I can see exactly why it won so many awards The entire film is a fantastic view of the class divide The symbolism used throughout is amazing The comedy is perfectly timed and the tension that is built in certain scenes spoiler free is some of the best I ve seen This film has made me visit the back catalogue of Bong Joon Ho and with the exception of Snowpiecer 2013 I have not been disappointed Overall if you are a film fan then you NEED to watch this and the rest of his films,9.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6684678/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2020,Overrated,Besides the storyline all other aspects in this movie including actings cinematography are good but for all the hype I thought it has a clever storyline but its not the development of the story depends on one silly mistake which for me a sign of a weak plot How could the whole family which could not even fold the pizza boxes properly could suddenly be shown as so good in what they do And if they are really that good how come they could not get proper jobs at other places all these while And does the movie tries to tell us how selfish the rich people are and we should be emphatic to the poor I did not get that at all its just a simple message that if you re a bad person you re a bad person no matter whether you re rich or poor because its so obvious kim s family are greedy selfish immoral people too,5.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5744982/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,Its Everything,Movies have always had a certain point of perspective or a certain ressemblance but not Parasite Its like nothing else before its not only a comedy its also a horror drama and a thriller with a great message behind it The acting is good i feel but of course i cant tell perfectly because i dont understand Korean The reason this movie is good is because of its spontaneous and ambiguity Film writters often do films where they answer all the question in your asking yourself about the story But in those case you watch the movie and you dont really think about it afterwards because often those answer are boring or too simple But in this case the film is good because it dives into something relatively ordinary but always make you wonder if there is something more to it The way the events occur are nothing like any other movie It has a marvelous ending with full of sense I really like the way the director portrays the simple emotions of life and the class of society If you are open to new ideas and new way of looking at a story you may like Parasite,10.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8162727/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,Brilliant for bother the thinkers and those that simply want to be entertained,Parasite has received rave reviews it appears that no one is willing to say anything against it I thought it was fantastically enjoyable if you want to just simply follow the plot full of tension and fully fledged characters There is also an entire other layer that one can see the film through though so this appeases the thinking crowd too I must admit that I thought the second layer was not always clear about what it was trying to say However it is clearly one of those films which is MEANT to raise more questions than it does answers and that is fine though can be frustrating for some Ultimately it is one of those films that is difficult to mark down from a technical or artisitic or even entertainment standpoint However it has to be said that it is not hugely emotionally affecting And this is not necessary a fault But in my opinion for a film to be 10 10 despite its technical brilliance has to be emotionally affecting and really make you feel something and teach you more about yourself and other humans around you Parasite doesn t quite do this which stops it form being in my list of favourite films But I fully respect it is an excellent movie entertainment and also an excellent film art,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7539596/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2021,Very good satire,One of the best scenarios in recent years Very smart full of symbolism and links The first half of the film was perfect for me as they infiltrated a funny and rounded story The quality drops a bit in the second half of the film when the genre and tone change The very end of the film was also not the end to the end and when it ended I had no sense of delight I think it is a great satire and a critical society the division between the layers exists and is quite pronounced today it is not possible to move from one layer to another there is a big difference between them It is said with us A full does not believe a hungry man,8.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6439673/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2019,Easy to Understand,The movie is simple in the fact that people like to move up the ladder Seems removed from our lives yet things start spiralling out of control their lives seem not so different from our own daily lives After some reflection relatable Who are the parasites in this society Is it us Or them Or aren t we all living our lives in a cacoon may it be a luxurious mansio or a rundown flat We are no better those next to us and they to us,10.0,16.0,32.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5039180/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,Simple,Sincerely I found it like a slice of life thing with some humor and at the end some drama Nothing more I think that this movie is mainly psychological not proper a thriller Anyway it can be a good movie to watch but not the best The actors are good much better than those ones that you can see in Korean TV shows personally I find them pretty awkward and acting exaggerated The soundtrack can be appreciate This movie is about the difference between poor and rich In particular the struggling of poor people to live I can t get why it is so appreciate and famous maybe is me that I didn t get the hidden message or something I think that I have to search on internet some information about it,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6049499/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2022,"darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic.",The latest film for Snowpiercer director Bong Joon ho Parasite might very well be his best film to date Parasite is a thought provoking film that s part dark comedy part family drama and part thriller It s not really a singular genre film but all these elements complement each other to deliver a surprisingly intense and shocking cinematic experience Meet the Kim family a down on their luck destitute family of four Living in an impoverished basement in a South Korean slum they are forced to glum off of other people s WiFi networks and take menial side jobs folding pizza boxes to bring in a pittance of money The family s eldest son Ki woo Choi failed to make it into university but what he lacks in book smarts he makes up for in street smarts He s a natural con artist with the gift of gab An opportunity soon falls into Ki woo s lap in the form of a job recommendation His best friend Min Park Seo joon is traveling abroad and wants Ki woo to take over tutoring one of his well to do teen students Park Da hye Jung Min Hyuk has a romantic interest in the high school sophomore Da Hye and wants Ki woo to watch over her and keep away potential suitors while he s abroad Min Hyuk s master plan is to start dating Da hye when she enters university Min Hyuk s trust in a scam artist like Ki woo is probably the biggest mistake of his life With the help of his sister Ki jung s Park So dam exceptional forgery skills Ki woo is easily able to maneuver himself into the rich well to do Park household as the new English tutor for Da hye Da hye s mother Mrs Park Jo Yeo jeong is a flighty snooty simp She makes for an easy mark for the Kim family to assert themselves into the lives of the Park homestead After Ki woo hatches a master plan he s able to manipulate Ki jung into the Park home as the art tutor for the Park s youngest child Da song Jung Hyun joon Next up the kids trick the Park family patriarch Lee Sun kyun to fire his driver and hire their dad Ki taek Song Kang ho After that it s the family housekeeper Moon gwang Lee Jeong eun who gets ousted and replaced by the Kim kids mother Chung sook Jang Hye jin However Ki woo s carefully layered plan is nothing more than a house of cards and a dark secret within the Park household threatens to shatter the Kim s ticket to money and luxury Parasite is a brilliantly shot movie It s very much a product of its country of origin As a result its style is both unique and refreshing when compared to Hollywood films It s darkly comedic but it s not exactly an irreverent comedy At other times the film is darkly tragic and surprisingly poignant The lengths to which the Kim family goes to con and manipulate the Park family are both shocking and at times borderline detestable The one thing that keeps the Kim family from being outright unlikable is their true familial bond The Kim family is comprised of down and out scoundrels and yet they still love respect and appreciate each other Meanwhile the white collar Park family members are self absorbed obsessed with their status image and wealth and they appear to lack genuine love for one another If anything it appears that their wealth and status have made them soft and gullible The Parks look down at others of a lower social standing It s evident that while material wealth might bring certain comforts and convenience it doesn t bring true love or happiness This is a remarkable film about the rich vs The poor and the dynamics therein While the Parks are generally the protagonists of the story they are not good people One imagines if Ki woo who comes off as quite brilliant would likely be better served investing his talents into more legitimate pursuits His sister Ki jung is equally brilliant and a gifted graphic artist It s bizarre that these two couldn t apply themselves in school or make it into university Perhaps that s either a flaw in the storytelling or commentary on the South Korean academic system The performances of the main cast are impeccable Song Kang ho as Kim Ki taek really steals the show with some surprisingly dramatic and bittersweet moments While Ki woo is the basic protagonist of Parasite Ki taek is the heart and soul of the movie The second and third acts feature plot twists that are both surprising and shockingly satisfying They are twists the audience will not see coming but they make complete and total sense Those are the best kind of cinematic gotcha moments Bong Joon ho and cinematographer Hong Kyung pyo construct some beautiful imagery The film is wonderfully shot The shots are very straightforward crisp and clear yet contain all sorts of compelling imagery The third act also features some quick surprising shocking bits of violence and gore that are rather Tarantino esque Parasite pulls no punches in terms of its visuals and narratives While many are throwing around the word masterpiece for this film it might be premature to call it that Bong Joon ho has created something with Parasite that s darkly humorous compelling dramatic poignant and bittersweet all at the same time Parasite is a true cinematic experience that will leave the audience with a lot to chew on during the ride home,10.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7873082/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,Intelligent and Extraordinary,Parasite will go down in history as one of the best comedy and international films of the century The film stars Korean celebrated actor Song Kang ho as Kim taek the head of a poor deprived Korean family living in a basement with his wife and two children The film tells the story of a poor family living in a basement without access to basic utilities The head of the family is Mr Kim He wants the best for the family But he cant afford the cost of university education for his intelligent son Kevin and brilliant daughter Jessica Min is a friend of Kevin He also wants the best for his friend He recommended Kevin to take his place as a tutor Kevin became the personal tutor of Da hye the daughter of a wealthy businessman Kevin was able to grab this life changing opportunity First he brought in Jessica as an art teacher The two worked intelligently and perfectly by bringing in their dad and mum as driver and househelp respectively But nothing is so perfect in this world What would happen it comes to knowledge that they are related as family The film is set in suburbs and high class residential area in a typical Korean city This gives it the affluence versus poverty touch that underlines the theme of the film The script was suspenseful and full of excitement The performance of Song Kang Ho was spectucular He blended emotions with intelligence Directing wise individual performances raised the bar Everyone knew what they were doing and delivered with aplomb The quality of the film s video editing gave it a polishing and glossing visual impressions However I was not impressed with the films dialogue It did less than enough to convey the theme of the film to its audience Paraite is going to be a film you would not quit watching It is emotional and funny No matter how hard life maybe there will always be a time to laugh And if you want to laugh very well then I recommend this film for you,9.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5512743/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2020,A film that defies simple categorization,When Parasite won the Academy Award for Best Picture it made the headlines as the first non English language film to do so That doubtless gained it a wider Western audience it might otherwise it had but then that is precisely what it deserves Parasite is every bit as good as all its accolades suggest Directed by Bong Joon ho who co wrote the screenplay with Han Jin won the film s story follows the Kim family who live in a tiny semi basement apartment They are grindingly poor and in an early scene they leave their small window open when the street is fumigated to get free extermination They seek to change their fortunes when an unexpected opportunity arises and Ki woo fraudulently gets a job as a tutor with the wealthy Park family He and his family then deviously orchestrate a series of situations whereby each member of the Kim family gets a job with the Parks a goal they ve achieved about halfway through the film At which point a bizarre twist completely changes the direction of the plot It s very funny with lashings of biting wit in the first half There s a hilariously cringe worthy scene if Da hye asks Ki woo if he fancies Jessica secretly his sister whilst Ki jung s means of getting the Parks driver fired so that she can recommend her dad for the job is priceless It s enormously satisfying watching the family s ingenious schemes unfold they are horribly devious getting the driver fired for supposedly having sex in the car and leading Yeon gyo to believe that Moon gwang has tuberculosis In the second half it becomes increasingly slapstick as the Kims are forced to hide in the Parks living room whilst Dong ik discusses Mr Kim s smell and then starts having sex with his wife on the sofa and when they return to their semi basement apartment to discover it has been flooded with sewer water As it becomes more slapstick it also becomes increasingly dark and macabre and the bloody climax at the party partly filmed in slow motion is as shocking as it is unexpected Bong handles the film s transition from one thing to another with remarkable ease resulting in a superbly well crafted film It s brilliantly shot by cinematographer Hong Kyung pyo and the sets are lit in such a way that they never look like sets whilst Jung Jae il s elegant and occasionally unsettling soundtrack constantly underpins and emphasises the story s shifting mood The cast probably unknown to most Western audiences is uniformly excellent especially Song Kang ho as Kim Ki taek park So dam and Kim Ki jung and Cho Yeo jeong as Choi Yeon gyo Much has been written about Parasite as a satire on social injustice and Bong has stated that the title refers to both families the Kims because they infiltrate the house and the Parks because as a rich family they leech off society But in spite of that the film defies simple categorization and its message isn t clear cut Interestingly the Park family are portrayed as nice people there s a conversation amongst the Kims where they attribute this to the Parks having money the implication being that the only reason that the Kims turn to crime is because they are poor At the same time however the Kims self justification is undermined when they suddenly ponder the fate of the driver they have displaced whilst Chung sook s unsympathetic treatment of Moon gwang and Geun sae is the catalyst for the subsequent carnage that leaves none of the families unscathed Ultimately Bong doesn t provide a clear cut message about inequality and injustice but instead presents a cast of flawed characters and leaves the audience to form its own opinions on their actions and the consequences of these Much of the publicity surrounding Parasite might lead audiences to expect a Korean equivalent of an angry Mike Leigh or Ken Loach kitchen sink drama but it isn t anything of the sort It s some more complicated less easy to define and highly idiosyncratic and it most assuredly deserves to be seen,10.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5862927/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,It's not as a good movie as it seems,The whole point of this movie is that there is a crazy guy in the basement and he has to come out to kill everyone like some sort of reverse Frankenstein plot Don t tell me about symbolism or the more deep core messages in this movie when everyone in it is a damn CARICATURE with each person filling the stereotypical roles like the dumb rich housewife so that only one thing can develop and that is the story There is no part of the film where we see any real in depth look at poverty coming from the mouths of the characters only their superficial actions which lay against a strict blueprint to propel the story forward to the climax which is the crazy guy coming out and killing everybody So let s talk about the story it s literally an infiltration movie similar to heist movies like Ocean s 11 with much better cinematography And this is where I give the movie an okay rating because of the cinematography and overall directing which was done pretty well Otherwise I don t see how people are raving that this is such a good movie have they been hoodwinked by the fact that we ve seen this all before with less stereotypical ways of depicting class struggles and character,6.0,3.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5488255/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2023,"The Tale of the ""Parasite...""",Bong Joon ho s magnum opus Parasite is an extraordinary film that defies easy categorization It is a complex and multi layered exploration of class capitalism and the human condition The film s title Parasite refers to the characters who are seen as opportunistic and manipulative but the film s true focus is on the interwoven lives of two families from different social classes and the psychological and political differences between them We follow the Kim family living in squalor and poverty in a cramped basement apartment They see an opportunity when their son Ki woo is hired as a tutor for their contrast the wealthy Park family s daughter The Kims quickly begin to insinuate themselves into the lives of the Parks with each family member taking on a role in the household But as their schemes and manipulations become increasingly complicated their facade begins to crumble leading to a stunning and incredibly violent conclusion as if this was a Greek tragedy One of the most striking aspects of Parasite is Joon Ho s ability to seamlessly blend different genres incorporating elements of comedy thriller and social commentary Bong Joon ho s masterful direction is evident in almost every aspect of the film from the carefully crafted script to the expertly choreographed action sequences The film s characters are complex and fully realized with each member of the Kim family possessing their own distinct personality and motivations Through its exploration of class dynamics and using socialist ideas and politics Parasite asks difficult questions about the nature of privilege and inequality in our contemporary society The film is particularly effective in highlighting the ways in which the wealthy exploit the labor of the poor with the Parks relying on the Kims for a variety of household tasks from cooking to driving The cinematography of Parasite is particularly noteworthy with each shot carefully composed to convey the psychological states of the characters The contrast between the cramped and dingy Kim apartment and the pristine modern Park home serves as a powerful metaphor for the social and economic divides between the two families The film s use of light and shadow is also masterful with the Kim family often depicted in darkness while the Parks are bathed in bright natural light which shows the thematic contrast between them even more The performances in Parasite are all uniformly excellent with each actor bringing nuance and complexity to their roles Song Kang ho is particularly memorable as the Kim family patriarch struggling to keep his family afloat in the face of overwhelming economic hardship Meanwhile Park So dam delivers a standout performance as the cunning and resourceful Kim daughter constantly manipulating those around her to achieve her goals Ultimately Parasite is a film that defies easy categorization blending elements of comedy thriller and social commentary to create a powerful and thought provoking cinematic experience Its exploration of class dynamics is both timely and timeless and its characters are complex and fully realized Bong Joon ho s masterful direction and the film s outstanding performances make Parasite a must see for anyone interested in cinema that challenges and inspires and one of the greatest films of this decade,8.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8962530/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2020,A great example of how we can never have enough.,Parasite follows the story of the impecunious Kim family and how the prejudice of greed and class threatens their newly formed relationship with the Park family In many ways Parasite starts more like a comedy a rather typical film that some may even describe as normal but it is in the second quarter when after the Kim family and Park family have become acquainted that the movie begins to live up to its title Parasite The film was developed in such a beautiful manner that throughout the entire film I found myself constantly guessing what will happen next but I was always happy to be wrong When I think of Parasite I think of the sheer variety within its themes and how calling it a Thriller Comedy does not do it justice Whether it was the unsettling tune that played at the weirdest of times or the thought behind every shot the entire movie had me convinced that it was going to be like nothing else Parasite leaves us with a rather uneasy feeling not because the film was not enjoyable but because of the way it makes us question everything I believe there is a message that comes out of Parasite and my take on it is that The act of falling is a lot worse when we fail to enjoy the summit So If you re looking for a film that does many things wonderfully different and will leave you with a constant thought in your mind then maybe Parasite is what you should watch next,9.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6077237/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2019,a film that has already grown on me since watching it hours ago,Bong joon ho is clearly a talented director from everything i have seen from him he has a key eye for slowly drawing you into the plot and keeping you at the edge of your seat i also loved how the story played with your expectations for characters in the film this film was the first in a long while that made me legitimately feel nervouse for the characters being discovered i won t spoil it but you will know what i mean when u see the film for yourself the only complants i had would be a few scenes went on a bit too long and i kept misleading myself into thinking it was going to end sooner then it did but i imagine on my second watch these issues won t be a big deal to me i mean this film has already been creeping into my thoughts since seeing it hours earlier i m not sure if this film is a 8 or 9 or how the film holds up to the directors previous works but this film is worth your attention please if your sick of the hollywood garbage that is turned out in your local cinema please look for a cinema that s playing parasite it s worth your time and i feel it might be my favourite movie that s come out this year so get hyped and check it out and if your new to the director check out his previous movies the host and especially mother are some of his best but parasite is up there with them check it out,9.0,7.0,26.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4963917/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,Absolutely deserves the Oscar,Normally I m not much into Korean entertainment The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG So I didn t know what to expect when I begun watching this film I saw it with a blank slate with no preformed opinion whatsoever The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan and that too is made by Bong Joon Ho I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this The Kim family is in a desparate need of money and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family s house He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house Things don t go too well for the Kim family as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family To hide this they fight and accidentally kill her and it s at that very moment the Park family comes back nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape Later at Dae Woo s birthday the cook s husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki Jung The family is completely separated with Ki Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook s husband was hiding The only part about this film I don t like is when Ki Taek kills Mr Park There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki Taek had no more control over his emotions but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning or if Mr Park hated Ki Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell Nothing justifies his this act But other than that I liked everything about this movie the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke the acting the dialogues the story most of all everything is phenomenal Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is Although it s for a mature audience I won t mind showing it to someone who hasn t watched it already It s a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come,9.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6831857/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2020,Further proof that many people let media types tell them what's good.,Once again I find myself questioning 3 things 1 the entertainment industry s media machine which seems to be growing further and further away from the people 2 the willingness of an army of sheep to fall into line and 3 the veracity of many online reviews The caustic social commentary is irksome and tired i e hardscrabble noble poor struggle to survive while self indulgent rich people tread on them This has been covered in literature and film countless times and often better than this In this case the poor family are with the exception of the daughter listless and dim not at all sympathetic The fact they ruin the lives of two people who actually do their jobs is forgivable apparently In contrast the unlikable rich are in fact a clever entrepreneur and his wife who though not smart dotes on her children and wants nothing but the best for them Not sure why the somehow deserve to be exploited by a family of indolent grifters And apparently the father s distaste for poor grooming is deserving of homicide Great In any case the movie is predictable except where it introduces deus ex machina plot contrivances The finale is idiotic The father is desperate to drive his kid to hospital The car keys are under a dead man s body While attempting to move the body he notices that the man has body odor and pauses to in a particularly demonstrative fashion hold his nose and roll his eyes Riiiight Throw in a little bit of tastelessness really if you find a pair of panties do you immediately sniff them and you ve got the makings of a rather tedious and somewhat offensive 2 hours of mediocre movie making,5.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5611024/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,Funny and intense at the Same Time,Parasite is one of those movies where it gets you excited in the first half then just tears you apart in the second It s either a hit or miss for this style of film making but Parasite did it perfectly The best part is how it surprises you in such an unexpected way that it makes you depressed The ending is insane and when you thought it couldn t get any crazier it got crazier At the beginning the plot was about a poor family who would slowly integrate each other into a rich family s household by use of manipulation I love the original plot it was clever and original It also brought in a lot of dark comedy and excitement The second half is completely different it was about the poor family trying to keep their secret from the rich family The second half brought in the intensity after a pretty relaxing first half Because of such a drastic change in themes and moods it feels like a roller coaster full of emotions Very few movies were able to make me laugh and smile to just sadness and intensity in just 10 minutes The pacing was also a really big contributor to playing with your emotions It s very slow in the first half then it speeds up extremely quickly in the second All of these techniques were specifically done to play with your emotions and it s done so well The acting was great everyone gave a very solid performance No one did an Oscar worthy performance but there was no need for it Parasite focuses on real life emotions and how people would actually react in such circumstances Kang ho Song gave the best performance in my opinion as he brought so much melancholy to Ki Taek Mr Kim Overall everyone had a great performance that was realistic and funny The biggest reason why Parasite won so many Oscars was because of how well shot this movie is The cinematography is very slow and since the set is primarily in a lifeless house everything is very depressing The directing is also very well done Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in South Korea if not the best He truly deserves his awards as he puts all of his talents into Parasite I love and hate Parasite but I don t hate Parasite in a bad way It really plays with your emotions in a crazy way Everything in this movie was done to simply toy with your emotions the pacing and mood changes were so effective And in a modern cinema where adapting screenplay is more common than not Parasite will go down in history,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5783050/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2023,Well-made is a word for this.,For me Bong Joon Ho s movies were clearly not my type before because I thought they were too boring I had to quit while I m watching all those his movies except Snowpiercer Anyway since I was in theatre and I have never left a theatre before and also was thinking that I have never gonna watch this movie again so I fought against my desire to leave That was my best movie related choice of that year Even though first half was little boring as similar as other works of his maybe too loose But as the scene goes by tremendously natural looking visual effects plots and details were getting so tight and natural concentration level of myself was also increased I felt the mise en sc ne of every scenes were highly calculated and there were some scenes that doesn t fit the standard rules of ratio or direction and arrangement but even those things that supposed to look like mistakes were pretty That was the moment that I felt the director is so talented Parasite was an opportunity to make me able to think watch and feel a movie in a different perspective So even though Bong Joon Ho s works are not my type of movies I was highly inspired by this one,8.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9275066/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,Thrilling,I just finished watching Parasite Ir was phenomenal It s story had me hooked from the start hype from others helped in keeping me tied in the first 30 minutes too haha But nonetheless my heart was beating at certain points and my eyes were burning from staring at the screen so intensely I wasn t wearing my red blocking glasses I love the way it started without much detail and ended in the same place it began I LOVE full circle movies The movies theme lit a fire under me It was bouncing many places with my emotions but it ultimately made me appreciate growing up with little in certain facets of my life By no means did I live like this fictional family did But I can relate The director did a PROFOUND job on it Seriously What a thrilling movie,9.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6837047/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2021,Smart comedy,Parasite is a smart highly entertaining black comedy and it s good to see a good film getting some recognition for once However I feel like all the people who praised it as an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of all times must have been watched Transformers and Avengers all their life The film itself is solid in most aspects but conceptually I don t buy the cheap social critique and easy populism that one more time depicts the rich as spoiled dumb and not worthy of their wealth Perfect food for the envious middle class that dreams of living in big houses driving expensive cars Retrospectively the last season has been full of this kind of us vs Them films and while Parasite might actually be the only one to be any good it s not thanks to its message Actually it would have been alright if the movie ended with the party scene without all that subsequent melodramatic crap to glorify the working class who lost gain Up to that point both families are almost equally ambiguous with even some interesting reflections on how this generation s weak spot for resonant brand names and exclusivity as even the humblest servant now is supposed to have a resume full of renowned names or belong to elite companies to get a job The vertical depiction of society is also effective in its simplicity with the Parks physically living above everything else but at the same time unable to see what lies beneath due to the high walls and trees that entirely cover the view from their garden The layout of their house also mirrors this verticality with rooms and hallways they are not even aware of An above average film overall but definitely no masterpiece not even Boon Joon ho s best,7.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7264784/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2020,Thought-provoking,There should be such a journey in the course of everyone s life It allows you to calm down and feel yourself and understand life Aunt is not so much a comedy movie as a warm road movie In the tenderness and tenderness Xu Yan described the anxiety and wolf howling in the middle aged man as a last resort and wolfberry in a thermos cup Teacher Huang Meiying who plays her mother is both acting and funny Every move makes people shout It s too subtle The most amazing performance is the part of Yuan Quan After she separated from Xu Yiwan the wife she played was wearing a trench coat and leather shoes striding among a group of exotic faces That was both the liberation and rise of a woman and the best ending of the whole story I really like this adaptation of Little Lady As a kid actually until growing up I was obsessed with why Jo and Laurie were not together Because it s too long apart I can remember very few details except for two places one is Laurie s tassels on Jo s apron and the other is the secret code of their pillows Greta edited the conversation between Jo and the publisher in parallel with Professor Jo Yuzhong giving the director a personal explanation this is the needs of the times and no romance wants the heroine to end with an old rich spinster And I asked my question in a publisher s tone I can t see why she wasn t with her childhood sweetheart I feel like Greta and I have the same confused childhood Well because of this I m willing to give this movie five stars even if it doesn t meet my expectations in a few places Once again I would rather embrace such an open ending I accept that protestanism influenced the interpretation of American novels during that period but I do n t accept whether I went to their puppy love and said that the professor is the most suitable person to his sequel The genius of the film is non linear narrative which distinguishes the past from the present with different hue and light Some transitions were very genius especially the comparison between Beth s first scarlet fever and his last death Jo was also awakened but the right thing was wrong and it really made me cry It struck off the deteriorating section of Beth s body in the book which kept me upset And using intensified continuity editing directly blasted the result like a heavy tear gas bomb also Beth said write for me Amy said Beth is the best of us Through a story it deeply tells the social reality and will make you automatically think of more social reality and make you dissatisfied with all the rich and poor Its ability to arouse empathy and extend the association has been achieved What you and I come into contact with every day in our society and experience every day What this movie does not talk about all broke out through the perception of this movie This is the real power of this movie The film finally leads to a very sad ending In the end fate returned to zero and all changes returned to the original point After getting his father s Morse code Jiyu vowed to make money and then bought the house in an attempt to make his father see him again Of course all this was realized in Jiyu s dream but can it really be realized Not to mention whether it can make enough money even if it is done can Jiyu s father really see the sun again Isn t it a real cage waiting for him Don t forget he is a murderer You will find that the real scary part of this story is why Jiyu s father driver Jin finally killed President Park The social phenomenon of inequality between the rich and the poor has made the poor intolerant but the internal grievances are extremely deep in this psychological and mental state The slightest disrespect of the rich will cause a chain reaction of torrents and tsunami He noticed that the uncle who rushed out of the basement waved his butcher knife towards Kiting and driver Kim after his middle aged uncle fell had nowhere to vent his anger He eventually inserted the knife into President Park However killing President Park can really eliminate his anger Can he reverse his fate I m afraid the answer doesn t need me to tell everyone already knows,8.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5558602/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,A strange mix delivered with style,This is certainly unique It s strong points are excellent central performances from the ensemble cast and some good laughs in the first half It s stylishly done but ultimately it s a tad too silly and has a fairly bitter taste that isn t for me If you like dark comedy though it may be for you,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6199694/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2020,Felt for everyone except the protagonists,Parasite starts out with a rather familiar gritty arthouse vibe Some humor is sprinkled in as Ki woo Choi Woo Shik scans the ceiling and windows for some unprotected or underprotected wi fi to steal as the unemployed family can t afford phone service and they need it to find work Their partially underground dwelling is susceptible to various indignities from drunken pee and bug killing gasses to flood When they do get a gig assembling pizza boxes they can t seem to get it right for some reason Their luck changes when Ki woo s friend Min Seo joon Park passes his tutoring job on to him I little fib and a lot of confidence and the money starts flowing in to the Kim family But then he sees an in for his sister Ki jung So dam Park I suppose simply introducing her as his sister who is legitimately good at art might not have worked so they go for a much bigger lie and paycheck Greed is kicking in with head spinning intensity Before long the family is doing things so atrocious I started borderline hating the film Because its protagonists are so unjustifiably vile To be sure I loved the parasite allegory One gets in starts multiplying eventually severely damaging or destroying the host That last part I was dreading the most Yes I was also dreading what will happen once the scam is discovered But I felt really bad for the mother Yeo jeong Cho who inadvertently brought the infestation into her home She was just trying to do what any mother would what s best for her kids Her only fault she wasn t too bright Of course I could have never anticipated the crazy plot twist that unraveled it all But as the story rolled towards the end in a gut wrenching tangle of victims and perpetrators the host family was treated as if their suffering were at best unimportant at worst funny And they are the ones who did nothing wrong Except for being rich I suppose that automatically makes them villains It was really bothering me But that wasn t the only problem I had with the film It didn t make sense to me how the Kims could come up with and perfectly execute an elaborate scheme when they couldn t even assemble pizza boxes right And if they are this smart how is it possible that even the two young ones can t get work Is Korean economy that bad Another problem was that interesting things were introduced but dropped without explanation Like we never found out why the old housekeeper looked like she had been mugged Or what Ki woo was planning to do with the lucky stone And that wonderful allegory that existed so naturally in the first half of the movie Not completely gone in the second but you have to look for it,6.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5457041/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2021,"Love the plot, the acting, and the script. The ending...",Parasite is a solid movie through and through The Kim s devious no plan to get themselves from their pitiful subterranean hole into a luxurious lifestyle is a unique one Where the comedy comes into this movie is that they never think it through as is their intention but their fumbles don t matter because the Parks are so gullible to begin with Yeo jung Cho s acting gives the best portrayal of anxiety and naivety that allows the audience to understand why the no plan is so successful And it s Kang ho Song s positive and respectful Ki Taek who absolutely steers the family ship that makes the Kim s situation relatable and their deception forgivable I will say that the ending albeit catastrophic did and yet didn t grip me I doubt many feel the way I do about it Maybe because as lovable as the Kims were they were not innocent The good times couldn t last forever No lie of that magnitude survives long And karma came for them horribly While all the events of the finale did grip me in its moral context and its tragic somberness when the film was over the lasting impression wasn t there because I felt the family that played with matches got burned as expected But it s still poetic and still a beautiful film,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6640673/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2019,Korean Gem Among This Year's Film Collection,Being an Asian myself it feels great to see Asian films win the Palme d Or for two consecutive years Parasite has a quite unique style and tempo in telling its story Most spectators while watching the first half of the film might well mistake it for a comedy that depicts life of a bunch of jobless social dregs Well the plot took some drastic turns when the parasite family lodged happily in the mansion of their employer The second half is full of vehement conflicts as if the masks that helped hide the impassable gap between their classes has suddenly disappeared The stench felt by the couple is all too metaphoric Educated and civilized as they are the couple still could not withhold the disdain they held for the lower class in the social hierarchy Clash of different identities finally turned into a catastrophe Impoverished people despite trying every means they are able to get hold of be it wily tricks or honest labor will always feel out of place up high on the social ladder Maybe drinking beers in the damp and dark corner will be a happier ending than to spend life in disguise and despair,8.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5097933/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2022,Up There with the Best,For me one of the greatest cinematic experiences I have ever indulged in It s meticulous in its design effective in its direction and enticing in its writing The struggling Kim family sees an opportunity when the son starts working for the wealthy Park family Soon all of them find a way to work within the same household and start living a parasitic life Their is no arguing against the film s success and quality A starling watch which incorporates societal divide through an imbalanced class system and utilising primitive methods to target the lack of understanding within humankind highlighted in the consequences of rich and poor mixing Ki woo a key figure of poverty in the film is seen to work as a tutor at The Parks home Joon Ho implemented this into his production because unfortunately it is the only way in which families from two extreme ends of the class spectrum in modern day South Korea can cross their paths convincingly in their story arc For non Korean speakers the film is possibly even more exciting its vibrant fast tone compliments the increasingly intimate storyline and allows the unfolding of the subplot to be extra special Setting is used by director Bong Joon Ho to further emphasise the contrasting lifestyles on screen A small open street terrace on a bustling corner of the town centre contrasts greatly to a large gated mansion a home built and designed from scratch solely for the film s purpose Every detail of the blockbuster is well received by its audience mesmerised by every characters every move captivated in what will happen next Ultimately Parasite is a be careful what you wish for message The title itself referenced an infectious agent which some may suggest refers to the Kim family swarming The Park s for work and benefits though is it actually alluding to the diseased poor in civilisation who are made to suffer from the capitalistic greed denying them of jobs education and healthcare The picture is an illustrated masterpiece carefully pioneered to demonstrate serious philosophical subjects in a fantastical manner to convey relevant and important philosophies,10.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8336578/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2021,Go in open minded....,So I went in after seeing 10 10s 5 stars and Oscars awards You know how a celebrity starts a trend and ten years later no one can believe that was fashionable and it actually was horrendous I get that vibe here because the film is so unique and Let s the viewer decipher the plot people are saying this is great because it s thought provoking similar to a tate modern peice of art red splash of paint worth 5 million because the artist is famous Anyway as you can tell I m not that keen on the film but didn t hate it just left confused to the over inflated ratings reviews and awards Go in sceptical and you may far better than me,5.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6804799/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2020,Engrossing and technically flawless if emotionally lacking,I was captivated at just where all this was going and how it was going to resolve it s issues and in the end i marvelled at the technical aspects of the storytelling more than i engaged emotionally with the main protagonists and if a drama is to be successful in my eyes you really have to care about the characters Its not that i didnt care but there were many ideas and subversive elements going on underneath all the drama i felt that it ultimately pulled in too many directions at once to be a masterpiece,8.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6158846/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2020,A new pattern of Korean culture,Now it s the time to stop that longing Parasite was just flashed me through my mind and filled that completion of my waiting Since it was released it was talked it was going for awards and it created a history in Academy Awards I was so far and keen to watch this movie and it veils the curtain now As a movie it is worth watching because I m not used to the socio political aspects of Korean culture The film describes the class variations and social norm dividing people into rich and poor But actually what makes me attractive is that kind comic blending at the beginning by the family to enter into the Park mansion Going smoothly sometimes it provides a little bit tense and frights the film has a steady graph till the end and then it hype accidentally and I feel astonished The mood of the movie changed vice versa and it shook me for some time A very changing pattern of Korean society and Korean classification was the major essence that I can find in the movie,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5512049/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2020,Be A Host for Parasite,The Stream Are you going to complain that this is a foreign language film Okay fine The Big Screen Completely surprising at every turn The Final Bill Enjoy the ride Trip Fontaine Parasite reminded me that there are actually some original ideas out there being made into movies It also reminded me how annoyed I am by all of the sequels and remakes and reboots that have flooded Hollywood and American mainstream movie theaters Directed and co written by Bong Joon Ho who also directed Snowpiercer and Okja both of which are on Netflix Parasite is a South Korean film with English subtitles about well this where reviewing this movie gets difficult because I don t want to spoil anything Um it s about an out of work family who through a series of events find work and surprising things occur There is so much to admire about Parasite The screenplay is so good because while the setting may be foreign to American audiences the story is familiar and takes unexpected turns that when you really think about them the turns were always somehow inevitable The point of view is funny and insightful The themes once completely revealed are devastatingly universal A further boon to Parasite is that the cast is great Each member of the cast gets to shine in their distinct ways The chemistry is familial and easy The father played by Song Kang Ho and the daughter played by Park So Dam are the standouts but uniformly each character plays their essential part in this tale I ll also note how the production design is architecturally awe inspiring and meticulous The sets that were built for the film tell just as much of the story by just existing as do the dialogue and the actors Parasite is an absolute must see If it is in a theater near you take the opportunity to enjoy this spectacle on the big screen Do not read any spoilers Go into this one knowing as little as possible,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5389797/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,"Shame, it was going so well",The film was going pretty well and I was enjoying it but then Spoiler alert Why on earth would they allow the previous housekeeper in at that time of night Surely the sensible thing to do would have been to tell her to come back in the daytime But no in order to further the story they had to crowbar this scenario in From that point on the film was ruined for me,6.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5891726/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,It's good but not all ends are closed,It is great The comedy element is working across the movie there are many unexpected resolutions of situations but in the end I find it containing too many unresolved moments elements which might have some additional interesting spins It s like the movie teases something really really complex and then resolves everything all of a sudden It s good but it could be even better,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5431331/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2020,"Good, but not his best",I watched dozens of Korean and Japanese or Chinese movies I am aware that to fully enjoy them you need to understand the culture of the country and you can t just judge it based on your own culture Keeping this in mind I wasn t sure what to expect with this movie My ex and my friend considered it boring but they usually don t appreciate subtle storytelling I wouldn t say that the movie is boring Parts of it reminded me of Bin Jip the parasite aspect of living in someone else s house or family a small part reminded me of the family in The Host I understand that the movie is about money about social class etc That being said I do feel the movie is a tad overrated It is by no means a bad film I did enjoy watching it especially how good the family is at conning the family so easily and how blind their host family is to their true intentions take for example that the youngest son actually did notice the morse code and could have prevented things but his father or mother are so distant from their own son they didn t even bother to check his Indian tent This is a typical Palm d Or movie like Suzhou River It rewards the patient viewer but will bore those with short attention spans who can t appreciate subtlety Personally I think The Wailing is a far better Korean movie anr Brotherhood the best I saw so far Parasite is good but those who know Korean cinema will see that although good this movie is barely above Korean average which says a lot about the high quality of Korean cinema though,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213827/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,Best of 2019!,Parasite came along just when I thought I d seen the best 2019 had to offer The movie progressed elegantly like an amazing musical piece The depth of the characters and the story kept me glued to my seat hoping the credits wouldn t roll And when the credits did roll I stared at the black screen in a moment of contemplation thinking this is what cinema should be Absolutely recommend this to anyone who hasn t seen it 10 10,10.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5271254/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2020,The parasitic relationship in Parasites also reflects social inequality under class differences.,Bathing in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into an adult breathing the air in the dark room can only walk like a ghost You can t let go of a poor stone for a lifetime and you will never get rid of the cheap smell Curly bed bugs sterilize yourself with windows of potions hosts in high places use money to hire people to disinfect themselves The rich sucked the blood of the poor soared the poor sent their lives to the rich the people and ghosts shared food in the same room and the insects and beasts developed together to develop enemies In The Parasite we saw President Park s family who were blinded by money In a high society they respect wealth and status but ignore the lower class people who live in darkness The gap between the rich and the poor has increased the antagonism between the two major class relations and has become the trigger for the tragedy,9.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5526811/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2021,"Intriguing, entertaining and surprising",I watched this with no preconceptions I knew it was Korean and I knew it was laden with awards But I didn t have a clue about the story So I won t spoil anything in this review It s easy to be be seduced by the style of this film Calm controlled camerawork and beautiful cinematography that makes full use of the available light colour and weather The story draws you in too Perhaps a little slowly at first but it reaches a fantastic climax navigating through various genres as it gets there It s an inspired bit of storytelling But there are a few things that stop it from being a true masterpiece The first hour is a little too slow The combination of the subtitles and the low key performances of several lead characters make it quite hard for a non Korean speaking viewer to understand their motivations And the greatest shame is that the final act is unconvincing when compared to what has preceded it But well worth watching The second hour is a stunning piece of cinema,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6629616/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2020,Enjoyable movie but acclaimed for the wrong reasons,I have serious issues with this movie Not because it isn t incredibly well made acted etc I ve seen some bad reviews of it which I don t agree with but I understand where they are coming from Because at no point is the audience given even the slightest hint about why any of this is happening Why are this rich family hiring an art tutor for their eight year old They must have more money sense Rich people are stupid Look at this smart but poor family taking advantage it s all good Well no it isn t actually Scamming is a massive issue in Korea Voice phishing molka cams car insurance scams are an absolute plague and they are in many ways uniquely korean issues But that isn t why this movie leaves a bad taste At no point is it addressed why this family would need to be hiring tutors for their kids This is a very Korean issue and it isn t something that is exclusive to rich people It is in fact the norm It s just much easier when you re rich because no personal sacrifices need to be made Maths tutors for 4 year olds Piano teachers Ballet lessons Learning 3 or 4 languages This actually happens Yes at 4 years old So an art tutor for an 8 year old really isn t anything to bat an eyelid about if you live in Korea Which is why most young Koreans would do anything to live in Europe or the US it s just a constant grind every single day This isn t a film about inequality In fact Korea is well down the list of most unequal societies Elderly poverty is a big problem in Korea Inequality is not Seoul is just a city like London or New York or San Francisco that has very expensive districts and houses apartments But unlike those other cities schooling is a large part of the reason for that Everything comes back to education yet here we are blaming it on inequality It s fashionable of course There s always something with the best picture oscar these past few years Anyway it s good to see a Korean movie doing so well I would rather it have been Old Boy winning the big awards but I have no issue with this kind of entertaining fluff winning awards Korea deserves recognition as they are producing some fantastic TV and films,8.0,4.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5478410/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2020,One Extra Point for Screenplay & Story Telling,In the year 2019 Parasite a Korean film came out of nowhere created history in the world of cinema The film needs no recommendation and any of my words would just not be enough to describe the aura of this movie I ll just share my experience about the movie which was phenomenal and once again it has given me the reason to love cinema more The film would take only 20mins to transform from something ordinary to Extra ordinary The film will keep you at your edges and will be with you for quite sometime Everything in the movie seems around hitting the right note at right time strong screenplay and direction are two of the main pillars of this visual gem Hats off to Bong Joon Ho Han Jin won for creating this masterpiece,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5688326/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2023,Great cinematography. Very up-to-date message,Parasite rocks an incredibly well crafted screenplay that smoothly mixes dark comedy thriller vibes and social drama It s like a rollercoaster of plot twists that keeps you glued from start to finish This movie s all about class differences digging deep into the gap between the rich and the poor Bong Joon ho s storytelling is pure genius showing a sharp yet compassionate take on this social divide that ll make you think The cinematography by Hong Kyung pyo is just drop dead gorgeous The movie pays serious attention to every little detail whether it s the swanky Park mansion or the grimy Kim home The contrast between these places really drives home the film s message,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9301899/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,Dark City,This is a bravura and surprising thriller with a fancy modernist brutalist house as one of the leading stars There is little doubt that as a loser family start to target a rich household their early success cannot hold I m a fan of Korean films anyway and so was relaxed about the various styles this film goes through While the film is totally accessible there are still enough references to Korean and Asian society to make it a little demanding on the viewer which is why the Oscar success was nicely surprising The film does not perfectly handle it s different layers the political message and the moral message rather wrap around each other awkwardly The pacing doesn t always work either the direction is relaxed in the house but pokes around nervously outdoors This is not the best Korean film I ve seen Old Boy and I saw the Devil were superior but the setup cinematography and the sheer chutzpah of the plotting make it a sharp witted success I don t reference the classic Old Boy accidentally that too was effectively a double layered film and on reflection it was a little better at it,7.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5502738/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2023,An enjoyable movie,A brilliant an enjoyable movie to watch I was invested throughout the whole film Although in parts it dragged however there was great character building and ultimately I cared for all the characters I wasn t sure who the hero or the villain was But the ending wow I was gobsmacked I knew something bad would happen but didn t think it would be that bad I must admit that I was a little confused as to why the poor father Sorry I ve forgotten their names killed the rich father just because he stank Didn t feel that would happen in real life and did feel rather ridiculous The film was very long I felt they could ve cut parts and perhaps gave us more closure towards the end Every scene after the stabbings felt rushed and it was alot of information to take in felt like they could ve elaborated on this part on the movie 7 8 10,7.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8811336/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2023,Extremely Disappointing (But Still Good),I ll be the first to admit that much of my lack of enthusiasm for this film is totally my own doing When this first came out and won Best Picture and everything I was determined to not have anything spoiled so that meant I have avoided EVERYTHING about this movie since late 2019 early 2020 But I still constructed this whole idea of what it was in my mind and because of that I was far more interested in the story I d created than what was actually on display And like I said that s one hundred percent my bad But that s not the only reason this was so disappointing to me The biggest detractor was the characters I honestly didn t really like any of them and the more tolerable ones were still not the kind of characters I want to root for I had great empathy for Ki taek and his family but I didn t like them It was kind of fun at first to see them dupe this overwhelmingly oblivious rich family but as soon as I actually started to think about it it made me uncomfortable I know it s satire and everything but seriously why are we punishing the people who didn t do anything wrong Why send the driver and the housekeeper to potentially face the same situation you yourselves are so desperate to get out of Don t get me wrong I m not on the side of the rich family either they had plenty of issues But it felt like the movie was trying to make excuses for Ki taek and his family when they didn t deserve it I mean seriously kicking the housekeeper down the stairs Tying up her husband even when he begs to just keep living in the bunker I just couldn t even pretend to be on their side Ki jung s death also really bothered me since they d gone out of their way to mention earlier that she seems to fit in with this lifestyle So was that her punishment Because she could take this lifestyle in such stride she ended up dead Because she could be so easily seen as part of this rich life she had to end up suffering Maybe I m looking too much into it but either way I didn t like it And maybe it s as simple as it just comes down to the fact that I might not be the target demographic for this film Who knows I thought the cinematography was great and the writing was excellent as well as the acting I absolutely won t tell anyone not to watch it and I might even recommend it But overall I was just really expecting a very different story my own fault and more relatable characters I wanted so badly to give this at least an 8 but I honestly haven t been this disappointed in an objectively great film in a very long time I m glad that so many people adore it but it s not for me,6.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8982968/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2022,Quite the journey...,Parasite starts with an endearing family of characters and continues the familial theme until the cows come home The direction and photography are impeccable but perhaps not worth the watch time While I wanted to see the family get into more hijinks my favorite act was the 1st the story decided to sit at this house of rich people to examine the class divide I imagine and I was a little disappointed However the house holds a few remarkable secrets and the anxiety I felt watching this family blend in was palpable and it didn t hurt that the actors had great chemistry and humor going I also enjoyed how the naturalistic directing style contrasted with the insanity of the last act Give it a watch,8.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8529351/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2020,Cinematic marvel,Four highly coveted Oscars including Best Picture Best Director Best Original Screenplay being awarded to a foreign language film is an unprecedented event in my memory This makes Parasite South Korean 2019 tragicomedy a must see movie Having just come out of the theatre I can admit in all sincerity that the film has affected me on multiple levels But before broaching the poignant essentials should firstly dispense with the banal which I expect the woke and self righteous movie goers are likely to focus on These will undoubtedly include such predictable clich s as injustices of income inequality disdain of the chauffeur driven elite towards smelly subway riders aloof callousness to the upper classes etc These elements are undeniably featured in the film but purely as a foil for a deeper exploration of the human psyche which deserves to be examined with some specificity Viewer warning Parasite while a monumental piece of cinematic work is not a joyous viewing experience The unrelenting intensity unleashed on the viewer almost from the start not too dissimilar to that of observing a circus acrobat on a tight rope without the safety net is sustained without respite throughout the two hour plus duration Armed with only a cursory knowledge of the South Korean society culture and class hierarchy I felt somewhat disadvantaged particularly during the early scenes At the risk of being exceedingly presumptuous I fear that most of the US movie going public might be in the same boat despite the prominence of the ubiquitous Samsung KIA Motors and other Korean brands permeating global markets If not for the omnipresent media denunciations of its dangerously unpredictable neighbor to the north we would probably know even less about the Region While ignorance is generally considered to be a bliss in the case of Parasite not knowing the Korean societal dynamics one can t help but experience the frustrations of cognitive dissonance right from the start On the one hand we are presented with While on the other hand The initial culturally foreign element driving the dissonance is that despite the unambiguously self reliant and skilled family members the mother feels she needs to kick the husband out of his slumber to come up with the plan An accomplished hammer thrower evidently needs a man to do the heavy lifting pun intended when it comes to figuring out options for protecting the family or improving its finances What makes these incompatible realities even more disjointed is the apparent inability of the siblings who clearly exhibit an above average portfolio of skills to claim their proper station in society The brother while devoid of formal university education has superior math English and college entrance test acing skills The sister in addition to her mastery of drawing and appealing looks has perfected the improv and BS artistry to such an extent that in any meritocratic setting she would easily achieve a distinguished career in marketing politics or screenplay writing The film creators are seemingly posing a two part question 1 is it the social status and family pedigree rather than merit that acts as a dominant determinant of one s ability to succeed or perhaps 2 it is a self inflicted limitation imposed by one s own belief system that places the current circumstance or family history to be the obstacle to advancement The filmmakers are hinting at the latter by incorporating the heavy rock imagery introduced to the audience in a form of a gift by a family friend looks more like a ginormous paperweight rather than heirloom The brother becomes so inextricably linked to the rock particularly during periods of high stress that he seems unable to separate himself from it no matter where he goes Predictably in keeping with Chekhov s dramatic principle this heavy rock becomes the instrument of his near demise Curiously it is the same metaphorically tuned brother who misses such an obvious boulder of a symbol again pun intended However it is the juxtaposition of the affluent Parks vs the poor Kims in the film that takes the cake definitely pun intended An unspoken shield seems to reliably insulate the wealthy from various external forces While a heavy downpour can dispossess the slum dwellers of their property entirely it is only a minor inconvenience for the wealthy down to the leak proof pretend American Indian tents While basements of the rich can withstand a nuclear attack from the pot bellied dictator north of the border any substantial deluge simply drowns basements or basement homes as the case might be of the poor in raw sewage Another purpose of incorporating the heavy rain scene into the film is to remind us that often when it rains it pours That is while the Kims managed to cleverly contrive themselves into the Parks household the elation proved to be short lived as they discovered other subterranean dwellers in the Parks house whose status is even lower than that of the Kims leading to dramatic disequilibrium to a comfortable and promising situation According to the filmmakers while the invisible walls of wealth and privilege protect the affluent class from external threats no one is safe when it comes to the enemy within The message here seems to be that as long as the class resentment is obvious and inter class mobility is driven by factors other than merit e g antecedent lack of connections body odor cheap underwear or any other subjective and artificial boundaries the risk of societal discontent is always lurking in the background bringing the fragility of human existence to the forefront often causing the innocent to suffer The carnage scene in the latter part of the film while abrupt and sudden can indeed be foreshadowed as a natural consequence of open expression of disdain that Parks Sr signals to Kim Sr in no uncertain terms Where I struggle with my interpretation of the film is the title There are no obvious parasites in the plot Even the subterranean male dweller performs light sensor duties at appropriate moments thereby communicating his respect and appreciation The Kims dutifully fulfill their respective roles While the Parks Sr works for his money Perhaps the idea behind the title is to suggest that there is a symbiotic feeding off one another that remains fundamentally destructive as long as the gulf between societal layers remains unbridged Not sure Need to think about it some more Nine out of ten,9.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5486013/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2023,What desperation can do to people,I couldn t really understand the meaning of the title before watching this movie and as soon as I watched it I immediately made the connection and thought it was the perfect headline for such a piece of art of the actual cinema Parasite narrates the story of a desperate family whose condition is meticulously depicted a dirty small underground house with narrow corridors and a short ceiling full of insects which are in turn the parasites of their house and exposed to every kind of mistreatment by society and any disgrace such as the flood What is the effect of desperation on human beings Becoming extremely selfish ruthless They d take advantage of everything to survive and obtain what they crave for In our case every member of the poor family manages to infest the rich one by ruthlessly eliminating anyone on their way like a virus destroying all of the defenses and feeding themselves with the victim s body the rich family s wealth I appreciated that the storyline was very unusual and involving and also made me reflect about two important themes which constitute a real issue in nowadays society and appear to be highly criticized in the movie the power of recommendations and the superficiality of rich people Respectively the topic of networking being close to a relevant person in the working environment can be crucial to obtain a job no matter who you are and what your abilities I believe the movie points the finger against corruption in the working places Secondly rich people s naivety the stereotype of rich people being seen as very gullible and superficial is clearly shown by the wealthy family s behaviors they appear to be blind to what reality looks like they only see the superficial part because they are convinced to be able to buy everything with money they see money as the certainty to all the best in life and seem to never have experienced anything bad in life because they were lucky enough to live in the right part of this society in which money leads everything and everyone What I didn t appreciate about Parasite though was the absence of a deep characterzation of the protagonists which I personally would have added to empathize more with them and some forcings in the plot which made it less realistic as for instance the ending the poor family s father ends up sending morse signals to his son which understands everything he wants to communicate Overall however I d really recommend watching this movie because other than very well made graphically has a lot to leave to the spectator,8.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8916726/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2021,A positive bias,seems to be surrounding many things South Korean and Japanese at least that is my feeling The culture and art of these and other Asian countries get hyped ferociously in the west I am not saying that I mind people can like whatever they want and there is so much intriguing and nice to like but it does have this unpleasant side effect that films like this are treated like pure gold This film is not for me I heard much about this film read many great reviews it being incredibly funny frightening disturbing dramatic and and and A Film that should have won all prices as best competitor in all genres a part from adult and children s movies So I watched it expecting it to be dark smart and deep and at the same time entertain me and make me laugh and cry at best But it did not I yawned quite a few times though It is really long and it would probably be so much more entertaining if it was just 90 minutes but as it is several scenes just drag along not giving the viewer anything no content no grand acting no new and brutal visuals yes the scenery IS VERY WELL DONE But it is not so beautiful that I want to stare at it while nothing is happening and also after a while we have seen all the shots so thank you next And about all the genres it really is not that funny not that dark not frightening and not horrific some drama in it but not done better then in many TV shows in all fairness I might be unable to understand some of the humour as I do not speak Korean and also I could only find a synchronised version so there could have been some puns that just flew over my head but I doubt that that would have made a change The acting is not great the characters are not really likeable and sometimes feel unfinished the story does really not make much sense and the twists and turns are not something incredibly smart or unexpected I must really say I went in hoping for great entertainment and did not finish it in one sitting but stopped half way in and finished it the next day because I was disappointed and bored and felt like using my time differently It is simply a film the message is very simple and while it has some nice shots it is really not a film I would recommend to anyone really I even now knowing the film rereading the reviews do not see what those people saw in it Which is grand People have different tastes As a review in simple terms A mediocre film with nothing outstanding about it and ruined by a too long running time which results in the film being boring,3.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7141822/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2023,"8.3/10 - So Smooth and Accessible, Yet Provides Food for Thought",All you ll need to do is walk up the stairs Parasite is a 2019 South Korean film directed by Bong Joon ho You might ve not heard about tons of Korean movies but chances are that even someone such as me who needs to check out more Korean cinema has still heard something about Parasite It s the highest grossing South Korean film of all time and the first non English language film to ever win an Oscar for the best picture The movie follows a poor family and their struggles to make a living When the son of the family gets an opportunity to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a rich family he takes the job with no hesitation lying a bit of light lies regarding his qualifications Soon he learns that the mother of the family is rather easy to manipulate and so the poor family begins to plot a scheme to completely infiltrate the household of the rich Parks family This one has something that I think anyone can appreciate when it comes to art it s super accessible but it still has enough depth so one can have an elaborate film nerd discussion regarding the film afterwards Everything in this film just feels so smooth so fluid and well done camera movement editing composition everything just has this good flow that I really appreciate Certain sequences especially bring that to the front but it s present all throughout the film and I really love it There s also a cool blend of genres here comedy and drama with some heist movie vibes and then around the halfway point there s this awesome shift that really get this film going and in unexpected directions with much more weight to them It s like there s this whole buildup in the first half of the movie and then it turns out so abruptly to something darker and more thrilling Really love this aspect of the movie Well done And you know what Pretty much every aspect of this film is well done to the point that I don t think that this film has any notable flaws It doesn t automatically mean that the film is a 10 10 experience only that it does what it tries to do in the best way possible but still the humor works for me the acting is spot on the story is compelling and the social commentary gives some proper food for thought This is one of those films that I d probably recommend anyone who s old enough to watch an R Rated film So yeah this one s very good Its flow and pacing are super satisfying everyone s acting is spot on and the genres brought to the table here are woven together in a really unique way It s accessible but will also provide food for thought and in the end of the day I truly think that almost everyone will enjoy this film Feeling an 8 3 10 on this one,8.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9159313/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,Go in knowing nothing.,My dad is someone that doesn t even watch foreign films that require subtitles and he thought it was great If thay doesn t cry out how great this film is then I don t know what This screenplay is one of the best in a long time incorporating elements that fit together like a puzzle the characters are all deep and compelling the score will be stuck in my head for a long time and the story is one to go in without knowing anything Bong Joon Ho is deserving of his Oscar wins and I hope this will introduce more Americans to South Korean films that are as good as Parasite,10.0,6.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5487954/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2020,Much hyped,In the disguise of highlighting social inequality they just manage to show 2 extremes of society but in most cumbersome blatant way In fact the poor been shown as if to leach on the rich and live off right from the title no creativity or novelty in incidents or scenes Characters are not at all introduced or given depth everything is hurried throw Climax is hotchpotch and forced upon Much much over rated movie Oscar,5.0,4.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6394285/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,Not a winner but 2nd Place,I m not really sure what this movie tried to To tell Well the movie move very quickly between the scenes and there was some thriller it was not comedic in anyway I m still confused as to why the father decided to kill the other father however the ending is quite emotional and shows the in quality of life between the rich and poor and the hard work that comes from trying to be wealthy,7.0,1.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5483137/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2020,Don't believe the hype.,I appreciate the effort of the Parasite team the director Joon Ho Bong in particular He tried hard to get recognized from the international audience by creating a non typical Korea film Unfortunately this is overdoing The movie is too long and quite boring Many scenes are unnecessary Yes there are times that the movie are fun and entertaining but to say it is the best film of the year I don t think it is the case at all I will be shocked if this movie wins any Oscar award,6.0,5.0,21.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5442165/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,Parasite,Parasite is without a doubt the most talked about movie of 2020 It s also the highest rated film on Letterboxd Indeed no matter the source I had only heard great things about it and to say that my expectations were high would be an understatement Thankfully though despite the popularity of Parasite I had no idea what it was about I knew of course that it was about the divide between the rich and the poor However as far as the plot or any significant moments went I was clueless As such I want to start by talking about how unpredictable this film is and how drastically it changes tone when it needs to While there seems to be significance in every moment and every shot there were four moments that particularly stood out to me or should I say four periods The first and most obvious one is the beginning Those moments where we get to know Kim Ki taek and his family Those early moments of happiness despite struggle and despair A family that if nothing else had each other Those early moments were filled with a sense of longingness and intimacy simplicity and even to a certain extent hope The first tonal shift and the beginning and what I would consider the second period comes as Ki woo the son of the family gets a job tutoring the daughter of rich parents What follows is a period of deceit and urgency Those previous tones are forgotten as they lay a path for a fast paced comedic period that promises a better life despite the dangers associated As the family starts to settle into their new roles and as their lives start to change the sense of despair turns into one of greed and ruthlessness While the first and second period were often humorous and light hearted the two last ones are the opposite The second shift in tone and the start of the third period comes as the family learns of a hidden truth inside the house they now inhabit without permission This is perhaps the most significant shift in tone as it not only introduces a certain level of violence but it also blurs the line between good and evil even further It s also the first time where despite how Kim Ki taek and his family hope to see themselves they have become what they once despised They have turned from those looked down upon to those who look others down With this change in roles and tone the film increases in tension and leaves a sense of uncertainty in the air A sense that won t go away until the fourth and final period Indeed the third and arguably final shift in tone comes as the family find their own home destroyed by a downpour of rain It is after these events that Kim Ki taek and Ki woo especially turn into different people They find themselves looking back at who they once were before they got a taste of the better life Attitudes change back to what they once were and the actions fuelled by these attitudes are ones of despair and hate hopelessness and spite Now as I mentioned it could be argued that there is one final shift in tone at the very end And indeed it might be the most interesting one Every action prior to this point was fuelled by self interest and a sense of right to something that others possess However as Ki woo tries to find stability in his and his family s life the actions while still driven by self interest do not attempt to benefit from others It is perhaps the most significant change in the entire film which mind you is full of changes in the first place It s a change that pits all the preconceived ideas against one another No longer do the poor feel unjustly abandoned and the sense of hope that was apparent in the beginning returns Despite everything that has happened it s that hope that shines the brightest and leads to a promise of a better life The reason why I feel that those final moments are so significant is that the whole movie prior has spent its time creating a chasm between those well off and those not However as it progresses and ultimately reaches its conclusion that chasm has diminished and blurred into one that can barely be seen And indeed by the final shot it seems to have disappeared completely While the divide between income classes is central to Parasite there is an endless number of other such divides Another central theme and one that plays throughout is the goodness of people At no point is there any clear indication about who is good and who is bad And interestingly despite their claim to be bad and unkind people it s Kim Ki taek s family who is at first the group that you root for However as the story moves forward and the lure of money turns into greed it becomes clear that it might indeed be the rich family that we should be rooting for And by the time the film ends it s impossible to define what is good and bad anymore No one despite their background and wealth is just good or just bad But alas as much as I would like to delve deeper and deeper into all the various examinations of human nature there are so many to dissect that it would take me hours upon hours and days upon days to do so Even on a first watch there seemed to be so many layers to explore and unpack that quite frankly I m a little overwhelmed As such it s no wonder Parasite is so incredibly highly regarded It s not the type of film that many will consider their favourite but there is no doubt about its excellence and perfection Parasite is without a doubt one of the most special movie experiences I have ever had It s a masterclass in filmmaking but it s also so much more Rarely can any film so honestly examine and depict human nature let alone make it into a film that while often heavy is enjoyable While it will never be something that I will consider a favourite it more than deserves the praise it has garnered and quite frankly I can t wait to watch it again to see just how much I missed the first time,10.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6444732/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,A Grifter Great,When you write a review this late into a movie s life post genre busting Oscar nobody will read this stuff so here goes nothing I ve always liked the con men grifter genre because it s all about the glorious world of deceit where nothing is as it seems Typically the drama comes when the best laid plan falls apart which it does so gloriously and tragically here I m looking forward to the black and white version as there s a glorious luminosity to that format and this picture really doesn t require color,10.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5491826/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2020,"Pretty good, but hyped more than necessary",Don t get me wrong it s a good movie I just don t see why it s soooo hyped On the other hand I appreciate this type of dark comedic movie getting recognition even if by the Academy I stopped watching the awards years ago because the movies are sooo predictable or pretentious or big budgety but not a lot of soul So by that standard and the fact it introduces more people to the awesome world of Korean cinema this movie is really good The story is great the characters were fun and you got to know each and the acting was spot on The settings were great as wel I thought it was a sci fi flick but I truly knew nothing about it I was expecting a thriller like Bug or The Fly or something weird like that What I got was not disappointing Very quirky which reflects the work of the director who brings an interesting flare to movies He s definitely developed his signature style and I think it will make people visit this portfolio Again very good movie But won t change your life It may stick with you a little afterwards but it will fade so you can move on to the next,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5725691/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2020,Watched this film before all the Oscar Wins,The hype following this film was real and I saw it at the Scotiabank Theatre Toronto in Dec 2019 And I left that theatre stunned and in a trance of bad ass cinema The peach montage scene alone I think its somewhere between 5 to 8 minutes and there are 60 shots in that That alone will make your jaw drop The detail in this movie is masterful and this does what cinema or what a great movie should do it should grip you expand your mind captivate you and take you on a hell of a story that involves a fine balance of acting sound visuals and believing in the story This film did all that and RESPECT,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6390792/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2019,Truly a blast,Parasite was such a mesmerizing piece of film It s storytelling was weird absurd unexpected and somehow came together really nicely It s hard to describe this piece due to how many genre s of film it covers but throughout the film I ve felt like there were multiple layers of metaphors that I was missing It s not your typical film that s for sure All I can say is that you should go in blind it s worth it,9.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5100665/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,Must Watch - (8.5),Watched this movie by renting from Google Movies It is difficult to say the genre of the movie as it has elements of mystery romance thriller dark comedy sentiments etc Story is very unique and exciting It mentions about how the poor depends on rich and vice versa A thought provoking movie It will make the audience think about the movie even after it ends There are so many hidden thoughts and meanings in the movie Direction is different level and acting is great There aren t much negatives I would say the first hour of the movie is better compared to the second hour,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5686687/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,The square root of ten,I walked out near the end of the movie I highly recommend you don t spend time and money on it It made me very uncomfortable watching two hours of people scamming other people and worse for personal gain Yes you see that in movies all the time but this one simmered in cruelty in slow motion surrounded by beautiful people and sets I didn t like ANY of the characters in the movie and that is hard to do I felt a hollow sadness when I left Maybe because it had a lot of 10 s or maybe it is a reflection of what society thinks is a good film The only redeeming quality I saw was that the Korean people are sweeter than us like 1950 s bad guys in suits,3.0,22.0,59.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5242747/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2022,A marvellous film (albeit 20% of reviewers don't 'get it').,Not everyone will understand the subtle ironies and dark humour written into the script This is a slowly evolving funny and engaging film for those who have the ability to let the magic unfold without any expectations or needing an explanation for everything Storyline and characterization are all that s needed for any film to work at a basic level and there is so much originality and depth here to keep the viewer engaged throughout the duration Many many contemporary films follow established formulae whereas this one stands alone For anyone after repetitive safe bland boring and brain numbing CGI laced entertainment I d recommend trying something other than this work of admirable quality which is well filmed and acted throughout,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7829354/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,"Too Much Hype, Too Much Time",Cultural story line was interesting funny bizarre Not sure how to say much that has not already been said I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not wasted over 2 hours that would have been better spent digging for worms to fish with or eating a bowl of frosted flakes with bananas and strawberries which would have been more appetizing 90 minutes would have done it for me make that 45 minutes Way too much hype for a theatrical mess Maybe best foreign film but best movie of the year ha Just goes to show the Academy is screwed up This film does not stand in the same arena with movies like 1917 or Harriet,4.0,3.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5487294/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2020,Best Movie of the Century (in my opinion),Not only is this my favourite movie of the century it s one of my favourite movies of all time What s so great about it This movie has the best example of an amazing midpoint and conveys a theme and deeper meaning better than any other movie I ve seen The first half of the film was captivating enough but once it reaches it s midpoint I was glued to my seat and my eyes were glued to the screen this movie is close to perfect I m sure it might have some flaws however I can t see them since the are so easy to overlook because of the qualities that it would take me hours to list Just to name a few the pacing is fantastic the characters are interesting the conflict is original and it has one of the best montages of recent years This movie will go down in history and be remembered for years to come as an achievement of cinema and this is why I strongly suggest you watch it,10.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6257394/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,"I always believe that if the ending is not happy, it must be not enough to feel life",It s a pity that Parasite is attacking inequality with the poor s wrong face and choice This is probably the reason why I have not been able to truly accept this film because it is really uncomfortable to think deeper The structure and technique of the film are shocking but the idea behind it is really difficult to understand If you want to say what it makes people think about it should be the most basic respect between people No matter what class status or situation you can really treat the other person as a person not those inferior ones,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5554253/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2019,Ingenuity and originality plus biting social satire = winner,I have not seen such a movie that is so bold and daring in its originality in a long time and that helps make this the most gripping cinema of the year more so than any Hollywood horror and thriller movie Though the movie is not without flaws such as the perplexing ending with inane logic that makes it hard to follow somewhat despite the shocking turns and twists the director proves himself to be the master of the filmmaking craft by many years of experience Toward the ending I had to think to myself This director I could not quite remember the name but will memorize following the end is a genius whatta crazy movie That is a great compliment to the filmmakers who conjured up the most intricate structure of a thriller that also emphasizes originality I don t know about the political social and economical situations of South Korea but I imagine that the themes conveyed by this movie also applies equitably to Europe Australia and North America without losing the tonal cohesion and heart rending message of supposed inequalities Parasite has to be one of the most original films released in the last decade and I cannot remember the last time I saw an original movie without it being derivative mildly subtly or obvious It s also the most daring in terms of urgent social messaging under guise of a dark satire worthy of Jonathan Swift s work on par with Joker Certainly Parasite does not warrant the full accolades due to minor flaws that confound the otherwise hypercritical and jaded moviegoers like me but the effort put into the structure of exposition followed by insane but carefully constructed twists is compelling as a gripping thriller that only this director Bong Joon ho knows how to pull off effortlessly like the illusionist and no one else not even the veteran once great turned hack American directors like Brian De Palma and Michael Mann can try Just watch this movie without knowing ANYTHING about the plot I did not even watch the trailer and I assiduously avoided reading the reviews prior to this screening The astonished thrills and incredulous disbelief at the directorial and storytelling ingenuity are worth it by watching this film blind without advance knowledge 1 2,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5229541/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2019,Strong 4.5 // Well-oiled Machine,Wow A truly exceptional film that somehow lives up to the immense praise It manages to be so many things at once an operatic satire a classist takedown a cheeky comedy a twisty thriller a chilling horror a somber rumination Much of the success is owed to the absolutely phenomenal screenplay which is one of the most intricately constructed in recent memory Every setup is paid off every tonal shift deftly balanced every progression carefully timed The movie feels like a well oiled machine firing on all cylinders thrusting you through the densely layered narrative without so much as a hiccup And perhaps most importantly despite its highly allegorical nature the film never compromises on the entertainment value and emotional catharsis of its literal story and characters It s not often you see a film realize its ambition this resoundingly Don t miss it Strong 4 5 5,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5234589/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2020,Parasite crafts a dark but brilliant story about our society,This film got a lot of praise going into the Oscars season this year for not only being a commentary of society in the same way Joker does but doing it through the lens of a Korean family by doing this it forces the film to have a different feel from any film of its type Many Americans don t understand the class system of other countries and getting to see another countries class system being represented on screen gives the film a very different type of feel In Korea there are a lot of stricter gun laws that stop people from getting to them so in order to make a kill you would have to use other methods and that does play a role within the context of this film and adds to the complete and utter fear that can come from it There are also a issue for more flooding for the poor in Korea in which this film also addresses in a lot of big and massive ways throughout the film as it becomes the catalyst for why the family makes many of the choices that they choose to make within it Parasite really does manage to capture the essence of what truly matters in our society for the poor and the rich and their differences,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5617955/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2023,"Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is a thought-provoking masterpiece on class inequality and survival",Bong Joon ho s Parasite is a striking social commentary that delves into the dark side of class inequality greed and the illusion of upward mobility The film follows a poor family s attempts to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy family leading to a series of unexpected events The cinematography direction and acting are all exceptional and the film s message is conveyed in a manner that is both compelling and thought provoking The film s exploration of the haves and have nots is executed brilliantly with the script being both engaging and unpredictable The cast particularly the actors who play the poor family gives authentic performances and the dynamic between the characters is gripping Bong Joon ho s direction is masterful and the film s pacing is on point The use of sound and lighting adds to the film s eerie atmosphere and the symbolism and metaphors throughout the film are well thought out and executed Parasite is a work of art that raises questions about society s structure and the lengths individuals will go to in order to survive It is a film that is both haunting and unforgettable leaving a lasting impression on the viewer,10.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8951715/?ref_=tt_urv

One to watch for anyone interested in the art of filmmaking.",This is one of the rare times I whole heartedly agree with the Oscars Since I saw this film yesterday I haven t been able to stop thinking about it and it still have left a feeling in my gut and its visuals still lives in my mind This is what movie making is all about it s artistically beautiful it s entertaining it manage to capture your attention and is interesting and thought provoking It makes you feel and think simple put It reminded me a little bit of Get Out even if very different movies also I haven t seen that many Korean movies 5 perhaps and some of those are some of the best movies I ve seen so perhaps should check out some more Korean movies And Kang ho Song has been in 3 of them I ve seen so I must believe he s a very famous actor in South Korea but I wouldn t know Anyway the cast of this movie is fantastic a bunch of very likeable actors that portrays the absurdity darkness drama and comedy of these characters and situations in an excellent way This movie is entertaining because of the absurdity of the situations that these people come to be within but also still so impactful beacuse it at the same time it all feels so realistic in a crazy way The film with all it different events and character projection flows perfectly and also with beautiful just delicious cinematography and set design Some visuals of this picture will be in my mind for a long time And off course the underlying meaning of the the film as I think everybody knows by now even those that haven t seen it yet it s about class poverty VS wealth Something that has been going on in this world for thousands of years As present today as it ever been I suppose The gap between rich and poor it is very much a gap that alienate the classes from each other And what this film so intelligently does is that it isn t hitting you over the nose with this message it s just there embedded in the story in an obvious but at the same time sublimely way I think that s masterfully done by the director beacuse I think that s a hard thing to acchive To make such a strong comment on society and the human condition without being obvious or preachy Just beautiful actually There is sympathy and distaste to be found against the personalities in both familys with distaste perhaps being a bit of a strong of a word their human their very very human and you can understand both sides Humans are selfish by nature and both sides just does what s in their best interest No one sets out to be or wants to be immoral or evil people just live in their own worlds their own bubbles and only cares for their own immediate occurrences and problems Why wouldn t they Why shouldn t they Not being either rich or poor myself I can relate to both sides in this movie This movie also portrays so well how different these lifestyles are How the living conditions of the poor family don t remember their last name is just straight up unhealthy and how secluded and oblivious the luxurious conditions of the rich family is from the travasties of the poor the contrast of these two extremely different living conditions is shown again and again but mostly by imagery in subtle ways but also so obvious in their subtleties so it s even more obvious and impactful On top of that the film is dark and humorous for entertaining purposes Witch great acting And also without giving anything away how the occurrences unfolds towards the end is not only to give the movie an entertaining and impactful climax conclusions It also portrays the real tension of the underlying currents these gaps and problems in society creats How the big differences and separation of living standards for people can lead to drastic and devastating outcomes even But think this movie can probably be interperted in many different ways and these are just my own interpretations,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5729241/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,"Mediocre, at best",I m unsure as to why the film has been overrated The main theme of the film is status class and betrayal However I think the film fails to make these themes compelling and thought provoking enough to motivate the audience to care about the characters The first half is extremely uninteresting and it is difficult to not be sickened by the actions of the family despite their poor economic background There is some intrigue at the second half but to be honest I found the overall structure of the film s plot to be too chaotic and convoluted compelling enough As a result there is something missing from the film The events that occur within the film are quite surreal and hokey Some are the scenes are downright bizarre and made you wonder why the character said that in such a melodramatic unrealistic way This affects the believability in what you re seeing thus negatively affecting any sense of connection with the characters Forgettable,4.0,6.0,30.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476813/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,"Gripping, masterfully crafted thriller with a clever streak of black comedy",There are a lot of words that can be used to describe director Bong Joon Ho s Parasite It is equally parts darkly humorous thought provoking relatable and frightening The first half of the film plays out like a wickedly diabolical black comedy As the cunning yet relatable underclass Kim family deviously schemes to infiltrate the much wealthier and more fortunate Park family The kim family s deceitful schemes are portrayed as slightly mean spirited but also deeply relatable We understand why the Kim family is doing what they are doing Their situation is horrible They live in a claustrophobic bug infested dirty house and despite being hard working and intelligent barely make enough money to make ends meet Yet the film somehow never feels as if it is openly supporting what the family is doing The awful and desperate nature of the kim family s lives along with how it contrasts with the much more lavish carefree life of the Park family is brilliantly conveyed through the film s masterful cinematography The camerawork and lighting is at times surreally beautiful and at other times horribly uncomfortable to look at You feel the claustraphobia and discomfort that the Kim family must endure in their own home everyday of their lives and their desperate longing to experience a fleeting glimpse of the life of comfort that the Park s live As a result though you do not necessarily agree with the actions of the Kims it is easy to delight in their perverse exploitation of the rich and powerful This is rather obviously where most of the film s memorable comedy derives from Delivered through a witty and cleverly written script the comedic side of the film is incredibly entertaining and becomes even more so on repeat viewings due to the more subtle aspects of it This rather light hearted and satirical tone completely changes in the film s second and third acts through the introduction of a shocking riveting and complex plot twist that makes you question everything you found delightful about the first act The film is very suspenseful intense and morally gray in this second half You genuinely have no idea which characters are in the right or wrong and the tension continues building until the film s hauntingly dreadful conclusion Overall Parasite is an incredible film in every aspect The acting is exceptional across the board with every actor turning in relatable and undeniably human preformances The characters are superbly written with realistic and very relatable goals and motivations The world of Parasite feels remarkably well realized and lived in And the entire film is thoroughly entertaining and nail biting while also managing to be endlessly complex and thought provoking In short it is nothing short of a masterpiece A film everyone should see at least once,10.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8820958/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2023,Slightly overrated but genuinely very good,From Okja and Snowpiercer director Bong Joon ho comes Best Picture Oscar winner Parasite a South Korean dark comedy about a poor family lying their way into working for a rich family in order to improve their bleak living conditions The film focuses on the Kims who live in a small basement apartment and are desperate for a better life When they re not studying or doing the odd poorly paid and thankless job like packing pizza boxes they try to cut corners by attempting to use their neighbors wifi or getting rid of cockroaches by letting in anti pest fumes through their window when the pest control guy patrols the alleyway above where drunks often go to throw up Through a contact Ki woo Choi Woo shik the son is given the temporary opportunity to take over tutoring the daughter of the well off Park family This opens the Kims up to using this idea of trusted contacts in order to infiltrate the Park household by each doing a different job for them They pretend to be virtual strangers sabotage the people already working for the Parks and everything goes according to plan until it doesn t Much has been said about the themes explored in Parasite and indeed you don t see this poor rich dynamic done in such a bold way very often Recent release Knives Out attempted something along the same lines but Parasite never sugarcoats the Kims which could have come off as condescending and often does whenever incidentally an Oscar nominated film tries to reach out to minorities or people below the middle class Green Book for example probably had its heart in the right place but its dated execution left many cold The Kims may be the victims of a society that turns everyone into parasites but so are the Parks Bong Joon ho wisely avoids the poor people are inherently good and rich people are inherently bad dichotomy instead taking aim at the system as a whole to show how it dehumanizes people in different ways breeding resentment desperation even violence between them Of course there is a power imbalance here as well with the Parks having all of it throughout by virtue of their wealth despite the Kims best attempts at leveling things somewhat so the Kims were doomed from the start This dynamic along with a shocking twist halfway through leads to some nail biting conflicts within the Parks swanky house and it reaches a boiling point by the end This is a carefully crafted film with slick cinematography clever if sometimes a bit too on the nose motifs and excellent performances so its popularity at award shows was deserved though one has to wonder why movies from all over the world are only recognized by the Academy once in a blue moon South Korean directors like Kim Ki duk Park Chan wook and many others have plenty of masterpieces under their belt but they have been largely ignored by most bigger award shows The good news is that Parasite s big wins could be the start of the Academy finally looking past its own Oscar bait and selecting more arthouse fare from all over to celebrate Then again the Oscars being what they are it might also be a one off nod which would be a shame but not all that surprising Parasite is a funny sometimes shocking often very good film that never goes quite how you expect it to go The ending might be its weakest element as it feels a bit too spontaneous when it had been so darn tight up until that point but it still works well enough This is definitely one of 2019 s best and it s well worth checking out but I encourage you to seek out a lot more South Korean films as well whether Hollywood promotes them or not Very good,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9421723/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2020,"Good movie, but highly overrated !",The movie is pretty engaging and great performances by the actors but all the drama before the oscars etc and hyesteria around this film was definitely unnecessary You won t be disappointed watching it Again highly overrated,7.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6099986/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,Excellent Movie - Finish Rushed,This is obviously an excellent movie great acting and directing and production and photography with excellent dialouge and a tight script It seemed to me that the ending was rushed and it was far too predictable But this movie has some great moments that will go down as movie moments for a long time no spoilers I have seen the other academy award nominees and although this movie was excellent I think that Once Upon a Time was better Joker and Irishman are both more a series of scenes around one actor but Parasite is a movie where there is no single dominant actor as such The lead role is Kim the father but in many contexts it is also about the son daughter and mother the parasites,8.0,0.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5484652/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,Didn't resonate with me,As well crafted as this film is with gorgeous cinematography a decent soundtrack and brilliant acting I just found it too much of a slow burner with no payoffs to justify it I have been a fan of slow burners in the past namely Interstellar and Bladerunner 2049 being two of my favourite films yet they had arguably much better stories and spectacles throughout to make up for it I heard Mark Kermode say this film delivers much of its plot visually yet I found the majority of the plot to be delivered with only dialogue or monologue The supposed climax never really peaked enough the horror wasn t all that tense or shocking and the comedy didn t land otherwise to carry it through Furthermore the references and foreshadowing throughout the film to later events could have been more creative Finally the 3rd act and ending felt like it could have been more meaningful and conveyed the Director s discourse with more conviction Again I don t want to deny the craftsmanship and deeper thinking into this film There s some real consideration that s been put into this and a good attempt at making a pertinent and contemporary social commentary Yet for me it just didn t work Nevertheless I invite you to try this one out for yourself,7.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6381414/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,From the same director that gave us Okja and Snowpiercer.,For an average movie afficionado I have to admit that while I liked Parasite aside from the obvious I had to read up about the movie in order to fully appreciate the message it wanted to convey On the surface we know what s it about the story about two families from extreme ends of the social ladder The Parks with their high tech mansion and luscious front yard that hides them from the outside world and the Kims with their sub basement apartment and a window that allows them to look at their sad reality just enough to keep fighting and surviving What is not obvious though is the why What transpired in the movie is believable but the why is what makes the difference Maybe it s a cultural thing where here in the Philippines as depicted in soap operas a million times over the Have Nots are automatically nice people hopeful that things will get better as long as they keep working hard Meanwhile the Haves are depicted as calculating and manipulative taking advantage of those that they can In Parasite it s the other way around And this is very evident when the head of the Kim household commented that the Parks are rich but still nice To which his wife countered they are nice because they are rich That money makes living easy therefore they are not as stressed that s why they can afford and have the time to be nice Which is true I related to when she said that if she had what they had she d be kinder too Of course it s not automatic though and there are always the exception to the rule Everyone were well casted most especially Choi Woo Shik Fight for My Way as the young Kim with whom the chain of events started I mean I know I m supposed to hate him but the combination of his cunning and naivete makes him appealing to me and even to the Parks Cho Yeo jeong as Mrs Park was also a standout playing a balance of a simple yet hands on head of the household You may also notice Lee Sun kyun The Coffee Prince as Mr Park and Park Seo joon Fight for My Way Secretary Kim in a supporting role The last character of note is the the Parks house itself It has a personality of it s own commanding your attention whenever you re within it s premises Winning the 2019 Cannes Palm D or award and besting 20 other foreign films submitted to be South Korea s entry for Best Foreign film at the Oscars a 99 Rotten Tomato rating and 8 5 in IMDB you can not go wrong with this movie It was well written the infiltration of the host by the parasites flowed naturally The cinematography was beautiful charming even in the squalor of the Kims situation For all that Parasite tried to do at the end of the day the world appears the same but it has definitely changed For the better or worse it will all depend on the next set of people assuming the roles of hosts and parasites,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5568566/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,A psychological study of the mind of the Rich and the Poor,Director Bong Joon ho has done it again Although still couldn t surpass his previous masterpiece Memories of Murder this film is without a doubt one of the best film of 2019 As usual for Bong Joon ho s film this film is rather weird which I absolutely love The story is very original and smart You ll find yourself questioning who s the good guy and who s the bad guy Is it the poor who will do anything in order to survive or is it the rich who live their life standing on top of others ignorance of the people under them While the film doesn t dive into the background story of the characters much you ll still be able to grasp the motives of each characters through their expressions and subtle hints within the dialogue spoken Moreover every scenes shown within the film is well thought out The contrast between the two very different social classes within the society is well hinted throughout the entire film I m really impressed with the efforts the filmmakers put into these small but significant moments The casts are also excellent and of course that s include my favorite actors Song Kang ho They all manage to seems very convincing in this weird setting Everyone in the film all has their moments and they all have a role to play in the film Nobody outshines the others Overall this film did not disappoint I can see why this film won the Palme d Or at the Cannes It s an odd but simple film with a powerful message,9.0,4.0,22.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5051461/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2020,"EXTRA! EXTRA! ""Class divide sweeps the globe""",In this dark comedy thriller the Kims a resourceful lower class family swindle their way into employment within the home of the wealthy Park family Rich with style and social commentary Parasite presents director Bong Joon ho in complete control of his craft The cinematography works subtly to convey the rising tension of the film with purposeful slow push ins on the characters Even if the audience doesn t at first notice this subtle movement we subconsciously feel the pressure closing in on the Kim family and a sense of foreboding disaster as their con is at risk of collapse The film is filled with deliberate long takes the smooth camera movement shifts the shots creating new compositions and keeps the frame visually interesting without the need to cut This helps to give more opportunity for characters to share the screen building on the visual representation of their relationships These long moving shots also function as a method of emphasising the scale of the Parks house and give the audience the chance to gain a well constructed sense of the space which is symbolic of the Parks vast wealth The production design is immaculate and demonstrates a careful attention to detail both the Park and Kim houses were sets constructed for the film and while they could not be more aesthetically dissimilar they both feel equally believable The locations of these two houses are also important with a not so subtle metaphor the Kim family live down a street in a semi basement dwelling while the Park house sits atop a hill This vertical distancing represents both the separation of the families and their respective classes Through this visualisation we understand that there are physical structures in place enforcing the separation of the classes while the rich keep moving up for the poor the uphill battle only gets harder This idea translates in the story as setbacks for the Kim family negatively compound forcing them into a downward spiral while the Parks with their established forward momentum easily transform obstacles into positive opportunity But the movie is more complex than poor people good rich people bad each family possesses both good and bad traits showing a common humanity aiming the critique towards the system rather than the people within it The lower class can be viewed as infantilized by their idolisation of the rich while the upper class may be considered child like in their naivety towards the struggle of the less fortunate The two sides of society romanticise aspects of the other what then separates them is the ease with which the wealthy Park family can dip into that fantasy and return to their privilege while the Kim family are punished for their aspirations and attempt to embrace a more lavish lifestyle outside of their designated class In Parasite Bong Joon ho has carefully crafted a slick and evocative film that through excellent film technique conveys important social themes of the segregation of classes through the systematic structures of society The film Resonated with audiences all while being insanely entertaining leading to a much deserved Best Picture win,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5540828/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2020,You can smell it everywhere,Just like most movie goers I didn t know what the plot was about Despite the urge to google it I stayed away Now after watching it I realized I still wouldn t have been prepared for what was ahead A fast paced thriller centered around two families Like two sides of a coin they re polar opposites yet they are crucial for the coin to spin Along with the unnerving feeling you have trying to figure out this movie it s also filled with a lot humor thrill and some family drama with a social message that is cleverly stitched into this feature Brilliant acting and amazing set d cor and intricately designed sequences make this a classic on its own A masterpiece by director Bong Joon Ho He has his own directorial style and this movie is probably the best of them all Adopting certain aspects from all his other movies while creating a uniquely critical film for ages to come he has added his name into the directors hall of fame He won the Oscars for best director best original screenplay best international film and best picture matching a 67 year old record set by Walt Disney If you plan to watch it don t read about it just latch on to the host and don t let go,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5582597/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,A moving though contrived dark satire,The aptly named Parasite is a movie with a message one that permeates through every frame and colors the interactions between characters The class struggle between the upper and lower echelons of society in this case the rich and their servants is a common concept in most Asian societies and placing this dilemma at the heart of the plot is in my opinion its undoing Although the idea itself is worth exploring through a work of art it lacks the striking bizarre and mystifying elements that make other thriller flicks appealing Perhaps my misgivings about the movie are mainly a consequence of my expectation that the plot would contain some major twist and supply a mind blowing climax in the tradition of the classic thriller Although the tale does end on a violent note it is far from being unpredictable and even a fairly attentive viewer could foresee a similar denouement halfway through the film More of a satirical drama than a wild ride Parasite moves at a rather sedate pace and the clever con tricks that prompt a chuckle in the first act turn predictable and even lose credibility with most supporting details seeming artificial and contrived The characters though well portrayed by a talented cast suffer the ubiquitous flaw of being agonizingly one dimensional merely tools in the hands of the director designed specifically to bring about certain sequences of events Barring a single incident in the climax of the film the characters seem to lack a will of their own the overarching concept of class inequality embodied so perfectly in each person that they appear more like an ensemble of caricatures Yet praise should be doled out where it is due and no element of the film deserves more praise than its cinematography Despite the shortcomings of the plot the wonderfully filmed scenes make up for them to a certain extent the symbolic staircases architectural secrets wink wink floods and lavish garden parties yielding a veritable visual extravaganza The score ebbs and flows beautifully with the pace of the film and complements each scene powerfully In summary despite deserving some credit as a timely black satire if a good old crime thriller is what you re looking for Parasite is certainly not up your alley,7.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5435911/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2020,"Sadly, Woke Culture Comes to Korea",After watching the similarly overrated Host a couple years ago I wasn t keen to jump on the bandwagon for this one But so many people told me how amazing and different it was and kept recommending that I see it So after it won all these awards and they put it back in my local theater I broke down and saw it Well that was a waste of 13 50 and two hours It s billed as a genre bending comedy drama but in my opinion it misses on both fronts There s nothing especially humorous in the dialogue or even the situations Poor family scams rich family for jobs and money Ooh that s so original except that it s not The fact that the poor family is so unsympathetic makes it just unbearable They re vile and annoying Is it a clever commentary on class structure in Korea Not really Just hamfisted platitudes The rich couple come off as far more likeable in fact As for drama there really isn t much Yeah they try to take a dark turn towards the end and there is a feeble attempt to make things dramatic but I just kept looking at my watch wondering when this bore fest would end Then it just kept dragging on And for the record I spend lots of time in Asia including Korea I ve seen lots of Asian films I have Asian relatives and an Asian spouse It s not cultural misunderstanding here I just think like that similarly shallow representation of mental illness in the even more boring Joker film people want to praise something that they think brings attention to some uncomfortable issue Guess what Variations of this class structure have existed in Korea for hundreds of years Things are better now than they were There are plenty of options that don t involve scamming and murder But if you can feel better about yourself by claiming to empathize with the lower economic stratum by suffering through this film more power to you,5.0,4.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5490761/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2020,Mastering the basics,South Korean cinema is taking more and more presence in the film industry proof of them was the last installment of the Oscars where the main protagonist of the night was the director Bong Joon ho who has made several films of diverse genres among the best known we can find Snowpiercer and Okja whose original language is in English and are productions with original content with details of great value that makes them hardly unnoticed However where this director s genius is really appreciated is in his films The Host Mother and Memories of Murder really outstanding films full of surprises and unexpected endings so in truth my emotion startled the find out that he made another movie after 10 years since the last one Parasites is one of the most acclaimed films at the Cannes festival and even won the golden palm in turn was acclaimed in the Oscar Awards and won the best film best International film and best director Like many of his previous films he manages to put elements of comedy and drama comedy is well written and inserted in such a structured way that he cannot take seriousness from the other scenes that were sometimes extremely dramatic exciting and in some terrifying parts This film is the culmination of Bong as a total author since he manages to link several genres in a total collision and thus generate the magic he looks for in one of his works because Parasites is one of those works so well spun in its history and in the way in which it is said that he manages to wrap the viewer so that he cannot get rid of the screen Like all the great movies in history I consider the experience to be better if you don t know too much about what you are going to experience I hate spoilers So I will not reveal almost anything about the plot I will only mention that several genres at the same time a comedy then a thriller and even a robbery movie It is a really ambitious film and there is too much happening in matters of messages and themes it is also incredibly well acted thanks to the depth of the characters It is a really accessible film that can be enjoyed because it is one of those films that you can show people who generally do not choose to watch Asian films since it entertains you from the beginning and never gets boring highlighting that It is taken with a beautiful cinematography the music is fantastic with proper use and all the characters add to the experience making it not feel that time is wasted Movie I would definitely see again,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5526732/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2021,An immaculately constructed critique on the class divide of the modern society and its inevitable consequences,With Parasite Bong Joon Ho once again proves that he is a master of social commentary in cinema Eventhough he has tackled several socially relevant themes in his previous movies particularly in Snowpiercer it hasn t been as immaculate as his work on Parasite With a masterfully written screenplay and flawless direction Bong has created a cleverly constructed critique on the class divisions of our society The true genius of the film lies in its subtlety Instead of presenting the themes in an on the nose manner the film utilizes several symbols and metaphors using the characters as well as the impeccable production design and blocking both of which was aided by an exceptional screenplay and one of the best usages of storyboarding in cinema The film conveys its themes entirely through these aspects with little to no reliance on exposition The theme of wealth inequality is presented through the lives of two families who are at the two extreme ends of the financial spectrum and the parasitic relationship that occurs between them One of the most notable achievements of the production design is the portrayal of the localities of the two families The Kim family lives in a congested cluttered stink bug infested frequently flooded semi basement house in the lower regions of the city relying on cheap food surrounded by crammed up houses of similar conditions On the other hand the wealthy Park family lives in a modernistic spacious well organized house with expensive possessions in a beautiful neighborhood in the upper regions of the city The best visual representation of this can be seen in the sequence where Ki woo walks up to the Park family house A cleverly placed edit suddenly transitions the gloomy congested alleyway of the slum to the sunlit spacious driveway of the Park house Another example of the brilliance of the production design is the subtle portrayal of the increasing wealth of the Kims The cheap possessions seen in the house of the Kim family in the earlier scenes are gradually replaced by more expensive objects in the subsequent scenes The movie showcases how the existing class divide in our society forces a parasitic relationship between the upper and the lower class This is best expressed through the infiltration of the Park house by the Kim family followed by them existing almost as parasites on the Park family This parasitic existence makes them temporarily rise above their hardships This is evident from the sequence where they finally manage to chase away the drunkard who constantly urinates near their doorstep symbolizing them standing up against the pathetic living conditions that have been plaguing them for years However the wealthy also live as parasites on the poor as seen by how the Parks utilizes the Kims for their needs Another aspect the movie addresses is the competition which occurs among the members of the lower class which is a direct result of parasitic relationship between the rich and the poor This is presented by the conflict that occurs between the Kims and the housekeeper and her husband Both families who live as parasites on the Parks eventually discover each other and engage in a bitter conflict with one another to claim their place as the parasite This internal competition within the lower class results in their own downfall as the ensuing conflict results in them ending up in a much worse situation than before An attempt to change this will ultimately result in the downfall of the society as a whole since the modern society is built on the existence of class divisions This is symbolized by the climatic birthday party sequence where all the three focal families suffer fatal casualties This results in the Kim family finding themselves in a much worse spot than they already were at the beginning of the film which is the eventual outcome of the internal conflict for power which occurs among the lower class The film also showcases how both the classes are affected differently by the same events This is most evident by how differently both the families are affected by heavy rain The Kims lives are nearly destroyed by the flood while the Parks view the rain as a mild inconvenience as their camping trip had to be canceled While Ki Tiek grieves the loss imposed on him by the rain Mrs Park gleefully talks about how the rain had reduced the pollution and freshened the air The film also deals with the destructive nature of false hope symbolized by the Scholar s rock which Ki woo receives from his friend The rock which promises wealth instills a false hope in Ki woo and his family This prompts them to go on this risky affair which ultimately results in their own downfall This leads to one of the most effective instances of symbolism in the film as the rock is used as weapon against Ki woo symbolizing how his hope had betrayed him By a blend of exceptional works done in the field of writing directing acting cinematography editing and production design Bong Joon Ho has constructed one of the best critiques of the modern day class divisions and wealth inequalities of the modern society Despite detesting class divisions Bong also acknowledges that such a division ultimately acts the backbone of the society Once the distinction between these classes become inconspicuous the foundation of the society will be disrupted resulting in its destruction a theme presented quite explicitly in his previous film Snowpiercer Through the eyes of the Kim family Bong Joon Ho showcases one of the sad truths about our society Due to the existing class divide the poor in search of a better life are forced to live as parasites on the rich which in turn causes an internal competitive conflict among the poor resulting in their own doom bringing them back to the same condition as before or to a much worse spot These series of events are inevitable because our society is built on this nature and any attempt to change this nature will have catastrophic results The film doesn t criticize the families for their actions Instead it criticizes the nature of the society which forced them to commit these actions,10.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6745061/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2020,The fable and the heavy hand,When it comes to social satires directors often push their awareness to the viewers as if they are unaware they are preaching to the choir Whoever saw Bong Joon Ho s Parasite will definitely agree with the director s populist political stance Now only if someone would ve told him that as well Without spoiling I can tell you that Parasite is definitely satisfying This is a thriller calculated to the nano meter equal in precision pressure unease and focus It revolves around Ki taek and his family poor unemployed and living in a semi basement some sort of small place halfway underground Forcing the metaphor I could argue that is placed symbolically to represent the clear cut line between the lower and upper classes They are poor which forces them to be clever and witty in order to survive So their plan is to attach themselves to a rich family For the sake of not spoiling I will stop here But know that Parasite touches on every single social point it tries to make It is a well defined story of class and the lack of social awareness This works in the first half of the film in which the naivete of the rich and the wit of the poor is augmented This is not done to oversimplify but for the movie to properly present its parable which by definition is a simple story But if this heavy handed approach pays off by the end it pushes the characters into unnecessary inexplicable sometimes seemingly random explosions of rage Parasite is undeniably cutting edge and modern Bong Joon Ho uses traditional fables to conceptualize and clarify the vagaries of modernity Throughout its complexion it looks decidedly simple as its frames wonder around the minimalist and polished performant Asian architecture of the privileged property where most of the movie takes place a movie as harsh with its characters as it is with its viewers,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5375203/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2019,Parasite by Bong Joon Ho,The stories about the social classes have been interestingly often explored in the books television series movies and so on Especially to see how the main characters would get through their difficulties by facing them in the line between poverty and wealth These stories often explore the theme about hope to see how the main characters who have so much will in their souls would try in all the way to help their family Some of these stories would end with the main characters who become wealthy to help their family with satisfaction Other stories would end with the main characters who are still struggling with what they are facing to without losing any hope even it would take a long time to accomplish something important The auteur filmmaker Bong Joon Ho have been interested in making a story which explores this theme As the audience have been really curious what the new movie of the filmmaker would be about once it has been announced After a long time of work in 2019 came out Parasite by Bong Joon Ho with Song Kang Ho Lee Sun Kyun Cho Yeo Jeong Choi Woo Shik and Park So Dam The movie s plot The unemployed Kim Ki woo Choi Woo Shik takes the opportunity to work as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park Family Then Kim Ki woo would slowly bring his whole family his father Kim Ki taek Song Kang Ho his mother Kim Chung sook Chang Hyae Jin and his sister Kim Ki jung Park So Dam to get each of them a job in the Park Family Until something unexpected is going to happen to get a dramatic consequence From the beginning to the end the movie would surprise the audience through the most unexpected twists especially if something wrong is going to happen then the Kim Family must find new solutions to not get in trouble In the same way the movie gets emotional to see how the Kim family is so united to never let anything to divide them The monologues and dialogues were elaborated to see how the main characters would find new plans for what they are looking for Also to let the audience feel the deep meaning of the dialogues and the monologues especially between the Kim family when they talk about important topics The camera and the lightings work to be compatible in ever single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots to make the sequences look like paintings needed for the Mise en sc nes The editing was specifically elaborated for the narration s rhythm without ruining it as well as to build tension in the most unexpected moments Song Ka Ho was extraordinary as Kim Ki taek who would be then the one to tell his son about the meaning if it is necessary or not to have plans Choi Woo Shik was excellent as Kim Ki woo who once works for Park Family he would try to make sure his family have a better life Chang Hyae Jin did a very well done job as Kim Chung sook who would do anything just for her family and not for anybody else Park So Dam was excellent as Kim Ki jung who in the course of the story would just do whatever is necessary to take important decisions The score by Jung Jaeil was elaborated to let the audience feel the thrilling moments as well as the emotional moments to be unforgettable in every single musical notes Parasite is one of the best movies of 2019 as well as one of the greatest and most unique masterpieces of all time,9.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5321083/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2019,"It'll make you laugh, cry and probably check your basement",I had no expectations walking into Parasite but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019 and it s bound to be a classic It s directed by Bong Joon ho he did Snowpiercer 2013 and Okja 2017 and now he s back with Parasite and it is fantastic From a directing standpoint this movie is gorgeous The cinematography is extremely well done It s just stunning and so metaphorical There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat My favourite aspect is the narrative I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society It was just beautiful to watch it play out with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances The characters and performances themselves are also amazing The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy I don t think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too The score and sound design by Jeong Jae il was also perfect in every scenario It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone emotion and atmosphere In regards to flaws I don t think there are any major ones with Parasite There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could ve been better explored to support it But still it didn t really bother me Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019 It s funny thrilling emotional satirical and hauntingly true It s delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core,9.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5304658/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2020,Smart and suspenseful dark comedy-thriller,Hollywood wishes it could make a movie like this Perhaps if Paul Verhoeven was still allowed to make slick satirical blockbusters like he used to they d have a shot at matching the Best Picture winner PARASITE Without going into heavy spoilers the movie follows the Kim family who are a lower class clan of con artists that have no qualms about fleecing people But they are close knit and love each other dearly Their latest scheme is their most ambitious and riskiest one yet each Kim family member will get hired by the wealthy Park family for a different occupation and pretend not to be related to one another The acting is excellent across the board The first half is very enjoyable to watch how crafty the Kims are at tricking the affluent if foolish Parks But then the second half takes a few shocking twists that threaten to upend the Kims new social standing I strongly recommend this movie it s definitely worth the hype,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5790074/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2021,Heavy-handed violence dressed up as social commentary (?),This puzzles me to no end My honest feeling is that the claim to offer some kind of social commentary is a layer of respectability varnish that serves as an excuse for filmmaker and viewer to indulge in the heavy handed violence that tickles their fancy and nobody wants to admit that because well their peers and colleague critics like it so it must be good But then again this seems so blindingly obvious that it s hard to believe that so many people fall for it I m honestly struggling with this I think being critical and voicing social commentary is good and necessary but movies like this feel rather as if it s part of the problem They re ice cold de humanising disengaging They make me care less But then again maybe I m just stupid and blind,1.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7523319/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2019,"""Call me by your Name"" meets ""The last of the Mohicans"" - a brilliant cinematic acievement",Parasite is freaking awesome It is a comedy a family drama a thriller a horror a political comentery a social drama a an action piece you have to watch it to believe it It is just every cool fun and clever movie shrinked into 2 hours and 15 minutes of pure and unstoppable laughter some masive and engaging thrills and a story about the distinctio of classes and th edynamic of a family trying to make ends meet The cinematography is really distinct andI like that Asian films have a reather common but unqiue look and tone and creates a magical atmosphere and tone The way the camera moves is so sweet and subtle the framing the long shots it is just so fun to watch The lighting is beautiful the way certain rooms are lit give a darker or lighter tone It never tries to show off and everytihng feels so organic that at one point you forget you are watching fictional characters and a made up story The soundtrack is another thing to praise of Most of the tracks are classic music and although it often feels so contradictory to the film the result is so great and so much personality was added to the movie The great thing is that despite that the characters have not such a deep arc or are given any major traits I was able to connect with them in the end and the whole film feels like a big family struggle You grow with them and graually start to care in site of their anethical and cheaty choices and actions Evey actor gives such an appealing perormance and some of their reactinons are really on spot The humour is there mostly during the first hour It is seet and it feels genuine it what family members would talk and joke about It creates an intimacy and a fun time Then we get a lot of shifts in the tone and the twists come and go and the great thing is that the film is constalnty on the go it is always moving forward and does not waste any moment and in the end the Parasite is a great story toold in the best way possible The political comentary is perfect There is actually a film that was released last and I vastly enjoyed Burning Biurning was about a trouble guy feeling mad that his friend is dating a ritch successful man and he has nobody and actually talks about class discretions in a fascinting way Parasite does the sam thing but in a different way In the movie we see a poor family trying to work together to scam some narrow minded ritch family that live in a huge house with their luxuries and all It is what Us went for but done in a more clear nd subtle way The ritch use the poor and the poor try to become the ritch You either leave in a fancy house with a garden and a maid or in the ground floor with insects and a smell It is like two different words that slowly destroy each other I will not say more Watch this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do I laughed gasped fell into thoughts I was moved and always wanted more It is a genius fraud it has several peach scenes a crazy artistic kid a birthday party and just make a plan and go watch In fact don t make a plan Just watch it,9.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5201805/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,On pure innocence,Set against an urban background bathing in pollution floods and the North South tension as an ever present echo in people s psyches Bong Joon Ho achieves a revelation of pure innocence of simple humans that are puppets of their circumstances The relentless positivity of each studied family even the little basement couple s their love and dedication to each other keeps the audience in all the way through It s hard to point the finger at any of the characters as the victim or the perpetrator except the outside forces or the cutouts posted in the hiding place of the Housekeeper s husband A Korean tradition by now masterfully applied in the Wailing and The Chaser there is an effective tonal play coating the baseline with humor which intensifies the suspense,9.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5226914/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,An Instant Classic,Parasite directed by Bong Joon Ho has become instantly ingrained into film culture already It became the first foreign film to win best picture and for good reason Parasite is one of the most original movies I ve seen in a long time From the jaw dropping suspense to the social commentary the one word I have for this movie is meticulous The film follows the poor Kim family as they hatch a scheme to infiltrate the very wealthy Park family The concept is simple enough but the story both subverts and exceeds your expectations as the plot snowballs out of control The movie is a showcase at building suspense As the movie goes on the tension grows higher and higher until we get the payoff in the climax The movie s script is just so great The characters are written profoundly and every scene means something to all the characters the themes and the story The cinematography in this is also really great Another thing that really stands out is the messaging and how it is conveyed The audience is treated with the upmost respect from director Bong Joon Ho as he never is heavy handed delivering this social theme The theme is conveyed is symbolism and metaphors and it works amazingly I really loved Parasite and it is probably a close second for my favorite movie of the year after The Irishman It is definitely somewhere in my top 15 favorite movies of the decade if not too 10 The movie is extremely creative original and meticulously created I m happy to say that Parasite stands amongst some of the greatest foreign films ever made 9 5 10,9.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5844412/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,Definitely worth your time!,When I watched this film I was impressed and I really liked it but I wasn t blown away I left after seeing it thinking yeah I get it but after sleeping on it I really found myself understanding the film properly The way it s written is exceptional and I d never seen anything quite like it the seamless jumps between genre really caught me off guard I never knew what to expect and going into the film without knowing a thing about it I was pretty shocked From comedy to thriller I was on the edge of my seat The thing that really sold me on it being a good film however was the ending Sad hopeful but ultimately a fantasy A bitter bitter fantasy I mean what a way to end I will say though that there were about ten times while watching that I was expecting the credits to roll Ultimately this probably wouldn t be my first choice when sitting down to watch a movie nor would I normally choose to go see a film like this is theatres but boy did I enjoy it I think everyone should at some point in their life see this film but I don t think everyone will enjoy it,7.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5500590/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,Overlong,I found this film overlong The film starts off well and the first half is light as the poorer family invagle themselves into the richer family However at this point the film takes a tonal shift and whilst this is understandable it jars with what has gone before The film takes an age to end which I found irritating,6.0,2.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5469107/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2020,One of the best films I have seen to date.,Solely based on social inequality and the consequences of capitalism Parasite is a film that demonstrates indirect friction between opposite social classes Bong Joon Ho was writing in an attempt to reveal that Korea isn t as glamorous as one would think this is shown from the massive social gap between the Parks and Kims from one of his press interviews but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening The younger generation in particular feels a lot of despair I think this is quite ironic as we saw the younger individuals were more likely to proceed into becoming slightly successful as they were the ones that secured the jobs for their whole family also going back to the statement about the poor widening but what stood in the way was another poor family who had the same idea but in the end both had different morals which ultimately lead to the demise of both poor families This is just one of the reasons why this film was so incredible because even just talking about it sounds poetic and satisfying,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5665011/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2019,what a waste,Simply for me its the worst movie of Bong Joon ho Plot has a multiple and serious goofs and all the screenplay seems to be a pretension for the director writer to express all of his ideas about injustice and cruelty of modern Korea and of course the world In order to do that in good cinematic manner a writer should first write a good screenplay that the plot twists come from the characters and believable situations and then the director visualizes it in his point of view to accomplish his ideas something we saw in great Ken Loach movie I Daniel Blake I exampled this movie because it has same theme about injustice Of course Bong Joon ho is a great writer director and i love Memories of Murder Mother and Snowpiercer but after seeing this movie i was disappointed as simple as that,4.0,10.0,26.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5190477/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2023,I found this while looking for parasyte,I feel bad for people who refuse to watch foreign films purely because they don t want to read subtitles and whatnot because they are really missing out For the first half of this movie it s great just a story about a poor family who tries to integrate themselves into the lifestyle of a Rich family The second half is like really weird though but I enjoyed it Does it deserve all the praise it gets Honestly I d say yes Like this is one of the best onscreen portrayals of economic inequality and corruption of wealth I ve ever seen The ending is brilliant but I wouldn t even call it bong joon he s best 10 10,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9443462/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2021,The Art at its finest,This movie is pretty good The score and cinematography combine to create a lucid sense of reality bringing a more artsy nature that is just jaw dropping It s genuinely beautifully shot The camera angles combined with how the focus shifts depending on the characters feeling or emotion is something to marvel Also manages to transform a fairly bland aesthetic to a dream like image through the lighting and focus making bland canvases into something they aren t an idea through the movie The way Kang Ho Song and Bong Joon Ho create emotion through the facial expressions twitched and little reactions is superb I do feel the final act was slightly forced as he almost feels it needs to happen but this is negligible compared to the rest of the movie Probably the most invested and immersed I ve been in a movie for a while It also creates tension and suspense up there with some of the best ever It also creates an uneasy nature the whole way through keeping you in the edge of your seat the whole time The humor ranges from really dark to almost slapstick which perfectly exemplifies the characters development through the movie giving a greater understanding of the characters,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6577541/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2023,"Suspense, philosophy and professionalism.",The movie Parasite is about a poor Korean family that finds a way to earn money by working in a rich family s house However more secrets are revealed sooner or later behind the kindness and generosity of everyone in the Pak family s house and among their employees I ll try to keep everything laconically The movie gives a viewer a glimpse of a wonderful director s work I really liked how Mr Bong Joon ho chose the angles and points of view in this story Considering that the movie is a thriller a drama and particularly a horror the camera flows and moves in a way that calms down the viewer and lets him her dive into the film It is also significant to mention that the way suspense was kept and increased was special The viewer doesn t understand the concept in the beginning but closer to the end the curtain is moved apart I recommend that you pay close attention to the majority of the scenes because there are some hidden clues and social problems in South Korea presented One example is the social inequality between the rich and the poor and how inhumane people can behave toward each other Lastly the movie is special in the way it shows the differences in how people think about and contemplate their own lives For instance being rich doesn t always mean being smart Moreover the movie will definitely make your emotions mix To clarify some scenes can be considered funny others are heart touching and scary Do not prepare for something monotonous One thing that made me dissatisfied was the ending I won t implement any detailed spoilers so don t worry However the ending totally twisted the way I personally looked at the main character and the story itself It suddenly turned from a suspenseful drama to a massacre which from my point of view didn t give the story more color To conclude shortly I truly recommend this movie for those who seek a worthy thriller with a story twist and an unexpected ending Therefore it doesn t concern those who watch with great attention to details Believe me clues and details will bring you to your destination much faster Thank you for reading my review Ibrahim R Manafov 2023,9.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8860241/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,A cruel allegory for the truth of society,At the beginning of the close to the real life segment is a very common introduction technique in Korean films The long slow shot passes through the cramped living space on the ground floor and the characters are drawn one by one In the cluttered and narrow semi basement the plot of searching for network signals and pizza boxes soon leads the viewer smoothly into the narrative atmosphere of life The combination of deliberate camera speed and quick message delivery is so precise that it has proven the power of director bong joon ho When stepping into the mansion that moment parasites and the real story gradually away but into the structure and framework of social fable That doesn t mean the director has given up on story and suspense though It s certainly not the freehand brushwork of burning which won critical acclaim last year but lost popularity but it s similar to the metaphors and hints in snowpiercingly and even to the themes of class and destiny An undetected basement like that set by many science fiction works becomes a space device that isolates the class and tests humanity The passage about family education can naturally get heated discussion from domestic audiences who are in the middle of anxiety The depiction of high asset families in the film is a kind of deliberate label misreading which makes all members look silly and indifferent which is obviously not true But the director quickly deflects the viewer s confusion with exquisite technical expertise First of all the suspense and conflict in the script are constantly pushed forward which makes the audience hardly pay attention to the serious injury in the life picture which also becomes an important evidence to question its commercial genre But I have to admit that this is the subtlety of the script every character has realized their own appearance deduction transformation and account every props given to the camera whether stone secret door tea table or induction lamp have been effectively used become an important force to promote the story What is exquisite is the scene itself The three important locations of poor families rich people s villas and underground secret rooms are all arranged in a very real and rich way The seemingly random close ups can accurately present the emotions of each scene and the differences between each other The stylization of the scene also serves as a metaphor for the theme just like the strange smell that the host keeps saying which is the smell of poverty and the significant difference of different living conditions It brings out the heart of separation hidden under the surface of kindness builds up estrangement and hatred and finally promotes the explosion of the ending Of course technical sophistication was not enough to get the jury s approval The emotional tension at the heart of the film comes from the characters examination of their own lives from the warmth and kindness that cannot dissolve the estrangement from the tears in the eyes of a poor father as he looks back at his home in the flood and from the tragic conflict facing the family of four after a brief period of joy The film also jumped out of the suspense genre with some depth to cause thinking The mislabeling of the high class is also highlighted in these passages which is an unavoidable wound in the film But like snow train bong joon ho has always been reluctant to disrupt the plot with lyricism and pauses This preserves the tension and integrity of the story but it can also hurt the meaning and attitude that the fable itself hopes to convey Butler s rainy night visit to the line and joy and sadness both before and after contrast so bright even fantasy is over the boy out of the warmth of the segment the film to be presented by the split opposition and despair has carefully through setting suspense infiltrated the viewer s heart it s almost no moralizing paragraph but through the story of extremes is like a knife cut the surface of society will be more deep vein and the body When the story is over who lives in a dark room and who travels in the sun like an insect everyone may have found the answer The reflection and emotion gained from the fable can also provide richer support for the following life choices,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5339238/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,A Dramatic Shift Halfway Into the Movie,Parasite is actually very artistic in the way it essential splits into two movies The first half of the movie focuses on the family s strengths and successes is more lighthearted and could be described as more of a comedy The plot twist happens at the exact halfway point to the minute where the underlying plot is revealed The tone dramatically shifts to become more serious uneasy and dark The second half of the movie is more of a drama and horror slasher with a series of violent deaths and sad truths uncovered The class divide becomes more evident and while the first half of the movie was more hopeful the second half feels more hopeless,10.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8837806/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,K-Blockbuster: Cinematic K-Pop,I came to see this hyped out title and was expecting to see it flop only to be amazed by its brilliance and cinematography Simplicity without a doubt is the ultimate sophistication I feel Parasite was an infastation to Western cinematography taking all tip awards and leaving nothing behind Eastern cinema has a lot more to offer than cheesy martial arts and special effects and Parasite is the gateway towards this level of cinematic appreciation This movie portrays a lower class family making ends meet and struggling to survive in a capitally oriented world by skipping into the higher layer of society Although they have less to show they are more of a family than their higher class counterpart living the life of riches without ever fully experiencing any of it together In a way it blends and clearly separates these two worlds similair in essence but completely different in reality It is a manifesto on class struggles and how social stratification represents an unpenetrable rock wall where a lifetime is not enough to break free and move to a higher layer Because of this you are forced to become a parasite and take from others to grow or remain a parasite of society and depend on the generousity of the Rich In the end one has to wonder if Capital is a true parasite of our lives taking our focus from the importance of the human experience and manipulating our life s purpose as it pleases,10.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5515963/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2020,"from ""iQ-filmovi"" at blogspot",Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020 the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon Hu not because of some special quality and originality but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films nor was he ever interested in being one On the other hand Bong Joon Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013 so the criteria should be in line with that fact The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch drinkable extraordinarily driven It is placed between comedy drama and thriller intelligently refusing to classify itself as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible He will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars except for acting because there is no reason for that But there is also no reason to emphasize the over originality of the story itself ie screenplay because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement s Joy House aka The Cage of Love with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda The main thrust of Joon Hu s film is taken from the title with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere which of course is so modern today but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons Also in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before just remember the contribution in directing of the 2015 award winning plagiarism The Revenant there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year,5.0,3.0,25.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5406959/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2020,Decent but not the best movie out of South Korea,I ve been watching Korean movies for more than 10 years The only people who think this was a great movie are people who have never seen a Korean movie South Korean movies are edgier and smarter than anything Hollywood produces Parasite There was no class discrimination in this movie What I saw was a bunch of pariahs preying on a very trusting very naive family ignorant to the plot unfurling at their expense These people ruined the livelihood of nice people who had job security They lied to this family And the family paid the price As for the man who held his nose wasnt the parasitic family in raw sewage the night before That said this movie will keep you in suspense But again it s not the best Korean movie I have ever seen If you want to see a good korean movie watch The Man from Nowhere or Handphone or A Company Man You can watch Oldboy or Mother These movies are all available on prime You to see how parasite pales in comparison to just his hand for the movies Hollywood take note,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5692112/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,A Very Cynical Movie,The Movie have a few very interessting situations in which the audience don t know if it should laugh or be serious It s a Arthouse Movie and not a Blockbuster with very much action in it The camera the location and the story of the movie a very good The house of the rich family reminds me a little bit at the house in the movie Ex Machina The style of the movie is similiar to other korean movies like Burning or Oldboy,8.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5203983/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2019,Another bong masterpiece,Thought provoking self reflective socio economic critique Highly entertaining film that mixes genre styles or tropes giving a wholesome movie watching experience The agony of poverty and class inferiority is the raging theme of Parasite At first knowing the title of the film and the directors previous films i thought this was going to be a Apocalyptic virus outbreak kind of film But it turns out a metaphor for the plot of the story A poor family finds a rich family and slowly becomes a part of their house and their life and in the end the parasite does what a parasite does,8.0,2.0,20.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5048505/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2020,Gripping but foreseeable,While Parasite had great cinematography and was gripping from start to finish the movie lacked proper closure and wasn t executed greatly The conclusion lacked any relation and was uneventful This movie which so profoundly tries to highlight social class differences failed in creating a movie with a logical ending and turned into a sappy melodrama almost painful to watch,6.0,2.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5500273/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2020,Just perfect cinematography,A lot of people don t think it s fair that parasite won at the 2020 oscars But you know what I think they absolutely did The cinematography is just out of this world And just when you think you got the plot all winded up your finger the thread spins right off and the movie takes a MASSIVE turn Like holy the fact that the old maid came back was weird but when her fricking husband was just chilling in the basement DAMN The script is just so gorgeous and detailed The way were everything is planned out the way it should be with a good movie Each line fits perfectly in every scene and everything is so balanced out From the beginning of the movie i felt like everything had already fallen into place The actors are so good Obviously i d never heard of them but omg so good You should really watch those cheesy videos about 10 things you ve missed in but in this movie it s actually really interesting Like the part where there is always a slight line in shots between the wealthy and poor people which makes sense to the line that the rich dad said he always seems to cross the line but ends up to just not do it It s a small detail but when you pay attention to it it all starts making sense Or the realisation point in the end where Kim was now hiding in the basement was so mesmerising The way they played back every move he took to get there Also when they needed to get rid of the maid every scene perfectly balanced out with the previous and next one Everything fitted into everything Just perfect,10.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5516060/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2021,Mediocre and overrated,Doesn t take much to please people nowadays I don t buy the deep multi layered metaphorical masterpiece others talk about It was a fairly simplistic commentary given the runtime on social class tensions That s it Interesting plot but I feel it could have been delivered in a much more captivating way I found the pace excruciating after a while once I understood the general message Wasted opportunity Those giving it a 10 are not on this planet,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7109518/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2020,A Cringe-Worthy Disappointment,This film is what happens massive amounts of government funding is poured into a local film welfare system since it now seems fashionable to have disdain for the west these days most people in the west are practicing telescopic art appreciation and the general public had been dumbed down to the point that Hollywood can t make a dime with anything other than comic book characters This film is visually dull and predictable The characters are uni dimensional and unrealistic and the plot is beyond implausible It is Kung Fu Hustle without all the charm and CGI My disbelief remained un suspended through the entire cringe fest This film is beyond bad It is insulting,1.0,7.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5847478/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2020,I'm being fair with a 6; 7 would have been generous,Nothing special Decent but could have cast more actors that didn t look like they were acting Kang ho Song Ki Taek and Hye Jin Gang Chung Sook were great Not one scene of theirs looked forced Can t say that about anyone else as they all had moments where they looked like they were acting I understand the metaphorical meaning and depth of the film which made it decent I can handle can t place it in just one genre idea However there just is not enough there to make it Best Picture of the year The powers that be were reaching to award something just to make their own point I think It s not even in the same category as Joker and I typically don t like films that are gloomy and 70 s ish looking but Joker was much better and was even similar to Parasite in some of it s lessons on humanity I m not saying Joker should be Best Picture either because I didn t see hundreds of movies last year to make that call but it was the best I saw in 2019 If you can either understand the spoken language of Parasite or don t mind reading subtitles then it s worth seeing partially for the meaning partially to say you saw it partially so you can see for yourself that an ok movie can win Best Picture Tune out the idea that you ll watch a comedy or a drama or a thriller or a horror movie its a blending of a lot of things,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5660660/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2020,A masterpiece!,After a long time watched a movie which can go into so many different genres making it a masterpiece Being a non English film winning an Oscar sure explains it This starts out as an entertaining casual comedy but with the surprising plot twists this dives deep into a strong comparison of the wealth gap and the psychological states between social classes especially portraying the rage of the lower class Other than those the cinematography lighting foreshadowing of events the plot were outstanding This film gave me a feeling similar to that of the ending of Breaking Bad Won t give out any spoilers this is a must watch film for anyone This will probably go down in history as one of the best movies of all time,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5695044/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2019,Meaningless But Technically Good Film,This film is not the great film that some say Given we are so lost in class conflict reviewers act as if this says something about class and privilege It doesn t beyond a few obvious scenes of class resentment It also shows the bad influence of Tarantino by ending the film with idiotic and meaningless violence It is clear that Hollywood like the rest of America is brutal in the way it cuts out any real mention of class so a film that highlights some obvious aspects of class conflict is seen as something special This film is not special and Snowpiercer was far better The rich are too clueless in this film the rich are never this clueless they are savage in the protection of their wealth just look at the state of the world And things happen without reason Why would the maid let the maid in at night who was fired Why wouldn t the rich check references on the people they let in their house Why would the rich home owner accuse the driver without any real evidence Still there are some great scenes some memorable lines,4.0,7.0,18.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5262827/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,If not for the ending...,This movie was engaging and even suspenseful at times The acting and directing are both very well done But the ending is over the top pathetic Had I known I wouldn t have invested 2 hours of my life for an utterly useless contribution to anything good Pass Save your 2 hours of life Go for a walk Rewatch Dumb and Dumber you ll feel smarter than after wasting time on this attempt at a ground breaking movie The Oscar win proves that Hollywood is morally bankrupt and void of ideas,1.0,12.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5504526/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2020,"Entertaining, but I didn't like the message",The one thing I got from this movie is that Bong Joon ho must really hate rich people This is even more obvious when you consider that his other notable film is basically about the same thing Rich vs poor This is a bit odd considering he has a net worth of 30 million dollars This movie is about a poor family that lies and weasels their way into the service of a rich family In doing so they not only screw over several people but also murder a few of them in the process And yet at the end of the film we re supposed to feel that all of this is somehow justified Or maybe we re not supposed to feel that it s justified because I sure didn t Not really sure why it got so much praise Could be because we are living in a time when the majority of movies being made are superheros or reboots Thats basically the only thing this movie has going for it It was entertaining and well made but I didn t like the ending at all,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6367820/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2020,Not as good as they say it is.,I think the hype that they created for this movie was what caused me to build my expectations when I started watching the movie and I was kind of waiting for something to happen that would blow my mind as the story progresses But that moment never came It just seemed to be just an ordinary movie and does not deserve the hype The movie is completely overrated watch it for yourself and tell me I am wrong There was another reviewer who gave a low rating that said did we watch the same movie That s exactly the feeling I got after watching the movie Rating wise it s probably not a 3 but a 5 or 6 at best but I am so disappointed after watching the movie that I couldn t resist scoring it low,3.0,6.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5484322/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2020,Solid but over-hyped.,This film is very nicely shot and had some entertaining moments in it The cast are great and the story has some unexpected twists Overall I would definitely recommend watching it however I really can t understand how it won best picture and best director at the academy awards In that sense the film is quite mediocre as it doesn t leave a lasting impression as most Oscar winning films do My guess is the Academy lording diversity at the risk of social criticism,7.0,3.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5487947/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,Absolute masterpiece,I came to know about this movie after it has won Oscars and immediately decided to watch it Let s just appreciate the entire cast and the director of course I didn t read any reviews before watching this movie because i didn t wanted to be spoiled and biased So i straightaway watched the entire movie today and i can say that now why it is called PARASITE The title is metaphorically used in this film just like parasite first acquires the host body and divides into multiple cells and eats the host cells for existence but sometimes immune system of body fights back eventually killing some parasites cell that s what depicted in the movie but in the end it is parasite cell that won The oral sex was also perfectly setup to show us the uncomfortable and uneasy position Kim was stuck in The scout reference from starting was also to carry out the ending scene BTW i am from India so if any of you can suggest me 5 near to best Korean movies compare to this one then reply me,8.0,4.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5481468/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2020,Stunningly original tale of rich and poor,Bong Joon ho s masterful film Parasite is a wicked and brutal satire about wealth disparity The film s setup has a poor family the Kims infiltrating the lives of a wealthy family the Parks by becoming their new employees Kim Ki woo Woo sik Choi is legitimately a tutor for the Parks daughter Da hye Jung Ziso but he uses his standing to then usher in his sister Ki jung So dam Park who poses as an art tutor for the Parks young son Da song Hyun jun Jung The Kim kids then frame the Parks driver for being a creep which allows them to bring in their own father Ki taek Kang ho Sang for the job Finally the family gets rid of the Parks housekeeper Moon gwang Jeong eun Lee by making her seem sickly due to a peach allergy which paves the way for the Kims mother Chung sook Hye jin Jang to get the gig The Parks don t learn that the Kims are related and everything seems to be going fine until they learn that Moon gwang has been hiding her husband Geun se Myeong hoon Park in the Parks basement What makes the twist in Parasite so great is that it s as predictable as it is impossible to see coming The basement in question is featured only twice in the film for less than a minute before its actual role is revealed But it s a twist that doesn t feel out of question as we ve seen it happen already just through the eyes of another family What makes Parasite so perfect is that it understands the rules and power of storytelling Everything on screen has a specific purpose and a meaning that transforms the story as it unpacks And it s ironic that as brilliant as Bong s plan for the story is the genius of Parasite lies in the 10 minute sequence where an entire plan is demolished on sight,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5723731/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,Underwhelming,I m sure I ll get hated to the hill for this but this wasn t a masterpiece It was well acted from what I could tell Without knowing Korean it s certainly possible I m missing nuances of language that I correct in my own mind through the subtitles I ve seen others defending the second half of the movie but that really is where it goes off the rails We were enjoying it up until the party started Then nothing makes much sense It completely separates the plot into 2 distinct movies the 2nd of which isn t that good The movie explains most of its nuance and message with plot devices that work out just right to explain themselves But they re just plot devices And the end plays out as if we re supposed to be happy at the reunion He killed someone that did nothing to him except tell his own wife he smells Snowpiercer and Train to Busan were better movies tho they suffered from the same poor ending problem But those endings were 5 10 minutes long not 30 All in all I really wanted to love this like everyone else does but neither myself nor my wife did come the end I understand subtlety but it really seems like people are digging so deep for it that they re applying things that even the director never intended Maybe that s the abstract nature of it I m not Roger Ebert,6.0,4.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5501975/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2020,All in one!,Amazing film completely worthy of the Oscars it won It did not follow the typical three act story instead it is like watching two movies in one the first part a comedy or satire the second part was more like a thriller However the screenplay and the photography made both parts feel as a whole During the 132 minute movie it put the audience through many different emotional states It is a movie that develops many topics resulting from the capitalist world and the increasing difference of the wealth of the rich people and the misery of the poor It explains the differences between the social classes emphasizing not only how the opportunities are different for both but also how climate change affect them differently However is not the typical movie that romanticizes the working class but rather show them with disunity among them and as people who live from the wealth of their masters and do not hesitate to smash others for a little bit of wealth Moreover both classes do not seem to understand nor show some care among them The wealthy people live from the work of the poor while the poor live from the wealth of the rich then who is the parasite are there more than one Another thing the director shows in this movie is the social death resulting from poverty All this is shown in screen through a complex yet understandable symbolism and the mood is perfectly settled with the music The photography and editing is also really good my favorite part was a montage with combined more than 20 scenes A piece of art to enjoy,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5544796/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2020,Corona or corona,I couldn t help but be drawn to this movie after the opening scenes depicting the never ending struggle to find a good wifi signal The film shone it s true colors though and expressed what to expect when a man nonchalantly sprayed the streets with disinfectant as the family watched on Followed closely by the family sitting around enjoying a beer I think someone has caught the Corona virius The family although quite quirky manage to surgically insert themselves into the lives of another But they re not the only ones This dark comedy left little to be desired with a well rounded cast The ending was straight out nightmare With a touch of the comidic and a flourish of hope Favorite scene cigarette on the toilet while the house goes under Ps Just be sure to skip the naughty bit at 1hr 28 for the kids,8.0,3.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5479733/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2020,It was also a well-completed and well-expressed popular film,It was also a well completed and well expressed popular film but the palm did find it unworthy I don t deny it at all but I do n t think it s necessary to retell it I think there are great shortcomings in three aspects 1 the development of the plot is not logical 2 expression means symbolic meaning is too straightforward low level 3 theme is not deep First look at the first generally speaking a story is very strong film for the development of the plot in line with the basic logic is a minimum requirement Of course I fully agree that there is a de facto logical sacrifice required for thematic expression and dramatic effects But the parasite s sacrifice did not achieve the same thematic expression which is not ok For example the placement of four family members into wealthy families which accounts for almost one third of the films was dramatic and smooth When the first day of the male master s visit when suddenly the spirit of his sister when suddenly put forward I feel wonderful feel very clever because after all received a salary more than the previous tutor it is normal to double this salary But then it was arranged a little bit and it was so smooth Second if the smooth entry into the mansion is needed for the development of the plot then these people can also be qualified for the mansion job seems even more fake The rich s nannies and drivers are n t so good especially nannies who have been working with former builders for years to get used to the job And the whole conversation and manner the slum environment living in the old couple can not be unmasked Of course the director did not fail to take this into account adding Song Kanghao at home rehearsals and the male owner complained about Song Kanghao on the edge of the play But it is still not enough and the overall logical rationality is very fragile Third the night of the camping scene drink all know four people in the living room drink wine and even broke over the wine cup can taste it the hostess did not even notice even on the sofa hit a shot all over the glass residue was only a sweep of Kim Kiting a simple treatment also unaware this is basically intolerable illogical There are a lot of such examples I admit that some are necessary but in the overall advance the director did too much to advance In particular the final garden battle frankly speaking is it necessary this ending does not feel a little abrupt this is the director stall spread out there is no way to solve the outcome of the conflict created by the climax of the solution ah And the end of the garden battle is the same leaving the people in need one to stay in the basement to write the other to receive letters outside And Song Kanghao also did not know when his son can come to see so every day to knock on the Morse code that lights flash all night our German residents do not find someone to repair Forget it you can t stop,7.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5559064/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2020,A Movie about differences between different class in our society and climate change,South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon ho already has an impeccable track record but he s stepped up his game with this brilliant powerfully revealing social satire Certainly Parasite might feel uneven to some audiences because of its radical shifts in tone from clever comedy to violent dark tragedy but it s more likely that Bong has executed everything as planned Each insignificant detail from the young boy Da song s love of Native Americans to a peach allergy to the Kim family s sad little half basement apartment has been planted for some specific exacting reason Cleanly and slickly constructed Parasite takes perverse pleasure in scamming the rich during its leisurely funny first half and that pleasure is contagious When the second half comes it s not only a narrative shock but it also forces viewers to ask hard questions about why the first half was so enjoyable In earlier films Bong slyly explored the impact that humans have had on our environment In Parasite he looks at an even bigger picture He wonders why humans tend to look away from or insulate themselves from others troubles and suffering In this movie reaching the high ground is certainly desirable but those occupying the low ground aren t going anywhere,9.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5699113/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2020,Quite frankly brilliant,This movie has it all From a fascinating and creative storyline to intriguing characterisation Bong Joon Ho captures the prevalent topics of greed and class based discrimination Although many were not a fan of the films later half personally I enjoyed the exciting new developed dynamic that Ho presents He entertains the viewer through immensely tense scenes that keep one on their toes wondering where the plot is travelling One can truly marvel at this accomplishment and the vast majority of people will I think be perfectly content with the way that it finishes,9.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6278317/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2019,Interesting mix of genres,It s hard to define the genre of this movie It starts as a subtle and enjoyable comedy before veering into overdone goriness Reminded me of Chinese cinema of the 70ies The theme of the movie is quite interesting and seems to be preoccupying more Korean directors cfr Burning from Chang dong Lee the abusive crossing of social class lines Too bad for the ending My rating would have been higher would that have been subtle too Still the movie is good and enjoyable,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5203609/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2020,Masterpiece!? Please! It was interesting though...,I ll try and keep this shortish For reference I think there are at least 3 films of 2019 that were better than parasite including Once Upon a Time in Hollywood The Irishman and The Joker If you re not the kind to often seek out great original content than I can imagine why you might think this movie is really some kind of unique fresh gem But there are too many plot conveniences and unrealistic character behaviors to really class this as The greatest film of the decade Not by a mile Having said that I found the movie had several interesting threads and themes going on some of which resolved and some which were probably the most interesting went nowhere ie the young rich kids role among other things That was slightly disappointing I think the so called class divide commentary was there but not to the extent that everyone raves It showed more that there is not such a simple black and white difference between the two which I appreciate But I think the class divide actually provided more a part of the organic scenery than a driving force of the film Overall I m glad I saw it but I would have rather just watched it at home than paid to see it in gold class Does that make me a bad person,6.0,2.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5506135/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,Comic strip drivel.,Some great films have won the best picture Oscar and some not so great films I think this is a candidate for the worst film to win the award in recent decades If you like comic strip then take it as that and enjoy it Have a laugh Otherwise its utter shallowness and the revelation of how deeply preposterous the acclaim is that has been given to its facile and puerile social commentary made me feel that I had been conned into taking my seat in the cinema,1.0,3.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7883890/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2020,Overrated just like most other movies on this website,This is not the first movie ever to try and combine 5 6 different genres and be jack of all trades Each one I ve seen so far failed and this one is no exception The story is rather simple and movie is simply too long for such simple story If they made it like let s say a 90 minutes long gory comedy it would be just fine probably worth seeing but definitely not a masterpiece or the best movie of 2019,6.0,0.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428677/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2020,"Entertaining and good, but very overrated",A good movie with an appealing enough plot that has some interesting twists However nothing justifies a Best Picture award No outstanding performances no memorable soundtrack not even the sets photography are good enough to leave a lasting impression Plain and simple its a solid script that entertains for its duration with a somewhat critical view of society which people who think of themselves as movie critics will cling on to justify that this movie can win Best Picture award especially being paired up against Joker and 1917 both of which are vastly superior in every aspect,7.0,4.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5473195/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2021,Brilliant storytelling - Definition of a Modern Kafka-esque film,I loved this film It s one of those films that astonish you and make you think about the film much after it has ended It studies class divide in a post modern world and has so many elements to it that one needs to watch a video explaining the film Sometimes it may feel over exaggerating but I can t fault the director for this style which does truly make him the Kafka of our times Thank you for the film of the year and congratulations on being the first foreign language film to win the Oscar,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6469765/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,A surprise and a disappointment,I am a little astonished at the high praise this movie has received The film starts from a good idea for a story has good actors and beautiful takes I found it pleasant and amusing up to approximately two thirds of its duration In the first part of the movie we are confronted with the ability of the poor to scam the rich and a comic presentation of the rich exposing their naivety and manias The plot seems to change in nature after the servants are lead down to the underground bunker by the former housekeeper In fact that moment is a turning point into chaos of the plot I mean My limit of disbelief was then reached Moreover none of the interpretations of the movie that I ve read about in other reviews e g A metaphor of class struggle a concern with wild capitalism climate change and whatever seems reasonable or applicable because they are not compatible with the story and characters description so far My interpretation is that simply the final sections of the script are uninspired and pointless I learnt with surprise the day after having seen the movie that Parasite won the Oscar for the best film,6.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8674413/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2020,Certainly overrated,I was really impressed by the direction no doubt and few other aspects of the movie but certainly not worth of Oscar Just a normal movie which was going good until everything went beyond reality and started going haywire Would have been much better if it have kept the thrilling story of their play in other difficult situations without being all gory at the end Overall good till 1 30 hrs Later it s just not amazing Too much overrated Don t know why they don t consider other masterpieces coming from third world countries,7.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5686249/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2023,oddly unique and great movie,This kind of interrogation might still feel as effective in a gloomier more self serious film but Bong has somehow mastered the art of mining powerful messages in the midst of hair raisingly entertaining set pieces breathtaking action sequences and daffy character development The balance he strikes between the grave sincerity of his subject matter and the agile levity and stimulating smarts of his filmmaking gifts regularly reveals a deeply spiritual artist one who wants audiences to pay attention but who also knows that getting audiences to transform often requires age old stories to be told in freshly affecting ways Parasite burrows far deeper than most films dealing with economic disparity Its sheer weirdness and wit undergird a profound meditation on the rancid decay at the core of a society that turns up its nose at the stench of truth It invites exploration of what lies beneath the politely accepted status quos of wealth and poverty with the force of an inevitable revolution Like the striving family at its center Parasite is not to be underestimated and will never be forgotten,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8910471/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2023,Ayn Rand Would Love This...,The director seems to have a bone to pick with poor folks He s like Hey look poor people are just freeloaders living off the sweat of the rich It s as if he believes the rich are the hardworking upstanding citizens while the poor are just leeches But wait it gets better The movie practically screams Rich people are awesome and they totally earned all their wealth Yeah right Most of us know it s often about nepotism and inheriting stuff not blood sweat and tears The director might as well be the president of the Ayn Rand fan club shouting Greed is good As for the movie itself forget about comedy or horror it s just plain bonkers and uncomfortable to watch Imagine sitting down to watch if you re barely living and making it If you are a maid Is this what your boss thinks of you as a maid It s like the poor cannot be trusted That s a recipe for some serious awkwardness And don t even get me started on Cannes It s like a gathering of eccentric artists who think they re creating something groundbreaking But honestly most of the recent award winning movies like this one are just plain junk So if you re looking for a good laugh or a spine tingling scare Parasite might not be your cup of tea It s more like a cup of confusing uncomfortable and downright weird,1.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9337703/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2023,Multifaceted fantastic film,After seeing Parasite I thought the film was perhaps a 7 or 8 out of 10 but having slept on it I ve decided it s a 9 or 10 And now over a year after I originally watched and reviewed the film although I ve only watched it once I d say it s one of my favourite films This review will be full of spoilers I think fewer expectations will improve the viewing experience The reason my opinion of the film went up overnight is that it gives the audience plenty to think over I believe it can be interpreted in many different ways Like any great artwork it is filled with memorable details I think there is a hidden meaning to the film but at the same time it is a fun film to watch You could watch this film at a purely surface level and enjoy the experience but I believe there is some kind of allegorical aspect to the film A famous allegory would be Animal Farm which is about animals taking over a farm but which is actually about the Russian Revolution and the USSR There is no such obvious allegory to Parasite but I do believe there is a hidden meaning The main thing that points to allegory is the strangeness of the story particularly at the moment of greatest drama where the father kills his employer virtually unprovoked Really what we see here as an audience is that the disgust which the wealthy man feels to his employee is more hurtful than the murder and severe wounding of the poor man s children At the surface level we can see this is a film about class Very visibly we can see the people living in or just below the gutter contrasted with the splendor of wealth The film largely tells the story of a poor family taking over several servants jobs in the household of a wealthy family The poor family are able to do so through insider connections and duplicity in a way which entirely conforms to the saying it s not what you know it s who you know There are few job interviews just recommendations and so the people with contacts are rewarded while the people with skills are not aware there is a job vacancy And how is one to interpret the word parasite Who is the parasite Let me state here that in one interpretation of communism the wealthy class i e The land owners and shareholders are parasites living off of the wealth of the workers But in this film the wealthy man appears to be a hard worker so presumably he s not the parasite Is it the poor family who takes over the servant jobs of the house The poor father certainly reacts angrily to being compared to a cockroach They are the most obvious candidates Also the cook s husband who lives in the cellar is a parasite who lives off the scraps of the wealthy family and who also lives off of the work of his wife Even the ditzy wealthy wife might be thought a parasite who lives off of her husband The poor husband Mr Kim makes some enigmatic comments to the wealthy husband about the wife and whether he really loves her The wealthy husband talks of him over stepping the mark While playing Indians he does pretty much say to Mr Kim something like I m paying you to be here don t overstep the mark in other words we are not equals Visually this is a good looking film imaginitive camera angles As an audience we can feel the moments of panic the fear of being caught hiding around the house There are parts of the film I didn t understand but which presumably make sense to Koreans like the meaning of that ornamental rock Anyway a great film highly recommended,10.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9021610/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2021,"PARASITE - The less you know , the more you will be surprised!",First of all let me tell you my experience about Parasite Back in time as everyone was talking I thought okay it has to be something special that s why everyone is recommending and on top of that the film won Best Picture in Cannes film festival was also nominated by Oscar in couple of categories Also won several awards in Golden Globes And when there is so much hype about something obviously we all want to watch it immediately But as it was not released in India I had no options other than to wait Finally after huge public demand they released the film in several multiplexes Sadly on a very low scale After some time I watched it and My God What an experience I was just looking at screen with my wide eyes open throughout the runtime I wanted to understand what Director is trying to convey through it I had my imagination about it like oh it ll be some commercial sci fi alien film or zombie action film you know something like that But HELL NO It was nothing like that infact not even close With every upcoming scene my all the imagination was fading away like a weathery cloud As if the Director made it just to prove me wrong Jokes apart but it was really unexpected Every scene was interesting and metaphorically shot Visual storytelling is one of the beauties of Parasite And of course those periodic twists Damn Shortly The film was engaging and especially if you haven t watched the trailer or if you don t know anything about the plot this film will surprise you so much more and I have personally experienced it During the whole time I couldn t even imagined or guessed whats going to happen next So you can watch this film You should watch this film and try to find what it tries to speak It started as a black comedy then it became a family and social kind of drama after some time it was a thriller again after some time it was a mystery later it was a revenge climax was horror and ending was a tragedy I mean what else can I say Seriously man that Director Bong Joon ho is a South Korean diamond After Parasite I watched some of his previous work and was mesmerized by this man s vision and brilliance of storytelling Memories of Murder 2003 Okja 2017 The host 2006 Mother 2009 are some his movies that I want everyone to watch This are more or less equally good movies that you will not regret after watching,10.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6965958/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,Just so so,Parasites is not about a class or a group of problems not about the parasitic relationship between poverty and wealth but that everyone can have problems In fact the shortcomings of human nature is an inherent phenomenon left over the human gene is from the competition for resources and competitive selection is engraved in the blood of the bad history and relics even if one day to achieve unlimited energy technology people no longer worry about livelihood this feature is difficult to eliminate in a short time But modern people are people because of the ability and rules of self restraint and if there were a criterion for distinguishing between the top and the bottom it would probably be the capacity for reason intelligence and empathy,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5632439/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2023,Best Picture 2020,I had high expectations for this film as it was the Best Picture of 2020 It simply would not have been my choice Straight off the bat the cinematography paired with the color scheme and score pulled me in Much of the music in the film was haunting and effective though at times it fell completely flat indulging in string clich s which seemed to contradict the original nature of Parasite Parasite is unlike any film I ve seen in several regards It takes a while for the plot to settle in It s rather special as the circumstances unravel It is genre bending and defying The film shifts in tone several times which I found refreshing However I was both indifferent and negative in response to integral directions taken in the final act I appreciate that every single character was flawed and that many of our protagonists were irredeemable Slow burns are my favorite type of film The pacing was mostly tolerable though I do believe in being slightly condensed it would be improved The ending dragged out We can gather much from what is told in one word There were many moments that felt like watching a trailer of a greater film in part due to sound mixing which was disappointing If the editing was improved upon I again would have enjoyed it more Stylistically for the most part Parasite is brilliant Sure it may have its faults but it is still worlds upon worlds better than your average film Does it align with my preferences Mostly yes but not entirely If I preferred the directions taken it would lean towards an 8 or perhaps even a 9 as the film is built on a remarkable foundation that I truly have never seen done before it s frankly inspirational If there were some different decisions made and some of the editing was improved upon again I likely would have bumped this up to an 8 or a 9 To most Parasite is a masterpiece and understandably so On a technical basis I am inclined to agree I recommend Parasite,8.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8992000/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2020,"The inverse of ""Trading Places""",What an Eddie Murphy comedy from 1982 compared to the Palme D Or winning Parasite Yes because both are excellent class distinction films but mirrors of each other Trading Places has likable characters that faced with Fate the evil Duke brothers team up to defeat the bad guys at their own game Even the homeless black con man Billy Ray Valentine who is a completely decent man can work with privileged out of touch white Ivy Leaguer Winthorp who is a completely decent man and respect each other to beat the Dukes An American movie an optimistic improbably fairy tale of the American Dream Parasite on the other hand has unlikable characters who have no way out of their predicament The poor Kim family actually aspire to be like Billy Ray Valentine because they have no choice in a culture like Korea s And the Parks basically Winthorp cannot once consider the Kims to be human beings worthy of respect So instead of everyone ending up on a beach eating cracked crab we have a bloody murder scene in the back yard,8.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5554669/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2020,"A great movie, but it also lacks something (for me) (only minor spoilers)",Parasite is a great movie It s very well paced and structured and has an interesting and constantly evolving narrative From a filmmaking standpoint it s on a very high level In the end though I still felt it left something to be desired I felt that the movie didn t have as much of an impact on me as I had hoped The ending wasn t as cathartic to me as to others and I quickly forgot about the movie shortly after I watched it even though I usually think about movies like this for days after I watched them Maybe this can be attributed to the fact that I found it genuinely hard to really sympathise with the characters for different reasons and I didn t form a strong emotional bond with them and without it how am I supposed to care about their fate It s sad what has happened to the hiding guy and his wife but they were introduced so late in the movie and their characters didn t really get fleshed out The big family who the title probably refers to got fleshed out quite well but the more I learned about them the more distant and unlikeable they became As for the rich family they are somewhere between the previous two They had some character development but not much and they were neither liekable or unlikeable so basically I didn t care about them at all Overall I would still say that it s a pretty strong movie but it lacks some kind of soul that would elevate it to a much higher level and make it truly stand out Therefore I also think that the 96 100 Metacritic and 8 6 100 IMDB scores are undeservedly high This movie is an 8 0 8 5 10 for me which means that it should be somewhere around 80 on Metacritic and somewhere between 7 8 on IMDB,8.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5372560/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2020,A blistering black comedy,One of the most horrendously hilarious portrait of any typical family ever committed in cinema in recent memory It s narrative had a global relevance seldom seen in cinema these days It s multi layered social commentary that still managed to be very Korean all with its profusely embedded cultural and historical references scattered throughout the story which seemingly etched in stone that was gifted to one of the main characters Metaphorical literal it s everything a brilliant story could ever be Never had I laughed in a cineplex so loud it s almost scandalous an orgasmic feeling even But what stands out as phenomenal in this film is the richness of how the characters in the film were all fleshed out result is very multi dimensional I ve seen qute a few of Bong Joon ho s film works and I can already say this film is not his finest work but it s grasp over the numerous accolades it has received since its release is very much deserved and I definitely still want to be surprised with the stories he has already told and are still gonna tell in the future so I m very much looking forward to exploring his other works as well it s just like finding jewel in the rough as they say Definitely an alpha,10.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6332535/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2020,8.5 but I'll round up for Bong,I think people are too quick to dish out 10s and on the flip side of that a bit too harsh to give anything less than a 7 just to its popularity This film isnt a ground breaking once in a lifetime masterpiece but it is beautifully shot acted and written With any film I think you must give some room to believe the unbelievable It s a movie It s meant to entertain to move to inspire to question People dont get what the purpose of this movie was I dont think For me personally it was meant to leave us torn In a place where no real sides were taken so that we question it constantly never really reaching a definitive stance The characters are not ones to necessarily sympathize with or hate so clearly but rather there to open our eyes and really think about how incredibly ruined and beautiful this world can be simultaneously It was deserving of the oscar over its competition and it is deserving of your full attention as a remarkably well crafted piece of cinema by a very talented director writer,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5482166/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2023,Fantastic!,This movie is amazing in almost every way The acting is compelling and fleshed out the story is believable and leaves you thinking for months after seeing it and the simple setting leaves it easy to get into and understand The commentary it has on the class system is spectacularly built and it well deserved it s Oscar The one flaw pulling this from impeccable is I felt it drag throughout its first half which left me leaning for my phone a couple of times early on But these moments were short and I was pulled back in very quickly ready for it to blow my mind throughout its second and third act You gotta watch this,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9197453/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2019,Let's put it the easy way. It was phenomenal.,What a masterpiece that was Being familiar with the korean cinema and the overload of fantasy it carries every time I wasn t really prepared for this rare gem It s mix of pretty much every movie genre and a hell of an emotion ride It all starts very smooth and simple kinda funny too as we ve been introduced the family You can easily assume It s a family comedy drama So far so good From the moment that the boy gets into this rich House and then mess an chaos surrounded the place It all turns into a crime soft thriller mood and It s getting darker and darker until it explodes I don t wanna say much because it will destroy all the fun In my opinion you should not read or hear anything about the plot before seeing this movie The only useful tip is good to know is that after the first 15 20 mins starts a wonderful ride and you will definitely love every single minute of it Spoiler ALERT Here in Greece we say The one who always searching for the Big fish turns out losing and the small one he already got So never be greedy guys Be thankful with what you have and always work harder if you wanna do better Enjoy the movie guys Every one has to watch this P L,9.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5299640/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2020,Pretty cinematography. So so premise.,It is amazing to me how often you see folks review films and they get caught up in the hype that some people say how great a movie is and then they feel they have to say the same thing Not me The movie was aesthetically beautiful and shot in a way that I have not seen before However the premise is preposterous The rich family were very rich and somewhat naive but on the whole they were nice people The mom doted on her kids and wanted the very best for them even if she did not always understand them The father worked long and hard hours but appeared to always come home They treated all four of the folks they hired to help as almost family And the movie made a point about identifying the supposed insults that the rich family made about the poor family but the insults were not particularly harsh But I guess we were supposed to hate the evil rich family Meanwhile the poor family got an innocent driver fired Caused the existing housekeeper to suffer a severe allergy attack several times and invaded and jacked up the rich family s house when the family was away It wasn t a movie depicting the differences between the ultra rich and the ultra poor It was a movie identifying the differences between an idiot family and a successful family who got rich,4.0,2.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5462979/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,Parasite:Crawling up the Ladder,There is hardly any doubt that with every discovery and innovation we are inching towards a drastic change simultaneously progressing as well as transgressing Some people like to call this the end of the human race However there is a lot of churning and grinding that remains before one finally reaches the highest level of degeneracy or supremacy To put it succinctly Parasite is an animated movie with humans as lead characters and in fact it is a movie with animals as its prime audience And animals don t see their primary sense is instinct and avoiding all sorts of dangers their major interest The question that needs to be posed here is not who is blind but to what degree is one blind Parasite can t be seen This particular movie poster is interesting as everyone is blindfolded somehow implying that everyone is blind Subterranean Views On the surface the Park family has a prosperous life they possess a huge villa along with a driver housekeeper and tutors The Teks on the contrary stay in a sub basement infested with pests Both their dwellings have severed ties with the outside world and provide an incomplete picture the sub basement only allows visual access to the lower half of the lane where passer bys mindless of the fact that corners where they were so shamelessly urinating could be a home to a family whereas through the French windows of the villa one has an idyllic panoramic view of the pruned garden which in its own way is a slice of manufactured reality as it is guarded by high walls on all sides Picturesque Panorama The movie does explore the disparity between the haves and have nots but not simply in a matter of fact way it goes beyond realistic depiction and shows how in this post modern day and age the dividing lines between these two classes become blurred What seems as a prosperous household is in fact rife in conflicts Basti esque One of the rudimentary manifestations of this can be seen in the rich son Da Song who is supposed to have internalised the American Indian the essence of experience that he captured from his previous expedition This in any case would have been any other nine year alone indulging in make believe however for Mrs Park this seemed to be erratic behaviour which had to be kept under check She likes to think of his artworks as Basquiat esque and justifies his eccentricity as genius Neither the mother nor the father try to address what could be the root cause of this problem instead they keep hunting for a tutor On the other hand his sister Da hye doesn t seem to be a predominant subject of parental concern Da song as American Indian Ki jeong and Ki woo act as foils to the rich siblings as at least superficially they seem to have a better control over their lives it s the lack of resources wherein they are challenged In spite of not having completed their studies they are quite adept to take on the world Needless to mention here that Ki woo invests a lot of faith in his father s plans unlike Ki jeong about whom the family unanimously concurs that she doesn t belong with them and was meant to be the first deserving candidate to acquire a higher strata Mrs Park comes across as a docile homemaker the centre of gravity of the household but that partially is shared by the housekeeper as Mr Park says that his wife had no talent for housework and that she was bad at cleaning and her cooking was awful and he was thankful to have Ms Mun Kwang who cooked awesome braised ribs and kept the house in order On being asked by Ki Tek if he still loved his wife Mr Park sneered it off by saying let s call that love The husband is highly class conscious and and in his interactions with his driver he makes it evident that he doesn t like his workers crossing the line Unfortunately for him the smell that Kim Ki tek s family reeks of doesn t adhere to the class boundaries that Mr Park is vehemently determined to keep intact Subwayers Stench Kim Ki Tek the poor dad on the contrary is not class conscious but oblivious of his reality as a result of which he keeps coming up with make shift plans plans that lack planning as a cure to the daily problems that his family has to grapple with To put it very crudely he is a hopeless romantic who up until the climax retains his calm and composure Soon he is at the verge of losing this presumptuous pensive facade post climax when the story takes a riveting turn Plan is a common thread that runs throughout the movie especially for the working class family that is the only hope that keeps them going on in their lives However the nature of these plans are to be questioned as they are short term based on addressing immediate needs and oblivious of the cries of posterity Ultimately the so called plan boils down to its nascent state and ceases to exist as Kim ki Tek says that the kind of plan that never fails is to have no plan at all Therefore Parasite is an apt title for the movie as it shows how the bourgeois as well as proletariat family exist as parasites in case of the working class it is quite evident and the complete transformation corporeally too takes place on the night when the Parks birthday plan to take Da song for camping fails and they have to return home and we see the Tek family hiding under the couch and they have to crawl out sneakily Also in the first few scenes when Ki jeong and Ki woo are hunting for the wi fi signal they sit huddled together in a corner beside the pot is also a visual simulation of pests hiding in a corner Perhaps the underlying rule of the coexistence of these two classes bourgeoisie and proletariat is that they remain blind and follow their routine day in and day

11 August 2021,A 10,I give this movie a 10 The director need not make any more movies They have created a masterpiece Every single line of dialogue and action undertaken in this movie leads to its inevitable conclusion There is not one thing out of place much like the house in which much of the movie resides The thing that stands out the most to me are the dynamics of the families involved We ll start with the rich family They live idyllic Everything is perfect in their world Everything is in its place The father works very hard for his money he is home to be with his kids But there s a problem But we ll look at the poor family why The poor family are thieves con artists morally reprehensible They will deceive and cheat others within their vicinity They will use whomever and whatever they can to get ahead and get something for themselves But not once does any member of this family put the other one down Never They are completely and utterly supportive of one another No one is blamed for things going wrong No one is told they did not do things good enough for the family Everyone is appreciated for what they bring to the table They are congratulated when they succeed at a task They are told how amazing they are at the skills they provide There is so much love in this family for one another it is nearly possible to look away from their actions towards anyone else They are a lovable family They would not turn their back on eachother in a heartbeat They express thanks for the fortune and opportunities they have been provided no matter how they came to them They thought of the people they had undermined and their fates Go back to the rich family The father is critical of the mother s housekeeping cooking general matriatchal skills The mother is extremely impressionable and willing to cover up any discretion without a thought for the welfare of those affected The sister criticises the younger brother for being a charlatan and fake The brother shows open disrespect for his mother s commands and authority He is showered with gifts rather than attention They are willing to believe he is schizophrenic and prone to distraction than actually believe he saw a ghost This is why the poor family s father when hearing the criticism s the rich family s father has about his wife asks him but you love her Despite all her flaws that you have mentioned Despite all your criticisms about her abilities in the kitchen and housekeeping skills You still love her don t you And you see that the rich man has to pause when delivering that answer Does he You can see in the poor family that they are eachother s biggest fans Not one word of criticism for eachother is ever uttered Apart from the mother stating the father would run like a cockroach if discovered He pretends to be angry with her He fools the children into thinking he would ever strike her with a fist or open hand He laughs at them for ever believing such a thing could would or should happen And they all laugh together in the end at what the mother replies This family loves eachother unconditionally They support applaud congratulate and openly tell eachother I think you re amazing But they are con artists and crooks Thieves and liars to everyone else And to get off for an evening the rich family s mother and father pretend to be the morally reprehensible for sexual kicks Though they treat their help with respect they find them beneath them as people They find them dirty And this gets them off sexually Because that s what they really want to be but they can t Because they have surrounded themselves with everything that says they are supposed to be better If they slip if they fall the facade will come crashing down And it will show everyone else what they really are No better than anyone else in the end The same And the poor family have a dignity and an integrity with one another that says they deserve the best of everything But life has not worked out as planned This movie is a masterpiece,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7217998/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2020,One of the most overrated films of the decade,Kim family members are intelligent yet very poor They somehow persuades rich Parks family into entering their home as servants housekeepers etc Kim family starts to suck blood from Parks family Because Parks family is so rich they have already been exploiting poor families for years So they deserve it completely Kim family tries to be rich at the expense of others but it is OK They are poor they are victims of the system so they have right to do that They make other poor people lose their jobs They don t waste their time and immediately starts drinking alcohol and having a big feast in the host family s house Joking aside why do some people refuse to criticize Kim family s greed They already got one good job why not stop Let the others benefit too They get other jobs by defaming previous employees I am not a great fan of Parks family but am I supposed to hate them What s wrong with them They are just rich and extremely gullible They even help other families by giving jobs they don t make them work like slaves By the way at the end the man from the poor family kills the man from the rich family because the rich guy hates the poor he even thinks they smell bad God can you imagine that How can a man be that evil The film which deserves this year s Oscar is definitely Joker which truly depicts a man who is systematically and unceasingly ignored and looked down on It is the real critic of greedy and selfish society Parasite got Oscar because it is an Asian movie Joker didn t get Oscar because it is so American It is even part of DC comics so that makes it definitely not Oscar worthy The academy wanted to show they care about rest of the world and other cultures which is good in theory but art should be universal regardless of director s gender race or culture,5.0,5.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5569347/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,Mostly boring,The first half hour is promising Then it turns into a catastrophe No one can believe even with simpletons as employers that anyone could have hired the father and the mother who ve been unemployed for so long obviously because they re good to nothing They re irresponsible heartless The movie is overlong and mostly boring the characters are unlikable And it all ends in a screwball comedy which becomes a ridiculous gore horror movie The screenplay is contemptible and I wonder what parts of the movie were so well directed that the director can claim having been influenced by Martin Scorsese If I were Scorsese I d resent it as an insult,4.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5483276/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2020,A Must-Watch Foreign Film,Dark and humorous with an unexpected turn of events I think one of the best things about Parasite is that for a foreign film it doesn t feel like a foreign film At least in my experience foreign films always felt somewhat polarizing like either you watched them or you didn t and I feel like this movie is a good starting point It feels very familiar even though its Korean and I didn t expect it to be that way I highly recommend watching,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5783781/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2020,Gisaengchung,One of the most powerful things about this film is that at first sight it seems that the evil of the poor is naked while the rich family is a little innocent But take a closer look and find that the hypocrisy and indifference of the rich without any flaws is the stone that lies on their family The family is unaware of a poor man who has lived in his basement for several years and the last scene is hopeless for the poor which is the reality of society,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5639137/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2020,"I Don't Give 10's, I Had To Here",When I look at a movie as a whole I m more focused on story then execution first and am always pleased when the films execution is excellent too like this film I went into this movie with very low expectations because it seemed confused and I wasn t convinced the thriller part of the film would work because I set a pretty high bar there I also never give out 10 s because a project can always be improved In this case it reached at something instinctual that has only happened a few times where at the end of a film or book I immediately almost impulsively want to experience it again Parasite succeeds in a big way for a couple of really important reasons The intelligent wit and comedy of the film draws out great empathy from the viewer without them even realizing it and brings you along just enough to be fully invested in the characters The family is relatable poor and have their sense of humor and love for each other that has great reach for those watching As things take a dark turn into its thriller act the transition is natural and a part of you wants that playful interaction to come back but as things unfold you know there isn t a turning point and that it s about to get worse before it gets better At this point in the film the meaningful narrative on wealth inequality and its impacts quickly take a full cast you enjoy together and almost seems to divide them against each other By the end of the film you ve been fully primed for the message and will probably feel a bit torn towards the protagonists and plot as a whole That feeling is coming from the reality so many have experienced and for it s masterful strokes I found myself completely hooked There isn t a single negative I can think of with this film From direction to acting costuming and screenwriting this film was highly intelligent and used genre as a way to paint new aspects of the story rather than relying on tropes or frameworks within a single genre The changes from comedy to tragedy itself compels the narrative and that achievement alone makes this an excellent film,10.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5628413/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2021,"Loved it, So many twists and turns...",This movie covers all aspects you d like for a film It goes from a comedy with important subjects to feel good to waiting that something really bad is about to happen to a lot of other emotions I can t even compare this film to another It s one of a kind in so many ways Not your usual type that is Completely deserves all won awards And to think I just stumbled upon this masterpiece Everyone needs to see this one The story is about the Kim family who try to get by in any way they can and I don t want to spoil anything because you re in for a treat Everything that can happen basically happens and at the same time the viewer is exposed to the differences of class in society Watch it,8.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6444528/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2020,It's a simple message,The movie s poster looks like it s going to be a thriller horror genre but I was wrong It was more drama and reality I was not that impressed with the storyline The actors did a good performance of realness but for me this movie does not really add something new to me knowledge that I would had never thought of I must say the production was great as South Korea really is known for their Dramas which is similar to this movie Will definitely recommend people of this movie but for me the x factor is missing and also the ending is a bit odd and not well planned Thats it for me Thanks for reading,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5540125/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,What a twist!!,I actually didn t expect the movie to go in a series tone at almost half time Normally thought it would have been a comedy entertainer like those classic Korean movies I really liked how they conveyed the idea of rich people being selfish when a situation arises and poor people remain always poor no matter what they do The actors did a tremendous job playing each role and their relationships with each other,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5992177/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,Are you a parasite?,Asian films are not the most frequent guests on our screens and probably the main reason for this is a significant difference in the perception of the world and mentality between East and West which is eventually reflected in cinema as a special kind of art Despite the abundance of awards primarily in Western cinema 4 Oscars and 1 in the main nomination the viewer accustomed to Western cinema clearly divided into genres will not be easy to watch this film In terms of belonging to the genre I would call Parasite a tragicomedy of situations built on the grotesque and this combination can hardly be called common and easy to understand The film is informative which is quite important in my opinion It is felt that the director of the film Bong Joon ho did his best There is an academic sequence and a competent style of presentation of the plot There is a plot which occupies most of the tape and then the climax and denouement which is devoted to about the second half of the picture That is there is something to see and it is felt Let s look at the plot of this movie in order The Kim family is on the brink of survival They live by part time jobs stealing Wi Fi from their neighbors In fact parents have a profession but for some reason they do not want to work in it or cannot this is not disclosed Children seem to be supposed to study but the boy did not go to college and about the girl it s completely strange So it all starts with the guy s friend offering him his job as a tutor for the duration of his internship The first question is why forge documents if you have already been recommended The final decision still takes place after an open lesson in the presence of my mother Question two why lie that this is not your sister but some distant acquaintance Perhaps some kind of Korean mentality is manifested in this But if the owners are not against nepotism and recommendations then I see no reason to invent something The moment when the hostess leaked the driver in the end is not disclosed This is a blatant failure in the script But it is very well shown how a simple housewife can wind up a problem out of nothing but then it is doubly strange why she does not use the services of trusted agencies Especially they are not cut off from society but are friends with the same families and for sure exchange experiences Plus accepting a person into a family without a total check is like walking through a minefield Silly and pointless Especially when the husband is the head of an IT corporation and it is easy for him And it s easy to check the former driver for drugs and you can simply reprimand him with a warning for having fun with a girl In short the film s credibility is seriously lame Nevertheless the nature of people is well revealed who not only could not honestly get a job but also began to feel like masters there Fighting for their place they were ready for a lot After all they did not want to return to their basement stinking life I honestly feel sorry for the Pack family who just wanted peace and quiet in the house But with the staff they were totally unlucky I would like to see the scene of their lives after the events that happened how it all affected them But we have only seen the last of the parasite family The sad events nevertheless gave them an impetus to take up their minds and at least somehow take care of each other Separately I will speak about the Pakov house This is an absolutely uncomfortable place which is absolutely not suitable for a family with a child but looks great on the screen The housing of such wives is always decorated with something smoother softer after all she bought a wigwam for a child and carried it out onto the lawn As if there is a separate world that does not fit into their house The lawn was again decorated for the child s birthday And the interiors remained with cold textures and clear lines Yes the script is interesting dynamic and at the same time quite cruel with unusual twists this is a plus A summary of this phenomenon and gaps that can be closed just a little more screen time Also a clear musical accompaniment which is successfully accepted Is this movie worth watching Definitely yes if you have a desire to look at the social problems of the modern world from an unexpected angle What s more the music the beautiful interiors the bright heroic camera work the lively atmosphere and the lust for profit make this film a serious challenge to yourself and ask yourself the question Are you a parasite,8.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8528660/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2019,"Precise, thoughtful, and awesome twist. SEE THIS IN THEATER",I had high expectations for this movie considering it won best picture at Cannes this past year and it exceeded them It s a film with thoughtful socioeconomic commentary as well as an examination of nihilism through the lens of a struggling family Drawing on the stark lifestyle differences of an upper class Korean family and another family that is barely making ends meet folding pizza boxes the audience is able to visualize what a family will do to improve their current financial situation Without giving away any spoilers the movie is packed with hilariously sharp moments and as an American seeing this movie reading the subtitles may have helped those moments shine even brighter The intertwining of suspense humor and social commentary makes it hard not to be reminded of Jordan Peele s Get Out so it s a blast to see it in theaters At a time when originality is lacking at every corner Parasite comes through in nearly every way and should be a lock for best foreign film of the year I wouldn t be surprised if it generated some best picture buzz as well Great movie,9.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5222058/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2023,Basement Of Deceit,You won t see many unique takes on class disparity as given in Parasite We start with a family living in a slum basement apartment who through a tutoring opportunity given to the son successively infiltrate the home of a wealthy family in the capacity of personal servants They manage to do this through deception and subterfuge against the family s current help staff It s easy to see the parasitical nature of this impoverished family yet the wealthy family isn t able to perform normal daily tasks without the help of others implying that they re parasites of the lower classes since their lives would fall apart without them The story unfolds in a very unique way starting as something of a comedy and becoming progressively darker with several key plot twists that were an enjoyable surprise There were serious logical flaws with the ending of the film it wasn t a believable ending but the overall story was very engaging and interesting There was a very distinct visual style to the film partly created out of necessity of the story The use of levels of buildings and staircases helps create a visually engaging film and aids in the telling of the story in important ways You also have a sharp contrast in visual spaces between the impoverished family and wealthy family s apartments with both the spatial dimension and the windows The basement apartment is cramped with low a ceiling and dirty window people urinate in front of while the wealthy home was custom designed by a famous architect has wide open spaces and a large wall window looking out at well lit private yard What stood out most about this film was the initial set up creating an expectation of a moralistic tale about class struggle that gets shattered fairly quickly and by the end is completely non existent There was no moral lesson being preached and instead we re given a raw look at human nature,8.0,0.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9008719/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2021,Worth a Watch,Lots of reviews complain of a lack of realism and plenty of comments cover the intellegent and clever social aspect of the movie I think people lost something in translation somehow This is a black comedy and it s a pretty funny one at that Think Severance with slighly less gore and a sprinkling of Faulty Towers The only peice that felt out of place for me was the ending which was much too sentimental to fit the movie I think black comedies are notoriously hard to end fittingly anyway The class thing plays a role in the movie simply to support it s outrageous plot True it surfaces in the end between Mr Park and Kim but it s never explored intellectually enough to hang your hat on An intriguing plot plenty of good acting Song Kang Ho the pick some good scripted banter that translated well and some very good cinematography I do have to say the one sex scene is actually quite graphic and although there is no nudity is more akin to a Korean soft porn movie Go into this film willing to take it at face value and you ll probably enjoy it 7 6,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7444275/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2020,"This is what passes for art these days...overrated, too slow",It surprises me how critics have a taste for movies that may be artistic but are just awful or average experiences at best to watch If you re a film critic you might like this movie for the reasons that all the other film critics do If you re an average moviegoer who wants a movie with characters to relate to and a story to inspire and remember you would be disappointed The first half of the movie is way too long in setting up the premise you don t realize what the movie turns out to be until the second half making me feel like the first half consisted of too many irrelevant details and was way too long By the time the movie picks up pace you re already tired I found myself skipping every thirty seconds towards the end Secondly a great movie should leave you with a positive feeling either a feeling of hope or inspiration or if neither of those are possible atleast the satisfaction of having had a good laugh This movie does none of that it leaves you with a feeling of despair and hopelessness Sadly that is what passes for art these days There were some good parts about the movie such as the acting was top notch especially from the sister Cinematography was good too but the movie was just not deserving enough to be the best picture of the year If it wasn t so highly rated I would ve given it a 6 10 but giving it a 4 to bring the rating down to what it should get,4.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5533704/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2020,Well made movie with a thoughtful screenplay,PARASITE 2019 A tale of the uneasy relationship between the classes a tale of identity and of desire This morality play explores that even with a plan man is destined to remain caged and immobile no matter the social and economic aspirations The story has been told before but Korean director Bong Joon Ho ratches things up a bit especially in the film s climactic ending The lower class Kims are masters at manipulation and lying to get ahead and benefit working for a naive wealthy family Yet sadly the Kim s never advance The class struggle moves into poor against poor before dissolving into all out chaos between the classes The director keeps a good distance from the characters painting them in broad strokes The story ends violently yet tragically it appears that nothing has really changed One man confined to hiding in the cellar is simply replaced by another and the futile dream of social and economic advancement continues I often wondered while watching this film if PARASITE was the correct translation of the title For me the class relationships in this film are more symbiotic each class needing the other to survive So who or what is the parasite For the director it is hope that longing that burrows under the skin that you can t get rid of This is a well made movie with a thoughtful screenplay that has a natural forward movement to it There is an artistic art house metaphoric quality to it such as a rock is both a totem and a weapon but I don t think it is the masterpiece many claim it to be The movie plays out very straightforward more like a made for tv mini series An excellent three parter perhaps The production is great and the actors are terrific parts of it quite funny However for me this is a good movie not a masterpiece nor Oscar best picture worthy I rate PARASITE 7 10,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5973114/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2020,"Entertaining, Overrated and Politically Correct!",This is a well made film but is far from achieving masterpiece status and those who are capriciously throwing that word around must be cinematically starved To give a movie an Academy Award for best picture and best director without nominating any of its actors is indicative of the fact that while the film s screenplay is definitely intriguing character development is sorely lacking along with any kind of memorable performances Did the director direct a gang of ghosts The message of the film is politically correct and although I agree with it I see this as just another Green Book cop out I m also appalled that the movie glorifies violence as a solution to economic disparity a disparity that is directly attributable to governments and not as individualistically motivated as this movie so strongly suggests Good film Yes Masterpiece and Best Picture of The Year Absolutely Not And we might as well just do away with the foreign film category now that this boundary no longer seems to mean anything,6.0,6.0,17.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5478317/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2020,One of the better films of the decade,Bong Joon Ho s latest film Parasite is a finely crafted potpourri It opens with the Kim family Chung sook wife Ki taek husband Ki jung daughter Ki woo son in their semi basement apartment the perfect setting for this working class household struggling to keep their heads above ground They rely on their neighbours for free wi fi while they sit on the kitchen floor folding pizza boxes for cash A friend of Ki woo s has been tutoring the daughter of a wealthy family the Park s and when a replacement is needed Ki woo with the help of his document forging sister fakes his way into the job The Parks require a significant amount of help to run their household and as such need an art teacher for their son a driver for the father and a housekeeper to maintain their luxurious home The Kim s are a clever clan and find a way to infiltrate each of these positions through cunning and deceit often usurping previous help By this point we understand enough to see that this is a film about class conflict The Kim s appear to be the protagonists with a grand plan and you d expect the Park s to be characterized as either villainous or ignorant but they re neither They re quite a nice family only they re focused on their own objectives When the Park s leave for a weekend of camping the Kim s take over the home boasting and toasting their good fortune Mid soir e they re interrupted by an unexpected visitor and that s when the action really begins The film s screenplay is too unique to be classifiable and the twists and turns too unexpected to reveal If my recommendation isn t enough the film won the Palme d Or at Cannes a universal festival unlike the Oscars which Bong called a local festival as part of his press tour to the tittering of film lovers The film is distinctly Korean but broadly relatable as we all live under the zero sum game of capitalism Bong asks who is the parasite The labour class who need a job to survive or the wealthy who can t survive without their labour,10.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5820182/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2021,A must see movie that makes you ponder on the real world,I can undoubtedly say Parasite was one of the most touching movies I have watched I was not expecting a foreign language occurring in a foreign society would affect me so much Since engaging with another society far from your culture is rather perplexing especially in a movie But every element of this movie was so well put together together that dragged the audience from the beginning to the end without a blink The ending was not maybe what viewers anticipated from the beginning but it wasn t too far out of sight either The soundtracks were meticulously composed with a purpose for each scene to convey the emotion that the director wants to the audience Because Parasite has played with all my emotions from happiness to sorrow throughout the film and the soundtracks along with the actors were exceptional in deliberating this story to us This movie pictures the extreme gap between the classes in a society The story begins with a family who is struggling to make ends meet by folding pizza boxes and selling them and live in half of the basement in a very poor neighbourhood Their son is taking over a friend s job to teach English in a very wealthy house The family one by one find their way into the wealthy family household by working for them from cook to chauffeur The movie started as a comedy then shifts to a thriller drama and eventually a bit horror The movie is shedding light on the problems of society that is rarely talked about It has made me realize there are struggles in the society that we don t see The working poor and underclass are not right in front of us We are all living in one place but they are the ones who have to crumple in half a basement with the very poor living condition This is a society where one family is thrilled to see the rain and the other is seeking shelter because the overflooded rain has ruined their basement If you want an eye opening movie that shows you the brutalities of a capitalist world then this is the movie for you It makes you wonder of what else is happening in a society that you have no slightest idea It gives you insights of rarely discussed struggles in societies that doesn t care much about the poor I don t want to spoil it more than I did already but I have deeply been thinking about the effect of society on people What one might do to reach the top How much this gap between classes put pressure on lower classes This movie has brilliantly pictured the answer to these questions I myself have watched this a few times and with a group of people it is a great movie for conversations I believe Parasite unquestionably deserved the four Oscars it received including the best picture for the first time ever for a foreign movie,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6597051/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2021,And the Oscar goes to...,Bong Joon Ho and his long awaited rise to masterclass Without doubt this director has a cabinet that cripples some of the historically best but has been underestimated for over a decade Parasite does what so many others cannot achieve Successful genre twisting combing elements of classical horror dark humour and enriching drama so successfully that you d think it s a class of its own The performances are looked over simply because and I say this cautiously the best movie direction seen in my lifetime Fantastic story fantastic everything Rare 10 WOW,10.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6559856/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2020,Haunting,Parasite was a great movie one of those movies that you still think about days after you ve finished watching it I loved how it was in Korean it felt like a glimpse into a different culture The story especially was chock full of literary devices The symbolism of the water starting with the money rock being given to the family as a gift for good fortune was prevalent throughout the movie Beginning with a small stream from a drunkard peeing outside their home and culminating in the night that changed the Kim family forever torrential storm that ended up flooding their house The circular nature of the narrative was also satisfying but haunting The irony was not lost on me that they discovered the man living in the basement of the Park family only to have Ki Taek ended up living there himself after he killed Dong Ik The parallels between the Park and Kim families were only enhanced by how different each family was Two parents a boy and a girl but from completely different walks of life I wasn t expecting the story to go where it went I wouldn t have imagined the slaughter at the end of the movie watching the first 1 30 which made it all the more surprising and meaningful Parasite was certainly worth of winning best picture and is a movie you ll think about long after you ve watched it,0.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5987266/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2020,reality,This movie reflects the current status of Korean society The huge gap between rich and poor has brought huge differences in people s mind and material In fact these differences have not changed since ancient times The oppression of slave owners and slaves nobles and civilians and landlords and peasants has never disappeared but we were born in a good era and we can t feel the cruelty The most powerful thing is to make you feel that part the truth clearly,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5791105/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,Much ado about a lot less than pretended,Korean satire about class differences turns into working class slapstick and pointless violence that is pointless relative to the point of the satire The underlying dynamic is contemptuous of the poor and working class and ends with a phony working class dream under the guise of family The last half or so of the film drags,5.0,3.0,26.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5409540/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2020,Amazing Attention To Detail,Parasite is one of the best movies I have seen This is not an arguable fact at this point it is so well made and the story line is brilliant The attention to detail in this movie astounds me Every single thing has meaning from the levels of the house to even the portrait that Da Song paints when he is younger which looks more like Geun sae than a self portrait I really appreciate the commentary on the different classes and how their perspectives are changed through dialogue through clothing and even through lighting The whole idea of how the upper class will only take action when something affects them is so prominent with the Parks not even aware of the troubles of their workers until it affects them And even when they do find out they only do what will help them and their kind picking up Da Song and even stepping over a girl who has just been stabbed It s such a stunning movie and I give it the utmost praise Another thing this film comments on is the idea of the American Dream At the end of the film Ki woo has an idea of working hard and buying the house that his father is trapped in That is what the American Dream is the idea that if you work hard and get an education you can achieve everything However this will probably never happen for Ki woo It s mentioned at the beginning that he has been denied from schools in the past but he thinks this time will be different But it s the tragic truth that it probably won t be different If it were the film wouldn t end with that being a dream It would cut off one shot earlier with the father hugging his son and then it ends But there is that final shot establishing that it s just goal that he won t be able to achieve And so he starts off how he did at the beginning of the movie socks hanging above his head and him sitting at his kitchen table in a basement,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5509380/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2020,Best movie experience in a while!,Simply exhilarating As a long time lover of classical music and a sucker for delicate frame composition and well thought out cinematography I couldn t have asked for a better representation of all three The film is well orchestrated and at times you are not sure if you are at a classical concert or in a movie theater The plot is tangible whether you align yourself more with the Kim or Park family Frame composition is painstakingly crafted to deliberately imply the status of one family above the other or separate from them Acting is stylistically directed in alignment with the tempo of the film By the end you are not sure where you stand within the plot and who you relate to more and maybe that s a good sign a sign that the film was well written I simply can t think of anything I did not like about this film and that s why I highly recommend it to any movie lover or even more to aspiring filmmakers like myself There is a lot to be learnt and even more to be enjoyed,10.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6046590/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2020,A stunning depiction of the flaws of social mobility,Without giving away any major plot points Parasite can only be described as one of the most unmistakable yet subtle pieces of social commentary of the 21st century Focused around the idea of class divide it explores the unavailability of social mobility as broken system and highlights the nonchalant attitude of the upper classes towards less fortunate people Shot beautifully and includes an incredible performance by Kang So Hong All round a brilliant film,9.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5496401/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2020,Movie of the year - Everything is pure imposture,Everything is pure imposture Movie of the year a wonderful cinematographic surprise wellplayed well done Everything is pure imposture that seems to be the only way for the protagonist family father mother son and daughter to get a job at all and to reach the state of happiness At one point the disillusioning sentence is heard from the father 500 university graduates apply for a position as a night watchman Everything could be so beautiful if the poor family s greed wasn t so great and their recklessness They soon discover that the old housekeeper whom they had pushed out of their position has a dangerous secret that could endanger their new positions This triggers a chain of surreal mad and wonderful situations that lead to the poor family losing everything and more But against the background of the madness of the rich family and their airs all the sins of the poor family were finally excusable It fills me with sadness that the poor without rights always remain the poor and without rights and with every attempt to change their fate they just slide deeper into their Schlamassel,10.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6299051/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2021,Bad,I came here because the high ratings were bothering me This feels like one of those films by a director that has grand ideas but actually very little experience in the real world that leads to what can only be described as pretentious outcomes Now by experience of the real world I don t mean that the films premise needed to be more grounded far from it some of the most outlandish unbelievable heck even total fantasy stories can feel grounded thanks their attention to detail that make them or their world believable I mean here that the details this world is so unbelievable that the whole experience is boring an insult This manifests itself most prominently in the character s and their development There are collections of character traits bundled and attached to two main groups of characters poor and rich Presumably this is to make the overall plot work the poor are conniving and greedy and the rich are well rich And apparently dumb with their lack of curiosity and poor decision making This falls apart almost immediately when the poorer family show signs of being sloppy they can t be bothered to fold the pizza boxes properly and do not understand what s wrong when there is complaint yet have meticulous attention to detail they perform an A class service to the richer family on demand Both seemingly motivated by their want for money If they were indeed driven by money via attention to detail they would have had a million opportunities in between these extremes If we are to feel anything for this family they need to hold some values we can warm to The suggestion that they are hard working well meaning individuals simply down on their luck is once again rendered unbelievable when they take the nasty decision to harm the original house made of the house There is no dog eat dog need to do this again if they used the smarts on display within this household outside of this household they would inevitably be more successful and have less need to do this Yet it is this utterly flawed down on luck narrative that upholds the social commentary of unfair class divides that apparently makes this film amazing The treatment of the rich is also highly flawed If they are as many critics have read from this representations of greed and ignorance why is the mother then only one that seems to be treating people kindly and fairly If this is a commentary on how people behave it is the mother and father of the rich family that are the kindest and fairest and how are we to feel badly towards them or their situation This inconsistency leads me to view this as a poor treatment of the poor person stereotype and much less than being a statement on society this film is actually an embarrassing statement on the directors ignorance This perhaps is forgivable not all directors have had the world experience and who is to stop them from making a film It looks nice at least What is not forgivable is that the Oscars can t see this for what it is nor the endless reviewers The pretentiousness therefore is mirrored in the critics praise they think they understand a clever observation on society but all they are revealing is their own poor understanding of class and how people work Forgivable again perhaps for the average viewer but critics with large audiences There s your statement on society people with loud voices haven t got a clue,3.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7700503/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,It was great!,For someone like me who barely knows anything about movies and films this was spectacular to me In the beginning of the movie at first I thought it was a little slow paced because I was under the impression that something big would happen after a couple minutes in as most or some movies usually go However it was an opportunity to achieve a deeper understanding on who the characters are and their lifestyle which is something I don t usually pay attention too The way the movie was created is clever it builds up the tension throughout it and gives foreshadowing before the climax happens and everything starts going wrong for the family Meaning that the small conversations they make can have a meaning in what they say or do in future events And when the climax happened I was on the edge of my seat and whispering words on what they should or should not have done showing how invested I was in the movie At the same time I loved it how smoothly the transition was as if everything clicked all together Even though I was frustrated with the characters actions they were portrayed really well on what s going on in the world and in society How unfair it could be and how hypocritical we are once all that good luck begins to get to our heads One that s well off would say how blessed we all are while those that are struggling to get by would call it hell and how their lives are simply unmanageable without financial or other kinds of aid I like how they portray that in the movie the portrayal of human nature Not to mention the amount of comedy in this film I was just laughing at certain parts that I struggled to keep quiet I would give it a 10 10 but me being stubborn I m still frustrated about the characters actions despite it being well done 100 All in all it s a great movie and I m glad it got the attention it deserves Props to you all,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5509386/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2020,Definitely Deserved All of Its Awards,This film is truly an accomplishment in filmmaking Director Bong Joon Ho starts off with such a simple plot and manages to turn the film into something really crazy and quite suspenseful which I was not expecting at all especially after having seen the trailer As for the cast I don t really know anything about any of them as I have not seen any of the other films that they have been in but they all did a fantastic job in their roles The main cast does a great job at portraying this manipulative family who will do just about anything in order to make a living while the wealthy family s actors do a great job at portraying these gullible and complacent characters that have no idea about the intentions of the workers that they have just recently hired One thing that I absolutely loved was the entire plot and how it was executed I did not realize how crazy this movie would end up getting I really thought that it was just just going to be drama between two families for much of the film but it ended up being so much more than that I loved it No wonder it won all of the awards that it did definitely one if the best movies I ve seen in a long time,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6253999/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2019,Exquisite,I ll keep it short This is one of the two best movies I ve seen this year along with Uncut Gems A biting comedy that bites a little too much towards the end I am not a big fan of that shock conclusion This great film didn t need shock to make it come alive The movie reminded me of satirical comedies such as Tootsie and Down and Out in Beverly Hills Movies that take these interesting characters and puts them in environments that forces them to come to terms with life itself It also reminded me of Billy Wilder This is an old fashioned fairly tale comedy slapstick and all Mr Song is a a terrific actor and I hope that he and Adam Sandler are nominated for an Academy Award,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5344468/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2022,The movie is clearly overrated.,I agree with many who wrote above it is completely unclear who eventually parasitizes in the film Absolutely all of his characters work regardless of social class and the fact that the main characters received jobs in a rich house somewhat fraudulently can be found almost at every step there was nothing particularly shocking If the main rich man of the film were the personification of all the nasty things that the bourgeoisie can associate with then it would be much more powerful That is if for example he beat his wife mistreated children and a maid went to the left threw tantrums for no reason then one could still understand the wave of indignation of the father of a poor family indignation that reached its climax in the finale But this is NOTHING We see a peaceful family a caring father and mother who love children and really do everything they can for them From here follows the conclusion from the opposite if the main rich people of the film are decent people a loving family then I would like to see the embittered humiliated and offended poor people which would play on this contrast But this is NOTHING Both of them love each other everyone loves children there is plenty of respect between family members there is simply NO contrast an antagonist in the film In general I do not understand why such films receive Palme d Or There is a much more poignant movie underestimated by critics not getting anything There are many such films And here for what well for what For timing For a beautiful picture or a good game of actors This is now easy to do if you try a little But the fact that the main thing in the film is very false the PLOT this cannot be corrected by anything,3.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7778594/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2020,A WONDERFUL PIECE OF CINEMA!,Parasite is one of the few movies that live up to the hype around them Getting all the praise in the world from audiences and critics alike it s being called the movie of the decade On top of this it has won 4 Oscars including Best Picture But I assume you already knew that in which case I apologize for wasting your time But if the hype and those Oscars aren t enough to convince you to watch this then maybe reading on further will Parasite doesn t stick to a single genre but is a mix of drama comedy satire mystery and suspense All this fit into a 2 hour movie without causing a hitch in the seamless transitions between those genres Fueled with incredible performances from each and every cast member the movie despite being a thriller involves a plot which is so believable that it s frightening Wildly unpredictable the title of the movie will only make sense after the ending and till then you ll only be left guessing Not revealing the details but the movie seems to be going in a certain direction at which point it takes a sharp turn into complete madness Things pretty much escalate from there revealing a clearer picture about the intention of the movie The more praiseworthy thing apart from the flawless camera work and near perfect direction is the display of the disparity between the rich and poor using symbolism and other It paints a picture about what it s like to be on both sides without the presence of any heroes or villains I personally think that movies have become such an inherent part of our lives and their global presence has at least touched if not influenced a lot of people And not using such a powerful widespread medium to communicate about a social cause of which we have plenty seems like a wasted opportunity So kudos to director Bong Joon ho for taking on this issue and yet finding a way to make it entertaining,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5610043/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2023,"Brilliant, except the end...",This film has one of the most compelling premises and buildups in of any film in recent years However the ending left me rather cool and I felt that a story with such a gripping narrative should have something a little more well thought out It s almost as if there is a genre switch near the end of the film Where it goes from psychological drama to cartoonish over the top horror I m interested to know if there was studio intervention on this point because it almost feels like another filmmaker took over Unfortunately this bend basically broke the reality of the film for me But the primary build up of the film is so great its still definitely worth a watch,6.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9342763/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2019,"good, not great",This is an entertaining movie but count me among those mystified by the hypr it s generated 1 It presents the Parks more synpathetically than the Kims I suspect the rich will take more inspiration from this movie than the poor and Parasites sure seems like a call to arms by billionaires 2 As someone else pointed out at the start of the movie the Kims can t even fold pizza boxes but a few days later they re suddenly geniuses 3 Shouldn t the first chauffeur have turned up in the bomb shelter as the son of the first housekeeper An opportunity to reinfoce the theme that was carelessly missed by the screenwriters,6.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5265727/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,Don't (completely) believe the hype,I think the only reason I was mildly disappointed with this film was all the hype including of course the Oscar win If I d stumbled upon this foreign language to me film I would have been I m sure thoroughly delighted and surprised But given that it s supposedly THE BEST FILM of all those released in the last 12 months well I find myself in unexpected agreement with Joan Collins an Academy member who on Britain s morning GMB show said she thought it was a good film just not The Best Film although she also admitted to not having watched the last 20 mins as it got a bit dark I assume she meant emotionally not visually and she was having trouble with the subtitles on her apparently tiny TV screen Get a 60 inch Joan if you re being asked to vote It surely does twist and turn and goes from a light hearted almost Ealing comedy vibe into a slasher in the woods horror flick The acting is great The characters on the whole believable but as the closing credits rolled I couldn t help but feel a little disappointed Why Well I m probably in a minority with Joan here but I guess it was the whole story arc that left me unsatisfied I would have been more satiated with an ending that allowed the nice though slightly moralistically challenged poor parasites to get their rewards while at the same time allowing the rich privileged class to see the error of their ways The rich folk here were as far as I could see perfectly nice people apart from objecting politely to the smell of their poorer employees Did they deserve all they got I don t think so That s perhaps just a reflection of different story telling techniques around the world Maybe here in the UK US we expect Disneyfied Hollywood endings and this was not one of those I still can t see quite why the dad chauffeur decided to stab his employer to death I can t see how the son of the poorer family survived two enormous blows to his scalp with a sizeable rock with nothing to show for it than a temporary frontal lobe syndrome that made him laugh and smile uncontrollably until for no explained reason that symptom disappeared when he was looking at news footage of the crime scene Those details left me feeling uncomfortable and less than satisfied Was it just the Hollywood zeitgeist that got this film the Oscar Let s give it to a foreign language film for the first time they said That ll if not silence our critics then at least give them something to chew on That s probably unfair but for instance Rocketman sent me on a far more roller coaster emotional ride than Parasite did For me it was easily a better film,7.0,4.0,17.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476063/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2021,"A statement on society: not the film, but by the response it evokes",I came here because the high ratings were bothering me This feels like one of those films by a director that has grand ideas but actually very little experience in the real world that leads to what can only be described as pretentious outcomes Now by experience of the real world I don t mean that the films premise needed to be more grounded far from it some of the most outlandish unbelievable heck even total fantasy stories can feel grounded thanks their attention to detail that make them or their world believable I mean here that the details this world is so unbelievable that the whole experience is boring an insult This manifests itself most prominently in the character s and their development There are collections of character traits bundled and attached to two main groups of characters poor and rich Presumably this is to make the overall plot work the poor are conniving and greedy and the rich are well rich And apparently dumb with their lack of curiosity and poor decision making This falls apart almost immediately when the poorer family show signs of being sloppy they can t be bothered to fold the pizza boxes properly and do not understand what s wrong when there is complaint yet have meticulous attention to detail they perform an A class service to the richer family on demand Both seemingly motivated by their want for money If they were indeed driven by money via attention to detail they would have had a million opportunities in between these extremes This inconsistency leads me to view this as a poor treatment of the poor person stereotype and much less than being a statement on society this film is actually an embarrassing statement on the directors ignorance This is forgivable not all directors have had the world experience and who is to stop them from making a film It looks nice at least What is not forgivable is that the Oscars can t see this for what it is nor the endless reviewers The pretentiousness therefore is mirrored in the critics praise they think they understand a clever observation on society but all they are revealing is their own poor understanding of class and how people work Forgivable again perhaps for the average viewer but critics with large audiences There s your statement on society people with loud voices haven t got a clue,3.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7700529/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2019,One of my favorite live-action Japanese movies.,This is one of my favorite movies of the year The wonderful director is back at t again with another Korean film And this film is certainly up to his standards First I m gonna go mention everything good about this movie The cinematography is beautiful The colors look mesmerizing throughout the whole runtime They manage to make even simple dialogue scenes interesting with complex camera movements and angles The color palette perfectly matches the moods of the scenes The acting is mostly pretty good from all actors involved The dialogue and characters are well written memorable and compelling It s extremely well directed The locations feel realistic and like their a character The suspenseful scenes are well made and executed They re suspenseful and you sit on the edge of your seat The montages where multiple are happening are well edited You know what s going on since it s been recently established The editing is fun and fresh It manages to both thrilling scary and funny without any of them ruining the others The suspenseful parts are suspenseful and the comedy is placed at inappropriate parts The music choices and score match the scenes they re in perfectly and they never feel out of place The scary parts are well executed and photographed and they re genuinely suspenseful It never felt forced or misplaced There is of course no comedy randomly placed in the middle of a tense scene like there is in most modern day movies I don t think there is a single thing about this movie I dislike It is by far my favorite movie of the year This is a movie everyone would enjoy I don t think there s a single person I wouldn t recommend this to,9.0,1.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5175370/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,I figured out the title!!! Hint - They are feeding off of YOU!,I guess I was entertained That s why I gave it 3 stars If it were just some movie that I stumbled upon I might have given it 5 or 6 Since this was was kinda chosen to be the best movie in the world though it really fell flat for me This might have been better off as an animated film Each scene requires you to utterly suspend your disbelief in reality The ending was just plain stupid You send an essay length letter out into the ether in morse code every night just hoping your son might see it Then as it magically turns out your son DOES happen to see it while climbing a mountain one night and spending hours watching a house where the worst trauma of his life happened Even though it got dark and he was freezing he stayed there anyway and watched intently enough to notice a flickering light Also the light was alluded to early in the movie A person that owns a multi million dollar property does NOT tolerate faulty electrical work for any length of time The moment that basement guy first headbutted the switch to make the light flicker an electrician would have been called and the premise of the movie would have been ended by the electrician going down to the basement What was EVEN MORE STUPID was the son Kevin just deciding to be a millionaire Ok I ll accept that he s a millionaire now after a wave of the magic wand Not too hard to do in Korea apparently I guess they have short memories and forgot that he was involved in an extortion plot that resulted in 3 people being murdered including his sister Didn t the investigation of that incident involve anyone discovering the basement Those investigators seem like they did a bang up job THEN Kevin buys the very house where the rampage took place Did he change his identity somewhere I m not being too eloquent with this review I have a feeling if you have stuck with reading this that we re probably on the same wavelength already The main point I want to make is that the true parasites in this world are the ones that have built empires out of the tiny scraps that the masses have discarded We have all put down 12 here 5 there 7 here again to watch a movie or to see some kind of entertainment Would you have paid 20 to watch this Probably not The parasites are the ones who got fat from tricking everyone into thinking that have unique skill sets So unique that they should be rich for providing you with a piece of trash movie that you paid 5 an hour to watch I know no one read this but I m glad I got to drop in my opinion anyway I m also happy to be able to contribute to lowering the rating of this movie,3.0,1.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8547616/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2020,Parasite sucks you in from the very first minute...,With the likable struggling family trying to make a living in a rough world and then keeps you attached with it s unconventional twists while using subtle symbolism to get its anti capitalism message across As an American who believes in the free market and the American Dream of working hard saving your money the step people struggle the most with then investing your money and shooting for your goals with everything that you have I appreciate it when movies that are critical of the economic system of capitalism which allows for their to be a larger wage disparity between the rich and the poor then other economic systems doesn t feel the need preach its beliefs to you with elaborate speeches but instead opts to let the story do the talking However the one exception in Parasite to this was the conversation in the gym that Ki taek had with his son about plans And it s this quote that really sticks out to me You know what kind of plan never fails No plan at all No plan You know why If you make a plan life never works out that way This is an absolutely heartbreaking outlook to have on life and it can only truly be believed by a man who has let his circumstances defeat him But at the same time some people are just given the short end of the stick in life They grow up in a bad situation and often times lack the education the capability the direction drive or the opportunity to pull themselves out of it In the case of Ki woo and his sister Ki jeong they clearly weren t lacking in capability or drive but the lack of opportunity was implied which was why Ki woo s friend Min hyulk was a godsend to the family when he presented Ki woo with the idea of him taking a tutoring position What I find funny is that the father ends up acting on impulse when he hides in the basement and the situation of the film with a poor person living in the shadow of a rich person remains the same On the flip side the son says he has a fundamental plan in which he will go to a university and make enough money to buy the house so he could free his father At first the movie tries to trick you into believing that he was able to do so and he is able to see his father again but then it is revealed to be a more realistic and melancholic ending with Ki woo hoping that he will be able to actually set out and do it but never actually being able to do so This is suggesting that in a capitalistic society those on the bottom have a hard time of rising to the top even when they have the drive and capability to do so But me being the optimist that I am I cannot accept such an ending The reason that Ki woo fails isn t because his dream isn t attainable it s because he doesn t actually have a plan Saying that you are going to go to a university and make lots of money is not a plan That s a dream Plans need to be thought out with smaller attainable goals set as stepping stones to reach that dream And judging by the way Ki woo was raised he probably never had anyone show him how to break things down to properly execute a plan That pains me because once Ki woo gets some direction he d be able to find an opportunity to help get his family out of the rut they re in Of course in some cases it s better for you to worry about 1 and to not let your family drag you down with you which is something that I ve had to learn the hard way in my life Overall I am happy that this film won best picture It was an original film with a brilliant script great acting and likable protagonists despite all of the horrific stuff that they do But what I think is even more noteworthy is that Parasite is an anti capitalist film which portrays rich people as people And I respect Bong Joon ho for pulling that off especially when I felt that the biggest flaw in his previous film Okja was that he was anything but subtle with how he portrayed his antagonists Parasite doesn t have antagonists It has a working class of characters that are struggling to make a living and a higher working class of characters that is oblivious of the struggles of those that are beneath them,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5649442/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2020,"Original movie, Great directing, Smart writing",What I love about this movie it s a blast to watch very original and the directing is some of the best The originality is a huge plus to me because it feels like there s not much of it to go around right now But as far as the negative I ll spend a little longer on this because theirs so much praise already I feel like all the best drama in the movie feels manufactured I felt like the director had the poor father stab the rich one for a dramatic conclusion whether it was justified or not a mechanism to show the movie had some dramatic point Almost hamfisted in but never organically produced The rich family behaved like bosses in a typical work environment Seemed dismissive at times even gullible but in many ways incredibly generous and trusting if not creating opportunity and doing more good than required The director may say there s no good guys and bad guys but shouldn t we at least feel like theirs a motive behind the final killing I should have been thinking I hope he doesn t kill him I hope he doesn t kill him but instead I was just thinking why is this disgruntled cab driver grabbing a knife to kill the rich father of all people There s a murderer who just killed his son who is being carried through the courtyard by the rich daughter of all people trying to get him some help The rich father commented that he liked the cheap panties but that didn t relate to the message at all he didn t even know they were the driver s daughter s Seemed like a cheap inclusion to build motive for the dramatic killing Did he look down on the family Not really he was a boss and was even caring and didn t even know they were a family The poor father stabbing him in front of everyone put his own family at risk and hurt their ability to function even further and although you knew he was upset it didn t feel like that level of aggression worked with his character at this point in the film Overall the message didn t come across succinctly I think the director would probably say the rich should be more aware of the pains in the community So no one can ever have something nice ever again until everyone is rich The only way this rich family could have over come their flaws is if they had ensured that everyone in the world had a good day the day before If I want to get really critical I would say that the director wanted to make a funny political and scary movie and therefore threw in random scenes to sensationalize his script Like when the old maid comes to the door of course they wouldn t let her in if the movie was being honest And that s what enabled all the incredible drama was this poor decision made with unclear motivation They re all hanging out inside eating food broken bottles on the floor openly making a mess of the the house for the first time this could blow their whole operation they meticulous planned and were cunning and quick on their feet in every other scene but they decide to let her inside always oh well Could have just told her to come back So then they find a poor family living downstairs which is random and sort of unrelated to the story and the point of it but they find a poor guy there and so the protagonist mother decides to turn them in What needs to happen to create the next sensational moment Well if the family living downstairs were to just happen to discover the entire secret of the poor family before the mother calls the cops in 5 seconds then we could have a fight to the death What happens next Well the entire family comes tumbling down the stairs and the downstairs family gets video proof of them referring to each other by their family names etc If any of those random highly unlikely and unrelated elements don t happen in this short sequence the entire movie ends with the family making a little money as an uber driver a maid and 2 tutors But the movie needed to go bigger So we have these unintuitive moments driven by unclear motives tacked on to ensure we get the killing and dark moments and dramatic political messages that can only be found in the second half Now we ve got the pieces at the expense of depth Almost seems like a fun silly movie with random political narratives to increase the clout Like it s a movie that s supposed to make you feel good because you just got to watch a comedy a thriller and then became a better person because of the mechanically meaningful scenes I mean if this is how you make a great movie you could literally use this as a template because again it could be a manufacturing process But since the feeling of moral fulfillment comes by way of cheap design and gives a bit of hollowness to the final experience So I rate this 8 8 because of the direction and originality 2 stars gone because of the artificial nature of the climax I don t like crapping on a movie this good but it s off my chest now and there s plenty of positive reviews so I ll leave some of that to them,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5569777/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2020,Slightly overrated movie.,I watched this movie after reading a lot of rave reviews about it so that may have played into my impression about the movie I think it s definitely a good movie in fact one of the memorable ones of 2019 but i still feel the praise this is garnering is slightly overrated for what it offers The concept is nice I don t know how the dialogues are in Korean but the English subtitle translation was average and didn t have the comic nature many times The build up was slow but the movie picks up pace pretty quickly after that After some shenanigans by the family the real chaos which is at the heart of the story starts The frantic events at the end didn t make a lot of sense I think the end kind of soured overall impression of movie for me for the sake of keeping review spoiler free I would not say which event exactly but you d know when you watch it Another problem I found was that movie tried to be a lot than what story could have allowed it to be Comedy thriller would be perfect description but then there are attempts at being a drama movie too and they feel less coherent to the movie The acting was good by almost every character for the most part Overall I would say it was a good watch and it is memorable for the uniqueness of the story,7.0,1.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5456546/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2020,Relatively Amazing,If you want a thought provoking movie that will stick with you for hours or days then Parasite is the movie for you Most movies have a clear division between the protagonist and antagonist You root for one and despise the other because that s what we ve been groomed to do for our entire lives but what if the divide weren t so clear Classism is an age old separation that has been symbolized in literature and television for years and years The good guy is wealthy and the bad guy is poor or vice versa That isn t always how it works in real life and Parasite strives to exemplify that I would be gravely mistaken if I didn t mention the phenomenal acting and breathtaking cinematography that takes place in Parasite The tension that begins to build about halfway through the movie is palatable and will make your stomach knot I recommend going into this movie with no spoilers and very little prior knowledge of the film as it ll make the experience that much better I ve seen a lot of 3 7 star reviews claiming that they don t get the film and that it is over hyped You need to be able to look past the superficial to understand this film Good and bad are obsolete and classist stereotypes are shattered into pieces Go into this film with an open mind and an agreement to think past what you see on the screen There is a lot of symbolism and reading between the lines in this film and to fully understand it you ll need a good hour to think after the film As you re laying in bed wondering what the hell you just saw on screen it ll all start piecing together in your brain That s what makes a good film and Parasite is one of the best I ve seen this year,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5977188/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2020,Best Korean Film ever made,As far as I can remember the last time I watched a Korean film was in January last year and it was A Taxi Driver Most of the movies I watch apart from those in the big screen are mostly recommended or are heavily talked about I heard about this movie Parasite a few months ago when it won the Palme d Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival in May becoming the first Korean film to do so My expectations were too high but this film did not disappoint It is obviously one of this year s best cinematic offerings It was a good decision not to read anything about the plot of this movie All I knew before watching was that it is a satirical black comedy thriller film I expected the satirical portion to be the reason why this film is universally acclaimed But my mind couldn t do away with the word thriller look at the movie poster it s already creepy since I don t normally watch thrillers alone It was indeed a thriller I was thrilled to the point that I was so stressed I had to pause the movie a few times to catch my breath I was stressed but it was the kind of stress one discreetly craves in a movie since the stress gives satisfaction There are no supernatural beings in this movie No robots no science fiction no ghosts no zombies But as for the criterion of being a thriller it satisfies with flying colors The shifting of the mood in this film is shocking It starts like a heist film something that feels like the Ocean s movies Then it transitions into something that feels like a documentary about poverty The first half makes your heart skip a beat while the second half slows it down without getting repetitive or monotonous And then you reach the final scene where you begin to think a lot about everything that transpired Parasite is a film with a beautiful narrative where metaphors symbolisms and parallelisms all run up and down in a staircase The social commentaries are evenly laid out from the first scene to the last one This is a film about class struggle about the gap between the rich and the poor about mental illness and about realities in the world that are difficult to acknowledge This movie has so many layers it is probably best to watch it with a lot of friends because there are so many things needed to be discussed What good is a movie when you don t want to talk about it afterwards,10.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5852914/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2021,An argument for a spot in the top 10.,Parasite This movie has to be in everyones top ten if they ve seen it I seriously can t comprehend how someone would dislike this movie This movie starts with a poor south korean family having to battle with terrible internet poor income and people urinating on their property The name of this movie certainly fits a Parasite The fake rich with the rich stealing their goods from them and eventually taking their lives as a whole Not only was this movie social commentary on the living conditions and lack of income South Koreans frequently suffer from but if you didn t make that connection and pushed that part aside this is the most tense ive ever been watching a movie And my other favorite movies are Whiplash and The Departed so thats really saying something The director of this movie was incredible and this movie truly deserves to be in the top ten I place it on my list around the same placement as Pulp Fiction which is 8 on the highest rated movies of all time This movie is engaging as heck and sometimes you forget you re even watching a movie and instead getting a scope of an insanely talented and intelligent families life In the scene where they all practice their lines for the next day of work I truly pictured myself and my family doing this I never really grew up poor Low income at birth but not to the extent of this family and I still found myself relating to this When you look at the rich people s houses and get used to our protagonists operating inside of it you look around at your house and begin to feel like you re the family living in the semi basement You begin to relate to the characters and say they re doing what they can to get by I mean what s different from them and modern society chasing that bigger paycheck that better house and a more comfortable life style I mean who hasn t wished for that Around 1 hour in there s a plot twist that changes the rest of the movie somewhat drastically but I promise my heart rate hit at least 180BPM while watching those scenes Parasite is on hulu go watch it now if you can,10.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6699851/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2020,A Korean gem!,A very pleasant surprise of how to combine something mysterious and something with great horror elements but keeping it light with perfect black humor and not to give away too much at any point The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing The script was very cleverly written makes you face a decision who you are rooting for I could sympathize with either the good guys or the bad guys at any given point during the movie This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5382671/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2021,Very interesting!,The first half of the movie was slow but not in the bad way It builds up each character gives you an interesting story to keep your attention and shows the true nature of each of our main characters all before the second half of the movie which is packed with tense moments that made me want to hold my own breath and ends with exactly what I wanted the story to end with a great conclusion with a satisfying ending The music and acting throughout was great and made each scene shine as bright as it could Overall Parasite is a really good film and was really fun to watch very interesting and would highly recommend,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6952624/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,Interested again in the film format,In over a year I have watched one single film starting from April I went back to watching the series format but a film experience is different especially with one that lasts little more than two hours I grow a little tired as the story progressed but I assume it is only because I have not watched the format for a long time Nonetheless I did not feel boredom it was a good start for a return to watching the film format My second exposure to South Korean cinema after watching Oldboy presents a number of elements that direct the story and give the viewer an explanation to accept what is going on and immerse themselves into the narrative that is taking place these elements don t strike as being obvious but if accepted or ignored the viewer is to be rewarded by being emotionally engaged and producing both laughter and tears as well as experiencing the high suspense than any good thriller is meant to create It is a professional work the acting is engaging the script even if translated seems authentic and the cinematography and the directing are innovative and tasty One prominent example that makes this film a unique experience is a scene where the mother of the Park family tells the mother of the Kim family in the kitchen in front of the fridge about an event in her son s earliest years that involves a ghost the first mother will go about telling the story and meanwhile the fridge will open slowly and the view will be focused on the fridge and we will see in front of it a cake with candles that are lit right after a birthday cake was mentioned by the first mother In this scene elements from the past and the present were fused triggering a response suitable for a scary ghost story it was succeeded by a scene representing the event An obvious theme in this film is the disparities between the classes of society The Kim family face many daily struggles and they are driven to engage in a ridiculous activity to get paid and that is cutting pizza boxes in a specific shape Once an opportunity arises even one that bring morale into question they seize it and we can see how the family is happy for coming upon such an opportunity Once the Kim and Park families were connected more opportunities presented themselves that were again taken even though the morale stakes were increasing We witnessed the Kim family plotting to remove people from their jobs only to take them The end product is different jobs around the Park family where the Kim family pretend to not know each other This is where the title can be introduced a Parasite Many falsified premises were provided to the Park family and many plots were put into action only to receive money to receive payment for tasks that are actually accomplished The parasitic behavior is portrayed in how the Kim family assumed control over the Park house when they were away The film goes into deeper lengths to present what those in fight for survival go through from living in atrocious conditions to being forced into acting like an Indian highwayman The poor strip themselves from morality and dignity for survival and the rich afford to be oblivious,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7082066/?ref_=tt_urv

9 April 2021,A great film in recent history!,Wowowowow this is one of the best films I watched in a while It was well crafted and the acting was great It made a really good showcase of social divides across different classes and the extremes that one will go to in desperation It also showed how the rich think of the poorer proletariat as less than shown through the odour comments throughout the film it is this lack of respect that lead to the patriarch s murderous actions I feel like the house also represented the aforementioned divides in society the basement representing the lower class and the place of desperation originally used to hide from loan sharks and after used to hide from the police Above the basement the rich family lives literally above which could be seen as a metaphor for the place they hold in society towering above those who are less fortunate This is a theme repeated again when the protagonist s house being so low down is flooded by the torrential rain whereas the Park s house isn t affected The shifting of the film s tone from an upbeat fun atmosphere reminiscent of a bank heist film e g Ocean s 11 to a dark sombre tone was powerful It also presented the unforeseen consequences that can occur when these people are pushed to the extremes You could also argue that it was the greed of Ki Taek s family that dealt them this fate their lack of empathy and consideration when causing the other people to lose their jobs is what started this however I m of the opinion that this whole situation was the symptom of a greater issue wealth inequality If the state pension system was better perhaps the Geun Sae wouldn t have had to stay in that basement for so long If the Park family weren t in a bubble perhaps Ki Taek s father wouldn t have snapped If there was another way to get employment Ki Taek s wouldn t have had to resort to greed and forgery to get money All these things could have been prevented through a better social support structure perhaps this is the message of the movie This film was quite poignant and I believe it really achieved its goal of showing how the less fortunate people on the fringes of society have to live what lengths they are driven to perhaps some people will never understand but this film certainly made a great effort I m not surprised at all that this film won best picture it s a unique film and the soundtrack is powerful too might I add,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6795818/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2023,"Virtually flawless, visually perfect and eerie and tense",Parasite is truly a modern masterpiece For those who don t know the film released in 2019 to immediate acclaim winning several awards and for good reason The plot follows a poor family and a rich family in Korea The poor family live underground in a tiny apartment sized home with little food and luxuries On the other hand the richer family lives in a beautiful futuristic home that looks like something out of a Stanley Kubrick film like A Clockwork Orange due to its intriguing architecture and design Anyway the son in the poor family receives a request from a friend to work at the rich family home He agrees and as the story goes on the poor family forges a plan to purposely eliminate and fire every other worker at the house to be the exclusive workers Their plan works in a wacky and comical way However it becomes more of a thriller and even horror once the house s basement is revealed to have a man hiding within the husband of one of the previous workers It begins to go downhill and that s when the film peaks and became one of my all time favorites Overall it is a must watch for any movie fan or student 10 10,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9368226/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2020,Timely and poignant,Bong Joon ho s Parasite takes on the age old theme of wealth and poverty and human fate and what a take it is Artistically powerful and captivating it throws the viewer into the middle of a very modern and ugly problem stark wealth inequality and how an individual s life is worth only the size of his wallet Yet the film shows how fragile these lives are whether through the invocation of missiles from neighbouring nuclear power cornered by imperialism like the husband in the basement a Frankenstein inadvertently or maybe inevitably created by Mr Park or other hazards from which even the wealthy have no protection The film offers a damning critique of capitalism which benefits the upper classes of the world and is ultimately tied up with the global hierarchy of power and wealth a global system that benefits the rich and powerful The same way as the damned basement dweller worships the rich Mr Park for what he believes is feeding him the working class of the world has been led to believe that it is the Jeff Bezos Jack Mas and others who are the wealth creators who feed the talentless 98 The film is also a direct critique of the colonised mind which aims at the Korean and other society s worship of the capitalist and colonialist West The obsession with the English language their replication of the normalisation of the genocide of Native Americans Indians references to studying abroad and the relentless pursuit of mastering the English language as essential social capital is not unique to South Korea or culturally closer Asian countries notably China It is virtually every other country that is in Muhammad Iqbal s words have been hypnotized by the West yet fail to see like the members of the Kim family did before taking a closer look that beyond the fa ade of extravagance and cash Mr Park is an impotent man and his wife is a naive woman with no distinction from the rest of the society There must be something rotten in the system then The film has sacrifices the younger daughter dies amidst the drama in the backyard of the bourgeoisie the poor goes back to the basement His son gets his Morse coded message but rescuing him from that place remains a dream This is a depressing and hopeless take of Parasite on our modern world The film sells as a black comedy but I didn t even smile not once This is perhaps I was absorbed by the poignant subtext Secondly I don t see a solution is offered But I welcome the open endedness we can choose whether it the Parks family who is the parasite or the global capitalism of the 2 But it is the hopeless aspiration of the son that is to become rich enough to buy the house is built upon the his father s prison that is the most depressing part If this is the solution we are at a deadlock,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5554934/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2020,way too overrated,Probably the movie collapsed under the expectations I had because of all the hype and specially awards First the good bits the rare mix of various genres into one movie is something that might keep you on the edge of your seat or overburden your cognitive ability All the actors have delivered a good performance and cinematography is good too Some scenes depicting abject urban poverty are really riveting But if the writer or director wanted to deliver a message about poverty they have further muddied the waters by expressing this as poverty A few healthy adults who had no unforeseen shocks to their ability to work hard and earn a decent living go on to do things which range from boundaryline unethical to pure heinous crimes A long drawn second half makes it boring One of the reviews I watched about this film says A good movie is the one where you can t tell who is the villain Well you will be able to tell all the villains by the time the movie ends and you guessed it right its definitely not poverty This movie definitely did not deserve the Oscars over 1917 and Joker period,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5867185/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2023,"Not My Best Picture, but a Great Picture",Bong Joon Ho delivers greatness with this exploration of class warfare in South Korea What I love most about this film is how the director does not preach to us a trite message about greed envy and inequality In fact neither the rich nor the poor in this film are treated like demons or saints just people intersecting from their opposite ends of the social spectrum and all the chaos that comes with it Mid way the film takes a crazy turn that you do not see coming and it becomes something else entirely I will not give it away but Bong Joon Ho certainly knows how to keep the audience interested in what could have been a low hanging fruit story about social justice,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8952433/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2022,Parasite (2019) Review,This film was well made and thought provoking It is a social commentary on how the rich are ignorant of the struggles of poor people leeching off of them without considering the negative effects it has on them This element of the story was displayed in a unique and disturbing way that escalated in the shocking and bloody climax Unfortunately this film in my opinion wasn t as groundbreaking and masterful as the critics said it was It winked at the revenant issues in society without instigating change None of the people in the movie who were victims of this evil cycle did anything about their predicament to start helping others The rich and get out of their situation by accessible community college means The poor Despite the critic hype and intelligently displayed class war at the heart of the story it felt as if it used the same rinsed and recycled props sub plots downfalls cliches and unfortunate endings to display an ongoing problem in our society that has yet to be changed This movie isn t really asking for change it is just putting people against each other still oblivious to the situation rather then showing activism and improving the welfare of others,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8096869/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2019,Family Absurd Horror at its snarkiest,I watched this film not expecting much but the way it developed a sense of dread and anxiety crept in The film masterfully builds up and quietly holds the underlying tension and by the end it explodes in everyone s face leaving you gasping for air having held it for a longest time wondering what will happen next I eventually realized I was watching a subversive horror flick set in a beautiful house with secrets between the walls and what desperation can achieve when unhinged And my mind was blown when the third act went bongkers haha I watched this film 3 weeks ago And still trying to figure out what it all meant Don t miss it,9.0,2.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4994174/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2023,Masterpiece,This movie is a masterpiece The acting cinematography script and directing all combine to create excellent storytelling This story truly makes you realize the steps people will go through to take what they believe they are owed and keep it It really makes you reflect on humanity Additionally this gave me a huge appreciation for foreign films Despite this being in Korean the story is so well paced and captivating that you forget you are reading subtitles The lighting of this film plays a key role in its cinematography a lot of the light comes from artificial light sources that are shown in the movie such as lamps street signs and reflections of water This does a really good job of establishing the environment the characters are living in and allows us to truly see the comparison between the house they grew up in to the mansion they invade The acting feels very natural and it doesn t feel like you are watching a film so much as a documentary Additionally the use of voiceover does a great job of adding to the suspense of the story since it feels like we are learning things at the same time as the characters Overall this movie can give me tips for my own films with the importance of establishing a sense of environment using strong acting and the ability to tell stories out of order,10.0,0.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9006868/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2022,amazing 10/10 film,The 6 oscar winning movie PARASITE by Bong Joon Ho is an amazing film and this movie like the rest of Bong joon ho s movie usually are talking about social class likem snowpiercer and Okja but this movie PARASITE is definitely his best movie EVER but not to waste time let s get right into the review The movie starts with the Kim family trying to get wifi using the local coffee shops wifi they live in the very lower class and they are living in the ground most literally they find an ad for small time job like folding pizza boxes the fumigation team start to spray chemicals into the streets the mother Chong sook suggest to close the windows but the father Kim Ki Taek obliges saying that it ll kill the bugs in the house so they continue to fold pizza boxes while coughing cause of the smoke the pizza delivery woman criticizes the family saying the folded the pizza boxes wrong and how they can t sue it so they will dock their wages but the son Ki woo haggles with the delivery woman saying that they will take the dock wages and if he can get a part time job Right off the bat you can tell that the family is poor and lazy they fold the pizza boxes to the point where the pizza delivery woman says it s unusable they have to scrounge for money food and jobs and you can tell they aren t in the best situation The Kim family starts to eat dinner but there is a guy peeing right next to the window then Ki woos friend Min tells him to scurry off Min comes to drop of a gift a Scholar s rock Min is a guy who has life pretty sorted out he is a tutor and is in a good college he tells Ki woo that he has to go to a university so he recommended him to the family he tutors so he can get a job Ki woo s sister Ki Jung forges him a diploma from oxford so he can show the family that he is from a good school Ki woo walks up a driveway to the house which is big and modern and beautiful the maid Moon gwang wakes up the Mother Yeon Kyo she reads his transcript and watches him tutor her daughter Da hye to see if he is worthy of tutoring her daughter after the lesson he gets paid the he tells Yeon Kyo that he has an recommendation for her son Da Song he says that the person who can really fell art is a girl called Jessica Ki Jung the mother says that would be perfect to get a tutor for her so the next day Ki woo leds Jessica to the house to tutor Yeon Kyo son The story right now is just a string of lies Ki woo lying about his scholarship Ki jung lying about being a tutor the lies are about to get far worse from here also the Scholars rock which is a symbol of good luck doesn t bring much luck to the family later on in the story Jessica lies to the Yeon Kyo that her Da song has schizophrenia Jessica says she would be happy to take Da song as a student as Yeon Kyu is driven home by the Chauffeur she slides her undergarments into the car seat back pocket to get the driver fired so she can let Kim ki taek take his place as the new Chauffeur the plan works and the Chauffeur gets fired Jessica recommends to Yeon Kyo Kim ki taek as the new Chauffeur Yeon kyo likes the idea so Kim ki taek drives the father Park dong ik home while driving he tells Park dong ik lies saying that he has been driving for 30 years and starts to goad the father by complimenting him saying that he is impressive cause he is the head of a company and what not Park dong ik likes Kim ki taek so he hires him as the new Chauffeur Ki jung Kim ki taek and Ki woo try to get rid of the maid Moon gwang they figure out that she is severely allergic to peaches so they sneak some peach skin on her making her have an allergic reaction Kim ki taek tells Yeon kyo that while he was in the hospital he saw Moon gwang and he heard her say she has Tuberculosis Yeon Kyo gets afraid that it might spread to her family so she fires her opening a spot for the Chong sook to take the job as the new maid Like I said before the story brings them to a longer string of lies Kim ki taek tells a lie by saying that Moon gwang has TB and now they hire the mother the Kim family is metaphorically and literally infecting the family getting in like a PARASITE Chong sook soon becomes the new maid and soon the whole Kim family is part of their family but the son Da song is suspicious of the Kims cause they smell the same Yeon Kyo is going on a camping trip with her family so she instructs that Chong sook to keep the house safe when Yeon kyo and her family leave Chong sook lets her family in the house to stay for a few days in wealth while the Kim family eat talk have fun in the house the doorbell rings and Moon gwang shows up saying that she forgot something in the basement Chong sook reluctantly opens the door to let her in so the Kim family hides Moon gwang gets to the basement and opens a secret door behind a bookshelf and underneath the house is Moon gwangs husband Geun se Moon gwang begs Chong sook to feed her husband as the new maid and she said that she would even pay her until the Kim fall down the stars while snooping around Moon gwang records this while she plans to blackmail the Kims and get them fired Moon gwang and Geun se were the original PARASITES taking advantage of being the maid and the past knowledge of the basement eating their food and fornicating in the basement it s just a circle Geun se had a bakery that went bust so he fled to the basement same like Kim ki taek he had a bakery that went bust so he was in debt and now is poor like Geun se The kim family while Moon gwang is busy tackle her with peaches and restrains her husband Yeon kyo calls to say that they will be back early with her family from the camping trip cause it was raining hard the Kims rush to hide and clean the house they tie up Geun se and Moon gwang Moon gwang runs up the stairs trying to warn Yeon kyo but Chong sook knocks her down the stairs giving her a bad head injury Kim ki taek Brings Moon gwang down stairs with Geun se Geun se has been isolated for 4 years in the basement so he has gone a little crazy pressing morse code to tell Park dong ik that he has respect for him even though da song is the only one that knows morse code while the Kim family hide under the table Park dong ik and Yeon kyo discuss how it smells like kim ki taek they go on to say that he has a smell that you only smell in the subway and that insults Kim ki taek hiding under the table after they fall asleep the Kim family decide to run home in the pouring rain while they descend the stairs back to poverty finding their house is flooded they rush in and try to clean it up I LOVE the symbol where the Kim family runs down the stairs the camera shoots the side angel of them descending the stairs from being in the lavish modern house going down to poverty with the stairs literally leading down stairs which is SUCH a good shot It s unbelievable The Kim family find shelter in the homeless shelter after their house gets flooded with sewer water the Kim family try to get all the things they can before the house is fully engulfed with water Ki woo grabs the Scholars rock next shot shows the basement where Moon gwang with a bad head injury almost breaks lose her husband Geun se but she dies saying how Chung sook kicked her down the stairs while going to sleep in the homeless shelter Kim ki taek tells Ki woo that he has no plans and that they should just go to sleep the next day Yeon kyo sees its bright and pretty outside after the rain and she is getting ready for da songs birthday party I want to explain another shot that compares the rich to the poor Yeon kyo says how bright and pretty it is after it rained that is her perspective cause she lives on higher land and she is in upper class while the Kim family s house flooded they lost almost everything and how its sad and gritty Yeon kyo chooses any clothes she wants from her closet and they look very expensive while the Kim family has to run and get clothes cause the people in the shelter also need clothes so it s like a Battle royale where the Kims are this shot shows the difference between the poor and the rich it s SO BEAUTIFUL even though the scene is sad it s just GORGEOUS this symbolize Da song and Yeon kyos friends come over to the house Ki woo walks to the basement to check on Moon gwang and Geun se he drops the scholar rock he goes to pick it up but sees a body not knowing Moon gwang is geun se chokes Ki woo with a rope Ki woo gets loose but trips on the way out then Geun se bashes Ki woo head with the scholars rock Geun se walks outside with a knife trying to lure in Chung sook he stabs and kills Ki jung while she bleeds out da song falls down seizing park dong ik demands the keys from kim ki taek kim ki taek throws the keys but its falls under geun se and chung sook fighting chung sook kills geun se with a skewer park dong ik flips over geun se and pinches his nose cause the bad smell and grabs the keys this triggers kim ki taek so he goes over there and kills park dong ik chung sook holds ki jung as she dies Ki woo recovers from brain surgery but he can t stop laughing now Ki woo and Chung sook get taken to court and gets off with probation they visit ki jung pot where she got cremated but Ki woo can t stop laughing kim ki taek is nowhere to be found or is he kim ki taek is in the same predicament now he is the one in the basement trying to flee from people with higher power and is trapped in the basement Ki woo dreams of being rich and successful and buying the house and letting the kim ki taek out but that s just a fantasy something that he can t achieve This movie was INCREDIBLE PHENOMENAL FANTASTIC its a solid 10 10 for me the camera shots were AMAZING and the ways Bong joon hoe separates the rich from the poor is perfect I love this movie and I can see why it got 6 oscars,10.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8307351/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,"Great film, but the ending??",No doubt that this is a great film Great storytelling wonderful characters and scenes The build up is slow but very effective A lot has been written about this film in all the other reviews so I won t repeat but one thing that was sticking out for me was the ending Do we really believe that the father went back into the cellar Taking the risk he would t be able to get food at all and die And then when they moved house no one lived there the cupboards and fridge empty for months How did he survive And do we believe that he used morse code to contact his son How does he know that his son would watch Wouldn t he search a different way to contact him Call him at night And how can the son ever contact his father in the end saying he should come out and they will meet again The morse code works one way So this ending is the only real flaw to this film It feels constructed and overly romantic It even spoiled the emotion whereas I m pretty certain they thought it was tragical and moving So only 8 out of 10 because of the ending The rest of the film is pretty flawless,8.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5422791/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2021,The Novelty Of Reading Subtitles,Parasite Dir Bong Joon Ho 2019 South Korea I think some foreign language films become overrated due to many movie watchers not being book readers or the novelty of reading whilst watching glancing up between dialogue is probably where people are deriving pleasure You re barely able to watch the film while you re reading the subtitles at the bottom of the screen so you re unable to judge the acting and cinematography They re speaking in a foreign language too so it s impossible to rate the delivery of lines I doubt this film is rated as highly by Koreans Parasite is good quite original but certainly overrated The story is reasonably straight forward and not the mysterious thriller the original trailer advertises it to be The comedy only exist as humorous moments that can exist in everyday life whilst the drama isn t believable or impactful Who is the titular parasite Well we can assume all the people working for the wealthy family are the parasites It s a quick development of the plot when an entire impoverished family rapidly gain employment at the rich family s lavish home through skilled deception skills which seem unlikely in origin according to earlier scenes Of course their new source of income goes off rails as quickly as it had begun but certainly not in a deep Hitchcockian or clever way Many elements of the film are not fleshed out or are dead ends The family went from folding pizza boxes to being master conmen What was the relevance of the ornamental rock Why did the young man basically adopt the life of his friend Why was it briefly implied the rich man didn t love his wife What were the drugs he mentioned he d buy her What became of the boy s deciphered Morse code How did the young man send a letter to his father Was the end a dream So Parasite is not a funny film and not particularly thrilling dramatic clever or suspenseful The music score is ok but it s hard to comment on the acting as it s a foreign language movie and the photography is hard to judge when you re reading the almost non stop text at the bottom of the screen There s no particular moral to the story to learn other than maybe not pushing your luck and tolerating an unpleasant smell However from the originality and what you can discern from the plot it s still an engaging film even if that s largely from the novelty of reading subtitles 7 10 Not as good as Cinema Paradiso 1988 Director s Cut 173 min,7.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6754324/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2020,The Parasitic System of Capitalism.,The movie parasite has many aspects to look for It shows a new way to perceive you everytime you see it But maybe the most relavant aspects is of it s political perspective The movie throwout its storyline shows a series of scenes and act that portrays modern day society In present times it s noteworthy that the differences of classes is real and with time the difference of class is growing more and more Capitalism has rooted it s way into almost everything and anything The whole movie meaningfully describes two properties of capitalism rather specifically neoliberal capitalism these are Cool Capitalism and Cultural Hegemony The former is stated by Jim Mcguigan in his The coolness of capitalism today It describes the way the rich are unaware or rather ignorant about the actual condition of the society and that about the condition of the not so privileged In the movie there s a scene where Mr Kim is driving and in the backseat there s Mrs Park who says yesterday s night was a pleasant one in a parallel scene one can see the devastation on the poor Another example is in the same scene where Mrs Park says there s a bad smell and this increaes as the movie goes on Mary Douglass states There s no things as absolute dirt it exists in the eyes of the beholder i e its a social sature that is used to prove someone lesser than someone else This part shows how the rich are unaware of the cost or labour given for their privileges by people who are below them in this capitalist society This sums up as a fact that the people benifited by this capitalist system often distance themselves from the have nots both metaphorically and physically They don t want to smell anything that will remind them of poverty or maybe on which they are feeding The effects of late capitalism is the ever growing distance between the rich and the poor even in aspect of culture and lifestyle Antonio Gramsci calls this as the Cultural Hegemony Throwout the movie Mr Park describes about a line that he always keeps and loves to kept by any of his employees between him and them He describes this as professionalism but what this actually means is that he cuts out a division to maintain his status of supiority Cultural hegemony which favours the rulling class always teaches to aspire the supirior This can be seen in present day advertisement and how everyone wants to acquire the dominant status The same is portrayed in the movie by the scene where the poor family gets a chance to live in the Park house and enjoys themselves as the rich The very end of the movie shows us a scene where Ki woo has earned enough money to buy the rich house and afterall free his father however this momentary happiness is dissolved as its reveiled that it was just as aspiration made by boy in a letter to his father Furthermore in an interview Bong Joon ho says keeping in mind the family s economic condition it would take 564 year to buy that house This is contrary to the idea of capitalism in America that A little hardwork can get you anything you want to achieve although the reality is that the rich gets richer in an illusion of social mobility In the end part of the movie after all the horor is gone it is seen that the rich gets off from all the trouble but the poor is trapped and diseased In this society the poor are often faced with competition and struggle and are forced to fight between themselves for their living but theirs no attempt or ability to overthrow the prevailing system of domination This is also portrayed beautifully by the scene where the two poor families fight to get a hold of the phone and thus make their stay in the house Thus to sum everything up its to be said that if one looks at the movie in a normal way it is shown how the poor is feeding up on the rich i e the poor are the parasites to rich But if one is intelligent enough it can be pointed out that the rich are comparebly more parasitic to the poor The poor are often poor because the capitalist system companies is unwilling to compensate fair wages for them in order to maximize their own profits Capitalism has neither the capacity nor the morality nor the ethics to solve the problems of poverty Fidel Castro,9.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5940399/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2020,not bad,The article involves spoilers Parasites released last year is a seemingly ordinary and profoundly won the Palme d Or masterpiece There are some intriguing scenes in the movie which is the episode where father Kize stabs President Park when his daughter loses too much blood Indeed a person who seems to be easy going why did he start killing at this juncture Moreover there is no sign of anger before the murder let us analyze the large amount of information contained in it from this point Everyone also saw that part of the reason was the previous action when President Park picked up the car key under the body of another bottom man he pinched his nose This is to avoid smelling the damp odor that he had been staying in the ground for a long time and this behavior aroused the resentment of his father Keizer Other than that I want to say that this is not the only reason Let us analyze one by one First of all President Park s aversion to the behavior that is temporarily called moisture seems a bit abnormal at this time the tutor who was asked by his wife has been stabbed in the heart and his life is punished He is saving lives but at this juncture he still has to avoid the bad smell of the people at the bottom This seems a bit abnormal and some people will think that this is a play I think this illustrates a point he is more than unaccustomed he strongly hates this taste This action caused Kizawa who was originally in the camp of President Park to fall to the camp on the side of the deceased holding the key Yes they tried every means to get themselves a job become a parasite and gain wealth They are all private animals but their encounters are the same Compared with President Park he has a class gap After all why did President Park strongly hate this damp smell There is a reason for everything One of my personal speculations is that President Park was born into an ordinary family rushed into the upper class by his hard work and married Mrs Du who appreciated her talents This requires a process and after this process is finally carried out and succeeded the person who has risen in status will feel aversion to the people in the relatively lower class before him This aversion is often stronger than the people who are already in the upper class not to mention him At the time we were dealing with people from the bottom who were lower than the civilian class This layer of disgust is in the bones so it is so disgusting to smell that smell which explains the abnormal phenomenon above Similarly the Kize family also experienced a change in status caused by a change in status Before Parasitic came to President Park s house when both parents were in the state of unemployed nomads they saw that the drunkard outside the window did not dare to provoke peeing at home or his son s friend the drunkard roared away But when they saw the drunkard again after they had a job they fought hard feeling that they had a bottom and felt that their status exceeded that of the drunkard This also proved that after the promotion of status they would hate people who stayed in the previous class Similar stories like Fan Jinzhong received preferential treatment after lifting too much Let me say one last thing here Why do you think President Park is ordinary The above is just one reason and many other small details can also prove this point like being unfamiliar with aristocratic education and finding tutors for the children are all controlled by Mrs Du like when the children are camping on the grass they are willing to He slept casually on the sofa Or if you find a foreign object in the car you can carefully and rationally analyze its origin This detail is a relatively important quality from the civilian to the upper class Of course these are speculations and there may be other reasons behind these actions If the personal assumptions are really set by the writers it can be said that this movie is very intentional and has a lot of details Returning to the above in addition to the strong aversion of Kizawa which led to the scourge of murder President Park s behavior also has another layer of relatively comprehension that is the whereabouts of the Kizawa family will be exposed The corpse in front of him was a low level person before his death and he could see it on the outside The smell on his body was similar to the driver nanny and two teachers in his home they could be elegant in appearance but their heart and some behaviors could not hide their truth Appearance In addition Kize was very excited when introducing the babysitter combined with his own meticulous analysis above so that he could infer the secret of this parasitic family Keizer took this into account so he could only destroy evidence that would prove that they were a family Similarly this reasoning also has a small problem Because her daughter is almost dead and the hostess sees her husband s driver suffering from the serious injury of the tutor to this point it also feels a bit strange This matter will be exposed sooner or later so kill Park The president has no way to hide the truth Killing and not killing neither of them can stay here for a long time The grief of losing their daughters can t be restrained It can only be said that under the circumstances a blank brain did not allow him to consider so much The pain and helplessness of Keizer on this frame of the play can be said to be shocking As mentioned above there is a gap between strata This is to say another point Class differences are insurmountable Before the homicide Keizer asked President Park again if he loved his wife deeply and then President Park took it seriously shifting the topic and saying Please treat today as an extension of your work There are subtexts The president is unable to stay with his wife every day due to other reasons for his busy work so he said how much he loved her and he felt ashamed when answering this question Being stabbed by someone lower than himself he felt humiliated so he said this This sentence is actually meant to say you are not suitable to evaluate me you are not qualified and it is your job to do your job Keizer naturally sensed this meaning he was angry he was dissatisfied He was dissatisfied that he had to be treated as a servant He was dissatisfied with why he was not equal in life The dissatisfaction with society eventually vented to the dissatisfaction with people and this anger burned when President Park pinched his nose Perhaps at the end of the film Kize didn t understand why he had to become a parasite in order to live a good life and children like Duosong received a good education from an early age He lacked effort or luck Of course he didn t realize that when President Park despised him he also despised the drunkard I m afraid this is the weakness of human nature Therefore this whole tragedy is accidental and inevitable Too many reasons too many fetters led him to the extreme The main theme of Parasites is much higher than it seemed at first glance Although the whole story is about the dialogue and style of partial comedy there are some heavy pictures and deep themes behind which are worth thinking about It is just three simple families but it contains so many intrigues which is really surprising and regrettable Some of these details may never be discovered by

14 August 2019,Realistic Family Drama Portrayal became a Blockbuster!,First up the movie is overrated mostly by film critics From a critic s point of view it deserved a 9 10 solely for the great manipulation of scripting acting plot design and pace setting Plus I would understand why film makers critics are crazy about this movie as the Director successfully played the audience tricking them to accept a typical family class climbing drama with the simplest of tools and minimal resources into a blockbuster Thus I rate it as 9 as well However from one s own enjoyment as an audience it is just hanging between a so so 7 10 and probably a better 8 10 as there are some solid and memorable moments that I truly enjoyed Still there are many reasons to why this movie has not done enough to justify a perfect score or rated as a masterpiece from a production point of view especially since it did not deliver enough punches to make it relatively great in the big screen The GOOD Its success mainly lies in its ability to engage the audience I would not say to all but mostly with South Koreans and foreigners who is interested with their culture and my greatest applaud for it would be the deliberate shift from a classic cliche of Poor vs Rich Instead the two sides never collide in a direct manner that is the only refreshing point of the typical plot and that in itself is REALISTIC The BAD the movie does not live up fully to its title Parasite as the effect of parasitic relationship would be to cause its host harms to certain degree of annoyance However the host family in this movie barely felt any sense of hostility or annoyance or discomfort from the parasitism In fact the accident to the Host family in the end just is completely unrelated to Parasite theme of the movie Is it easily a fine line between cheap drama shot well in terms of cinematography and a great classic as there are no elements of a blockbuster tool or shortage of an A list cast to match its perfect score rating In my opinion instead of the camping twist that everyone is talking about the impressive note that could have been a game changer would be the flood scene Unfortunately that was not well played and became a redundant scene instead Still the director is a genius I would call him the Magician of the Cinema world as he effortlessly got everyone hooked into this illusion of a drama turned blockbuster Well done,9.0,3.0,20.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5058549/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2020,If You Love Quentin Tarantino...,There are countless reviews posted here that delve into this movie s themes I ve read at least 20 of them and many are engaging and brilliant But I m going to do something different I ll speak to the Tarantinoesque nature of this film There s a program on AXS TV called The Big Interview Dan Rather spends an hour talking with noted personalities across all genres of pop culture Several years ago he sat down with Quentin Tarantino QT and conducted a wonderful interview I don t want to include spoilers here so I think that if you re a QT fan you will understand what Dan is referencing below Late into the interview without accusing him of being exploitive Dan asks QT to discuss this How does he have the audience laugh and cry all in the same film How does he get an audience to view scenes of a horrific nature yet laugh during the movie or come out of the theater smiling QT s response when a movie really really does it to me it s because it s made me feel very different emotions I m the kind of director that I want to play you as an audience I want to be the conductor and you re my orchestra And I conduct the sounds that I make you to make and the feelings that I get you to feel And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings and I give you something ELSE to feel And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings and make you feel something ELSE yet again Well if a director can do that if a director can pull that off then you re a lucky audience member because you really had an experience that night You went to the MOVIES that was worth leaving the house I can t help but make my stuff funny because I think of things in a humorous way but it s not all a big joke I do like the idea that I can do this to the audience Laugh Laugh Laugh Stop laughing Stop laughing snaps fingers Laugh And maybe that stop laughing is something horrific maybe it s hard to watch He then cites specific examples from one of his movies where he said he needed to traumatize the audience I love a lot of what QT has done but not all of it This movie seems to follow the QT blueprint but then it veers off in one direction and stays there I did not leave the theater smiling Thus my rating,6.0,0.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5426704/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2020,Overhyped like those Kpop shows,Really overhyped and overrated The movie is OK but far from best of the decade to be honest When watching the movie I felt that I was always 2 or 3 seconds ahead of the plot which especially the first half vibes like that of a cliche sitcom show squeezed and polished really hard into an artsy crowd pleasing movie This whole unprecedented praise around the movie which I guess I will never understand somehow reminds me of the fanatics about Kpop which un surprisingly shares the initial K,5.0,6.0,30.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5472551/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2020,What a disappointment.,Summary Grade 3 out of 10 for me He is totally with globalist ideas class struggle between poor and rich The people rated it 10 out of 10 saying that the film opens their minds to new perspectives but if you haven t seen the difference between rich and poor today you must live on another planet It depicts the revolt of the poor against the rich in a crude way in addition they commit crimes and end up returning to a worse life than before They had to revolt with the government that does not promote any improvement So I mean I m poor and I m going to go around committing crimes being a criminal but against the government I don t do anything What a disappointment,3.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5822217/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2020,Interesting movie to say the least!,I watched the movie knowing how much praised it was so the expectations were pretty high I really liked the 1st half of the movie the one establishing the whole deception situation It was very smart and had 100 of my attention drawn to it I consider the moment when the family sits at the living room and the doorbell rings a chasing point for both the plot and my overall view of the movie It turned really weird really fast with some small plot holes as of my own perception I d give a 9 5 to the 1st half of the movie to the other half probably a 7 Still decent movie overall good acting interesting idea nice music and picture it deserved the oscars it received no doubt about that And cinema is indeed a nice way to learn the culture of each country through the stories that are being told every time I mostly watch European and American movies so it was very interesting watching a Korean movie and i did pick up some traces of their culture Stonks,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5789423/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2020,Not my kind of Film,Its many wins and Oscar nominations should be enough to summarize the film Parasite as it was put on a pedestal at this year s academy awards due to its incredible cinematography and well written script Going into watching the film I had many high expectations as I was aware of its at that time many nominations and high praise by those who had seen the film I was quickly let down to realise that although these many things were true about the film I found it to be a very long two hours to sit down and watch the film Perhaps this was because of its slow establishment at the start or maybe the film was just not something that I would normally be interested in but I didn t enjoy it I was really disappointed by this because it was clear that the incredible production that went in to the film was truly something to set it apart As far as the movie goes I thought that it was very strong the script seemed to be very developed for its nature and the camera work was beautiful For me the plot just didn t grab my attention but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys films of a similar genera Above the high praise that critics seemed to pick out about the film its main theme seemed to center around the American Dream In my opinion I believe that the film did in fact summarize the American Dream Not only did the characters acquire wealthy jobs but they managed to stick together as a family Although their financial situation could have been handled in much better ways I believe that the bond that they created as a family is definitely the epitome of a dream as money can t always buy you happiness,8.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5494817/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2020,Terribly overrated,This movie lacks depth nuance and completely misses the mark when it comes to emotionally impacting its audience I m baffled how this film has won so many awards as it doesn t draw one in to really care about what is being shown It s silly shallow and makes for an okay horror flick but if you re looking to learn something be moved or gain new perspective I suggest just reading the newspaper instead,2.0,4.0,18.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5489871/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,A very solid but lacking film which I'm sorry to see becoming a representative of the Korean film industry,Solid to good movie would almost give a 7 that I definitely enjoyed It s got Bong s style and especially his tone written all over it which is characteristically simultaneously all over the place in this case goofy tense thrilling emotional tragic violent and even reminiscent of Oceans 11 and seamlessly interwoven without feeling sudden moving one from one feeling to the other which is something I don t know any other director to pull of so well But that s something you can say about most of the guy s films It s a fun move but that s where it stops more or less Yeah there s OMG THEMES and CLASS but throwing those in doesn t change the movie I d go through the things that lessen the film for me but I ve typed enough as is and the issues are pretty apparent on your second third viewing Don t know it s a fine movie but there were GREAT ones that people don t bat an eye over I just dread hearing people talking about this and saying OMG DID U EVER TRY WATCHING KOREAN MOVIES BEFORE It s sure happened to me I hope it dies down All in all it s a decent well placed movie with masterful use of tone but Cannes and the Oscars and all the people on this very site raving could do so much better I just hope the movie will be a gateway for people rather than being that movie that lets you say Hey I ve seen FOREIGN films before,6.0,3.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5492372/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,Excellent,Parasite is about a wealthy Korean family in a modern day Downton Abbey upstairs downstairs situation one far more unstable than the patrician caste realises The film could perhaps be a bit more lean and mean and deliver its jeopardy and payoff with more despatch But it is an enjoyable elegant scabrous movie about a mix of servitude and trickery that is an interesting theme in Korean cinema,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5618575/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2020,Made for USA market I think,I found this film to be trying to cover too much time in one film You cannot convey depth and soul in such a rush It was a check list of trying to be quirky deep etc It did not work I previously saw 3iron and that blew me away This film has a very high score and I do not understand why It is overtly formulaic No character is given enough time to become anything you can relate to really It is a hurry and that does not work for something like this It is like Indie film for mainstream mind I was not moved by it,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5806482/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,The Most Important Movie in 2019?,I finally went along with OSCAR hype and watched the Parasite just kidding I was going to see it anyways I just never managed to get into the theater in the summer when it was in the cinemas I m not quite sure did seeing the movie after all the award shower enhanced the viewing experience or left me with shoulder shudder I will not say that Parasite is not worthy of all these awards but considering all the hype I expected something I don t know more Do I think that the film is overrated or underrated doesn t matter What matters is that Parasite is a wonderful movie I must give the highest praise to the actors The story was intriguing with several layers and it contained some unpredictable twists and turns along the way I have a hard time to find perfect words to praise the cinematography the camera literally danced with the actors and with the story Yet it was all so subtle that if you just didn t turn your attention to awe at the cinematography you almost didn t notice it Same thing with editing The magnificent aspect was also the way the story was told it started like absurdist comedy then turned to quite spicy satire then all of the sudden gory thriller and then ending this all with a nice touch of morale but without preaching The change in the atmosphere didn t ruin the pace or make the film lose its focus The characters were clear each one of them perfectly fleshed out At least the best original screenplay award is well earned Besides being visually poetical and masterfully acted the movie raises some poignant questions People praise how good of overview Parasite gives on South Korean society but to be honest all the First World countries are dealing with the same problems No matter which economical class we are people ale too self absorbed that they don t see the faults in themselves everything is someone else s fault While different people struggling for the same goal rather than becoming allies and work together they start to compete and that usually means that both sides will lose that is just philosophizing it is not a spoiler Was it the most important film in 2019 Well I don t know because I haven t seen most of them but Parasite is most definitely a rare masterpiece that can be entertaining and what most important thought provoking at the same time,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5527864/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,Cinematographic Masterpiece!,Parasite illustrates the Kim s persistent inclination to transcend social classes It is essentially a realistic scrutinization of how the rich and poor are parasitic towards one another however the beauty of this film is that this idea merely one of the countless interpretations out there Each scene in this film has been articulated with such thought while subtle and the use of cinematography mis en scene motif and symbolism to name a few film techniques prevalent all cohesively work together to portray the social disparity There is so much yet so little going on for me this film was minimalistic but incredibly insightful and meaningful It is the epitome of perfection I also love Choi Woo Sik he is easily one of my favourite actors This movie from the actors to the filming is absolutely flawless If you don t want to watch it because you don t want to read subtitles well you re missing something incredibly special Bong Joon Ho is a genius alongside the many amazing members of the production team They all worked together to create such a masterpiece A good movie leaves you speechless after but a GREAT movie like Parasite will keep you invested for months and months and perhaps for the rest of your life because of how realistic this is Amazing movie 10 10,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5631441/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2019,A disturbing yet beautifully woven tale of social disparity,Bong Joon Wo s Parasite is a disturbing yet beautifully woven tale depicting the dehumanizing gap between the haves and have nots Metaphorically and figuratively Ki Tae s family live below the ground of the haves Their toilet is even higher than their dwelling ground This is how poor they are They struggle to barely crawl up to the surface of economic adequacy resorting to scams and deceptions scrapping to make ends meet The seeming victims are the Parks a well to do family enveloped in the world of luxury and complacency Much of the depictions of Ki Tae s family members would initially make the audience think of how despicable they are While the parks are portrayed to be adequately tolerant of the underprivileged as long as their life is not in any way imposed Slowly but surely the movie unravels The subtext of hopelessness of classism soon reveals itself mixed in with a very well thought out plot twists Parasites shows a world where the underprivileged are too wrapped in their own survival to recognize the trap they are in while the privileged are too busy meandering the labyrinth of western luxury One of the best movies ever crafted for sure,9.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5268304/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2020,Who is the parasite?,Here is an interesting fact which I recently realized about this movie in his work The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon Karl Marx refers to bourgeoisie and bourgeois controlled state as the parasitic body which must be removed in order to end the opression on the working class However at the same time one can think of the working class family who insinuates into the life of this bourgeois family as parasites So who is the actual parasite This is the question I think the director wants us to consider and ultimately it depends on your approach Director s view on this issue is clear and it is so brilliantly elaborated in the film that I am in awe of his talent It made me question my own behaviour as an individual within the system It shook me and I think that is what all great forms of art does,10.0,0.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5906332/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,Simply unbelievable,It s rare for a movie to combine cinematic fireworks and social commentary in the thrilling way that Korean director Bong Joon ho manages with Parasite a slick home invasion drama that mirrors the masks worn by its characters polite until they drop the pretence The director of The Host and Snowpiercer is no stranger to genre gymnastics and here he tells the story of a poor Seoul family infiltrating the lives of a super rich household through suspense drama laughs and farce allowing moments of pure terror quiet observation and baroque noise to sit happily alongside each other It never jars as it glides from one state of being to the next The appeal of Parasite is simple and age old inequality class manners and how we behave to protect what s ours or to gain that which we believe should be ours,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6609115/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2021,It was basically a horrific comedy,I was disappointed with the movie after the reviews Seemed unrealistic and I didn t find the morale of the story I read how you can see Mr Park s view of the help can be perceived as seeing the help as lesser human beings but with the absurd ness of the story it questions Mr Parks integrity as a character It was a silly heist with a silly ending none of it being likely and I didn t learn anything The poor family stepped on other poor people to get ahead and even murdered a women then the husband of that women comes after them People kill people and it all seems ridiculous,6.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7110554/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2021,Wow,Parasite is a film capable of accompanying you in the narration halfway hand by hand making you amazed and sometimes laugh at the situations that the family devises then all of a sudden the hand that accompanied you on that journey gives you a loud slap And plunges you into an even more paradoxical situation in which hatred and fear which for the entire film remain slightly below the surface take over until the last scene that makes you understand the profound dramatic condition in which the family will have to live for years to come,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6970718/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2020,Amazing! What a rollercoaster! Definitely recommend.,Clever and darkly humorous Parasite is Bong Joon ho all the way through and he gives us a masterclass in writing and directing With its superb visuals that are full of metaphorical shots and an incredibly talented cast the film delivers a captivating commentary on the stark contrast between rich and poor those who are destined to rule and those who are destined to serve how being one or the other defines who you are and the lengths that the latter is willing to go to when striving to change that Whether you agree entirely with the iconic director s bleak outlook doesn t affect how fantastic of a viewing experience his latest work is,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5770237/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2021,One of the films that will become cult and mark a before and after in Hollywood,This film does everything well the way it is written generates one of the best rhythms that I have seen in a film of this magnitude the plot is built in such an interesting way that at all times you are aware of what is going to happen or in tension of key moments in history The construction of the characters is very well defined in both families with realistic personalities and behaviors about the direction and script of Bong Joon ho is magnificent and is evidenced in the final result with the subtext before the criticism of classism and clearly the title of the work where the parasites are reflected in both extremes both the Park that benefit from the workforce of the Kim and the families of less resources that benefit from the wealth of the Park family both the Kim family and the people who were hiding in the bunker The production design is also perfect to favor the concept of the film building the first floor of the main home from scratch or using the stairs as a metaphorical narrative resource Ending with cinematography the photographic direction seems incredible to me and in addition to being of high quality it is connected with the general concept of the division of social classes simply accompanied by visual resources such as literal lines or the simple fact of raising or lowering levels at the narrative and literary level it is also complete to generate a true impact with events such as the deaths and dreams of families in general I believe that this film will revolutionize the artistic level of other productions with so much acting technical and directing talent it is a example of South Korea to the world,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7340048/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2020,A very good movie that kept me engaged the entire time.,At first the idea of a poor family full of con artists going after an upper class family seemed kinda been there done that sort of I wasn t really into this at the start Once it got to the halfway part it took a very unexpected turn and the suspense kicked in big time I suppose the best way for me to describe it is like a snowball going down a hill getting bigger and bigger and then BAM because that climax was crazy I can definitely see why this got hyped up quite a bit besides obviously winning the Academy Award for Best Picture Good choice here,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5788904/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2021,Brilliant,This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and my heart was racing in every scene It has elements of all genres from comedy suspense and thriller After the movie ended I was speechless it even brought me to tears and I still don t know why The director successfully makes the viewers feel like they are part of the movie but also gets a message across about the standards of living for lower class Koreans I had never heard of this director but after seeing Paradite I ll be sure to check out his other movies,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7202753/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,Highly overrated,I really don t understand what they see in this movie It s good at most It is not an original theme it is not believable as a story it is slow and it does not entertain People are very hypocritical to praise a mediocre work of art so highly Without any doubt or fear of being wrong this movie does NOT deserve the academy award The film has the opportunity to develop stories and is left with superfluous scenes It tries to tell the injustices that a family of employees receives and honestly it fails to move the viewer I find it extremely strange that so many people have praised a film that is far from innovative The script is bad at the very least it could have told a story ten times better I m genuinely surprised at the rave reviews this mediocre movie is getting,5.0,4.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8645509/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2021,Who is the real Parasite? The rich or the poor.,A foreign film that won four Oscars is unheard of In 2020 the film Parasite directed by Bong Joon Ho won Best Picture Best Director Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film During this time many Asians and Asian American people were facing a lot of racism because of Covid and much other generational racism therefore it was a very BIG deal that a foreign film that was all in Korean with an all Korean cast was winning Oscars back to back It was a tremendous accomplishment especially considering the Academy Awards have been chastised for being racially biased against persons of color and for failing to recognize Asian actors Parasite is set in a modern day society in the city of Seoul the film shows the dark reality of societal structures The Park family a working class family cunning their way into the Kim home The Kim family a wealthy family clinging to the working class by living comfortably off the backs of their labor The movie Parasite critiques societal class and shows us how two classes can co exist but never interact The stairs which depict how the Parks and the Kims are separated and show the double meaning of societal class distinction are one of the primary symbols in the movie Parasite The depiction of stairs in this film is quite repetitive there are stairs in practically every scene especially as the plot begins For instance to go into the Parks house you must descend the stairs while to get into the Kims home you must ascend the steps To illustrate there s a scene where there s a rainstorm and the Parks have to hurry from the Kims house to theirs because it s flooding and we can see how far the Parks reside from the Kims at this point The cameras are filming the Parks as they descend the steps that lead to their neighborhood Every scene shot during this period depicts the Parks going down the stairs which represents their stance in societal class The rain was a curse for the Parks but a blessing for the Kims who found the rain to be beautiful and allowed for the sky to be blue and clear the next morning I appreciated how Bong Joon Ho took his time to outline the symbolism of the stairs and show how two different families viewed the rainstorm It gives the rich poor divide a whole new level of significance This film was beautifully crafted the direction of the cinematography captures the stillness of the scenes and it is also able to capture the expressions of characters and we re able to understand how something makes them feel Majority of the film is set inside the Kim s family estate an architectural wonder There s a scene where Ki woo Choi Woo shik the main character s son from a working class family pays a visit to Kim s home On his way to the house the camera captures him walking up a hill from which we can see a wealthy neighborhood The angles make Ki woo appear small in comparison to the big houses emphasizing how Ki woo is looked down upon and how unattainable this lifestyle is for him The visual composition of the daylight depicts a better way of life as represented by the Kims whereas the basements and crowded streets depict how life feels trapped as portrayed by the Parks The cinematography undoubtedly supports the film s plot and the direction that director Bong Joon Ho was pursuing Typically Hollywood films portray the less fortunate families as fools For instance Joker 2019 was an outcast the rich would always promise him assistance but Arthur Joaquin Phoenix Joker s real name never received assistance and was constantly exploited As a result he harbored a grudge against the wealthy However in Parasite the Parks are incredibly intelligent because they don t have the resources of a wealthy family The Parks are essentially scavengers which necessitates a high level of intelligence Many terrifying events occur in the Kims home The story has a Stephen King vibe however his typical American suburban life is replaced with a capitalist social class in Seoul Although the film is initially amusing and contains some extremely clever jokes the plot shifts and the film becomes less amusing and more serious When you watch the film you can t help but think that anything like that could happen which is unnerving Parasite is a brilliant movie flawlessly shot and the actors did a phenomenal job portraying their characters It shows a great depiction of how the working class is compelled to compete with one another while families like the Parks enjoy a comforting life of leisure Described by Bong Joon Ho Parasite is a comedy without clowns a tragedy without villains This film did an excellent job of delving into the characters personalities desires and pain Its serious message is delivered effectively while maintaining a dark horror tone This film kept me on the edge of my seat mesmerized me and kept me guessing about the beginning middle and end The collateral crossovers between the families as well as the overall meaning of the film continue to pique my interest Who is the real parasite The rich or the poor,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7412478/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2020,Top 10 material from this decade,A well deserved win for the behemoth of a movie So many undertones are explored and subtly depicted through the runtime of the movie If foreign language films are anything like this movie it is bound to have more nominations from across the world for the Academy s best picture award The movie fantastically talks about social stratification and class divide and how struggle and entitlement eats up the humanity inside The genius screenplay and plot line is accompanied by artistic sense of cinematography and an incredible score The ensemble cast have shown ingenuity in playing the characters The one question that remains even after the end of the movie is who is the Parasite or is just the concept of hope for a Utopian world and fulfillment of all desires or simply our real society Its a must watch The use of architecture design imagery and visual composition is magnificent The daylight shows the better a more hopeful and upper echelon way of life whereas the dungeons like basements and semi basements show how life feels trapped difficult and how it stinks of poverty Bong Joon Ho has masterfully drawn parallels and intersections between the two kinds of life and the chosen way to represent them from an architectural stand point says volumes The camerawork is exquisite in depicting serious situations which have greater impact on the whole story The parts to whole and whole to parts sequencing of shots brings to each scene a sense of completeness yet a mystery that continues onto the next,10.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5877800/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2020,Great Movie but not a Best Picture,I thought the movie was great the plot was very solid and intriguing even though it felt long because of the subtitles it was a very enjoyable film As mentioned in other reviews this movie has a lot of different elements It has some action at the end romance mystery and horror The movie does get a bit creepy some times but it doesn t take away anything from the film However I just didn t think it was as great as some of the other nominees even though I haven t seen many I don t think it s as good as 1917 and others Don t get me wrong it s a fantastic movie but it s not up there The movie did get a bit confusing at times but it s still relatively easy to follow Parasite is still a must watch though I would recommend it to anyone who is fine with reading subtitles,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5756026/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2020,An unexpected favorite,I went into the movie pretty skeptical I m not normally huge on thrillers but Parasite pulled out all the right stops The film was shot well the score was impressive but not overbearing and there was hardly a dull point over its two hour run time Absolutely deserving of the acclaim it s received and a must watch for those who enjoy social commentary and gripping storytelling,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5598150/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,"Original, but overrated",The movie itself isn t too bad It s worth watching if you want something different from what you re used to watching The story line is good it really makes you pay attention on little things but it s also too simple Acting was amazing but I didn t like the directing Maybe it was just directed in a unique way that not everyone will find its true value but for me it was boring In my personal opinion this movie is kinda overrated,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5718913/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,Poor story line,Overall a decent movie that differs from recent successful thrillers but the movie isn t as exciting as you would expect Lots of time you are sitting there hoping for speed up story telling The tension between the two families isn t really build up so the end comes surprising,6.0,1.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6291383/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,Tumbling,If you make a plan life never works out that way A classic line carved in the frame of new concepts and innovative structure of new cinematography Parasite belongs to drama Parasite belongs to psychological horror Minute by minute my mind and thoughts weren t able to keep up with the con family s plan Through Boon Joon ho s symbolic symmetrical following shots and a strong narrative all the way till the family dinner at the upper class house What lies between those wines is something that the audiences wanted but never expected There was a shot of the former housekeeper shutting off the light of the basement stairs when it was placed between Kim Ki jung and Mrs Park with a flip of a switch the mysterious curtain of the house opened Clearly Boon Joon ho knows the fine line between a soap opera and a drama Carrying those anxious and bubbly fragile plans of the con family I was able to look back and reflect with the father his emotional status is the needle that penetrates and pinpoint the map of this story Class between class what do we expect from wealth and what do we despise from the poor When we look at these two family what I noticed is the benefit that the poor family acquired from the rich gradually shifted into hate later on By using Mrs Park s ignorance and her pursuing of reaching a certain hierarchy in her specific social status and Mr Park who is the main income source of the family but constant absence of family Preciousness runs through the upper class their vanity of stepping stone to those who truly has exclusive and graceful lifestyles Surprisingly the story of Parasite never used something as tangible and as cheap as money to be the bait of desire in the film Instead it used something as common as daydreaming and curiosity as we can see the poor family came to the house with a purpose of fulfilling a purpose of living in quality and wellness They never planned to harm or manipulate the Parks all they ever want is sunlight and a clean space with each other But their plan was jeopardized by another similar family that longs for a stronger purpose shelter which is conflicted and somehow shifted their impression towards the Parks To them the Parks are the emotionless snakes that harvest their effort and their goal of being well in the same society The scene when two families revealed themselves was tremendous seeing the Parks reveal what s behind their deceptive looks and words and seeing the Kims burst with a stronger bond and unity between them is such a horrifying and realistic comparison Then when we think about it did Mrs Park pass out for her husband or for the end of her class Or we can ask was Kevin s dream of eventually moving into the house realistic or just another anguishing and beguiling plan of his,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5666551/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2023,Dark. Bleak. Pessimistic. Wasted Opportunity.,It starts off somewhat light hearted It then shows how people act inauthentically to fulfill certain role expectations and to manipulate people in order to be accepted and paid It explores the hypocrisy of prejudice and how people slip into an us and them mentality It alludes to how people feed off each other It had potential to then provide some sort of moral undertones to provide some sort of remedy perhaps through the characters having realisations that lead them to make positive changes Perhaps even leading them to humility redemption or reconciliation But it pretty much just veers off into a horror movie It tries to be clever with allusions and metaphors about unconscious and repressed psychological forces And perhaps there is some allegory for the North South Korea divide in there as well But the story becomes so over the top in its efforts to disturb that it loses credibility If you want to wallow in pseudo intellectual generalisations about socio economic class conflict and long outmoded Freudian theories of psychological neuroses then this might be a movie for you Verdict Dark Bleak Pessimistic Wasted Opportunity 3 10,3.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9421473/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2022,film,Hello dear friends and readers Well I finally got to the film Parasite about which there are already so many reviews despite the fact that the film is completely fresh 2019 I am not very familiar with Korean cinema if not to say that I am not familiar with it at all I m not fond of dramas I tried to watch something somehow but no everything is too naive and enthusiastic for me Therefore to be honest the film Parasite also began to watch with a little apprehension however what am I risking If the film doesn t work if I don t like it I ll turn it off and start watching something else there s a big problem So as you already understood the film Parasite is made in South Korea I must say right away that it seems to me the title of the film does not quite fit the plot it is somehow wrong confusing I would call the film Swindlers Liars Deceivers well or something like that Nevertheless in Russian the meaning of the word parasites has a slightly different connotation in Wiki Parasite trans a person living on other people s means at the expense of other people s labor a parasite social parasite And in the film the family worked on its own and therefore earned money relatively honestly In general the film is very good dynamic sometimes unpredictable Yes and the quality of filming the acting all this pleased me I will not retell the plot but I will say about it very briefly The guy gets a job in one fairly wealthy family and then by hook or by crook drags both his sister and his parents to work there How it will turn out for both families you will learn from the film I can recommend the tape Parasite But still I don t share the general enthusiasm for me the film turned out to be a one off I looked and even got a portion of the positive But I definitely won t revise this film and I m unlikely to remember it after a couple of months,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7778080/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2023,It's very metaphorical,Parasite is a very well written movie It talks about power greed and hope it says that how humans are capitalist by nature That a person only thinks about himself that when a poor family has power they will not help other poor but will only think about themselves There is a power hierarchy in the society and the one who has more power he considers the one with less power as a filth This film talk about privilege also that a higher class person gets everything but a lower class person has to work 10 times more to get that Everything in this film was well balanced there is no villain in this film the real villain is the situation Yes bong didn t give any reason for all or nothing but that s the whole point that s why it feels surprising The murder of Mar Park by Mar kim was a very psychological act The murder of Mar Park by Mar Kim is very surprising and to understand it you need to understand the psychology of Mar Kim Kim never wanted to kill Park it was the situation that led to this act Jealousy and anger have already boiled over in Kim s mind against Park And it s shown in a very subtle way He used to respect the park a lot but later he came to know that he just thinks of him as a worker who stinks alot This thing was deeply disturbing to Kim inside A big truth was already revealed in front of Kim secret bunker And right after that he heard Mr Park say about himself that he stinks and later her whole house got washed away by the rain all trouble came upon him in one night Still he has to go to work in the morning where the Park family is about to enjoy a birthday party But still the park treats him like a worker wo stinks they are completely unaware of his problem Even when geun se killed Kim s daughter Park was only thinking about his son and he should logically think about his son first But Kim felt bad for this work of Park because of his hatred when Park shrunk his nose to avoid the smell then Kim felt worse in that situation his suppressed hatred and jealousy came out in the form of anger which led to the murder of the park Kim had no Big reason to kill Park and he never want to kill mr Park it just happened to him like a DREAM a BAD DREAM And he got punished for this because he did wrong he had to leave his family and stay in the bunker and later he also apologized to the park but now nothing is going to happen with this apology crime was already committed now he will have to atone for it this shows the jealousy and hatred of the lower class against the higher class And the movie never justifies Kim s crime Kim was not a psycho killer he was a normal person he committed this crime which he regrets but now nothing is going to happen by regretting In the last a conversation between a father and son is shown which is very emotional a son will never consider his father a criminal He also knows that my father is not such a person but nothing can happen now In the end the film ends on Hope despite all this ki woo never stops hoping I don t know whether he will be able to get that house or not but God bless him to buy such a house so that when it rains next time he can enjoy it with his family like mr park does Both families were not parasite in this film the real parasite was human greed hatred jealousy and situation,10.0,0.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8953384/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2020,Ok but overrated,I love when people get carried away and jump on the bandwagon Enjoyable It was ok Best film of the year Not a chance Just because it has subtitles I think some people think they are getting their cultural diversity fix Its been done better a hundred times over The comedic element watch Kung Fu hustle The serious undertone watch pretty much anything else Won t be recommending wasn t awful just a bit meh,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5548526/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2020,"Great movie, great acting which plays out excellently.",I wasn t quite sure where this movie was going at first but like with all good movies this one puts this caper into place with precision The only criticism I would give is that it plays out quite slowly In fact there are some areas that I felt could have been cut from the movie to save a little time but not detract from how the story is told I won t go into too much detail about the movie as I don t want to spoil anything All I will say is that this movie is really enjoyable has good humour and sorrow but overall it plays out brilliantly and it is certainly understandable why it won an oscar for best picture and best screenplay to name a couple,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5772476/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2020,The film that starts almost like a comedy but it expands into mysterious drama.,In this film the author captured the ratio of lower social class in South Korea Even though he portrays the family in a very comical way he managed to show us their desire for a better life It shows how they are able to do anything lie cheat just to achieve their dream On the other hand we have another family that stands as a representative of a higher class they employ Kim Ki woo s family as a servant in their house We can see big differences between social classes The storyline of the movie changes drastically when Kim Ki woo receives a stone talisman as a gift from his friend This stone is supposed to provide them with happiness and money And the boy believes in it he puts all his faith in the stone leans on it and carries the stone with him even in the most difficult moment He thinks that everything good in his life is due to the stone Woo sik Choi perfectly portrayed the character of a boy who looks innocent on the outside but hides a cunning plan inside At the end of the movie Kim Ki woo said Dad today I made a plan a fundamental plan I m going to earn money a lot of it University a career marriage those are all fine but first I ll earn money When I have money I ll buy the house On the day we move in Mom and I will be in the yard Because the sunshine is so nice there Which seems like an American dream To study to marry someone and be rich That s what he wanted the whole movie But we all know that s never going to happen It s just a beautiful lie And American dream is a beautiful lie as well,9.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5507867/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,Watch this Movie!,Parasite includes drama mystery comedy romance thriller and a few more genre which makes it so multilateral that everyone will find his part Some people say it could be compared to the american dream which isn t wrong because a lot is about raising money and work hard to get into a college But this is not the only background story The whole movie is filled with metaphors what makes you thinking over it and realizing parts a few days after you watched it The pictures and camera angels aren t just good they also imply a great many symbols which makes it even more interesting to watch it Sometimes it was a little too much for me that s why I gave only nine stars Anyway if you want to see a great movie Parasite is a good choice,9.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5507824/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2020,Great story; outstanding screenplay,Spoiler alert Winning an Oscar despite being a foreign language film is remarkable Inspired by the Oscar win and the surrounding publicity if you watch the trailer it will intrigue you enough to feel an urgency for watching the movie That this is a class war movie will be evident by then That there is a parasite central to the story is implied too but who preys on whom is still subject to interpretation or is at least a twisted discovery you make as the story unravels There is a rich family gullible nice but also self centered and afflicted with class divide enough to dominate everyday decisions in their high ground lives There is a poor family struggling for food and shelter in their below the ground apartment life and yet reveling in their laziness and short term merry making of whatever bounty they can get from odd jobs When an opportunity comes knocking promising an easy way of pulling them out of their pit they pursue it full throttle morality and legalities be damned The momentum of their success builds up for a while and descend begins as they encounter a secret and fraud of another kind threatening their new found prosperity As they discover people like themselves who have stakes in uncovering their frauds they have to win the fight to not slip back to their below the ground existence The unfolding of surrounding events also leads to a realization that the idea of their affluence is also just a mirage After all the stench of the basement remains in them and rich people will forever pinch their nose in disgust as their stench wafts through the rich people s perfumed houses There is a moment of irony too when a few hours after they had savored the rainfall as they lay usurping the living room of their bosses and pretending that they belonged their after all they realize that unknown to them the same heavy rain had filled up their basement house with dirty sewer water destroying their belongings and rendering them homeless in real life The pretense of being rich as a part of their rich bosses life suddenly becomes exhausting and together with the chaos of meeting their possible nemesis shocks them out of their reveries of affluence shatters all their future planning and leads to a complete meltdown a day later The final scene plays out amidst an ominous setting The feeling about an impending tragedy is strong It still manages to be darkly funny as Geun Sey plays out his murderous streak with a comical frenzy The movie won an Oscar for original screenplay and is as much a masterpiece as implied by that accolade It talks literally and metaphorically about the chasms in the society and leaves the viewers to decide if there are any heroes or villains at all The movie shows self imposed helplessness that poverty brings along how the urge to come out of its grips fast and easy often pushes people further in to its throes That the need for escapism is so strong that precious reality is lost and often the only way out through education a steady job is completely lost Ki Woo often promises himself and others about the rightful things he will do and achieve but often leaves it to a later day At present he is too busy forging the documents fencing off his day to day struggles or later longing for the good days that happened and this is likely to be his way of life throughout in the absence of any supportive surrounding That is also how the movie ends with a promise by him which he is sure to never fulfill and so the longing the aspirations the needs will remain along with the helplessness of never quiet achieving them The parasite in the meantime could either be the one who had resigned to an underground life living off the bounty stolen from his rich savior as long as he lived or the one who is still alive and hiding in the same underground hell albeit with a hope of one day coming out of it Or it could be both of them or all the poor men in a hurry to attach their woeful life to those better off around them and be like parasites by the awful choices they make or maybe as a natural order of things or a bit of both,9.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5508942/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2021,severely impractical and over hyped,The idea of parasites was good but how they built the drama was totally rushed They just wanted to jump right into the intense ironical situations of the parasite family so bad that they forgot building a strong opening Like how on earth can amateurs play professional roles that easily That was totally nonsense A seasoned businessman can t realise something wrong with his driver who fakes years of experience after talking with him for days Of course they can learn but the way they turned the daddy into a skillful driver overnight was insane Also his boy and girl who plays perfectly those roles of intellectuals made it look impractically easy Come on the topic was potential and the directior s talent was on point some times but this was absolutely rushed Too dramatic and not practical enough It needs remaking on another level as the topic is worth it,2.0,1.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7259555/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,Parasite @ Bong Jong Ho #,Finally a movie comes what matches Hollywood s standards of cinematography and direction Ideally a very simple tale of a struggling family trying to make ends meet thru a con job when desperation becomes the hour that goes horribly wrong at the end but what makes or let Parasite deserve the Best Oscar Movie award is the drama that unfolds in each of these characters justified to their suitable roles epic dialogues and role play give a definite meaning to the film but what Boong John Hoo could have done is continued the timeline after the climax unfolds since he stretched it this far to get the message of class divide thru a comical yet satirical approach thru a con family trying to meet ends and justified the true purpose of the movie that backstabbing in the climax got a bit too far and took away the message of the film and instead the previous climax when it rains showed the true perspective should have continued with that with the character of Kang Ho Song proving his loyalty and finding out the true thief in the end and make it thrilling with a twist with still ends to meet like they ended up where they started at the grave end of things Beautiful Movie shows a degree in Direction of Cinema does hold weightage So ideally it s nice publicity for a Foreign Film to win the Oscar to gain worldwide audience and throw light on a different culture as this year I dunno Hollywood couldn t live up to its directorial concepts despite big names Well done Bong Joon Ho could have ended up well and more insightful had it thrown light on other subjects in the city but certainly a great attempt Korea Parasite,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5508457/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2020,Lucky people who understand korean!,Two poor families one not lucky in money gathering other one unlucky in social experience That s what parasites do they find most vulnerable people who has no immune developed against them who never met them before and use their healthy trust I thought Birdman will be a far leader on the best movie of decade but this Korean dreamteam jumped to the bus and almost made driver to give up his seat Lines with preexisting diseases changed after new parasites arrived killed it at the end Will be waiting for next one with wet lips,9.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5389599/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,Overrated,I have watched the movie it does not deserve all these awards and flattery at all The story is good and the film in general has a good quality quite a bit but it contains many directing errors like how could the maid s husband tear up his bonds himself And the father when he came out at the end of the movie his beard was shaved and he is still very young and many other mistakes that make it unworthy of any Oscar Perhaps it is a political game to say that the Academy is not racist But even though it should have not be done this way,6.0,0.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476283/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,Not that good,I finally gave up and watched this movie There was so much hype around it I was definitely intrigued After a careful watch I think we are in front of a weak movie From a technical point of view nothing to say about it nice craft beautiful photography In house scenes are delightful The flood scene is perfect Very interesting camera angles Nice analogy by putting the poor in the bottom and the rich on top This is clear when three members of the poor family are leaving the rich family house after the coffee table scene they are headed home under the rain and they go down and down and down till they get home Corporal odor references are clever My point about this movie is that we don t have a real story here Instead it s a social gag The movie starts very slow and for more than one hour something that should not be possible at all the poor family becoming a parasite of the rich family happens in front of us in form of a perfect plan that works as a charm The pace though is very slow and the whole situation is unlikely to say the least After that something unexpected happens the housekeeper re appears and the whole story kind of accelerates Couple of funny things happen but Bong Joon Ho looks a little bit lost The plan apparently is to set up everything so we can add the usual ultra violent scene that every movie tv show needs to capture the audience s attention The strategy of the poor family moves all of a sudden from perfect to disastrous the climax scene fortunately is short enough so we can easily forget about it and after that even some more weird things happen the scene in the hospital is almost stupid so it is the ending Some characters are over used like the rich family mother and some others are almost forgotten when they are super interesting the young kid of the rich family Even the sequence order in the second half of the movie is in my opinion wrong Parasite is not a terrible movie and we live in a society full of people that will enjoy the main metaphor being depicted by Bong Joon Ho but by no means we are in front of a masterpiece,5.0,3.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5499123/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2020,We're all parasites in some way...,This definitely deserved an oscar It s a masterpiece of photography acting and script I can t say what s the gender of this movie Start as a comedy and exactly in the middle turns to be a thriller horror I m not joking it s evenly divided It s a cult movie with subtle meanings behind the obvious when I finished I didn t understand all the things in the movie But after a moment of reflection and see reviews and comments on Youtube I realize the depth in history how the social injustices were represented and why the title is parasite There s no villain there aren t the simplistic division between bad and good guys all the people had at least a little bit of parasitism,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6095652/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2019,A roller coaster of emotions,I ve seen some Korean movies such as I saw the Devil or A Bittersweet Life but ths one tops them all It was the first time that I felt different feelings for the same movies I laughed for a scene and 3 minutes later I was grabbed on my seat for the tension The characters tend a little bit to the stereotype the naive rich wife the spoiled children and the hard working poor family but enjoyable to watch You feel attracted to them because you can understand their despair for trying to fit in especially the younger son However I recommend this movie Beautifully directed with some nice shots the last one when the poor father flees after murdering the wealthy father convincing acting and a interesting subject about societal classes The only flaw is the characters who have a too stereotypical part but it can be easily forgotten,9.0,1.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5140050/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2020,The Brilliance of Parasite is anything but a Parasite!,Parasite is a film that sends a deep message about people especially the class system of Korea and maybe the world The story follows two families that are in great disparity The rich but Naive Park Family and the Poor but Cunning Kim Family Kim Ki woo Kevin the son from the Kim Family is the main protagonist in light of the fact that the plot focuses on him finding work for his unemployed Family quite arguably my favorite character because of how his arc ends from an unambitious blameless teenager to a determined decided deceiver with a fleeting glimpse of wealth His character is lesson in how innocent people must commit repulsive actions in order to protect their loved ones from what I interpret at least The Story is written tightly since each setup has a payoff This is because Director Bong Joon Ho has written a screenplay that is heavy on Dialogue and the importance of Character Interaction He further Succeeds by filming scenes with immense detail The Cinematography is lush yet intentionally metaphorical for instance when Kevin s Father Drives Mr Park for the first time there is a brighter atmosphere but as his relationship with Mr Park deepens it is intentionally much darker Close ups are key in presenting the provocative nature of each character especially during the end Overall I will say this I have always been a fan of Bong Joon Ho ever since Snowpiercer 2013 became a part of my all time favorite films and Parasite just extends his talented abilities to write and direct entertaining and thought provoking films Korean Cinema has successfully entered western Cinema and I pray that more foreign films embellish the art that is Cinema,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5692092/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2020,Masterpiece in 2019,Compared to the peace and love situation in Chinese movie Korean movie is bold and willingly to talk about the black side of the society The class difference is bigger and bigger in both China and Korea And it is difficult for people to jump from lower classes This situation has been shown in this movie however it is not the main point of it The greed of the family is what really matters The shooting scene is marvelous It is difficult for you to be surprised when people can be like cockroaches when they are found to parasite at others home They are afraid of being found and light The stair is shown several times to show the great difference between classes It is enjoyable to watch this movie to wonder how it goes and be amazed when the entrance of the secret basement is disclosed,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6125892/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2020,I get the message but don't like the way it was conveyed,I like movies that start normal and small actions add up to twists and drama later but in this movie it was everything very predictable Nothing new They re just a poor family that starts lying their way out of poverty By the way it seems unbelievable that they would be such good actors and so coordinated with each other The next obvious thing is that the truth will leak somewhere and I kept hoping for some genius way for it to unfold But it didn t It had many great moments such as the little guy being a genius or when the house was drown in sewage water but none of those moments developed further or had anything to do with the story I kept waiting for a twist but all I got was a hot mess Maybe the twist would be if the nice rich people would turn out to be not so nice and naive or a strange collaboration to happen between the family and the poor couple I know that most of the things that happened have a symbolic meaning that try to convey the differences between the rich and the poor but they didn t have a good logical excuse to happen the way they did,4.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5548761/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2023,MUST Watch,Its Complete Movie with all emotional elements Parasite s opening shot of a small glass window looking up from a basement house to the view of a narrow winding road sets the visual language of the film firmly right at the onset There are many more such shots which metaphorically convey the social and economic disparity that is the central theme of this film Especially the use of stairs going up and down cramped spaces versus lush open green lawns delectably and elegantly laid out fruit slices as opposed to a clumisly heaped plate of food from a local kitchen Kim Ki taek Song Kang ho and his family live in a pokey underground house and are generally unemployed When we meet them the family is perturbed that their access to free wifi has been cut short Obviously not able to afford their own they have been sponging off their neighbor s connection In fact even as a fumigation carried out on their street Kim tells his family to leave the windows open so they can have a free extermination of the insects in their house despite almost choking on the fumes On some days they get by with temporary jobs like fixing pizza boxes So when his son Kim Ki woo Choi Woo shik is offered by a friend to be set up as an English tutor to the daughter of a wealthy Mr Park Lee Sun kyun he agrees Only hitch Kim Ki woo doesn t have a college degree having failed his university exams But his sister Kim Ki jeong Park So dam presents a quick solution to this with her expert photo shopping skills Armed with a forged degree document Kim makes an easy impression on Mr Park s wife Yeon kyo Cho Yeo jeong and their teenage daughter Park Da hye Jung ji so There s also their nine year old son Park Da song Jung Hyeong scampering around the house who Yeon kyo believes has untapped potential as an artist With one foot firmly inside the Park household Kim Ki jeong craftily places his sister as Da song s art teacher cum therapist Yeon kyo s naivety and gullible nature makes this inclusion quite smooth Soon with some careful scheming fake identities and a well rehearsed plan even his parents Kim Ki taek and Chung sook Chang Hyae jin are employed in the household It seems like a flawless plan with the Kim family settled into their new found roles and the sunlit lavish mansion of the Park family giving it the perfect backdrop But just like that director Bong Joon ho s screenplay springs upon us unexpected plot twists and a thrilling run up to a grisly yet astounding climax Through a well crafted maze of events the prevalent class conflict and social disparity come to the fore The Kim s are often shown huddled together as a family gobbling away at their meals and the Park s are often in their own expansive rooms almost isolated from each other In a telling scene when Mr Park discusses Mr Kim s smell that wafts through the car when he drives crossing the line and reaching the backseat he describes it as an old rag that has been boiled and that smell that people who travel in the subway have It s evident there is unspoken disdain is on both ends as Chung sook quips how Yeon kyo is nice because she is rich With not a moment that seems unnecessary or extra Parasite is exceptionally well paced and edited Yang Jin mo Director Bong Jon ho masterfully constructs stylized dramatic sequences set to a brilliant background score Jung Jae il as the film rapidly moves from one plot point to another It results in a gripping yet poignant watch The ensemble cast enhance the proceedings with superlative performances especially Song Kang ho Park So dam and Choi Woo shik With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior Parasite is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch,10.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9203477/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2020,The poor family's father represents thousands (probably millions or bilions?) of poor parents in the world,Since there are already lengthy reviews here that explained and summed up how original and excellent this movie is I will focus on the emotions that I felt while watching this unexpected story The scene that made the most impact for me is the part where the father and children hid under the table while the two owners of the house had an intercourse in the sofa next to them Beforehand I had felt a lot of the embarrassment the father was feeling and it was this scene that I felt it the greatest aside from the killing part We should remember he s a father He had been setting aside his pride for the longest time and in that moment his pride was shattered within earshot of his children and the love making is making it even worse The comments about crossing the line his smell and other factors a parent would understand he was absolutely humiliated And to think that among all the characters of that poor family it was him that seemed to be a little better the rest It felt like a scene that I have been watching for for years poor parents doing everything and receiving humiliation for their family s sake and the ones above that doesnt give a damn To be fair the rich family didnt seem to be evil but that s what makes this movie s message so genuine and precise sometimes we dont know ourselves that we are doing wrong because it is already etched in our society And I loveeee how the characters are really realistic I love how the director didnt opt for the one side is evil and one side is likeable play like most do It just made the meaning very genuine fpr me And let me just praise the trailer I had absolutely no idea what was going on and the movie did justice,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5866754/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2020,It was just average and pretentious,Visually it was amazing a korean film with international appeal made it fun to see but thats it I was expecting a deep dive psychological thriller and got confused along the way with the message it was trying to relay to the viewer how can others say this was some deep discussion on class differences when the poor cant fold boxes are con artists and liars and the rich are a well off family that work hard and care for each other whose only crime was having a bad smell problem its not riveting its weak There were so many plotholes and missed opportunities This film was extremely predictable yet offensive to whoever this film was intended for rich or poor who are you supposed to root for Definitely not the poor con artists and if thats done on purpose it shows a tremendous pretentiousness Its an average well done movie receiving high praise because it was korean made ive seen better in the last 10 years By all means watch it though,5.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5715540/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2022,Perfect,As in all recent works Pon Joon ho is not shy about frontal metaphoricity and is not afraid of unambiguous interpretations Moreover he openly mocks himself declares in the voice of one of the heroes they say yes you are right this is all a metaphor The director is not interested in hidden meanings and complex allegories his code lies on the surface and it is much more curious not what his movie is about to understand this it is enough to read the synopsis but how far Pon Joon ho will lead his leapfrog with style and images If at the beginning it is obvious to us who is hiding under those parasites then by the end the title of the film takes on global and comprehensive meanings parasites poor parasites rich parasites in the kitchen attic and basement inside and outside on both sides of the screen It s all a metaphor yes but no one warned how broad it is,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7779269/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2022,"Great movie, no Oscar for nothing",Of course not everyone will share my opinion but I think most people will like the film A kind of tragicomedy it starts cheerfully and provocatively and the ending is unexpected with cruel scenes Starting to watch I thought that you can watch the whole family To be honest I was amazed by the film I will watch it again and again as well as look at the analysis of the film and attempts to interpret it The theme lying on the surface is the theme of the ongoing stratification of Korean society into the poor and the rich Someone lives in the coolest mansion with servants the respectable Pak family and someone in a stinking basement the Kim family without a job But the film is very multi layered and everyone will find their own topic for reflection and opinion about what the director wanted to say The main character was lucky he got a job as a tutor for a girl in the Pak family Gradually he comes up with a scam and drags his entire family to work substituting the servants So they live and work until one day everything turned upside down but I won t reveal the secret see for yourself but the plot and script are of course the highest class I would like to praise the actors they played well I m not a fan of Korean cinema and dramas so I don t know a single actor The actor who played the main character also starred in Train to Busan Separately I will praise the operator and beautiful Korea the city and the Pakov mansion I want to build the same one for myself with a huge window and access to the lawn directly from the hall The contrast of the view from the window is shown in an interesting way some have a beautiful lawn with trees others have a lattice in the basement and pissing people In short everyone in this film will have their own opinion someone will consider the poor to be parasites someone the rich And besides this everyone will have their own thoughts in their heads about traditions progress fathers children socialism capitalism For me 5 stars,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7774680/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2023,I throughly enjoyed this film!,The movie I have chosen to review is Parasite by director Bong Joon ho I have decided to review this movie because not only is it rather thought provoking the way Bong Joon ho can mix comedy and thriller makes it even more compelling Parasite is a film about greed and class and how a low income family has managed to slyly finagle their way into working for a wealthy upper class family The Kim clan the low income family manages to cunningly secure jobs for each family member by undermining the previous personal staff members of the wealthy Park family However while the Kims start integrating into the staff positions of the Parks the film begins to turn toward thriller The sudden tonal shift in the second half of the film might seem jarring to some but personally for me it helped drive home what Bong Joon ho was trying to accomplish He wanted to show the clear class divide between the Parks and Kims and did it masterfully throughout the film which helps culminate in the final act s thrilling conclusion How he subtly peppered in the Parks casual disdain by having the father constantly bring up a stench or how something smelled terrible The constant insistence of something smelling sets up a crucial moment during the final parts of the movie Another thing I enjoyed was the Kims scholar rock or suseok I don t know if it was intentional but the rock only seemed heavy when the Kims used it because they believed it was worth something I think this because when the Kims house is flooded the rock floats but when the son carries it down the stairs it seems heavy To the Kims the rock is a symbol of wealth and future fortune but because of the society that they live in it is a hollow dream that cannot be fulfilled due to class discrimination and the idea that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer The lesson I learned from this film is that under capitalism it is nearly impossible to climb your way out of poverty and no matter how cunning or intelligent you are someone far less competent who was born into money will always have that money This film could be enjoyable for everyone although I don t know how many would be willing to watch it because it is a Korean film However I don t think language should stop someone from consuming good media Parasite is a fantastic film that I hope everyone willing to watch will watch it 9 out of 10 stars cause it freaked me out at that stairs bit,9.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8956522/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,Crypto,I had a good time watching it It s minimalist and resourceful it is a dark comedy about class that isn t overly and when it is it s an absurdist gesture I think the physical metaphors come across as a little funny in this way the use of varying vertical juxtaposition as a theme that varies from the ghost from downstairs and the Park s so oblivious to what s bellow them they fail to notice their cab driver in frame below them I do think this movie does try to cover a little too much ground and it blurs boundaries in a way that the exposition and ending are not much to take away from as the shenanigans throughout the movie Watched the film spoiler free but if I was told several people will die in this movie for example I would be surprised as how that would be presented The start of the movie is not ambivalent but is to me just generally unclear besides to describe a poor lazy family with some light comedic aspect Still a great movie I see why it s so loved Funny absurd and clever in imagery,8.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8364490/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2023,A Masterpiece of Storytelling and Social Commentary,The criticism on social and economic inequalities in Parasite is one of the film s most outstanding features The movie offers an incisive indictment of the class difference in contemporary society demonstrating how the underprivileged frequently must rely on lies and trickery to get by in a system that is biased against them The themes of the movie are subtly weaved into the action resulting in a thought provoking and emotionally stirring viewing experience I would unquestionably give this film 4 5 stars out of 5 My understanding of Parasite is consistent with the majority of the positive reviews the movie has gotten including its several Academy Award nominations and Cannes Film Festival Palme d Or award However I felt that some reviews overemphasized the social commentary of the film while ignoring its technical and artistic accomplishments For instance The Guardian s favorable review hails the movie s biting satire but just briefly highlights its superb photography and sound editing Even though I acknowledge the value of the social critique I think Parasite should be viewed as a whole cinematic endeavor The movie also has remarkable technical qualities The script strikes the ideal balance between drama and humor and the prose is snappy and funny Each performer gives a nuanced and believable role and the acting is excellent,9.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9028367/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2023,Wealth corrupts,Parasite dark and satirical reflects society s corruption in class struggle The films follow a struggling family the Kims and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family the Parks Bong Joon ho et al s fastidious composition of every frame consistent symbolism and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture and several other nominations and wins The film s ending fresh and unexpected never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending s twist The gifted stone speculated to bring wealth only brought corruption and misfortune The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted The line that must never be crossed except when one character does all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come The contrast of the darkness of the Kim s downstairs world to the Park s airy bright and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class As we watch the endings of each character we have to wonder if they got what they deserved How we feel about them forces us to confront our values to many this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too odd The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim s goals to worm their way up in search of light As Joon ho s morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it Joon ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film s message rather than to become the premise of it This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle The character s journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film s several subtleties,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9451764/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2021,The most simple film reflecting society.,Parasite is one of my favorite movies Although the plot that reflects social inequality might make it feel hard to understand the movie is presented simply and straightforwardly I love that the movie takes the issue of social inequality to the core of the story The film runs by asking us to ask questions in our minds throughout the story who is the real parasite class The rich or the poor Or do we all have parasites inside ourselves The film clearly shows the main point of the story from character quotes character actions and symbolic expressions More than that in terms of production it is good as well Every point of view color grading or even sound effects are meaningful and exciting which make the audience more involved with the movie even more In the first part of the story the story begins gradually allowing the viewer to get to know the characters mixed with black comedy that reflects the social system of inequality But at the end of the story runs in a different direction from the first There is something more exciting and thrilling Overall it s still a really great movie and a really good script Because the movie takes on heavy issues such as class and social inequality to make it more understandable At the end of the story the audiences can answer the questions that the villain of the story is not the poor or the rich but the social inequality that makes people be a villain,9.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6661386/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2021,A Unique Modern Classic,I am writing this almost straight after watching I feel I probably need more time to process the whirlwind of a film i just watched but it was truly great The build up of the plot tension and the characters is great You find yourself guessing where this is going at various times There were some minor breadcrumbs along the way intentional or not your guess is as good as mine The fact that we were guessing where this was heading was a great thrill alone but the action and climax was great when it finally arrived The soy sauce on the pizza was a sign of bloodshed in my opinion but even at this point I was unsure on what form it would be delivered to us and from whom It was a fasten your seatbelt moment it was a dark film but done in a way which made you chuckle along the way and cheering for the family despite the fact that are committing multiple crimes against a completely innocent family When you step back its quite a terrifying thought and in no way should we be cheering these people on but I was The little hits of comedy took the edge off and gave us light breather even towards the end despite the craziness and drama unfolding we managed to chuckle at a smalls dogs unconventional snack I love the ending having something left to you own interpretation like that is something a lot of people do not like but I for one like it and find it genius Overall I loved it for its uniqueness which is always welcome the tension the drama the dark comedy I would thoroughly recommend My only question where the hell is Min Film 7,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6628908/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2020,An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core.,It s a movie from an unfamiliar part of the world South Korea that paints an uncannily familiar picture But be warned there are no victories in Parasite and no one gets away unpunished The parasite of the title applies to every character in this film the rich leech off the poor who in turn survive by attaching themselves to the underbelly of the ruling class Parasite introduces us to the Kims a South Korean family of four living in a basement apartment They re so poor they can t afford Wi Fi they leech it from nearby cafes and earn their meager income folding pizza boxes A gift from the son s friend a heavy stone that promises wealth to its owner works its magic when the son Ki woo lands a job teaching English to a wealthy schoolgirl Park Da hye She s part of the Park family that looks like the negative or maybe the positive image of the Kims living comfortably in a modernist mansion high on a hill The Park patriarch Dong ik is a tech CEO who s barely home while his wife Yeon gyo is fluttery and fragile She obsesses over the imagined artistic genius of her son He specializes in angry rebellious scribbles It s into this shiny hollow world that the Kim family try to integrate themselves after the son Ki woo is hired as an English language tutor He immediately hatches a plan to get the rest of the family employed in the Park family Their schemes are exhilarating clever and intricately plotted For much of the film the audience is swept up in the thrill of the con We see them forge documents invent aliases and carefully rehearse their lines Much of this story however isn t told in words but in the use of space and the way people move through it The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame perched awkwardly on furniture and fittings so they can all fit They re a united front in this battle The Park family meanwhile always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame Parasite moves effortlessly between capitalist parable horror film and situation comedy as the natures of the two families are revealed The Kims grasping and greedy yet unfairly stigmatized by poverty even in their newly bought clothes they give off an odor that can t be masked and the Parks harmless and well intentioned yet coasting through life on the backs of others,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5720904/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,A MASTERPIECE it is.,The writer director of Parasite Bong Joon Ho takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected Wi Fi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley side windows When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother hiding that she s his sister and lying about her credentials as well Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening To tell more would spoil the fun but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker What s most interesting about the film is asking the question who really is the parasite Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants The answer is that it could be either or most likely both Bong s thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course much as it happened in his prior film Snowpiercer Bong sums it up best himself when he was described Parasite as a comedy without clowns a tragedy without villains If I had a complaint about the film it s that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film s message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have nots Parasite is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience meaning that it s a story that could not have been told in any other medium and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5705630/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2020,Opens well only to become an epic fail,As a fan of foreign films I was excited to watch this after its Oscar success but unfortunately it collapsed in its second half so badly I had to abandon viewing it The opening of the film introducing the starving Kim family and their machinations to secure work as the household staff of the Park family It beautifully demonstrates the life in the city slums with superbly executed plots to get the Parks existing staff fired and replaced with the Kims These plots become progressively more cruel showing the Kims slide into villainy The complication arrives when the former head maid asks the Kims if she can retrieve something from the Park house Here the Kims truly become villains manipulating the secrets of the house for their own gain and even turning to overt violence to preserve their position It is here that the film loses its way Though certainly the Kims and their rivals have difficult choices to make they are depicted as being gratuitously cruel Each faction needs to remove obstacles of course each faction shows no restraint fine But the film lingers on this wickedness for so long the audience becomes estranged to all of them We no longer care about ANY of these characters because they have all become monsters we abandon watching their fight because we have better things to do with our lives The failure of this film as with so many of the last few decades is in the writing and editing The sets are beautiful the camerawork superb But the film lingers on human suffering purely for the shock factor The suffering of the Kims is sadly reality for those at the bottom of South Korean society and desperation makes villains of us all but this is not a documentary This is meant to be entertainment something people can enjoy Angela s Ashes depicted similar levels of poverty yet still maintained the sympathy of the audience,2.0,0.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5648155/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2020,"Good movie, far from being the best movie of the year of the decade",Well produced good entertaining weird story that stands out of mediocre movies but is not a masterpiece Maybe can be different in culture how korean people show feelings but the mr kim lacks a lot of emotional depth they do not sell very well a character full of resentment bursting out and killing his boss yeah 3 scenes about smell 2 scenes about crossing the line and 1 scene talking about chaotic way of living about not creating any plans for the future is not enough to see the build up of ressentment in the character lack of expression lack of close ups lack of emotional anger yeah i get it the character is a island but even if that is true they did not sell well the anger burst you can see this by how many people that were not convinced about that scene The kid translate the SOS message and do not talk to any one or do not lead to anywhere seems like a waste scene the final about the boy recovering about 2 rock throws in his head feels cheap not constructed and about dreaming of getting rich and buying the house is a soft ending that feels cheap as well is not the first movie talking about class struggle is not the first movie that gets a showdown in the end is a good movie is fun has suspense has comedy is surreal i would still recommend it but to being a MASTERPIECE still lacks a LOT of depth,7.0,3.0,24.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5412282/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2020,"Social commentary on ""Parasite""",The movie Parasite lifts up to its name as the plot revolves around the Kim family a family who lives in a small semi basement in Korea using different tactics to leech off the Park family a well off family who live in a mansion The plot of Parasite was attractive but what I found more appealing are the conflicts created by the gap between the rich and poor The structure of classism was displayed in the movie in scenes where the audience could see vast physical differences between the Park and Kim family the semi basement that the Kim family live in is shabby wet and has little light and the mansion on the hill is sleek modern and filled with light What the Park possess is out of reach for the Kims but it is also what they dream of eventually having themselves Despite living a life of privilege the Parks show no sympathy for the poor They choose not to see or do anything about the wide divide in classes around them as society allows them to exist in oblivion There is no blame put upon the upper class for not understanding the hardships of the poor This oblivion can be seen in the movie after the huge rain storm The next day Mrs Park expresses her satisfaction of the rain bringing blue skies for her son s birthday party She fails to think about all of the people such as the Kims who have lost all of their possessions during the storm She even has the audacity to make a comment about the smell coming from Mr Kim as he helps her shop for the party It is also striking that although the Kim family is poor and dislikes the upper class they do little to move out of the position that they are in The Kim family possesses different forms of capital from the beginning yet they are unwilling to develop the skill sets that they have and move upwards in a way that does not involve lying and deceit Mrs Kim is a past champion in hammer throwing and both the son and daughter are intelligent and resourceful people who have the ability to succeed in school and get stable jobs Besides the son and daughter of the Kim family are already on track in terms of collecting more capitals by attending college to be educated and accumulate knowledge Instead they deceive the Parks into hiring their whole family ultimately ending in deaths and pain for both families There are many metaphors that exist within the movie that illustrate the difference in class and the potential conflicts that exist The tall stairs between the street levels that the Kim family goes down after sneaking into the Park s house to have a party show the massive gap between the rich and the poor The places where different families live mark their social status the Park who belongs to upper class live on top of a hill the Kim who is in lower class live in a semi basement and the old housekeeper family who is poorer than the Kim live in an actual basement In addition the stone that the Kim family totes around from the beginning of the movie signifies their desire to enter the upper class However the placing of the stone back into the river shows lessons learned and the fact that some of the Kim family is finally able to achieve a life of wealth by the end of the movie but only through hard work and dedication This movie shows the inevitable conflict in the social structure created by the ignorance of the vast wealth gap as well as the different social ideologies and forms among different groups of people,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5970684/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2020,"A Perfect Script, Perfect Direction, a Perfect Film",I ll be honest when I first watched Parasite it was after the Academy Awards and the hype had been around for a while On first watch my first watch for me it seemed like an okay movie that seemed messy On second watch I thought it was a good movie that had a mediocre script And on third watch I thought that it was a really good movie with a decent story But on fourth watch I finally understood the hype Parasite is not only my favorite movie of all time but I would bet that it is practically flawless I think it should be up there with the top 10 films of all time There s the obvious proof of Parasite s excellence with the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay Best International Feature Best Director and Best Picture But I promise this film is much more than a typical Oscar film It is complex and fun movie that has one of the best screenplays ever written and I d argue the best direction of any film I ve ever seen Granted I haven t seen Citizen Kane or The Godfather If you are someone who appreciates or likes the Oscars it is an absolute must watch And if you don t care about the Oscars or awards season I highly recommend it,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6015297/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2020,Intriguing And A Surprisingly relatable Film of 2019!,I have seen many movies in 2019 but i have to admit this is by far the most mysterious beautifully depicted movie of 2019 I found this movie to be equally exciting and edge of the seat kind of movie I enjoyed the first half of the movie a lot In the second half it was lagging a little bit but the climax shook me up Family melodrama comedy social commentary it has everything I was confused of who exactly is the parasite the poverty stricken family who are living off the rich or the rich one that reaps the benefits of their hard work It is a story of the poor basement dwelling Kim family who are living off the rich park family The park are total opposites They live in a grand modernist mansion in a hilly Seoul suburb The scam takes shape when the Kims bright young son chances upon a job as a language tutor for the Parks teenage daughter He recommends his sister as an art therapist for their son and says she s a distant renowned acquaintance and soon his parents start working as the family driver and housemaid pretending to be strangers to each other But then the little kid points out that they all smell alike and they smell of poor people This really is a horribly fascinating film brilliantly written Parasite is a movie that taps into a rich cinematic tradition of unreliable servants with an intimate knowledge of their employers an intimacy that congeals into hostility The first half was going on smoothly and building tension about what is going to happen next The last half unraveled the dark truth of the family The discovery by the kim family of another family already living at the basement of the park family and their trying to lead the day with luxury when park family went for a outing The horrifying behavior of the kim family with the basement dewellers and at last the murders of the park family in the hands of the kim It was a heart wrenching and edge of the seat kind movie I believe anyone who loves thrillers and mystery and yes some surprises they would surely love the movie The filmmaker Bong Joon Ho really knows exactly what he s doing and why he s doing it It is a remarkably well edited film The name is perfect for the movie The kim family is the parasite who are like leeches sucking blood off the park family Technically there are no villains in here But the kim family are so gory and ferocious Where as the rich park family can also be termed as parasites as they are dependent on these untrustworthy people for every sort of job So the villain here is the situation the capitalist society A society where there is a huge gap between the income of the rich and the poor the poor becomes poorer and the rich gets richer Whatever the kim family did they did out of outrage the ignorance of the park s about the poor kim s The kim s just wanted to change their fate of poverty Overall this movie is one of a kind movie of the year 2019 I thoroughly enjoyed the film,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6096641/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2020,"Dark comedy, tragedy, thriller? It's life and twisted human nature",Parasite is a widely successful South Korean movie that won several Academy Awards and is one of my most favorite movies This movie belongs to the thriller genre and uses metaphor and symbols to portray a deeper meaning Through showing the contrast between the lifestyle of the rich and the poor the movie portrayed how different the world is for different people Although the end of the movie has a very tragic and somewhat gory vibe the start of the movie was like that of a dark comedy show In the movie there was an ambitious poor household the Kim family who were with no jobs There were 4 members in the family and all of them were clever charlatans As the movie progressed it was seen that all of the members got jobs in a very wealthy family by using tricks To get the jobs they had to fire the previous workers Through deceit they made the house owners the Park family fire all their previous workers At this point the movie turns a little dark and strange It was seen that the previous caretaker of the house was also in extreme need of the job and upon learning the deceit of the Kim family hoped to gain access to the house by blackmailing the Kim family Both parties fought for the job and ultimately killed the previous caretaker Then the movie turned even bleaker when Mr Kim killed Mr Park due to his lack of empathy for the poor What makes this movie such a masterpiece is the apt naming The name parasite refers to the hierarchy of the society and its living conditions The poor must rely on the rich for their existence in our current world They must serve the rich But the poor must fight amongst themselves to get the opportunity to serve the self absorbed rich Even then they remain unseen the society does not share in their joy nor does it flinch in their misery In the movie there was a scene in which the Kim family lost their home due to heavy rainfall It was a matter of absolute devastation for them But the rich Park family called the rain a blessing as the weather after the rain was very soothing This portrays how different reality is for people of different classes In the movie there was a scene where a man killed the daughter of Mr Kim in front of Mr Park But all Mr Park did was ask for the car keys so he can leave the danger zone with his family Mr Park did not care that Mr Kim s daughter died There were many more scenes in the movie which showed how little the poor means to the rich and how brutally the poor must fight to find the opportunity to serve the rich,9.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6102612/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2023,"You will see the consequences of social inequity shot in such a interestingly relatable manner, it will be hard to dislike it",Filmmaker Bong Joon Ho once again surprised us with another masterpiece named Parasite Where powerful social satire meets tragedy The director did a great job portraying South Korea s current views on society exposing the underprivileged slums of most modern cities and it s citizens living in completely different worlds despite staying in close proximity You are likely to find it relatable as the themes of this story are not just localized to Korea but all over the world Having its fair share of global capitalism and universal materialism Meritocracy being the biggest trope of this movie Now the best way to enjoy this film is to cluelessly get into it its charm is to watch it progress and unfold in many satisfying unexpected ways You can definitely see a unique directorial vision as Parasite welcomes the audience into multi genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act Pure comedy dark comedy to heavy drama horror thriller mystery you name it It is one of the hardest things to pull off but the director converts them smoothly without letting the audience feel indifferent to the transformation It manages to elicit the full range of responses making the viewer react with uneasy laughter to unexpected situations that eventually lead to disturbing events full of horror Now who are the real parasites The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor Satirically it managed to portray how we may live under the same skies but have different views regarding life You know what kind of plan never fails No plan No plan at all You know why Because life cannot be planned Success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination Anyone can rise to the top but for those who cannot escape their sad reality will ultimately turn for the worse and thus start to justify their immoral backstabbing deceit and callousness for reasoning that can be only explained by growing up poor without support from others The characters all have different aspects to them that will be received and viewed differently due to the viewers own biases and world views This isn t a bad thing as the movies main point is to deliver a provocative social commentary in various metaphors And the best way to do so is to create morally questionable characters that will resemble at least one familiar person known to you Greed is inside each one of us but the question is how much are you willing to sacrifice for an idea of life in comfort All in all Parasite is a fantastic case of hard hitting yet entertaining cinema And one of the best movies recently made in Korea,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9433964/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,An International masterpiece,Why is this movie a masterpiece Why did it become the first non English language Oscar winning film Why is it ideologically universal and international The poor slaves of North Korea evoke sympathy The poor of South Korea at first too Until impunity and the prosperity that fell on their heads made them pigs monsters parasites that can t stop from greed But what spoils their raspberry A sudden spark of sympathy that had been awakened in the new housekeeper s heart for the old drenched ill and undeservedly turned out of the house and work for the ex housekeeper who had come to feed her husband He lives in complete isolation in prison like the North Koreans but temporarily gaining the upper hand they begin to mock the exposed family and at the same time Kim Jong Un Or the moment when the driver for some reason he kills his master and the young entrepreneur just before he dies suddenly says I recognized you that s why North and South Koreans both rich and poor suddenly become so similar What s it National Korean mentality Unlikely So you think the USSR and modern Russia slave owning America and modern superpower Nazi Germany and the modern locomotive of the European Union are they not mirror images In the sense that on the other side of the mirror glass they are the same simply inverted Money didn t make rich people happy They become indifferent and blind to someone else s misfortune but turn into such blind suckers that it is easy to trick them around your finger Family values banana for a hungry husband are beautiful but their absolutization makes people sectarian shackles them with a series of crimes in the yoke of circular bail In the age of technology miracles happen when you suspect that all the teachers a couple of phrases in English and OK doctors who put on a white coat becomes the doctor lawyers observe the formalities and enjoy yourself photoshop arrogance and skill all these professionals are just as fake as for example a housewife I don t know what it is I ll cook it according to the instructions on the label not to mention art therapists surf the Internet and that ll do coaches psychologists and other shamans Everyone plays lies pretends to believe or wants to believe but everyone follows the rules of the game Until something happens that violates these rules the spark of empathy I was talking about an ancient stone it s so metaphorical that is supposed to bring material well being and then slips out of your hands at the most inopportune moment and breaks the conspiracy and that the hero can t tear away from himself The smell of a basement that you can t get rid of The flood is a natural disaster that you expect but it always comes unexpectedly And the film turned out to be light It talks about values that people neglect but which nevertheless remind them of themselves in symbols nature flood ancient traditions stone belonging to one s social class smell family relations the banana playing Indians sympathy helping a person who got wet in the rain A sure sign of a real work of art is motivation non randomness of EVERY DETAIL which creates a harmonious ambivalence of art,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5669859/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2022,This film made me excited every minutes.,Parasite was directed by Bong Joon ho and tells the story of a down on their luck family that takes a special interest in a very wealthy family everyone in this family is unemployed and slowly but surely they find a way to all get jobs working for this wealthy family in very private positions a driver a housekeeper a tutor and the whole time this other family has no idea that all these people are related and scamming them But when something rather unexpected happens it changes both families lives forever I excited every minute of the film it s extremely funny in essence It s a social satire because we re watching two very different families and how they perceive things the characters we follow who are sort of scamming these rich people literally live lower than the others they live farther down in the city when there s a rain storm the wealthy people think it s beautiful but for these guys they re thinking that s a bad luck our whole neighborhoods going to flood and where this film shines is that so much of this is told through visuals we get this great sequence where this family is trudging through a flood trying to get back to their home and we just have these incredible images playing out on the screen with beautiful breathtaking cinematography of the city and seeing how people from a certain area are looking at this rainstorm versus people who have to take buckets and get water out of their rooms through the window because their entire house is filling with sewage like in the opening sequence the family notices that their neighborhood is being fumigated for rodents and bugs and stuff and they leave the windows open because if all of this mist gets into their house which the poor family could not refuse This movie shows two families with very different backgrounds And it shows that poor families want to be better,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7936436/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2022,My impression with this movie.,This movie gets a reward Oscar winning Korean films In our society there is a class difference between the affluent and the poor which is reflected in this film The main character are Song Kang ho Lee Sun kyun Cho Yeo jeong Choi Woo shik Park So dam Jang Hye jin and Lee Jung eun Storyline of Parasite movie there was a poor family that wanted to make enough money by working in the homes of wealthy people by as a teacher a servant or a driver but found another family lurking in the basement of a rich family s home In the movie first A poor family have 4 persons that lives in a ramshackle semi basement apartment One day the son wants to work and he has a friend for help him to get a job Therefore he gets the job teach the child of a wealthy family After that he see the chance for take him family to work together So he convinces his sister and his parents to join him as teacher driver and a servant in an affluent family In the middle of movie poor family found another family lurking in the basement and then they are killing each other At the last point his father lurking in the basement and him buy a home from wealthy family In my opinion I think a movie plot so surprising because in first we can t know about flashing light in the house but we know in the end of the story flashing light is a morse code that use for communicating with other In the part of actor s show is so professional and that great when putting emotion in front of the camera In the composition of movie I think that can reflect a class difference between the affluent and the poor people good In a part of music in movie give a feeling of sobriety and thriller with movie In my personal suggestion if you unlike a blood you should be careful because in this movie have a tragedy My personal film rating Overall score 9 10 Story line 8 10 Character 9 10 Movie soundtrack 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7944711/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2023,A brave screen play,Everything scary is going to happen slowly snd there is no fear for director to show dirty sides of humans The most important reason that makes the film Parasite admirable at first glance is the way Bong Jung Ho looks at the poor family in the film Something like the look Koreida had in the movie Shoplifters Depicting people who although they live in the basement although they are poor and do not have proper jobs but they are by no means lost and hopeless people The basic question that is ironically expressed in the film is why a family with such intelligence is so poor and their place is underground,10.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8964913/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2023,Parasite: Art in its perfect form,Parasite is one of those films that you watch once but must rewatch it multiple times to fully understand all the content layered into the film The film is about two families living in vastly different classes who interact with each other in a very peculiar way The Kim s are a poor family living in South Korea finding any feasible way to earn enough money to get by life The Kim s find multiple ways to work for a wealthy family The Parks by being housekeepers tutors and drivers by intentionally getting the previous workers fired through malicious acts Through the film we come to learn that their plans of overtaking all the previous workers positions begin to introduce complications which later leads to total chaos I believe that this film is one of the most meaningful and most intricate films ever made Ranging from Writing and Cinematography to the Topics covered this film does not fail to capture every emotion intended to be displayed by the director The theme about class in the film is very present and gives a deeper dive into how classism can affect both ends of the spectrum of class There is also another theme about how people will use other people for their own advantage thus the name Parasite I will be focusing on the writing and cinematography in the film to evaluate how this film perfects ambience mood and the meaning of the film The screen writing in Parasite really helps capture the mood and tone of the movie In the beginning of the film we are presented with an almost comedy like movie where the characters are being introduced but we get a good understanding of what the characters are going through For example we are introduced to the Kim s which are struggling to make a living and we learn about their struggles with money and finding work in almost an unserious way It makes the viewer feel disconnected with their struggles I believe the way this is presented is on purpose for the fact that we only want to be introduced to the characters and not grow a relationship with them Later in the movie once we see the plans of the Kim s start to fail we are shifted into a more serious and dark tone It is remarkably interesting how we can go from not feeling a connection to the characters in the beginning to feeling like we are involved in the demise of the Kim s This switch up in emotions is possible due to the screenwriting as well as the Cinematography The cinematography really captures everything the writing was not able to fully express Throughout the film I began to learn that The Kim s and The Park s have scenes filmed personally for each family When we are viewing solely the Kim s during the film the scenes feel very intimate with the settings feeling tight and making us feel like we are involved with their every move This really helps capture the ambience of the film The cinematography also does an excellent job in displaying the topics covered by the film such as class and classism Whenever we see the Park s we see them from a distance and in an elevated perspective to add the affect that they are higher in class than the Kim s The cinematography is also able to capture the topic of class whenever we see the families using stairs as when the Kim s use the stairs they are always descending a flight of stairs and whenever the Park s use stairs they are always ascending from it The camera shots of these scenes capture the topic of class as it can be interpreted that because the Kim s are in the lower class they are descending further into poverty and the opposite for the Park s Overall I believe that because of how the film s writing and cinematography perfectly captures the tone and emotions intended to be conveyed this is a movie I recommend everyone watch at some point in their lives There is so much meaning behind why every scene was filmed or written the way it is and I encourage everyone to watch this film and form their own opinions about the film This film is a refreshing take on thrillers which leaves the viewer thinking about it for a while after watching it,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9360250/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2023,Parasite is great,Parasite I think the most brilliant part of this film is the construction of 3 spaces the house lived by Park s family the basement lived by Kim Ki woo s family and the basement under the house which is lived by the original housekeeper s husband The design of the 3 spaces is a metaphor for the difference in the classes of the 3 family Every time Kim Ki woo goes to the house to teach the girl he has to go on a slope And when the family run away from the house they have to go down stairs The rich people living in the house can see the sunshine and grassland while the family living in the basement can only see passerby s foot and the man living under the house can never see anything outside that basement The movie indicates the different living conditions between people in different classes And the design of the spaces also matches the title of the movie which is the parasite Kim Ki woo s family lives like a parasite They hide themselves under the table listening the complaints about their smell from the rich What between the different spaces is the line that can t be crossed The movie constructed an illusion that the poor living in the rich s house and enjoy the life as the rich does However the illusion is broken and all of the poor come back to the real world when the real rich come home In the real world those rich people have not only wealth but power They utilize those who want to climb up and push them when they near the top It reflects the hidden unfairness in the capitalism The owner of the power creates a dream for those down on the ground and encourage them to climb up But everything end up as foam It is just like what the movie The Great Gatsby which talks about a man s dream breaks,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9424272/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2023,Parasite new century,Parasite is a cinematic marvel that goes beyond mere storytelling to deliver a deeply resonating commentary on the class disparities that pervade modern society Directed by the brilliantly inventive Bong Joon Ho the film effectively intertwines elements of drama comedy and thriller to create an experience that lingers long after the screen goes dark The narrative centers on two contrasting families and through them explores the complex dynamics of wealth poverty and human tendency It s a masterly crafted web of intrigue that keeps the viewer engrossed and constantly on edge The screenplay is astoundingly unpredictable and the sharp crisp dialogue effectively builds tension while maintaining its dark humor The cast delivers stellar performances that bring their layered characters to life Each actor stands out portraying their varied characters with precision be it the cunning yet charismatic poor family or the oblivious yet complicated wealthy family The somber atmospheric cinematography coupled with the haunting score creates an increasingly uneasy ambiance that height,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9435759/?ref_=tt_urv
