5 July 2019,One of the best films of this decade,I am remarkably stingy with my 10 10 ratings I ll be the first person to acknowledge this Of the roughly 2600 titles I ve rated on here only 34 have a 10 Parasite is one of them If this isn t a masterpiece then I don t know what is I m going to keep it vague on the plot front because I didn t know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways What I will say is that this film more than just about any other I ve seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132 minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent Parts of this movie were hilarious Parts were heartbreaking Other parts were insanely suspenseful I m honestly not sure if I ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad way back in 2013 And it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering You come to care for just about all of them I m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie And sure I ve seen many movies that are hard to fault but it s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect It s extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake there s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie s over and this one s not going to leave my head for a while I can tell Catch this one when you can and believe the hype Joon Ho Bong has made many great films and so far no bad one s but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was this one will surely be up there,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4978432/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2019,"You name a genre, this movie covers it",I can t remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as Parasite The movie starts out almost like an Ocean s Eleven heist film and then expands into a comedy mystery thriller drama romance crime and even horror film It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too I love a film that respects its audience There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch ability factor will be very high The film was incredibly entertaining too I can t think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening at least in terms of action Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this I had a great time with Parasite and I think most that give it a chance will too,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5166061/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,In a meritocracy success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination Anyone can rise to the top and for some lucky Cinderella plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired you too can achieve you dreams if only you try The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition backstabbing deceit and callousness You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one and then perhaps when you at last feel secure you can afford to be kind and confident and generous It s easy to be nice when you re rich the mother in this film Jang Hye jin at one point observes But it s a very long and very crooked ladder and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip and sometimes they ve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down either by those above you or just as often by those staring up from the ground below There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder But in a meritocracy you can t blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it No you must blame yourself You should have tread more carefully You should have climbed more quickly You should have used a firmer and more precise grip anticipated disasters and known just when to leap If you fail in a meritocracy it s all your fault You should have tried harder Better luck next time Kim Ki woo Choi Woo sik the young man who is the main character of PARASITE several times refers to metaphors and the film itself is of course a metaphor On a surface level viewers are treated to a very thrilling engaging well paced and well plotted crime story At all times however bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film there are deeply personal meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer These insights are rarely foregrounded They are so subtly interwoven in fact that if you re like me you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate humanist story you ve just witnessed Bong Joon ho s filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he ll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he s done so I want to avoid spoilers here but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece beautifully lensed enthrallingly edited superbly acted and intimately involving South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky Higher education is widespread so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs I lived in Korea once and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day six days a week public school English immersion private school piano class soccer team taekwondo math camp chess club and so on I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long As the father Song Kang ho in the film at one point says this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job One can t afford not to struggle The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea however They are the story of global capitalism and the specter of American materialism and imperialism note the Indians looms heavily over the film Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all It s nice to dream and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine and how nice an ending it is when they do But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be maybe just whims and fancy More often it seems our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5080349/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,"Engaging as a drama, with an intelligent social aspect to it",A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family if they can engineer it they can each get one of the jobs within the household This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story seeing the rich family as the marks As it plays out though it keeps this assumption in the background eating at the viewer as an idea before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot Between the start and then the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself In this the film engages and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film for me the key one was the falseness of the con itself Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family it is not like they are stealing money from them or somehow dislodging them from their position in life no they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job and the rich family could probably not care less about the truth as long as their needs continue to be met This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film and adds sense to what happens and why but it is interesting in and of itself Technically the film looks great and the director builds mood and tone well Performances are strong across all the cast but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition but it is a handsome clever film and the timing in the year is right I don t see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture but this is more to do with the system than with the film Regardless of awards or not it is an engaging drama with unusual developments and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6001308/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2020,Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea like what movie Us attempts to do but done properly It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like and its realism is very painful Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc but many people still live miserable lives and situation is very similar to that in China where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt and this is often directed against the white people who being able to process milk smell like butter and are seen in rac ist light as unclean but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles like roaches in the dark but in life and death situations resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies with many subtle points criticizes their culture and emulation of the America with a few cruel but precise strokes The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5411971/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2019,Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,As a film about a family imposing on another and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us tell a multi layered story in a widely entertaining manner but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative That s not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare writer director Bong Joon ho is in a class of his own The film follows a lower class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper class family and their lavish household As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances It s a twisty satire on social economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts However to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4972695/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,Totally Unique,Usually I don t read reviews before seeing a film This one however I did and happily so First of all it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about We need to shed our cultural biases including how to make films This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters The title I assume means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves I hope to see more from this director in the future,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5971949/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.,Finally saw this much talked about film As a fan of Korean thrillers this film surpassed my expectations The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple posing as unrelated highly qualified individuals The film begins like a dark satire it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u it is not at all demeaning It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5459301/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2019,"Class struggle. After Karl Marx and Victor Hugo, here is Joon-ho Bong",This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d Or at the Cannes Festival If I have one and only one advice to give you go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information Indeed this film might schematically be split in two parts the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous especially the gorgeous Cho Yeo jeong for whom I may confess I have a crush As a postscript an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you re French in the middle of the film the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap Le rustique and Bresse bleu Unbelievable,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4924389/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2019,Lacks any realistic human dimension,South Korean director Bong Joon ho Okja says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way Palme d Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival Bong s Parasite Gisaengchung does indeed thwart expectations but the question is to what end Defying any strict genre classification the film is a conglomeration of comedy drama satire crime horror and anything else you can throw into the mix Bong sees the film as a statement about the ranks and classes inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye and says that the film depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today s increasingly polarized society Unfortunately the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong s statement without much impact The film looks at class differences between two families one well to do and the other n eer do well For the Kim family life is a struggle They live in a cramped bug infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf The father Ki taek Song Kang ho Snowpiercer has failed in business and has accumulated many debts His son and daughter Ki woo Choi Woo sik Train to Busan and Ki jung Park So dam Cinderella and Four Knights TV series have repeatedly failed college entrance exams The mother Chung sook Hyae jin Jang Adulthood along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company but cannot even get that right Not to worry they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi Fi from the next door coffee shop On the other hand the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages Mr Park Lee Sun kyun Jo Pil ho The Dawning Rage is the CEO of a high tech company and the family lives in a spacious modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon kyo Jo Yeo jeong The Target a teenage daughter Da hye Jung Ji so The Tiger and a hyper active young son Da song Jung Hyun jun Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude for Bong they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters With the aid of a friend Ki woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da hye Of course he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs Park of his competence With that conquest out of the way the cunning Ki woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso Mrs Park hires Ki jung as an art teacher then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims this time for the deadbeat dad Ki taek and his wife Chung sook Bong said that Sometimes with the characters in my films I look at them cynically but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters even with the villains This compassion however does not seem to extend to the loyal hardworking household workers their work scammed out of existence Without going into detail the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over the top unsettling even though utterly implausible Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers revenge bloody violence a torrential rainstorm people hiding under beds and any other mayhem that may come to mind To be clear Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp edged yet it is hardly as one critic described it a masterful dissection of social inequality When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film Bong said I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about It is in parts funny frightening and sad and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it I ll wish for nothing more Enjoy the drink In a little while you may have trouble remembering what the film was about,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5189278/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,"Parasite Review: Comedy, drama, suspense, and yes, even horror.",A family who doesn t have a lot of money or opportunities in life starts working for a wealthy family But will this change the life of the poor family DIRECTOR Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS Bong Joon Ho Han Jin Wan CAST Song Kang Ho Lee Sun Kyun Cho Yeo Jeong Choi Woo Shik Park So Dam Lee Jung Eun Chang Hyae Jin In the movie we follow the Kim family who doesn t have much money By chance the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family He teaches their daughter English Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house Then the movie starts to get darker and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie The title of the movie turns things on its head Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience Parasites are found in all classes of society From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie and it s pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down and you feel like they re on board the Titanic They must run from the top and down to the engine room What a wonderful sequence and it s so beautiful to watch The cast was fantastic and everyone fit the needs of their roles The characters were well written with the performances complementing that perfectly It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people whom despite their eccentricities maintained a grounded realistic feel The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing So if you like foreign films thrillers or movies that can make you think a little check this one out It s a crisp film from a technical aspect and with a blend of great writing and acting you can t go wrong It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5469880/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2019,"Poor pacing, too few twists, too unbelievable",I think there s a really good movie buried in Parasite somewhere but I gave up trying to find it It has the same problem the director s previous The Host had the pacing is broken That s not all though People have written about the movie s unexpected twists and turns The thing is it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive they are too few and far between and too unbelievable The first major twist happens about an hour in and seems to come out of nowhere The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits though they are far fetched how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly until by the end I wasn t even paying attention Pity Some of the sequences were brilliant,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5338090/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,It's so metaphorical,I am remarkably stingy with my 10 10 ratings I ll be the first person to acknowledge this Of the roughly 2600 titles I ve rated on here only 34 have a 10 Parasite is one of them If this isn t a masterpiece then I don t know what is I m going to keep it vague on the plot front because I didn t know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways What I will say is that this film more than just about any other I ve seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132 minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent Parts of this movie were hilarious Parts were heartbreaking Other parts were insanely suspenseful I m honestly not sure if I ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad way back in 2013 And it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering You come to care for just about all of them I m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie And sure I ve seen many movies that are hard to fault but it s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect It s extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake there s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie s over and this one s not going to leave my head for a while I can tell Catch this one when you can and believe the hype Joon Ho Bong has made many great films and so far no bad one s but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was this one will surely be up there,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5446179/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2020,Bong's Brilliance,When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood When I see a decent foreign film I can t help but want to praise it more because they don t have the multi billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them Usually they have to be more creative more ingenious and more resourceful Parasite is one of very few Korean films I ve watched in my life My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space Korean films are a rarity for me This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them That is essentially what happened but you re not holding anyone s attention with that concept alone Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either Some how Parasite did that The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead The Park family was wealthy yet unlike your average rich movie family they were not cruel or unbearable people In fact they were very likeable Normally we want our clear cut good guys and bad guys We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose In the cases where all of our guys are good we want them all to win In the cases where all our guys are bad we want them all to lose In Parasite not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5428173/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2019,Family Affairs,Winner of the Palme d Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019 to say Parasite is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament When you have to spill blood in a film you have to dose it with genius hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and above all understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well Don t get me wrong Parasites is not a bloody drama but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art it is a tragicomedy about love life and death it is a film about the joy of living about survival about the family of the 21st century but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many that sick stifled definition confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019 many dispossessed and a few privileged in a game of services and currency exchanges in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence horror and death Although director Bong Joon ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes I only know one of his films the cult fable The Guest a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus Again in Parasite Bong addresses the family issue opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children to a rich family with the same number of members The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story A third component personified by a housekeeper gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax which is not the end of the fascinating story at this point of the story it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell until the sad final close up that ends this work When I watch films like Parasites my heart skips a beat I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L A garbage that the cinemas offer week after week freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes As soon as Parasite appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies don t miss it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5301416/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,Brilliant Dark Satire,Parasite A con artist family preys on an upper class couple and their children That s the bare bones of this film but it is a multi layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon ho keeps things going at a brisk canter A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park s home is a joy to observe First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper the existing servants just cast aside Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror Another masterpiece by Bong Joon ho which he partially based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5438030/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2020,Well....I didn't expect 'that' after the first half. That's for sure!,Flash Review WOW I did not see all that coming The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family s life to feed off them like parasites They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family s trust With ample tension and drama there the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper Topping that the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale The story was original well written and semi believable with twists that don t cheat the viewer Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch enjoy ponder,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5460203/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2020,"Unexpectedly shocking, unforgettable and of course, highly entertaining.",Song Kang ho is one of my favorite South Korean actors and I ve seen many of his films However I hadn t seen a Korean film since a long time and once I heard all the good things about Parasite and the amount of acclaim it has earned I couldn t stop myself from watching it And whoever said it slowly transforms into something unexpected wasn t kidding at all Parasite started as a drama with shades of dark humor before morphing into an edge of the seat thriller that keeps you captivated and shocks you to the extent that you can t even move It s that spellbinding The film can t be easily put into one genre and that s true Still whether you like black comedies dramas thrillers or not you must see this film at least once It s just that you need to prepare yourself to be shocked because once the surprises start coming you can t forget any of that for a long time Parasite runs a little more than 2 hours but is so captivating that it might feel like the shortest 2 hours of all time Words won t be sufficient to further describe this film s actual brilliance I m still spellbound What started like a fun movie became something so surprising that it was hard to forget after it ended It took away the very feel of watching a film Whatever I saw just felt real absolutely real No doubt Parasite is one of the most original films you ll see in the recent memory and surprisingly has elements of almost every genre covered in its entire duration Let s hope it wins big at the Oscars too,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5452136/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,The Best Film in Years.,Maybe it s just me but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017 2016 was a very good year for film the last great year altogether Have I simply seen too many films In 2016 and earlier There were a whole bunch of films that I could say now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen Since 2017 the most that I could say about I film I love would have been I love this film But I don t adore it One of the best of the year not ever Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours But throughout that duration time stands still We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains Parasite follows two families the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum many people interpret this as a social satirical film I can see where they are coming from but I didn t care about that Many different themes such as identity are also looked at but that is all just icing on the cake Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions so we root for them right away to get out of the slums Ki woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da hye in english Ki woo does not know English well but figures he can fake it and make some money he may be just a tutor but it pays well He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son so Ki woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy s therapist With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job it all seems like a sinch to get them in But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom Parasite could be simplified as family vs family but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters They are smart sympathetic even likeable The reason I call this film Hitchcockian is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine Even when a movie is unpredictable the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily But with this each time a twist comes which is frequent the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard The director really pulls out the rug from underneath Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director Bong Joon Ho could easily have messed up at any moment But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material In fact it it just the opposite the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate With all that happens Parasite becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget 4 4,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5256898/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2020,Not for me,PARASITE 2019 I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar Well I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part The trailer repelled me so I decided not to watch it before this point The cinematography was wonderful but once again my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film I found the movie sadistic and disturbing Rather than a provoking statement about class I saw a dark sick film laced with contempt gratuitous violence caricatures of people and unlikeable characters with no moral compass How utterly depressing,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5494892/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,Food for thought delivered with exciting wit,Parasite is the best movie of the year This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety second Academy Awards This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy drama horror thriller and tragedy The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money Parasite however is less cumbersome melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit depth and creativity instead International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions The movie is so detailed precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again I m grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre People are craving for a change and are tired of tame predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels remakes and sequels There should be more creative dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5252080/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2019,"Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""",If there s an argument that s been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class From the days of cavemen the Roman Empire the Enlightment and even modern times philosophers scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor It s something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all It s hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that s its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa This is also something that many movies has dived into In fact one of my favorite movies of the 2000 s is the science fiction thriller Snowpiercer It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out It s a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into It looks like he s made another movie about class except Parasite is a smaller story about two families but is still as impactful We start with a family of four living in the slums in a basement under a store father Kim Ki Taek played by Song Kang ho mother Chung sook played by Jang Hye jin son Kim Ki woo played by Choi Woo shik and daughter Kim Ki Jeong played by Park So dam They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes When a friend of the son comes to visit he offers Kim Ki woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family s daughter He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of a fancy house built by a famous architect wide space a backyard and nice cars After some convincing from the family a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son the father as a new driver errand runner and the mother as the new housekeeper The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something Though there is a second half to the movie I can t talk about it without spoiling it Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019 It may sound like a typical dark comedy but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn t expect At the front this is still a story on class difference A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of helping the poor Thankfully Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different Parasite doesn t try to make the wealthy family out to be villains But they don t try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child If anything it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad but even that can depend on a number of factors This movie is the prime example of would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully but it s acted amazingly Though the movie is in Korean you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I ve seen this year hence why I m not naming them one by one I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has I ll give this ten fancy houses out of ten It may be in a different language but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5257052/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2020,Just read...,Parasite is a unique movie I don t know if it s a true masterpiece or one of a kind indeed or just a piece of masterful craft Bong does everything he wants while telling his stories and he s the only one I know who can do that aside from Tarantino The plus here is a very sound moral I will think a lot about Parasite and maybe watch it again This is the first time in 100 reviews that I don t feel I can correctly rate a movie but surely it is in the 8 to 10 stars range,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5426376/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps,The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging clap worthy entertaining and relatable Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society As the name of the film itself the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house only to get the shock of their life Directed by Bong Joon Ho who made Snowpiercer and Okja Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to A poverty driven family comprising of a struggling father Kim and mother tech savvy son and a careless sister who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich by falsely accusing the old staffs The main drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim s family take over the house and celebrate their win However they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the old staff comes back which changes their plan completely This is where the film kicks off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads to series of uninvited events leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected If you go the wrong way you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim s loses one of his family member and ultimately face the redemption Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly when two staff families meet at the basement the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim s family Kim picking up in stuff son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess The beauty of cinema lies in the story telling and this is where Parasite scores Technically Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography Editing is superb though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed Art direction is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding Performances wise I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up my favourite would be Kang ho Song who plays the role of father of the unemployed family Parasite is nail biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps Brilliant 4 5,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5397969/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2019,One of the decade's most clever and original,South Korean film crews may be World Cinema s most painstakingly dedicated the movies are detailed and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Hollywood supervision on top of letting the actors give their all and show their most unflattering selves As is the case with Bong Joon ho s Parasite they might also produce some of our time s most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process We meet the impoverished Kim family father Ki taek Song Kang ho mother Chung sook Jang Hye jin son Ki woo Choi Woo shik and daughter Ki jeong Park So dam and we soon learn they aren t the most honest bunch Ki woo through his friend Min hyuk gets hired as a homeschool English teacher using forged Oxford documents at the home of the upper class Park family tech company CEO Dong ik Lee Sun kyun his stressed out wife Yeon gyo a wonderful Cho Yeo jeong teen daughter Da hye Jung Ji so and little Da song Jung Hyun joon This is but the beginning of the Kim family s sneaky ascent Learning of Da song s troubles Ki woo going by Kevin informs Mrs Park of an art therapist he knows named Veronica who is actually Ki jeong who may help Da song evolve Through a series of events I won t spoil Veronica later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki taek going by Mr Kim who in turn recommends a new housekeeper played by Chung sook The way the Kims continually fool the Parks from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad libbing based on research they ve done for the fields they pretend to work in is clever tense impossible to predict and morbidly hilarious throughout It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it s edited for instance cutting from Ki taek lying to Yeon gyo to him finishing the same sentence during Ki woo s rehearsals how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence and how utterly believable these performances are The actors who portray the Kims in particular give remarkably layered performances Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family s home employees The characters themselves are convincing actors hence their successful duping of the Parks which makes each real world actor s performance all the more considerable And yes it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position but the film is self aware and deliberate about this not only because the Parks in their carefree luxury aren t the most observant This is all comical to experience yes but what Bong has to say about class inequity and during the film s bleaker later scenes how it isn t necessarily so simple as letting the poor have some luxury for the sake of fairness is what makes Parasite stick We may understand the downtrodden Kims we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique and laugh at their conniving schemes but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end Parasite is generally well loved but divisive in the circles you d expect My guilty pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families also calling it a cancel culture comedy because I guess anti family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to cancel offensive celebrities and indeed berate classism So far as I can decipher White s main evidence is the fact that in the story a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi titular social parasites whom he likens to entitled modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists As mentioned the Kims aren t strictly heroes or justified Isn t this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters read villains who co opt our customs perversely But then psh who d reason like that,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5303579/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,"Started off great, then tanked - and I get the message",This film is either a love or hate review I get that most that hate it maybe didn t understand the message I did but it was written in a mind boggling illogical plot hole ridden way What makes it even worse is how great it was from the start that when the ridiculousness kicked in you become extremely disappointed There are so many ways this could ve been written much better and still get the message across and maintain the initial theme without tanking Directing and cinematography were excellent and the casting on point And the 132 min runtime was flying by until the plot started to tank Clearly over hyped and not worth anything more than my 6 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5439922/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2019,Extremely absurd without basic logic,Huge Oscar Winner What a JOKE There s no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4 member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family The two screenplay writers one of them was the director Bong simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99 struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1 rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation like feel good opportunity for the poor a self righteous self justified self indulgent revenge on the rich class At the beginning of this movie this lowlife 4 member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition the husband father was unemployed for a very long time the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times This helpless and hopeless family couldn t simply become a well practiced con artist family overnight If they were such great scammers they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time They were just like you and me who don t have money to afford a dignified basic living standard They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con artist so easy and so soon The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers director who made the rich people looked so stupid naive emotional fragile and so easily to be conned they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich The differences between the rich and the poor are many but usually it s because the rich people are smarter more intelligent more cunning 1 000 times sharper than the poor they are not so easy to be manipulated conned scammed or swindled otherwise they wouldn t become rich and successful Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn t even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile naive shallow emotional wreck but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split hair sharp otherwise they d not be able to handle their social status The husband in this movie also showed that he s a hardworking super smart self made businessman and entrepreneur he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers Yet this movie again simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers In summary Zero Probability Highly Unlikely The long term helpless 4 member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well experienced well organized smart grifters swindlers How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly so suddenly become so smart so organized so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step It s against the basic logic and absolute impossible The director screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples hate resent bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10 minutes standing ovation it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich so they were so generous to award this one way street movie the grand prize I don t know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con artist imposter swindler fraud genre movies Ah ga ssi Handmaiden 2016 is almost the same like this sucker but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love making scenes these two movies are basically the same HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE SAME CRAP DIFFERENT TITLE Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them To me both of these two movies are just a torture to watch There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers so I think it s time to call off making such stupid movies I m a poor guy yet I don t hate the rich people but envy them I m also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me there s no way I could manipulate them and con even 0 01 out of their pocket,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5102024/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2020,Bong Joon-ho's drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing,It s hard to nail down what type of movie Parasite is but this drama thriller comedy is definitely worth seeing Bong Joon ho tells this story in a way that keeps you engaged and keeps you guessing with protagonists you can t fully like and antagonists you don t really hate Even though I may not agree with every decision this film makes I enjoyed the journey and I ll be thinking about it for a very long time,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5449807/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,Goes bigger by going smaller,Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time That is not new But this film reaches new heights not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach As a result the comedy the stakes and the insights here are at a different level You care about the protagonists and you feel the weight of their struggle All the same ingredients are there the social satire the violence the bizarre twists the brilliant direction but there s a new weight to this film I don t think masterpiece is too strong and I m looking forward to watching it again some time soon,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5234535/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2020,The Privilege Class crashes into the Working poor,My Review Parasite My Rating 9 10 I m so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer director Bong Joon Ho Parasite has already received numerous accolades with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director and Best International Feature Film making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition At the 77th Golden Globe Awards the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards It also became the first non English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture The film s title Parasite was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning which he had to convince the film s marketing group to use Bong said Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family and I think that s why the marketing team was a little hesitant But if you look at it the other way you can say that rich family they re also parasites in terms of labor They can t even wash dishes they can t drive themselves so they leech off the poor family s labor So both are parasites I read Director and script writer Bong Joon is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I m sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout Stairs are used as a motif voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times and most obviously there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park s home I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film Unfortunately I ve only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon It s a movie I want to watch again as it s as good as all the hype it s getting and what a journey it takes the audience on Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2 2 20 this film had grossed a Worldwide 163 3 million and was estimated to have cost 11 million to produce Of course I don t know any of the actors but they re all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year I still think it s odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I m certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to I m still so fond of Pedro Almod var s Pain Glory Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more There s so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite The story depicts Class divides Climate Catastrophes Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it s unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing Emma this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series Succession portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup The common thread that Parasite Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it s survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently dresses differently or anyone doesn t process a degree or wealth The poor family s ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular neurotic self obsessed rich Park family 2 comments from Parasite said by Ki taek and wife Chung sook stay in my mind Ki taek They are rich but still nice Chung sook Ki taek s wife They are nice because they are rich Chung sook Ki taek s wife If I had all this I would be kinder Ki taek Rich people are naive No resentments No creases on them Chung sook Ki taek s wife It all gets ironed out Money is an iron Those creases all get smoothed out by money Both families end up with creases and

9 February 2020,"A good, relatable, and easy-to-access South Korean film, much like ""City of God"" was for Brazil.",Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles For a foreign film from Korea this is very accessible for all languages and audiences The actors are all expressive attractive and do a really good job acting The story has lots of universal contemporary components to it of pop culture For what it s worth the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea s City of God or something along those lines what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed well written and pretty gritty It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller part mystery without giving away spoilers I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating but unfortunately I just could not Sorry but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded and that s not to say that it wasn t fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the perfect range of storytelling The same issue also arose in the second back half of the movie some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10 However other than these two fairly big big enough to deduct two points flaws the script is practically perfect especially for a foreign film The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate immerse and challenge your mind while also keeping it entertaining They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender but unfortunately it just didn t quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility It could still happen but after viewing it with an open mind it looks like it s between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917 EDIT Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5470163/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2019,Unforgettable and original,Stunning This is a movie of superlatives Every aspect of this movie is well done from the original story to the acting and directing It is a drama comedy unbiased social commentary thriller a lot in one The completely accessible and involving story is well written and constructed every scene has a purpose Given the extremes that this story goes to it s still plausible the thriller elements don t get out of hand or descend into stupidity There is a social commentary on class and wealth that is so effectively laid out from start to finish It has changed the way I think about relationships across the wealth divide Don t read anything about the story before you watch it Just go and see it This Korean cast and director have made an unforgettable film that will be talked about for years to come And it deserves every accolade out there,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5330092/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2019,ONE OF 2019'S BEST...!,Bong Joon ho s Snowpiercer The Host latest is coming to local screens w the Palm D Or stamp of excellence it is well deserved This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family the daughter s grades aren t up to snuff at least according to the overprotective mother but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan his mom dad sister into the mix His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well off youngest son elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver the maid who worked at the property w the architect of the manse so that his parents can fill in those slots So far so good depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch inheritors of the new Korea but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down forcing our anti heroes to make a decision which will effect their world Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted at least for the most part me against them there s a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain their journey home is literally a descent into hell which rides the fine line between cruel mirthful One of the year s best catch it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5310067/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2020,"As Stakes Rapidly Rise, a Clever Family of Con Artists Slips Underwater",A relatively simple low key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family smoothly weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy naive white collar household Unpredictably composed Parasite effortlessly shifts between several genres evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between Of the versatile tools in that particular box the film s at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome Not all of those nail biters lead to fireworks and the film is careful not to overplay its hand so that when the time is right those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows The first hour is captivating as the leeches shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum but the home stretch with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways One helluva ride,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5445043/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,Brilliant Masterpiece of South Korean Filmmaking,O M G I knew Parasite was going to be good but I didn t expect it to be THAT good Parasite starts off with a simple premise Yet with what Bong Joon ho accomplishes in this film is worthy of praise and reward Every twist and turn is unexpected and the execution of the film is perfect No other word I can use to describe this film perfect Every character in this film is ones that viewers can emphasize with The themes of class conflict also seen in Boon ho s Snowpiercer prevails in this film as well It s stunning to see these dynamics play out In parts where you expect to know how the story will turn out another curveball is thrown that catches the viewer off guard Yet nothing destroys the suspense of reality There were moments in the film where I was biting my nails in suspense 5 5 The timing pacing and execution of this film will be studied in future generations of filmmaking This is by far one of the best films I ve seen this year,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5403514/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2020,Perfection.,There s quite a bit of hype around this film already but going in I knew nothing about it I prefer this I rarely watch trailers for this very reason the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off The opening is delightful a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty but looking out for one another keeping positive and striving to help themselves It s touching heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot Good fortune finds it s way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for It s not until half an hour in that this new hope gives way a little Just a little crack almost undetectable What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit I m loathed to give too many details but suffice to say this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace it s nothing short of perfect I don t think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises desperation to survive The plot cast cinematography every damn facet flawless The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint does anything but I know it s only January but this surely has to be film of the year,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5406226/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2019,"Explosive crime and class warfare film, funny and suspenseful",Bong Joon Ho s film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing mischievous energy and spiked with sharply drawn characters with varying shades of moral and ethical decay It s a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns It s best to go into this film knowing as little as possible The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang ho as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family however shady and immoral his choices become He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful The rock of the family he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever For all the vitality and edginess of this film there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here there remains a lingering shred of human dignity Grandly recommended,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5258059/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2020,It's so metaphorical.,Everyone said Go see Parasite Everyone said The one rule about Parasite is that you don t talk about Parasite So I went to see Parasite So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite Kim Ki Woo Woo sik Choi is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub basement room sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living of sorts by assembling pizza boxes Opportunity presents itself when his best friend the slightly older Min Seo joon Park goes abroad to study For Min is an English tutor to the up market Park family s school age daughter Da hye Ji so Jung Not wanting his fellow frat boys to move in on future romance he s lined up Ki Woo as his replacement Ki woo knows he s lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da hye s not too bright mother Yeon kyo Yeo jeong Jo But the influence of the family s lucky rock doesn t stop there Ki woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim So dam Park his father Ki taek Kang ho Song and his mother Chung sook Hye jin Jang And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family s lives You might think that s the story It s not Just when you think you know where the film is going a gentle comic tale with farcical elements the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone To say more if you ve not seen the film would be cruelty beyond measure It s a truly astonishing script by writer director Bong Joon Ho and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay It s the details that get to you This will be a superb film to watch multiple times There are fabulous details scattered throughout You know how the more expensive the car the more solid the clunk is as you shut the door Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts Look what happens to the one of a kind lucky rock As for one of my favourite films from last year The Farewell you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF This is a masterpiece of cinema well deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d Or award At 132 minutes it s not a short film but seldom have two hours flown by faster It s totally gripping At times hysterically funny at times shocking A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined Gripes I had just one An action near the end of the movie seems bizarrely out of character and was a WTF moment that I didn t think the film needed However it did set up a wonderful story telling finale that I will think about for many months It provoked that seldom found reaction in the cinema when the end titles ran A hubbub of chatter and appreciation It comes with a highly recommended from me For the graphical version of this review please check out One Mann s Movies on the web or Facebook,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5471551/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2019,Parasite Review,Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it s not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick The film s message is a little on the nose but I don t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable Other than that this film is perfect There is not one bad performance in the movie Cho Yeo jeong Park So dam and Kang Ho Song are standouts from the film All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable Another aspect I loved was the cinematography The film s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design The film s story and themes make this film incredible The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems It s so incredibly tense You never know what is going to happen next and it s always surprising to see what eventually happens The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family Every time this occurs you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil His score adds so much more to the tension I know I m using the word tension a lot but that s what this film is A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale For me each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year Overall Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting great cinematography and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5224654/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2019,A masterpiece that showcases an artist truly in control of his impeccable craft,I am remarkably stingy with my 10 10 ratings I ll be the first person to acknowledge this Of the roughly 2600 titles I ve rated on here only 34 have a 10 Parasite is one of them If this isn t a masterpiece then I don t know what is I m going to keep it vague on the plot front because I didn t know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways What I will say is that this film more than just about any other I ve seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132 minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent Parts of this movie were hilarious Parts were heartbreaking Other parts were insanely suspenseful I m honestly not sure if I ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad way back in 2013 And it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering You come to care for just about all of them I m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie And sure I ve seen many movies that are hard to fault but it s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect It s extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake there s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie s over and this one s not going to leave my head for a while I can tell Catch this one when you can and believe the hype Joon Ho Bong has made many great films and so far no bad one s but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was this one will surely be up there,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5247127/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,Unconventional and terrific,The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars including best picture I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run time but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward This is one to root for at the awards,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5460979/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2020,A unique and unpredictable feature film from one of the world's most exciting directors,Over the course of well regarded and unique films such as The Host the under appreciated Snowpiercer and the crazy Netflix distributed Okja Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho has established himself as one of the most noteworthy foreign directors of the last few decades Following on with his ability to mix and match genres with an ever present dark vein of humor seeping through his narratives veins Ho has hit it big with the surprise 2019 hit Parasite that now sits pretty in the IMDB Top 50 films of all time and stands head and shoulders above other foreign films from 2019 in regards to box office takings off a small scale budget of a couple of million dollars Incomparable to any other film you could think of Parasite is a very original beast that believe it or not combines drama comedy thriller and even moments of horror to ensure that its many twists and turns and social commentary co inhabit to create an entirely unpredictable experience that is best watched with as little pre understanding as possible Centered around the below the poverty line Kim family and their new employment in the household of the wealthy Park family Parasite allows Ho to weave together a loaded plot line that may seemingly be headed one way only to surprise us all as it veers further and further away from the expected Wonderfully played out by its core cast with highlights from Kang ho Song as father Ki taek and Hye jin Jang as mother Chung sook Parasite is the type of unnerving film that keeps you mentally on edge throughout as you re glued to the screen unable to turn away from a disaster in the making that must surely be headed towards a finale as wild as we would expect from a director like Ho As you watch the expertly directed edited and scored film one that has you laughing one minute and gasping for air the next you begin to appreciate that you re watching a director operating at the top of their game in what s still likely a career only around its halfway mark it s exciting to think of where Ho and his inventive mind can go in the future as he continues to give us films that seem to be cut entirely from their own cloths In an age where many films are nothing but pale imitations remakes or sequels its exciting to see efforts such as Parasite that give us something new fresh and exhilarating no doubt a reason why the word of mouth from cinema goers helped make Parasite a world wide smash hit and a genuine Best Picture contender at the upcoming Oscars Final Say While not flawless Parasite isn t far off it a darkly observed social commentary piece that is both heartbreaking and brilliantly humorous Bong Joon Ho has further established himself as one of the in form directors working today with what could well be his most important film yet 4 1 2 peaches out of 5,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5457457/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2019,A Masterpiece in Filmmaking,Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now Admittedly I haven t seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years I thought both of those films were great so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film Parasite After viewing not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019 but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you ll see all year Now some people may not like the turn it takes but here s why I think Parasite demands to be seen To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven t seen it so I ll stick to the basics here The Kim family lives in a basement living space All unemployed they find any way they can to make things work Ki woo the eldest sibling in the family is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con artists Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate this makes for some terrific tension The biggest praise I can give this film is that it s constantly in motion never wasting a moment to surprise you The set up for this movie has many clever aspects to it the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn t disappoint either Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to it becomes that much more interesting In other hands this story could ve have come off as a very generic film but there s truly something special about how well made Parasite is Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung pyo Hong each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say It s very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon This movie is brilliantly made in every way It s very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here so I won t bother trying because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much A great engaging story that surprises you from start to finish along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year I can t praise this film enough This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn t be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5219988/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2020,Bong Joon-Ho is a genius!,Bong Joon Ho is a director that I ll definitely check out more I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone Parasite is nothing short of genius It s best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent Bong Joon Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety Bong Joon Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience The events that unfold don t come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing Aside from the story this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019 The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic The editing is fantastic as the film s pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever The aesthetics on the whole is top notch I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense Whilst delivering a fun film there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they re dumb 2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven t then go watch it immediately This is a film you should not miss,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5438127/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2019,Staggeringly original Korean social satire; one of the best of the decade,I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype It was the recipient of the Palm D Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews It s an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of the past ten years I won t say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible extremely wealthy family The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society but also in the world as a whole From there its main raison d tre expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations The results are shocking startling hilarious and utterly brilliant Such results certainly couldn t be achieved without a truly outstanding cast but lucky for us Bong Joon ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble Even more impressive is the film s character development While the film s primary characters are often not the most ethical they are surprisingly likable and multi dimensional especially when heightened by both emotion and tone You ll certainly remember them long after the credits roll But what s most unforgettable about Parasite is that the film manipulates in the best way possible its tone in so many unique and engaging ways that it is able to fully subvert the viewer s expectations of not only how the film will go but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions Combining laugh out loud witty comedy taut suspense and moments of pitch black darkness viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years While such tonal shifts may sound erratic they could not have been done more perfectly here so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film s almost impeccable tightness not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged One review cited in the film s trailer calls Parasite a magic trick I couldn t agree more both literally and figuratively A definite 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5201749/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,"The Social Commentary, It Showcases is Spectacular!",If a film makes you think continuously even after the show ends it must be a great one And this one did just that Packed with terrific direction commendable performances from the whole cast the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category It made me think it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it I just couldn t express the feelings I got watching this In one word it s truly a masterpiece It Won 4 academy awards this year and that s not a mean feat Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics the industry people and us the audience This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about It s entertaining thrilling with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind I assure you this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the Parasite in here The class difference the economical boundaries set by the same people It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects And it can be applicable to any country though it s been made having Korean culture and society in mind this story would be relatable to everyone No matter the country Someone lives in But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention Every character and their actions represent something And you need to find that connection And don t worry you will as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo trailer and articles before watching it Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally Enough of the review now I just wanna say go and watch this film immediately It s amazing and a surreal experience that could not be forgotten easily Top of the table recommendation,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5476073/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2020,A movie made by a 'far away' country doesn't make it a masterpiece,We live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good However the moral from Hans Christian Andersen s story The Emperors New Clothes is telling ourselves something is good doesn t mean it is and that is very much the case for Parasite In the main the film isn t too bad A poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy The acting is only alright but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say and the viewer doesn t learn much about the wealthy family The film also leaves many unanswered questions such as What happened to Ki woo s friend who went abroad and what did he make of it all at the end It s all a little silly really The film will appeal to 1 Wave the flag of support for anything foreign 2 Think being politically correct is a political party 3 Think transgender ism is choice not a biological state If you haven t seen this you re not missing much,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6252115/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2019,Crime & Class,An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder Parasite is the best Korean film I ve seen for quite awhile though it s not without its flaws Even allowing for poor translation a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow several plot threads are introduced that don t go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained and too many elements the morse code for instance stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell rather than making any sense within that story But for all that Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema a twisted amoral mischevious inventiveness interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out of nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration in this instance at a kick down some stairs I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all and it s a doozy taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I d been expecting Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5293690/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2020,Brilliant and one of those very few films truly deserving 10 stars...,I absolutely loved this film I thought it was sad darkly funny discomfiting and absolutely brilliant It s hard to talk about the script and its astute observations about class and equality without giving too much away but oh my so many stairways so leaden with meaning If you aren t into foreign movies because of the subtitles I d still highly recommend seeing this He is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue I ve got Snowpiercer lined up to watch tomorrow for a full on Bong Joon ho weekend,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5397797/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2020,'Parasite' is generous in giving you the cerebral food,Parasite is a deep complex layered multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven ts the haven ts are pitted against each other It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax Director Bong Joon Ho of Memories of Murder and The Host fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human s imperialistic pleasures As a result what starts in a mild satirical tone climaxes in a disturbing manner so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle This is no easy movie let me remind you But if you can finish the journey it can stay with you forever for the ample food for thought it offers Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5470227/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,"Parasite, a spoiler filled discussion",I am remarkably stingy with my 10 10 ratings I ll be the first person to acknowledge this Of the roughly 2600 titles I ve rated on here only 34 have a 10 Parasite is one of them If this isn t a masterpiece then I don t know what is I m going to keep it vague on the plot front because I didn t know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways What I will say is that this film more than just about any other I ve seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132 minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent Parts of this movie were hilarious Parts were heartbreaking Other parts were insanely suspenseful I m honestly not sure if I ve felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad way back in 2013 And it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering You come to care for just about all of them I m stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie And sure I ve seen many movies that are hard to fault but it s rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect It s extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake there s a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie s over and this one s not going to leave my head for a while I can tell Catch this one when you can and believe the hype Joon Ho Bong has made many great films and so far no bad one s but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was this one will surely be up there,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5252759/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,A masterful emotional rollercoaster,Bong Joon Ho is an outstanding director and this might be his best work yet Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade hell I d go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it It s funny it s heartbreaking it s intense It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused which is something that many films fail to do The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic with no good guys or bad guys They re people They feel like real and believable characters which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year It s well shot as to be expected and the social commentary is fantastic This is the first movie I ve seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect I loved every single bit of it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5412346/?ref_=tt_urv
