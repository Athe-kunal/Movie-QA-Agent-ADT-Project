22 December 2000,Amazing performance shines through,Robert Zemeckis has his 4th best film here behind Forrest Gump Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future with Cast Away Sure it might be overhyped and some characters in the film aren t needed not to mention it depends on the liking of the lead but when you have Tom Hanks working harder than any actor in a movie this year it is worth it The story follows Hanks as a dedicated fed ex deliverer who has a fiance Helen Hunt and has to leave her Christmas time to go to Asia but alas the plane he s on crashes in the water and dare I say more well I can because practically everyone saw the all revealing trailers Well Hanks arrives on a deserted island and then the real fun begins as he survives in a primitive way probably remenicent of 2001 Hanks favorite film and even finds a silent companion named Wilson a volleyball That Hanks can communicate with this volleyball and almost make the ball as a real person with real feelings that is almost like the Silent Bob to his Jay is one of the films triumphs The others of course being the whole lot of him on the island and Hanks performance If it was someone else it would not be as successful but Hanks gives his all and as usual pulls through 5 fold delivering one of the years and his best performances A,9.0,223.0,266.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565901/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2017,Not a film to cast away...,Quite the opposite Admire both Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks and honestly feel that Cast Away is among the best work of both It is long and the opposite of feel good but utterly riveting thanks to the bold risk taking and Hanks giving a performance for the ages Cast Away has been criticised by some for having an unsatisfying ending It is understandable as to why it is polarising and why it is seen as inconclusive and depressing to some wanting something happy Count me in as somebody who found the ending incredibly powerful and who cannot fail to tear up Have been picky about endings recently and the inconclusive nature didn t bother me that much and actually appreciated that it was more downbeat rather than happy who to me would have felt a little too on the pat side There are so many great things about Cast Away that help make it quite a superb film Zemeckis direction is some of his boldest there are some courageous risks taken like his use of camera work and done in an ingenious way and not overdone Even better is Hanks one for the ages almost one man show performance sometimes not saying much but expressing a lot in a nuanced way He is instrumental in making the island and his resilience in struggling to survive riveting viewing and he does so phenomenally It is a very well made film too beautifully and cleverly photographed atmospherically lit and with a lovingly created island setting They blend so well with the film s tone and with its boldness The score avoids from being overwrought while there is a beautifully constructed script that provokes a lot of thought and wide range of emotions While deliberately paced the story is an engrossing one with a excellently harrowing plane crash and the very telling section on the island that to me didn t drag at all even with events being a little on the slight side Plus there aren t many times when you feel so much for a volleyball you do here While the other characters aren t as well written or as interesting as Hanks it is not in a way to bring down the film in any way Helen Hunt makes a moving impression even with limited screen time her meeting with Hanks one of the film s most powerful moments In conclusion a powerful bold and superbly acted directed and made film that is moving without the audience being forced or manipulated into feeling so 10 10 Bethany Cox,10.0,55.0,65.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3736791/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,Excellent film gave me goosebumps,Crazy that Tom Hanks didn t win the nominations that year A captivating stranding of wonderfulness gloriously directed by Robert Zemeckis I like how there s a bit of comedy despite the circumstances I love stories about unfortunate things happening where characters are stuck somewhere that deal with many things Cast Away is legendary even many years later,10.0,34.0,39.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5778417/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2002,Definitely worth a couple viewings.,I ll be honest the first time I saw this film I wasn t too sure if I liked it I mean I certainly enjoyed it but I just wasn t too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around And just got better with each additional viewing I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first But all in all I ve watched the film enough times now that I can say I love this film When I really stop and think about it the film is brilliantly executed The scenery is absolutely breath taking the special effects are so well done that you don t even realize that there are special effects present This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis case and point Forrest Gump The acting is very good although there s only 2 real sources of acting in this film Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt The rest of the cast was good but their roles were very minor Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance as usual You really can feel all of his emotions while he s stuck on the island Also not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film I truly applaud him for his work As much as I liked Russell Crow in Gladiator I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more although that would be his third Oscar Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance There is also a good deal of comedy in the film and it is done very well This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch There aren t a great many films that I would say this but this one I would Although if you aren t a fan of Tom Hanks then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island So if that is the case then you are off the hook So I hope you watch the film and I hope that you enjoy it Thanks for reading Chris,10.0,141.0,175.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565973/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2002,Outstanding,I think this is an excellent movie I ve noticed many felt it too long boring etc which is to be expected in today s gimme non stop action I haven t been doing anything for 5 minutes I m bored mentality This was a true man vs nature movie that really made me think about what I take for granted and I found myself wondering how I would react in such a situation Would I talk to a volleyball you betcha anyone who has spent any significant time alone can relate Bought the DVD and will watch it for years too come,10.0,483.0,547.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566106/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2002,well-crafted and intriguing,From director Robert Zemeckis comes this powerful character study of a man and his quest for survival Hanks is a time obsessed postal worker on a routine cargo transport His life is forever changed after the plane crashes and he finds himself stranded all alone on an uncharted island We re drawn into his long arduous journey as he struggles not only to keep his sanity but to stay alive so he can make it back to the love of his life Hunt A fascinating believable and thought provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live with a remarkably ideal performance from Tom Hanks and steady effectively leisure direction that allows viewers to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey A small idea expanded into a one of a kind movie,0.0,83.0,109.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566109/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2007,A wonderfully silent drama with Hanks and Wilson spiritually sensational,At the turn of the millennium technology started to get bigger and better Films were starting to develop in a way that was never predicted but so did the actors After watching Robert Zemeckis Forrest Gump 1994 I thought I had seen a true drama but that was clearly only the beginning Tom Hanks Big Forrest Gump stars in his Oscar nominated performance as Chuck Noland a Fed Ex executive who is stranded on an isolated island after a thunderous plane crash When doing background research on this film I was surprised to see that Russell Crowe had beaten Hanks to the Oscar in 2001 As good as Crowe was in Gladiator I personally thought Hanks made the most sensational performance of his career here Hanks character Noland is truly remarkable From being a comfortable and hard working executive at home with his long time girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt to being an isolated figure in different circumstances The change in character allows Hanks to express his full acting potential and dive deep within the soul of the character It is a true battle of human intelligence and human power that Hanks does so well to give and some scenes really got to me it is such a powerful role and does well to rival his other Oscar wins The text s semiotics are remarkably significant Having left the wreckage of the plane with only a few supplies Noland builds himself around what he can salvage and none is more recognizable than Wilson A silent volleyball which was encoded into Cast Away so Hank s could use dialogue to express his traumatic emotions The plot is made exciting through various scenes The plane crash is very dramatic and beautifully directed by Zemeckis and scenes shot on the island when Hanks is alone and wandering what to do are silent and chilling justifying the drama genre The beautiful island is contradicted by the drastic situation a truly magnificent incentive The ending too is wonderful as it paves the way for many possibilities a spellbinding film,7.0,69.0,91.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1744977/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2012,The most deserving film not in the top 250,This movie is the most deserving of all movies out there that is not in the IMDb Top 250 In fact this movie should be in the Top 100 Everything about it works the cinematography the locations the acting the story and this is Robert Zemeckis greatest showpiece Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing The story is so well written in its simplicity and Helen Hunt and Hanks have an amazing chemistry It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile,10.0,160.0,186.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2660746/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,It's all about love,I liked this movie but I can t say the same for the reviews found on this website Far too many of these fall into 2 categories Those who thought the movie was a Crusoe like story of survival and loved it and those who thought the film was an ad for Fedex and hated it But the movie is neither about man against nature nor about Fedex Cast Away is about love about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it about an ordeal that led one man to re think what is meaningful in life and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years Tom Hanks is superb as Chuck Noland creating immense sympathy for an ordinary guy trapped not against his will in a job that is eating him alive How many actors could have made Noland s attachment to Wilson believable Yet Hanks does The last section of the film much reviled by many is immensely touching Noland has survived 5 year s of utter isolation hoping to be reunited with his fianc and has resigned himself to death at least a few times before he is miraculously rescued Anyone who remains dry eyed during his meeting with Kelly when their rich feelings are both acknowledged and of necessity abandoned is unworthy of being allowed in the theater to see a film of such quality as this one That Noland s hard earned wisdom about love and family will not be wasted makes for a marvelous ending to the film It has required all of his ingenuity and endurance to survive on the island It will now require strength of a different kind to accept the irrevocable loss of Kelly and open himself to a new experience perhaps with Bettina The last scene with Noland standing at the crossroads as the haunting theme is reprised for the last time as Bettina drives toward her house and as Hanks looks into the camera with new found resolve is classic though again cynics are absolutely barred from enjoying it,10.0,114.0,132.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1494457/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2007,What a fantastic film!!!,I have never seen a more meaningful and thought provoking film Right from the start I knew this was going to be a classic film and my opinion was not changed throughout the course of the movie one bit It delivers such a strong message of fear survival and hope that leaves your mind devoted to thinking about it for a long while after It made me think about all my creature comforts and what is actually necessary in life Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV but anyway it sort of made you guess how he was feeling in a clever way This is one of my all time favourite films and I could watch it again and again without getting bored so go and watch it NOW,10.0,191.0,227.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1701876/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2007,"When you haven't got anywhere, all you've got is nowhere",Cast Away was Tom Hanks second film with director Robert Zemeckis The last time they collaborated was on the 1994 multi Oscar winner Forrest Gump I must admit I was never exactly a huge fan of Forrest Gump despite being a great admirer of Zemeckis work It was a film that painted a rather naive portrait of America and its relationship with the common man And the special effects however impressive they might have been were only a nifty selling point to wow the Academy award winning crowd One of the most commercially calculated and overrated films ever made Happily Zemeckis seems to have learnt from his mistakes with Forrest Gump Because Cast Away is a much more accomplished piece of storytelling A fascinating portrayal of a man cut off from civilisation and when he finally returns to it he s just as shipwrecked This is the type of film Tom Hanks should be winning Oscars for Because the film rests entirely on his shoulders And best of all there s none of the false optimism that plagued Forrest Gump Hanks plays FedEx Express worker Chuck Noland He is a man who lives and dies by the clock Always on the go One minute he s sorting out packaging schedules in Russia The next he s delivering much needed vaccines in Malaysia Its a hectic lifestyle and one that doesn t leave a lot of time for a social life Nonetheless Chuck is in a happy relationship with girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt even though she gets exasperated when they can t even finish a dinner date because his damn beeper goes off And that s exactly what happens on Christmas Eve After he s just proposed to Kelly he s called away for a job At the airport he tells her I ll be right back Famous last words The plane he is on is caught in a storm and dive bombs into the ocean Chuck survives in an inflatable life raft just barely and is washed ashore on an island Now all alone Chuck must gather every resource at his disposal to survive To make it through to the next day Cast Away is an outstanding film One of the great survivalist tales you ll ever see Robert Zemeckis direction has never been so astute and intelligent In fact for my money Cast Away may be the best film yet to emerge from Zemeckis mostly excellent body of work Before we even get to the island there are the scenes of the plane crash and Chuck s valiant voyage in his rubber dinghy The crash is a tour de force of action and effects work Zemeckis shoots it in a series of frenzied camera angles and jolting close ups Its a startling scene so affecting for its suddenness And the scene where Chuck nearly gets shredded by an out of control engine turbine stays in the memory and doesn t easily fade Only for Zemeckis to outdo himself by staging the equally striking scenes of Chuck in his boat caught in the ravages of a fierce thunderstorm And its a brutal scene of frightening imagery A scene of almost complete darkness illuminated only by flashes of lightning highlighting the tiny speck of Chuck and his boat on the vast ocean But its when we get to the island that Cast Away really opens up Zemeckis direction is clipped and concise He never shows us more than what we need and want to see The film goes through the motions of Chuck s trials and tribulations But there s an almost terrifying immediacy to these scenes Some of them are only about ten seconds in length Little interconnected vignettes Chuck writing HELP in the sand Shouting for help to no one in particular Spending his first night on the island surrounded by the sounds of crashing waves and bird calls Exploring the summit of the island Gathering washed up FedEx packages for supplies Cracking open a coconut something that takes a very very very long time Fishing Sheltering in caves Cutting himself Bleeding And the monumental feeling of ecstasy Chuck feels when he makes a fire for the first time Tom Hanks really turns in one of his finest performances here Certainly his best since Big another film he should have won an Oscar for What makes his performance all the more impressive is its almost in complete silence Which makes his isolation seem even more potent and poignant And a little eerie too Zemeckis also comes up with an unusual method to draw upon Chuck s slowly unravelling mental state A volleyball that washed ashore too A volleyball Chuck names Wilson It becomes like a character in the story Its Chuck s only companion and as he feels affection for this inanimate object you ll find you will too Zemeckis constantly keeps coming up with grander and grander developments None more shocking than when the film flashes forward four years and Chuck is much more lean and hardened by his experiences Tom Hanks deserves some commendation for losing so much weight for the role And his method of escape is clever Building a makeshift raft from timbers and using a portable toilet cover washed ashore as a sail Chuck overcomes crashing waves and turbulent storms in his fragile craft to get home The scene where he loses Wilson is a moment of surprising poignancy Watching him float further and further away Ultimately Chuck is saved But the story doesn t end there Once Chuck is home safe and sound he finds the world has moved on without him Kelly has remarried and Chuck is unsure of his place anymore The ending is bravely not a happy one There is something very bittersweet to Chuck s sudden salvation crashing into harsh reality If you haven t seen Cast Away you re missing out on a modern classic An expertly crafted tale of survival that s enthralling from beginning to end,10.0,25.0,33.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1692591/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2001,Applauding the guts,From time to time a group of people with a lot of guts come forward and challenge something that every average thinking producer would get nightmares to even think about making it Fear of failing must come to mind if the setting says only one actor for 80 min and one dead body 40 min of it basically limited to Hello What s that Albert Miller Over here no BGM no adrenaline injections with savages sharks snakes etc just plain Life is hard enough as it is I loved it for the guts of making it the heartbreaking and real to life love story Tom Hanks performance his companion Wilson great movie must see,9.0,619.0,693.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566047/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2015,Great one-man performance,It s 1995 Chuck Noland Tom Hanks is a FedEx systems analyst troubleshooting around the world He is meticulous about time in his work He comes home to spend the Christmas holidays with his girlfriend Kelly Frears Helen Hunt in Memphis but he s called away Before he leaves he gives Kelly a box with a ring and declares I ll be right back His plane goes off course in the storm and crashes in the Pacific Ocean He gets marooned on a deserted island with some of the packages washing on shore His only companion is a volleyball he names Wilson This is one of the best one man performance ever The story itself isn t as compelling as one assumes It is a lot of wave sounds while Tom Hanks discovers survival techniques through trial and error Wilson is a fascinating invention It s interesting that Robert Zemeckis doesn t insert a voice for him It actually works very well The movie can drag at certain places but Hanks is always a fascinating watch,7.0,14.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3154905/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2008,Tomorrow the sun will rise...,My only major beef I had with this movie was the way it was marketed Thanks to the trailers and previews to the film we knew that Chuck Noland would in fact be rescued from the island However even with that said the previews didn t really spoil the movie Though it would have made the message s that much more powerful if they didn t give that much of it away Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland A FedEx efficiency engineer who flies around the world at a moments notice to troubleshoot whatever problems the company is having at any given place Helen Hunt plays his loving girlfriend fianc Kelly who is very understanding of Chuck Noland s plight One day just before Christmas Chuck is called away to Malaysia This is when Chuck Noland s life takes a sudden and dramatic turn as his plane most realistically crashes into the ocean As the only survivor he washes up on shore of a small isolated island in the south Pacific This is a film that really forces the viewer to relate to the main character On the surface Chuck is not a guy most people would relate to He has a high paying job which he actually seems to enjoy on some level and a girlfriend he is completely in love with His life is as good as it can get up until the tragic plane crash Now his life is turned upside down as he struggles to find the basic needs of survival There are no cuts to the rescue efforts no meanwhile back in Memphis scenes It s all Chuck on the island for the second act of the film There are four basic needs of survival Most people know about the first three Food Water and Shelter Chuck realizes that companionship is really the fourth need which he finds in the form of a vollyball he calls Wilson The acquisition of food water and shelter are all epic struggles for Chuck Noland as we see him try to break open coconuts with rocks and make fire to cook crabs We suffer with him as he does his own dental work This goes on for four years Finally one day a piece of metal from the plane washes up on the island and it gives Chuck an idea of how to escape He builds a raft out of Coconut trees and uses the piece of metal as a sail to escape from the island He spends several days out on the ocean hoping to be rescued Along the way he losses his only friend of the last four years Wilson in a strange but very emotional scene Shortly thereafter on the brink of death from dehydration he is rescued In any other movie this would be the happy ending But this is not any other movie Chuck finds that Kelly has moved on with her life And now he must find a way to move on with his When he first arrived on the island he only needed to find ways to physically survive but now rescued he needed to find ways how to emotionally survive in a world that moved on without him The final scene just before the credits roll reveals the most powerful moral I have ever seen in a movie This is a film that proves that no matter how much suffering pain or tragedy that someone may go through their life will always be worth living And it does so without invoking religion or astrology or any other kind of pseudoscience This is a moral and spiritual film that all people can relate to in some way or another,9.0,27.0,32.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1947887/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2005,An excellent Robinson Crusoe variant,I ve always been intrigued with Daniel Defoe s Robinson Crusoe particularly the importance of the items that Crusoe salvaged from the shipwreck items that Crusoe could not have made himself and which make his survival and the relative elegance of the life he built for himself quite plausible The real life inspiration for Crusoe was one Alexander Selkirk who in 1704 choose to remain on one of the Juan Fernandez islands four hundred miles from the Chilean coast rather than continue on a voyage with a captain and on a ship he did not trust Selkirk was left with bedding a firelock rifle some powder bullets tobacco a hatchet a knife a kettle a Bible his mathematical instruments and some books Selkirk s four years on his own were a bit more austere than Crusoe s fictional life in large measure because of his relatively meager stock of good quality tools Selkirk also lost a lot of his social skills I was interested to see how Cast Away was going to solve the tool issues and how they would deal with a person living on his own for a long period of time The solutions were simply marvelous ice skates volleyball etc Tom Hanks is superb in the role And as a bonus the castaway s return home is a fascinating part of the story The driveway scene between Hanks and Helen Hunt is very powerful and reminds me of the great Emma Thompson Anthony Hopkins book scene from Remains of the Day Highly recommended,9.0,92.0,114.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0998636/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2002,Misunderstood,I simply loved this film but was shocked by the bad reviews that people gave it To this I say to them You seriously misunderstood the meaning of it Although I won t reveal any real details about the meaning because I think that you should try and understand it yourself The movie was terrific and simply breathless the whole time I felt awestruck about how the life of one man could be so changed after an experience that Hanks went through I say that every element of the film was perfect And for those of you who hate Wilson you have to understand about how human he really was to Chuck I was amazed on how well this movie was made and think that everybody should have an experience that should cause you to take stock of your life I was so adamant to get this movie I got it at 8 00 the day it was released I give it an 8 10 Well done Robert,8.0,258.0,337.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566116/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,Tom Hanks or Daniel Day-Lewis,They both have their place and there s room for both These two actors and I ll throw Sean Penn in there are touched by God It s hard to explain but when you see an actor you just know it Feel it My husband and I tend to gravitate toward actors rather than movies and then watch all of their work Tom and Daniel are truly transformational but their acting is always believable and authentic My husband and I don t tend to get emotional at movies but Tom Hanks in Forest Gump Philadelphia this etc Seems to pull those emotional chords for us Sean Penn did the same in Dead Man Walking Day Lewis did that for us in Lincoln Touched by God,9.0,16.0,17.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8601101/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,Loved it,I saw this in the cinema and loved it Essentially a one man band show from Hanks who proves himself up to the challenge with an intense physical performance Great scenery and the addition of Wilson is the icing on the cake,7.0,11.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7360251/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2018,An all-time classic survival tale,If you ever needed proof that one actor can carry and engage the audience through a film for a large portion of its runtime then Cast Away is the film you re seeking as well as being proof also that films can make you genuinely have feelings towards an inanimate object like a volleyball no that s not tears I ve just been cutting onions While it s seeped into pop culture with such grand moments as its Wilson orchestrated farewell the re teaming of Forrest Gump duo Tom Hanks and its director Robert Zemeckis is one of cinema s great largely one man shows and one of the quintessential survival stories of movie history Doubling as an effective romance Zemeckis story of Hanks s FedEx worker Chuck Noland becoming stranded on a deserted Pacific Ocean island after a plane crash driven to survive by the thought of returning to his girlfriend Kelly played by Helen Hunt is one of the director s most restrained even the music cues by Alan Silvestri don t start till over an hour into the film and in command pieces of work that sees the esteemed filmmaker largely hold back on artistic flashes and instead focusing on his leading man Hanks working his magic as the determined Chuck Often tasked with acting alongside nothing more than a few FedEx boxes this really is a film that s not afraid of a liberal dosage of product placement a bunch of coconuts or the aforementioned Wilson the loveable volleyball Hanks delivers one of his best ever turns as Noland and showcases why the esteemed actor has long held a place in many movie goers hearts Garnering tension from trying to start the first flickers of a fire or riding the rough waves of the wild ocean landscape Hanks embodies Chuck in mind body and soul and convinces us this truly is a man battling his mind and the elements to survive Sometimes coasting on his natural charisma and nice guy persona established over a number of years in the public eye both on screen and off it Noland isn t your everyday Hanks character and remains to this day proof that our chocolate box loving A lister is as good as it comes when commanding a feature film Final Say A film that remains a masterpiece even with its various minor flaws Cast Away is an engaging and emotionally powerful tale of the power of the human spirit and our will to survive Lead by what could arguably be a career best turn from Hanks and the impressively restrained hand of Zemeckis Cast Away remains one of the most uplifting survival tales in cinematic history 5 ad hoc dental surgery s out of 5,10.0,8.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4098757/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,"Cast Away shows that we yearn to survive, not for ourselves, but for love.",A classic shipwreck tale that is flipped into a love story This isn t just about surviving a deserted island with limited resources No It s about testing our limitations and capabilities proving that even the faintest of glimpses of humanity still resides within us when all hope is lost A FedEx employee travels on a plane it crashes he is washed ashore on a remote uncivilised island he must survive It sounds formulaic uninteresting and all too familiar Yet the most overlooked director for the past few decades manages to turn the simplest of plots into something much grander in scale Time seems to be stationary for Chuck who is marooned on this island for four years however the rest of civilisation keeps on ticking It doesn t hit you until the last thirty minutes where you suddenly become overwhelmed with emotion You feel for him You ve witnessed him struggle for survival and even contemplate death Only for the rest of the world to forget about him It s a sad truth but a poignant one Chuck befriends a volleyball with a bloody hand print for a face symbolising the need for social interaction But more importantly so that Chuck can shout WILSON which to me is extremely satisfying There is a really profound scene towards the end where Chuck walks around a buffet table looking at prepared crab and a lighter things that we take for granted Utterly resonating So simple yet so powerful Tom Hanks had a physically transformative role although at times was slightly bland Zemeckis direction is the star Easily one of his best directorial efforts Love the camera angles at the beginning where it s conjoined with the FedEx post I did find that the second act starts to lose steam especially when we fast forward four years I feel like some vital and pivotal moments were missed out I wanted more Helen Hunt just because I love her However Cast Away is another strong entry in Zemeckis filmography and a decent acting performance from Hanks,8.0,6.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4075933/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2015,Don't even think of casting away this movie! This harrowing tale of survival deserves to be told.,The movie tells the story of a Fed Ex worker Chuck Noland Tom Hanks whom find himself away from his normal life with his love one Kelly Helen Hunt when his plane crash into the middle of pacific ocean and he washed up on a deserted island Chuck has no choice but to learn how to survive in the harsh environment and find the courage to escape his island dwelling when he s able to Without spoiling too much of the movie the structure of this film is divided into three parts Chuck s life as a FedEx employee the struggle to survive on the island and the resolution with Chuck trying to regain his own life back and living with what has change Each one has this show don t tell modality of storytelling The movie doesn t have that much dialogue which in my opinion works This allows the beautiful yet haunting visuals shots to tell most of the film s story The way the movie opens up with a quick POV montage shot of the package travelling the work show how Chuck Noland s lives life under the punctuality of a running clock The way Director Robert Zemeckis shot the islands film in slow wide screen show how hopeless and isolated Chuck really is where time doesn t really matter anymore I like how the movie moves from a very fast moving shot to shot pace in the beginning to slow near one location standstill The movie has a lot of spiritual aspect of the film that makes this a great watch Lots of symbolism like how the angel wings package serves as a McGuffin It could symbolize an angel watching over him during this whole ordeal or how it shows that he must fly away from the island and return back to normal home Again this could symbolizes how much driven he is at his job It s really up to debate what this item was really about or what s in it Glad they didn t use the deleted scene from the script that actually has Chuck open the box It would had kill the movie for me Another symbol is that of Wilson the volleyball The character was created by screenwriter William Broyles Jr while researching island survival techniques in a beach in Mexico in which this time a volleyball washed up on shore While talking to a volleyball might seem weird on paper it makes a lot of sense as it show how much people are willing to go for a sense of normal connection when isolate from others From a theatrical POV Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue in a one person only situation The movie really does makes a good job to it seem like Wilson could be a person In my opinion he s the most famous inanimate object put on film It was heart breaking what happen to him toward the end Only Tom Hanks can make us feel something for a volleyball and make it seem believably In any lessor actor this might come across as silly or boring This movie is very engaging because of him Tom Hanks is a master of showing great range of emotion with his facial features and the way he moves his body You can tell how much trauma he went through the way he looks at things or how he reacts Not only that Hanks went through great stress to get his body ready for the role Hanks gained 50 pounds during pre production to make him look like a pudgy middle aged man After a majority of the film was shot production was halted for a year so that he could lose the weight and grow his beard He look like he had been living on the island for years This was a very extreme weight lost that might cause a lot of Tom Hank s health problems in later years Hanks even was nominated for Best Actor that year for a Oscar While Helen Hunt isn t in the film much She did a great job as a supporting role You really can tell the struggle she has with trying to love Chuck while also trying to move on The film gives fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone It s somewhat educational I like how the movie begins and ends at crossroads Two possible paths to an unknown future It s all very symbolic This movie has a lot of replay value There are tons of little clever things that change into the timelines of the movie you can only pick up on if you watch it a few times such as how Chuck wears his shoes during airplane flights the irony of the dentist that cause him so much pain or the name of the ranch where the angel wing package came from Then there are those slight things that foreshadow a lot of what will happen later on the film such as seeing Chuck s sailing certification or the off comment mention of a tooth ache or the song Return to Sender playing the background While the movie doesn t have that much music Alan Silvestri s minimal score was beautiful to listen to and good enough to win a Grammy Award in 2002 I like how he use nature sound effects to reinforce the feeling of isolation with his music The weird product placement didn t really hurt the film This film features a Fed Ex cargo plane crashing in the Pacific Ocean but it didn t hurt the company as the film s success ensured help increased brand awareness One thing that kinda did hurt the film is the trailer that really did spoiled too much Seriously Don t watch the trailer until you ve seen the film I like how the film later helped developed the show Lost Overall A great movie that showcase the triumph of the human spirit under harsh conditions It s brutal haunting and painful yet compelling enigmatic uplifting This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again,8.0,11.0,15.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3195598/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2007,a masterpiece for hanks and zemeckis,it s not my first time to see this movie but it s been a long time since i last saw it so i found myself this time pondering over the high spiritual meanings in this zemeckis masterpiece and decided to share my thoughts with you the idea that obsessed me after watching the movie is the spiritual aspect versus the physical one i e spiritual loneliness versus physical real one the movie is inspired by Daniel Defoe s robinson Crusoe where the hero goes through a tough spiritual trial on an isolated island for 20 years an experience which embodies the maxim of necessity is the mother of invention tom hanks is an employee at Fed Ex he goes on a business trip to deliver some parcels unfortunately the plane crashes he miraculously survives but is thrown on an isolated island for four years on the island he begins to search for every means to survive both spiritual and physical death he manages to make a house a fishing net to light fire and finally make a boat that would take to the middle of the sea where he can find rescue but the movie can t just be summarized in those few words it is the battle of man against the wildness of nature and the harshness of isolation furthermore it is man s journey inside himself the hero discovered his abilities and re figured his true self when he was stuck in a situation where he can t find any hand he was a strong person who didn t give up to the difficulties surrounding him everywhere he rather managed to maintain hope even if it is fake find himself a source of consolation to overcome his loneliness and fill this void emptiness vacuum etc he thus invented the character of wilson kept communicating with the picture of his beloved i think otherwise he would have gone mad when hanks goes back to his comfortable civil life and joins his old community i felt that may be he is more lonely than he was on the island then come the final scene to confirm my feelings he is standing all alone at a crossroad not knowing which direction to follow or who to go to Robert zemeckis did an excellent job in this unique movie the shot sizes the camera movement the transitions every visual element in the picture was perfect the cinematography was also great especially the water scenes the lighting was so convenient for the setting of the events on the other side tom hanks controlled this movie from the beginning to the end though he scarcely spoke throughout the movie his performance was outstanding in addition to the physical effort he exerted in many scenes it was very intelligent to make him lose a lot of weight since he stayed four years on the island eating only crabs and coconuts i remember the scene when hanks kept switching the lighter on and off several times after he came home which sharply contrasts with the suffering he has gone through to light fire on the island as for the final scene between Helen hunt and hanks i found hunt so cold just didn t like her to cut it short the movie was a masterpiece,0.0,45.0,57.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1701381/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2010,Hanks Pulls Off What Not Just Any Actor Could,I remember being fairly dismissive about Cast Away upon its initial release before I d seen it I wasn t thrilled with the direction Robert Zemeckis had gone as a director Forrest Gump anyone and I was just about Tom Hanks ed out by the time he made this But then I saw it and found myself impressed by both the direction and more notably by Hanks performance The difficulty of that performance should not be underestimated Hanks plays a man stranded on a desert island and spends the vast majority of time alone on screen Even if there are better actors than Hanks out there it takes a certain kind of screen presence to pull that off and Hanks has it His Academy Award nomination was richly deserved Grade A,8.0,5.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2278537/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2019,The ultimate survivor,Literally from the moment when humans began traveling the seas and oceans out of the sight of land there have been tales of people being shipwrecked and marooned Sometimes it is small groups of people on an uninhabited island other times there are natives on the island and in a few cases it is one person all alone Different and more expanded versions of this story arose in science fiction after interplanetary travel became plausible The recent hit movie The Martian is the best known example of the lone person marooned This movie is one where a single person somehow manages to survive a destructive plane crash and wash up on the beach of an uninhabited tropical island Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Nolan an engineer with FedEx that is a hard driving yet somewhat personable individual He is flying as a passenger in a company cargo jet when they encounter a violent storm and there is an onboard explosion of some kind Once on the island Nolan needs to immediately satisfy his basic needs of food water and shelter He struggles to get a fire going open a coconut and other basic tasks with no modern tools Fortunately a few packages from the plane wash up on the beach and he finds some useful items in them After four years he realizes that if he does not leave the island he will die there alone and largely forgotten This movie is nearly all Tom Hanks and he does a superb job of playing the increasingly eccentric exile in an odd form of solitary confinement In order to keep himself sane he must go a little insane inventing a semi imaginary companion to talk to It is a worthy addition to the story of how humans can adapt in the most strenuous of circumstances and with no hope of any assistance,10.0,10.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5238519/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2015,Counteracting Loneliness,So much has been written about the performance of Tom Hanks He is so convincing that for a while I actually thought this had happened to him This is a story of loneliness The Robinson Crusoe aspect is slowly developed as Hanks employs what knowledge he has to do the rudimentary things that are required to survive Crusoe has Friday Hanks has Wilson The despair that develops as one begins to realize that he may die never seeing another human being or experiencing some tenderness is so disturbing When Hanks walks around arms in the air announcing to the world that he has made fire it s a primitive conquest that seems so grand yet so minuscule The final scene in the film is so gut wrenching No man is an island but a part of a greater universe I m not speaking from a religious foundation but that which is within us,9.0,6.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3163358/?ref_=tt_urv

21 May 2013,Definitely a favourite,Cast Away stars Tom Hanks and more importantly a very special volleyball a k a my beloved Wilson I love this movie because it s dramatic and inspiring but also because it s not utterly swamped down with swells of dramatic music In fact the whole time Hanks s character is on the island there is no music and this actually has a profound and unique effect Don t get me wrong I love a good soundtrack but sometimes I think that there is definite overkill with music in scenes that don t necessarily need it I loved seeing the slow forced transformation of Hanks s character throughout the movie He went from sort of chubby overworked and neglectful of his health to this hardened survivor with a huge bushy beard He even has to knock his own abscessed tooth out on his own when back home he had the opportunity to go to the dentist and have painkillers and do it the easy way The only spot where some people feel this movie fell down was the ending where Hanks s character makes it back to the US and his true love But to be honest I think the ending was great I don t believe it was an overdone Hollywood ending and it also gave me hope for Hanks s character s future It helps that he didn t get back with his love because she had moved on with a family of her own I actually found it quite wrenching All in all I think this is a really well done movie And I still love Wilson,9.0,8.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2800496/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2002,Take The Time For It...,Cast Away is one of the better movies Hollywood released in the last couple of years However reading some of the comments posted here by other people it looks like not everyone here got it This movie in the most part is aboult desolation and what it does to a person So in order to appreciate this story take the time to watch it Sit down and relax unplug the phone and other irritations A lot of people have said how good of an actor Tom Hanks was in this piece and he really was Others have said how good Bob Zemeckis s direction was and it is But what stands out for me so much is Bill Broyles script It is very clever and wraps up all storylines neatly without getting to preachy A very very sound and quality script that unfortunatly cannot be appreciated by everone SPOILERS PS Some asked earlier what the point was of the package delivered in Russia It s from the woman Tom Hanks delivers the final package to And why does Tom Hanks keep one package closed Because it becomes his goal in life To deliver that package Not because the package is so important but to motivate him to keep breathing just as Wilson is substitute for his concious and gut,10.0,7.0,8.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566081/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2017,Utilizes Multiple Genres And Nails Them All,In 1985 director Rob Zemeckis created perhaps the most genre diverse film of all time with Back To The Future Fifteen years later he came close to duplicating that extraordinary feat with Cast Away an incredibly diverse movie in its own right For a basic plot summary Cast Away tells the story of Chuck Noland Tom Hanks a FedEx worker who goes down over the Pacific in an airplane washes ashore a deserted island and must fend for himself in the harsh terrain and conditions The key to this film is its ability to combine such genres as action adventure disaster comedy and drama and most importantly make them all mesh together and work on the big screen All the pieces come together nicely to form a moving exciting always moving I never quite understand why some people consider it slow plot character development What really makes this movie a classic however is that it is a human interest flick at heart The mental physical struggle of Chuck is at center stage here and the acting from Hanks is impeccable as usual he can play anything It speaks volumes that within 90 minutes you may be expressing emotion towards a man s relationship with a volleyball Overall I wish more movies would be produced like Cast Away It has a little something for everyone Though many film fans consider Forrest Gump to be Hanks crowning achievement I personally enjoy this effort tenfold as here the multiple themes actually converge to form a coherent dramatic narrative in the end All in all a great film that can be watched multiple times to catch the subtle nuances and character growth,10.0,6.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3659482/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2009,We live and we die by time. And we must not commit the sin of losing our track on time.,Jetting off on yet another important task FedEx whizzer Chuck Noland leaves his girlfriend Kelly Frears Helen Hunt behind just before Christmas Disaster strikes during the flight and the plane crashes into the ocean Managing to free himself from the sinking jet Noland is washed up on an uninhabited island Without basic modern comforts and fighting solitude daily Noland must live in hope that one day he might be saved before he loses his mind or the will to live Tom Hanks Noland re teams with director Robert Zemeckis after their hugely successful collaboration on 1994 awards stealer Forrest Gump Though Cast Away didn t win any awards the usual cry of it being Oscar bait had preceded it it can be argued to be Hanks best performance Few actors in the modern era could carry the film the way that Hanks does Beguiling and drawing us into his loneliness Hanks with minimal dialogue his only company being a volleyball that washed up with a few other FedEx parcels excels with facial and bodily acting Zemeckis who should be applauded for the middle section and the terrifying plane crash that precedes it puts Hanks Noland through the mangler The convenience of said parcels washing ashore aside Noland is bumped bruised and dentally challenged the Robinson Crusoe clich s exist of course but Zemeckis and a heartfelt Hanks put us there on the island as well with a pat on the back due for the excellent work by the sound department I might add Sadly Cast Away is bookended by not so great work The opening character introductions are unremarkable but just about good enough for the plot set up but the ending lacks emotional punch and defies what has been built up Things aren t helped by Helen Hunt s lack of chemistry with Hanks but that in turn is not helped by the writing from William Broyles Jr since it s only really now that it s Noland that we care about It s a bit churlish to complain too much though because Zemeckis kept us on the island with Chuck there was no cutting back to grieving family or fruitless rescue attempts With that it was a truly fine one man show even if that is something that ultimately renders the ending something of a let down 7 5 10,8.0,9.0,14.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2131715/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2006,"A Tom Hanks vehicle with Hanksisms, Hanky writing, Hanky melodrama",Tom Hanks stars as time obsessed FedEx executive Chuck Noland who literally lives by the clock even when spending time with his girlfriend Helen Hunt during the holidays On Christmas Eve his beeper calls him to catch a last minute FedEx flight to Malasya for official business and he waves I ll be right back before he boards Then his plane crashes in the Pacific and Chuck is indefinitely marooned on a desert island with only a volleyball as his company I have huge affection for desert island premises and subscribe to the thinking that whatever you do with the execution it will still be a wonderful experience It simply cannot go wrong It does not go wrong in Cast Away either although I would have loved to see more exploration of the lush island jungle in fact its island sequences are all golden The only problem this film has is the lachrymose final act in which Hanks fades and director Zemeckis pulls up the directing chair and starts pouring in relations melodrama to sew things together Everything up until this rote lukewarm point is well crafted with patient strokes courtesy of the film s protagonist Tom Hanks who put forward the idea for the film to Forrest Gump pal Zemeckis is in nearly every scene and carries so much dramatic weight effortless leading man appeal and sympathy laden charisma that he sucks you in entirely Initially I applied some skepticism to judging his businessman character and it was not until the vivid epileptic plane crash sequence that he started to absorb me As the airplane was sinking into the deep blue with Chuck trapped inside I can t imagine anything more frightening you knew judging by how much you were pulling for him that he was our hero This is man vs nature at its best Upon waking up on the beach of the stormy desert island Chuck is faced with some of the weapons mother nature has in her arsenal you can feel the energy being slowly drained out of him during the first couple of days as he struggles to crack coconuts find water build shelter make fire catch fish and tend to his wounds Insanity sweeps across the shore and Hanks aptly embodies the hard edged blood spilled sweat dripping tear shedding transformation of a time driven businessman to a primitive instinct driven maroon It is eerily crafted with an harmonic silence and sans your dutiful MacGyveresque inventions scaffolds or nifty tools Here is a mere man seen through epic aerial shots and with underlying subtitles that spell out desperation and loneliness both of which Hanks assuredly and crisply exemplifies So then what is really wrong with Cast Away Nothing aside from marginal missteps is wrong with the cast away part it s the ending that that is not in tune once Zemeckis wields his clear cut spelled out and moralist trademarks I refuse to spoil anything mostly because I remember the film having been spoiled to me long before I sat down to watch it just rest assured you will be begging to be taken back to the exciting island 7 out of 10,7.0,39.0,72.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1545982/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2010,Hanks shines,For some cast away will be boring and tedious For the majority of the film we watch Hanks as Chuck fighting the odds to live another day and to one day hopefully make it back home It all takes part on a inhabited isolated island There not a lot to do except catch fish and smash open coconuts But the film is not about surviving the harsh surrounding but instead about being mentally strong fighting self physically problems and living for hope I can t see anyone else but Tom hanks playing Chuck He has the likability factor and most importantly he can act he puts in all his effort for this performance He has to carry the whole film as he the only living talking thing on that island He has to pull the audience in make us care enough to wish and hope that he makes it off the island and thankfully Hanks didn t let us down There no over the top obstacles he has to overcome physically The biggest one is sorting out his infected tooth Hanks biggest challenge was acting next to a volleyball named Wilson The scenes in which he speaks to him could of came off as silly but Hanks is so brilliant that he makes us end up caring for Wilson us much as he does Overall I suggest everyone to watch this film,8.0,7.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2279405/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2008,a very strong performance in a very strong film,The idea of a drama about a lone person being stranded on an island has always fascinated me as a moviegoer In real life there have been many castaways such as the Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk who spent half a decade alone on a tiny island off the coast of South America when he was confident that his ship under deplorable conditions would not make it back to port Selkirk was probably the basis for this movie Cast Away No it s not a true story but it s manufactured so well that if somebody was to tell you that it was based on an autobiography you would probably believe it Cast Away stars Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland a busybody FedEx executive who s all about time who soon discovers he has all the time in the world when his plane crashes into the ocean and he alone finds himself on a deserted island where he ekes on the barest living possible He improvises his own shelter tools companions and accepts the fact that help may never arrive and if it ever does it may be too late for him This is an exceedingly wonderful movie Not only is Tom Hanks the quintessential choice to play a castaway but he does his performance so well that you quickly forget that you re spending most of your time looking at a superstar instead of a character And you have to admire Hanks for his nerve to play such a character When he first arrives on the island Hanks is a tad bit obese cleanly shave and perhaps a bit unsightly When we effectively cut to a scene that takes place four years after his marooning on the island he s a gaunt scrawny survivalist with shrunken muscles exposed ribs and a hardly recognizable face through all of the beard and overgrown hair In order to achieve this production was shut down on the film for a whole year so that Hanks could lose a tremendous amount of weight and fit the description mentioned in the script Now you have to admire an actor for such an undertaking Cast Away was nominated for two Academy Awards after its release at the dawn of the century One was for Hanks himself the other was for the sound design and the sound next to Hanks is the most important element in the movie The film clocks at two and a half hours in length and it s not until about seventy five percent of the way through that we even so much as hear a click of music The soundtrack is taken up by amplified sounds that heighten the feeling of a lonely place The crashing of the waves the howl of the wind the grinding of wood against wood as Tom Hanks vainly tries to build a fire the list goes on Without such incredible sound design I don t think the island scenes of Cast Away would have been half as effective And it s because of these two important elements that the movie stays interesting rather than bogging down as one might expect I mean after all you re spending a long time just watching a lone man struggle to survive on an island And it s not like he s doing anything incredible like wrestling with savage beasts or running from cannibals or anything like that Just an average everyday man just worrying about whether or not he s going to live long enough to see home again Before I conclude my review I want to give just one warning It has nothing to do with the film itself it has to do with the advertisements I saw the movie before I saw the trailers or the ads And good thing I did because I soon found out that the ads spoiled the movie from beginning to end in just a few minutes ruining any feeling of question or the height of our expectations and thus spoiling the integrity of the film In short see the movie then watch the trailers if you want As for the film itself it gets an enormous amount of recommendation from me,10.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1989930/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2001,Life's a beach,Chuck Noland is a man who lives by the clock Working for Federal Express he accounts for every second of his life and lives for efficiency His Xmas 1995 dinner is interrupted when work calls him away to supervise a flight to Malaysia He promises his girlfriend Kelly that he ll be right back He doesn t realize he s making a promise he can t keep While passing over the Pacific his plane enters a storm and ditches into the ocean very violently Chuck is the only survivor of the flight and manages to escape into the water with a life raft but loses the radio transmitter in the process When morning breaks he discovers that he has washed up on an uninhabited island Rescue does not come and Chuck must figure out how to survive while torturing himself with memories of Kelly In an annoying cop out the film then jumps to Four Years Later where Chuck has reverted to a cave man appearance He s not a happy man but his outlook changes when a steel section of a port a john washes up on the beach Using a analemma he has etched onto a cave wall Chuck is STILL keeping track of time and plans an escape from the island using the sheet of steel as a sail for his rickety raft to freedom Cast Away not Castaway has lovely sound design and photography why Zemeckis chose to shoot it in 1 85 1 is rather odd though as many shots seem uncomfortably tight and really immerses you in the threatening silence of the island It actually reminds me a lot of the video game Myst in that respect But the film is book ended by boredom The only part I ever really watch is the middle section on the island Skipping over Chuck s 4 year transformation from mailman to caveman was bad enough but once he eventually makes his escape from the island the movie skips over the 4 weeks of his reintroduction to society which is yet another cop out Zemeckis attempts far too much ambiguity with Cast Away It s usually a sign of a writer director attempting to cover up failings with mystery but Cast Away is a better script than that and it comes across as just being pretentious The middle section of the film is intriguing The non island scenes haven t got a leg to stand on,7.0,13.0,24.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565651/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2006,"Okay, But Nowhere Near The Hype",I remember all the hype this film got prior to its release Myself I was disappointed in it but on a second look with lower expectations it was much better The DVD picture was outstanding razor sharp and was much more enjoyable to view than at the theater I remember a comment or two at church when this film came out about how it was disappointing that God was never mentioned by Tom Hanks character in this movie that anyone in his predicament stranded on a island for years by himself would be talking or even yelling at God or praying at one point Nonethelesss Hanks and Hollywood are rarely shown needing or asking help from The Almighty so they show long scenes of him in his Robinson Crusoe mode talking to a painted volleyball friend instead That story however of Hanks and his island adventures is much better than the beginning and endings with Helen Hunt who almost does the wrong thing but thankfully does not I found that last 20 minute scene uncomfortable but maybe we were supposed to feel that way I just thought they could have come up with a better conclusion post rescue Anyway most movies in which Hanks stars pretty good and this is no exception It s certainly worth a look on DVD,6.0,27.0,60.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1352174/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2008,"""Cast Away"" - The Story Of A Wayward, Marooned Man",Believe it or not until last night I had never seen this movie I d seen snippett s of it on The Oscars and other places but I just hadn t seen it I made one attempt about 2 years ago checking the movie out of library but the copy had been grossly damaged Finally though my brother stopped by with his copy and we watched it He s seen it several times My overall impression after watching it was Wow what an amazing story The story of a man who has little time for his very understanding wife who obviously loves him like crazy Who takes off just before Christmas of 1995 on doomed flight that will alter his life forever The scene of the mayhem that ensues in side of the plane was very well done as were the scenes of Hanks character surviving the angry seas Finally he arrives safely to a deserted island Where for the next 1500 days his will to live is put to the test He finds food makes shelter works like a caveman to create fire and basically just learns the art of true survival All the while the only other thing keeping him going is the antique pocket watch given to him by his wife before he boarded the plane Her picture in the watch gives him hope that he ll return to her someday soon After 4 years pass he s still surviving but his mind has drifted into a state of altered reality He s taken to painting a face on a soccer ball with his own blood and nameing it Wilson as it says on the ball Wilson becomes his best friend Finally and quite amazingly near the end of this another piece of the plane washes up on shore and he uses it as a sail for a raft he builds It s actually a credit to Hanks acting when Wilson falls overboard into the ocean and floats away Hanks actually makes us feel his loss for this imaginary friend Upon being rescued and getting home he discovers his wife and friends gave up on his return Se s remarried with children and his friend informs him that they had a funeral and wake for him His now ex wife realizes she shouldn t have listened to her friends family who said she should just let him go Which gives us a slightly hollywood scene of her calling to him chasing after him in the rain as he s driving off They still love each other but the damage is done With the life he knew gone he s now at a complete loss as to what he s supposed to do with it now The ending really doesn t provide a clear cut answer but merely hints at it I can only guess the question to ask by the ending is What would I do if all this happened to me I give ten stars because the movie is simply that engaging moving even a bit suspenseful if you ve never seen it The scenery is breathtaking as well and the whole movie is worth the time to watch END,10.0,4.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1879702/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2013,Remarkable and a story that everyone would want to hear about,Castaway is one of those classic movies that everyone must see The plot is uncommon and it was very interesting Tom Hanks played a great role as Chuck Noland The fact that he had to face and understand the difference between life in the real world and living in an island with nobody else but a ball named Wilson made the movie remarkable Every second is mesmerizing and really made me wonder how scary and difficult it is if I were in Noland s position This movie also contained love that played a main role to Noland s survival which makes the audience to feel not as desperate to watch Noland getting lost with the power of love that brought him hope Also the transition of time as Noland lived his different life being an outcast was really interesting Not only by appearance but also mental and behavior It s a classic the everyone must watch Tom Hanks played it really well It also made me question his future fate as the movie goes on telling about his journey and survival day by day A very well done movie it s definitely a story that everyone wants to hear about,9.0,9.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2875541/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2002,A kind of modern Robinson Crusoe,Tom Hanks once again performed very well his acting in this film He certainly showed how difficult is the life for humans in areas where the so called civilization did not yet arrive At this point one should recall all what was taught at primary school to get fire to feed himself to sleep and to protect from rain and wind He could not find any black Friday man as Crusoe did instead he prepared a ball called Wilson as his only companion Very strange that in that tropical island there were no mosquitoes or any other insects at least he was not bothered by this problem and the whale he found in the sea was really very nice funny to see this sequence What happened to his wife who thought he died may also happen to many other wives of soldiers going to war In fact she is still in love of his first man and she married just to forget about him but not because she was really completely in love of the new husband,8.0,7.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566169/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2001,Much Ado About Nothing...,Before seeing the result of a new cooperation between Hanks and Zemeckis I read lots of reviews and praises about this film My opinion is It is the ordinary Hollywood mainstream movie targeted at the average America s audience by the way in Europe this movie did not score at all The first let s meet our hero part is just terrible The worst part is about the FedEx guy s visit to Moscow Hey Mr Zemeckis it is year 2001 now and you show Russia as it is 20 or 30 years ago The most ridiculous thing is a lorry stuck in the middle of the Red Square as far as know there s no traffic there and Tom Hanks the savior of under developed Russians paying his employees with bars of Mars and cans of Coke Hey this is nominee number 1 for the worst movie of the year Then we see Helen Hunt with another non convincing performance this year I think her popularity this year is a big mistake of the studios casting She tries without success to show at least some emotions towards her husband played by Hanks But it seems like Ms Hunt read her script just before shooting somewhere in between her other numerous movies because her acting is not convincing at all Then we are supposed to be stunned by crash scene after which the one actor show begins I do not think that Tom Hanks is a bad actor but his level is not high enough to carry the weight if mega million dollars movie alone For sure this part of the film contains lots of stereotypes about a la Robinson situations For almost one hour we see how Mr Hanks learns to make a fire to open the coconut shells etc etc In fact Discovery Channel would do this part of the movie in a better way Then our hero fights with the ocean loosing his companion Willson ball which was supposed to be a very touching scene Then our hero is happily home being saved in the middle of the ocean His wife is already married and here it s better to stop the movie but the director uses the audience s patience for another half hour posing some moral questions finally if it is good to ruin new family of his ex wife Overall the movie is boring with exception of some moments 10 of the movie or so After leaving the theater I just felt like I left an American style fast food feeling lots of food in my stomach but being unable to recall the taste of food Same here expensive movie longer than 2 hours with nothing to recall in couple weeks Indeed this year was not good for Hollywood,6.0,6.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565805/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2009,All You Need is Hanks.,I once stated that due to Tom Hanks being such a great actor that a film could be made with him being the only character and it would still be great This film prooves that theory Hanks stars as a fedex worker named Chuck He gets stranded on an island and must survive there the only possessions he has with him are a few fed ex boxes This is a great survival film Stranded on an island with no help makes for a great conflict that someone can relate to as it could happen to anybody Tom Hanks is phenomenal in this film He really plays a man stranded on an island well Shows all of the emotions needed fear panic excitement anger and determination I never thought that anyone could make a volleyball seem like a person but this film did that thanks to Hanks great acting THis really could be his best performance but he has so many and I think it is safe to say that he is one of the greatest actors who ever lived Zemeckis deserves a lot of credit too THis film obviously had great directing and Zemeckis is a really under rated director in my opinion Everything seemed perfectly right in this film Great conflict and legendary acting Highly recommended and easily one of Tom Hanks s best films and that says a lot,10.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2059858/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2001,One Tediously Super Long FedEx Commercial!,If you must see this rent it better yet wait until it comes to HBO or Showtime and save yourself the money It goes on and on and on for no apparent reason If I saw the FedEx logo one more time during this ridiculous exploitation I felt I was going to scream or at least run from the theatre Why should I have to pay the same price to see a tediously super long commercial as I do a quality piece of work It just doesn t seem right FedEx obviously subsidized the film they should have subsidized my ticket And P S Helen Hunt Stunk in this film,5.0,6.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565836/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2011,"In my opinion, the best movie ever made.",This is the movie that defines perfect Every way I look at it it s amazing Now if you don t think this movie is perfect erase all of the thoughts you had about this movie before reading this or else you ll probably disagree with many of the things I say This is my favourite film of all time I love Tom Hanks I love the location I love the story I love the camera work I love every aspect I ll start off with Tom Hanks himself Well he sure says a lot without saying much The emotions on his face are unbelievable realistic Every breakdown Hank s character has seems real He can also make the audience emotionally invested in a volleyball now THAT S good acting The camera work is astounding There are many shots that last much longer than the average take in a movie At first they annoyed me but now I love them The pans that can take a minute long really add to the realism and just lets you take in the situation the main character is in The effects are pretty good too sometimes the porta potty sail looks kinda iffy but for the most part it s solid Zemeckis nailed it with how this film was put together and the camera crew did amazing too The story comes off outlandish but in the end seems realistic I found that the chances of Noland actually surviving a plane crash and then stumbling upon an unoccupied island slim to none But hey at least it s not like Lost where not only to they crash onto an island but like 20 or so people survive I absolutely adore the ending It shows that the movie will take risks and that it s willing to vary from the crowd Some people might say this movie is depressing but for me it s a perfect balance We see a whole bunch of sad and dramatic stuff so when the happy funny moments come around it makes them all the more enjoyable Finally I will put all the stupid complaints to rest A feature length FedEx commercial Ya right Regardless if Zemeckis made a deal with FedEx or not it makes the movie even more realistic A real company makes it seem like it really happened or really could happen Not to mention why does it bug everyone so much I didn t even notice how many times the name appears until I read someone complaining about it online The next thing is the runtime I ll admit this movie is a bit long and is not very convenient When i saw this for the first time it bugged me how long the events went on after Chuck is rescued but now it makes sense to me More story needed to be told This wasn t just a survival movie It s supposed to be more than that A character study as we look at the lengths someone will go to stay alive and the effects that being taken away from civilization for a long time can have on a person and the people around him And for everything else you don t like Tom Hanks or the story that s really just personal preference and I probably won t change your mind on that Well I think Cast Away will always be my favourite movie and for me It s a dream come true My favourite director and my favourite actor come together to make a masterpiece It s Zemeckis best movie Forrest Gump is a close second and Zemeckis has mastered the art of telling a good story But can you please stop with all those CGI movies It was cool at first but now it s getting old Oh well we ve still got his early work one of the best films ever made and my favourite film of all time Cast Away 10 10,10.0,7.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2422870/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,one man show that delivers,Cast Away is a movie that captures the spirit of one character facing the challenges of nature better than any Jack London story The enormous risk in making this movie was that it relies more than any other film I have ever seen completely on the talent of its star and realistically I don t see how anyone other than Tom Hanks could have made this work And work it does Hanks did a lot more than lose 50 pounds to make this a convincing performance he reached the very core of the transformation from a human surviving in the information age to one that must survive on primal animal instinct He is so convincing that when he loses a completely inanimate object a volleyball his only companion throughout the mid section of the movie he moves the audience almost to tears There are a few other characters in the movie and the supporting performances are well done for what they are worth but this is Hanks s show from start to finish 8 out of 10 stars,8.0,7.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565485/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2002,Cure for Insomnia,Way too long is the first thing that comes to mind If you re going to have a one person movie no matter what else you do don t let that person be annoying and boy oh boy does Tom Hanks annoy me From a logistic point of view I find it incredible he could live that long It seems impossible but then again if he died there wouldn t be much of an ending and what s shocking about that Even when he gets back home HE S STILL BORING He s just not a fun guy I felt sorry for the volleyball and was glad when he escaped I would have done a lot to get away from Gilligan sorry I mean Tom Seriously there was good cinematography The island probably would have been paradise if the population were more agreeable Now I can see why Russell Crowe won Best Actor for Gladiator Having seen all the nominees except Geoffrey Rush I can honestly say the Academy made a right choice for a change,3.0,8.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566082/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2013,One-of-a-kind type of film,I went to see Cast Away in the theater during Christmas 2000 because I have a taste for stranded on deserted island movies like Mysterious Island 1961 but was somewhat disappointed Why Possibly because of the fact that Tom Hanks character in the film Chuck Noland is stuck on an island all by his lonesome and the island is very small As such there s zero social interaction except with a soccer ball that chuck names Wilson and there s very little exploration of the island because it s so small On top of this the ending is odd and somewhat ambiguous Despite this Cast Away was a surprise hit at the box office Viewing it a second time I was braced for its uniqueness and got more out of it but there s still a lot of downtime or empty stretches as Chuck tries to survive for over four years on the island and then faces a completely new life and perspective in the closing act So don t expect a lot of action or high adventure this is a drama about the mundaneness of being stuck on a deserted island and how it positively or negatively affects you There are only a couple of thrilling scenes like the excellent plane crash As noted above the film respects the intelligence of the viewer by not spelling everything out but the answers are there for anyone who takes the time to reflect on the events and clues Some questions the film might provoke How exactly does a certain Fed Ex package save Chuck s life Where s God in all of this The Texas ranch at the beginning belongs to Dick and Bettina but at the end to just Bettina what does this mean Why the angel symbol of all things Where does Chuck decide to go at the end Like I said Cast Away is a one of a kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it But when you are it s very satisfying and even enlightening The film runs 143 minutes GRADE B C,6.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2884880/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2003,Too manipulative for it's own good.,Cast Away is a less than average film overall and it certainly is nowhere near as good as it set out to be There are only two stars in the film that are noticed Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt Tom Hanks does fairly well and you can see that he has prepared for the role but you can also see that he s not very happy with the material he s been given Helen Hunt doesn t get enough screen time given the plot of the film She is convincing as usual as a loving housewife but only has one scene in the movie in which she jumps off the screen Cast Away blatantly shouts out Give me an Oscar The material sets out to be gripping and humane but I found it to be hollow on the inside and some of the scenes were unintentionally hilarious Come on one man s friendship with his football At 145 minutes Castaway is overlong and surprisingly little is covered in that space of time The film ends on a question mark and suddenly stops without any satisfying conclusion Most people including myself would probably feel cheated out of our money instead of engaged and satisfied Only the most sentimentally minded audiences wouldn t fall for such blatant manipulation,0.0,5.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566234/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2007,Hanks can't go wrong,Before there was Lost and before there was Survivor there was Cast Away Cast Away is Giligan s Island if Giligan were the only one on it and if he were Tom Hanks There was a t v show in the late 80 s to early 90 s called Parker Lewis Can t Lose They should have called it Tom Hanks Can t Lose because he is doing everything right If Tom Hanks popularity wasn t already astronomical enough he just served to increase it with his role in this movie How good of an actor must you be to have nearly an entire movie in which you are the sole focus He was not the focus of several other characters he was the focus because he was the only character This movie as simple as it was was brilliant Hanks did a great job as did the writers and director Very few movies have mirrored the feat that Cast Away accomplished,8.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1690786/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2010,Life on a deserted island most certainly not a good time.,This film was interesting however not as good as I was expecting The film about what amounts to a delivery man in a plane crash and stuck on a desert island for a while is rather good I just did not care for the run time after he is rescued as I thought it went on a bit to long after he was rescued I went to the movie to see a man on an island and how he copes I did not really want to see how his former wife could not wait a bit longer before she remarried seriously a guy would be expected to wait twice as long before anyone pushed them to marry someone else I am betting the female here started getting prodded to get married again about two weeks after his disappearance The story on the island was good though the volleyball was a bit lame I realize I am rather antisocial so the lack of people would not affect me as much as it would someone who loves people but I still do not see talking to a volleyball as something that is going to be helpful I liked the way at the start of his island life he kept getting hurt and had trouble eating and such and then it flashed forward and he is spearing fish and eating them raw His escape plan is both brilliant and reckless at the same time This film could have been really special had they cut a bit of time off the run time and got rid of the annoying wife,7.0,4.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2267629/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2018,Awe Inspiring!!!,I watched this film years ago and the imagery is seared into my memory The movie is pretty long but worth every minute Hanks transforms his body in this film to match the situation of his role It is very challenging for a single person to keep an audience engaged over the duration of the majority of a film especially a long one Hanks pulled it off and he makes it seem so effortless Hanks carried this film on his back up a mountain through a blizzard while being struck by lightening That is just how awesome he is in this film The writing is flawless The location is perfect You gotta love the other star in this film Wilson Wilson had attitude and played his role well Wilson took no guff and gave as good as he got Bravo Hanks acting was so on the mark throughout this film even if you didn t speak English and subtitles were not available you d still get the gist of every scene because Hanks was just that good,9.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4267251/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2009,Interesting Film!,Cast Away is not a bad movie as some of the negative reviews say This is certainly not an ad for Fed Ex What this movie is is a serious piece of art by acclaimed film maker Robert Zemeckis that stars Tom Hanks This film is about Fed Ex worker Chuck who gets stranded on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean That happens because his airplane crashed Now Chuck has to outwit nature in order to survive and come back home The acting is great The only two well known actors are Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt Hanks did a phenomenal job I will admit that some things are incredulous and boring at the least Some parts are slow especially during the island scenes The scenes with the volleyball made me think What the heck The thing that gets this movie to work is the odds of surviving on a remote island no one have ever heard of Overall this is a basic survival film I rate this film 8 10,8.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2047391/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2014,I don't have words,Maybe I was never going to watch this movie my brother had downloaded this movie I was just checking hard where I found this movie asked my friend about it he said it s a good movie I asked who is hero he replied Tom hanks I decided to watch the movie When I started watching this movie it seemed quiet funny I was smiling laughing but I ended up crying I watched same kind movie that guy was also alone w his boat in the end he gave up himself but he saw a torch light searching him when he was drowning in depth of sea like it 127 hours was also good But this movie gives you lesson at the end time of movie that volleyball when left him he was crying I cried too I love tom hanks his acting is superb wonder why this movie didn t win Oscar why why why The love to his wife was it was awesome when you love someone only in that case you d be able to understand what lesson this movie is giving you 10 10 my eyes are hurting because I cried so much after so many days,10.0,8.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2982570/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2013,Must see survival film,A film that would be nothing without a powerhouse actor like Tom Hanks Let s see this is a film where a single man gets stranded on a deserted island and most of the film s running time is nothing but him talking with himself No big emotional speeches barely no action no real climax the movie kind of just ends on a mystery but in a good way and very little dialogue compared to other recent movies And it pulls it off if only barely in certain parts Tom Hanks is the saving grace of this film He is charismatic enough to fill the screen with his presence and is able to convey a lot of themes and emotions without talking which makes the movie enjoyable to watch Still the deserted island part of this film is its weakest I enjoyed both the beginning and the end a lot more than I did the part where he s just going through the known motions of surviving on a deserted island Yes some of that stuff is creative like the reuse of skates for various tasks and the character of Wilson adds a touch of both humour and drama into the scenes Still Hanks character Chuck Noland is an interesting guy and he s opening speech at the beginning of the film easily both sets the character arouses our interest and gives a lot of room for growth not all of which gets explored The island was an important lesson for him but it was more of a necessary evil if you ask me That being said it s a strong movie The film makers went the extra mile to give it nice little finishing touches that lift it above its peers and make it film worth watching Definitely recommended,7.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2813813/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2006,Simply wonderful!!,This is a marvelous heartwarming engaging movie that features the genius of Tom Hanks The film was neither too long or boring it was just right It might have been boring if it d been anyone other than Hanks but as usual he melts into his role and delivers a riveting performance Kudos to Zemeckis also in capturing Hanks ordeal on the island from his weight loss to his desolation This is one of the best Robinson Crusoe type adaptations I ve seen And Hanks journey back to civilization was so interesting and moving He superbly played the part of the person who s struggling to find his place after being out of touch for five years The scenes are so touching especially his reunion with Hunt I was almost convinced this was based on an actual account so much so I was looking to see the trailers at the end of the movie saying Based on the real life account of Tom Hanks is one of the best character actors of his generation right alongside of Robert Duvall Robert DeNiro Dustin Hoffman Robin Williams Gene Hackman Morgan Freeman and Russell Crowe As an aside this is the only movie I ve seen that s been a showcase of a corporate logo from beginning to end and not a bad association I might add to which I wouldn t be surprised if it wasn t produced by FedEx If you re looking for something more than the shallow and contrived dramatics of the reality series Survivor or a movie without the standard pyrotechnics or other adrenalin boosting gimmicks then this film will be well worth your time It s a human interest story pure and simple I was so drawn in that when the movie ended I really wanted to see what happens to Chuck in the new phase of his life after meeting his next potential love interest at the very end of the film I guess that s left up to the imagination Happily ever after Enjoy a superb tour de force performance by Hanks,9.0,9.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1454788/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2006,South x South-West Pacific,I just had the unexpectedly strange and very moving experience of seeing CAST AWAY for the first time with a 39 year old male friend who is deeply traumatized because he is estranged from his pretty blonde wife and gorgeous young children He lives in a coastal holiday resort palm trees hibiscus and mountain cliffs His complete inability to previously express his agonizing emotional solitude whilst living here in Australia in paradise had him descend into sobbing heartbreak throughout in a way I have never previously witnessed He kept exclaiming to the screen and Hank s emotive performance and situation This is ME This is how I am feeling and for the first time in many years was able to melt awash with emotional relief at being able to translate his feelings whilst watching the ordeal in play It was an astonishing paralyzing experience for me to share with him and it has as of today today allowed him to seek the help and professional guidance with a degree of confidence and heartfelt understanding previously unavailable to him So I had a double feature A real life human drama in the room with me and the film itself It all added to the experience of having someone alongside who was living CAST AWAY for real in his own heart and head Maybe if you have a distressed friend unable to break into or out of the emotional knot caused by bereaved family loss this film will allow a way forward It worked for us any way One has to hand it to Hanks though for a front and center performance that allows every man watching to see his everyman persona on show and apt in every movement and emotion CAST AWAY is a magnificent looking film in c s and on a huge screen it must be astonishing great plane disaster set pieces and tropical traps hilarious and heartbreaking Robinson Crusoe level drama and photography and sound design worthy of Oscars I was queasy about all the FedEx ads throughout but agreed in the end it was a great device I especially liked the North By Northwest farm locale seen early and late in the film and even the positive denouement allowing a realistic life pointer to be an acceptable ending For a few moments there in the final act I gripped the seat in apprehension hoping the schmaltz possible wasn t about to really happen I would watch CAST AWAY again in fact I want to and will start from the terrifying and spectacular plane crash through the excellent compelling Island sequences and exit with the ocean tanker in the background CAST AWAY is a uniquely American film success too long in the last act and perfectly realized in all the island scenes by the irreplaceable Tom Hanks I thank you and my pal is today able to move on as well Other similar theme movies worth seeing are Man Friday 1975 with Peter O Toole as Crusoe and Richard Roundtree as Man Friday and the excellent LOST style telemovie made by Universal in 1969 called LOST FLIGHT which stars Anne Francis see my comments for that elsewhere and of course the best of the lot the original version of LORD OF THE FLIES 1963,7.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1403376/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2011,One of the Greats,I have a philosophy about people who view a movie in it s own time Many have great difficulty in appreciating the scope of a truly great movie for some reason true greatness is only recognized in previous generations because of how they stand out against their peers In my opinion this movie is truly one of the greatest movies of all time The story script performances cinematography and overall production are second to none in every way Anyone who doesn t appreciate every aspect of this movie is frankly inventing reasons not to like it just because most people do If you are one of the 10 people on earth who haven t seen it yet do yourself a favor and download it now You ll laugh you ll cry you ll ask yourself which way does he turn,10.0,7.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2435078/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2005,Unintentional comedy,This was one of those epic dramas that goes so far over the top it ends up folding in on itself We were supposed to be engrossed with his trials and tribulations feeling empathy for his plight but all we could do was laugh Every thing which went awry just made it all the more amusing And at the climax when he s on the raft and Wilson goes floating away and he cries out with all his heart WIIIIIIILLLL SOOOOOONN we nearly got kicked out of the theater A first I assure you It utterly failed to generate any sympathy for this poor guy whatsoever The ratings here at IMDb are above average and the box office take was generous but I for one was entertained and amused however not in the way they intended I ve seen this afterwards and while it was not AS funny it was still funny It surely was not dramatic or epic or much of anything else It s just a mediocre little movie that took itself WAY too seroiusly It rates a 3 2 10 for unintentional comedic effect from the Fiend,3.0,14.0,31.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1001455/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2020,Don't get stuck on an Island or the cinema,I seen this in the cinema on a date years ago The date was not impressed and I thought it was ok Revisiting it all these years later I found it to be a great film which highlights why maybe Tom Hanks is the best The amazing acting with no one to play against is astounding It is a film that needs to be really watched to take in Only half watching or talking during it Will take you to much out of the film to appreciate its classic style,9.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6067299/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2007,Unbelievable,Not to be confused with the movie Castaway 1986 from the autobiographical book by Lucy Irvine about her 12 month contract with Gerald Kingsland to live with him on a deserted Pacific island Spoilers herein Tom Hanks gives a laudable performance especially as he made the effort to gain and lose a vast amount of weight to give a more accurate representation of his physical condition However the tooth extraction scene left me chuckling The way he did it would have broken his jaw and he would probably have died from starvation as a consequence My main issue is with the character of Kelly the fianc e The time line is that he disappeared for four years and upon his return finds her married to a smooth talking good looking dentist with an infant of at least 6 months old to boot you don t use a car seat for babies younger than that Let s do some math Fedex is a huge corporation let s assume they would have continued search protocols for their Corporate Executive for at least 3 months after the crash check out the extensive search patterns on Kelly s map No one can be officially declared dead until 12 months after the date of their disappearance and sometimes later This would be when Kelly s family might start pressuring her to accept the fact that Chuck is never coming back and they would have held the memorial service How soon would any woman who declares that You re the love of my life and I always knew you were alive submit to the advances of another man Adding it all up I calculate that the maximum time span Kelly waited before getting married was a mere 18 months or thereabouts Just how fickle is this woman How soon would you get over the loss of the Love of Your Life let alone marry on the rebound and have a kid Check out the maps she has kept on hand in her kitchen She kept the vehicle She obviously still loved him This is a jarring credibility error in the script and unfortunately ruined the whole movie for me Now if she had been recently married and several months pregnant that would have been slightly more believable Up to that point I quite enjoyed the story especially the food humour at his company s Welcome Home party How thoughtless of the organizers to provide mounds of seafood and so much of it is casually left behind after he had almost starved on a tiny deserted Pacific island,6.0,18.0,33.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1659962/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2014,Touchy and brilliant....,This is one of the few films that really got me emotionally involved I am not the type of person to cry when watching a movie but I found myself sensitively affected at the end of this movie Courtesy of Robert Zemeckis who really has a talent of emotionally drawing in the audience with his style of directing One other thing that increased the success of the message behind this movie is the music score composed by Alan Silvestri which is so sad at the times it does occur However it was the films notable lack of sound score and sound effects that really closes you in which was done to re enforce the feeling of isolation It works really well and it will emotionally drain you This is a well crafted tale of a man imprisoned on an island where he is free to do as he pleases but is been shut off from human contact gadgets electricity and all the necessary objects needed by man today to survive The film follows a style which many filmmakers are afraid to attempt which is that of a film depending on one character A style which was later seen in Gravity by Alfonso Cuaron It works well in Cast Away with Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland in the lead It takes a well experienced actor to make this kind of film style to work and it rarely occurs in movies as filmmakers find it rather too risky This is the element that gives Cast Away its raw realistic feel and it hits you hard The other sad and touchy thing about this film is the fact that Chuck Noland was engaged to be married to Kelly Frears played by Holly Hunter just before his plane crashes The whole point of his survival depends on his love of Kelly and wanting to return home to be with her He does return four years later and only to find that Kelly has moved on and married someone else This puts the final nail on the coffin The filmmakers here explore the element of true love and a mans decision to be unaltered even by circumstances beyond his control and its amazing Do not expect over the edge entertainment but rather a deep sad story of survival love and humanity Keep the tissues handy,10.0,8.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2982321/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2008,"Brilliant Tom Hanks performance, coupled with daring direction",I thought this movie was good the first time I saw it But I have probably seen it another 8 times since then and it never fails to keep my attention Here s why Hanks delivers an amazing performance Not only does he undergo drastic physical changes throughout the movie that renders his character s plight so convincingly But the fact that the majority of the picture is JUST him on an island with very little dialogue no background music etc What a huge risk to have to carry a movie by yourself but boy does he deliver The cinematography and location shooting is amazing NO fake process shots it s all the real deal I thought the airplane crash special effects were amazing I was scared out of my mind it was so believable I think the director was daring to have so much silence and no background music the majority of his time on the island I m not sure many would have attempted this But I think it is one of things that makes this picture unique and memorable The ending is quite poignant I don t often cry during movies but the scene with Hanks and Hunt in the street in the rain had me balling my eyes out One of the closing lines has always stuck with me And I know what I have to do now I gotta keep breathing Because tomorrow the sun will rise Who knows what the tide could bring Great stuff,9.0,4.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1972500/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2000,"Pathos is not Deep, but The Nesting Is",Spoilers herein I write this on opening day for this film while it is still an event Lots of people are excited but when significant talent comes close to creating something important I use a higher standard There are some fine elements and moments in this film but the total disappoints The best two moments are the fire creation sequence and the plane crash The firemaking episode is the center of the film as I note below The plane crash is as harrowing as it gets speaking as one who was touched by such an event and supplants the equally person centered crash in Fearless Scene wise the most unsuccessful episode is near the beginning when Hanks gives a motivational speech to Muscovites about the importance of time His good guy persona keeps him from convincing here Contrast this to a similar but crackling speech by Alec Baldwin in Glengary Glen Ross I blame Zemeckis for this exhibiting his execrable What Lies Beneath as proof It was filmed between the first and second halves of Castaway He just doesn t understand global scope all his skills are local My disappointment has to do with the point of the film A biting existential angst is eschewed for a more desperate pathos in order to lower the risk of the film I suppose But what s left is empty There s a small nobility in leaving the old girlfriend to her husband but this only incidental John Sayles Limbo used the same story to much better effect because he wasn t so namby pamby about despair On the other hand what s remarkable about this film is the way it is structured it has a many tiered frame Often a film is bracketed as a story The Princess Bride comes to mind but scriptwriters use all sorts of brackets and here pull out all the stops It is an elegant structure The obvious bracket is the package We see it being picked up from a pretty we find out Texas artist in the opening shots She paints a distinctive winged logo on the box This box is either returned by the adulterous husband or a similar box is sent in reply It appears on the island inspires Hanks and is returned at the end of the film presaging a possible new life The content of the box created by an artist is metaphorically the film But there are more brackets both outside and inside of this one Inside we have the bracket of the outside world from which he comes to the island and to whence he returns This is primarily a sound bracket contrasting the sounds of ships and jets to those of nature And within that we have the creation of Wilson by Hanks just as the screenwriter creates Hanks character Wilson is the star truly the one being with no life no future His creation with fire is a clue that Hanks will get some distance on his own life I suspect that much of Wilson is on the editroom floor when the decision was made to tone down from despairing angst to just pathos Too bad Another internal bracket is more of a small plot symmetry Hanks confronts a painful tooth truth since Lewis Carroll His dentist is Spaulding mirrors Wilson as alterego is on the outside mirroring location and sets up his exgirlfriend s husband mirroring relationship Its clumsy as it is and probably had a less film schoolish feel in the original script Outside we have more brackets too The film leverages Hanks role in real life as everyman by setting it at Christmas and inviting the Christmas audience in We literally bracket the film with our own lives a point I m sure the writer wanted to make Two other virtual exterior brackets are worth noting The Imagemovers production company is a very clever conception entirely congruent with the use Fedex is put here as the vehicle for connection Also a much overlooked element of movies is the font design of the titles This film is very clear about titles there is no visual prelude or underlude You have the titles then the action then the titles again on black Font design is a non trivial art Tied up in the creation of display fonts is a deep hardwiring in the brain about communication eons deeper than cinematic conventions I know that extraordinary effort often goes into the design of fonts for major films as the effect is extremely powerful albeit subliminal If you get a chance to notice this font it is an ambiguous design half in the calligraphic world human nature free and half in the chiseled world civilized formal self aware But the blurring switches from side to side for each character An apt bracket Hanks understood all this nesting I m sure I wish he hadn t squandered the opportunity But because he performs with such commitment as an actor we r e prone to forgive him for his lack of courage as a producer With Joe vs the Volcano in his past he should have been more adventuresome in commissioning the script,0.0,7.0,15.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566156/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2007,"An emotional, uplifting, and positive story of hope, faith, survival and perhaps Divine Intervention.",Cast Away tells the tale of a successful and much revered Federal Express Executive who s dynamic life takes a surreal turn after he is the sole survivor of a horrific plane crash into the ocean The storyline pits a business savvy workhorse against the wrath of nature in a desperate attempt at survival At the core of the movie is a story of hope survival love and faith The movie explores the personal successes and failures of a white collar high powered Executive who s career and many aspects of his personal life are ruled by the clock An unexpected and traumatic life altering event removes Chuck Noland Tom Hanks from his regimented lifestyle bound by self erected parameters and deposits him smack dab in the middle of a new life where he realizes that ironically he now has an abundance of his most treasured and precious resource the resource of time Cast Away is an excellent cinematic experience for viewers who have a strong sense of faith spirituality and perhaps even divine intervention Throughout the film Chuck faces obstacles and scenarios that make Survivor look like a walk in the park Everywhere he turns he is seemingly subjected to tests of his mettle and intestinal fortitude Watching Chuck navigate each experience the viewer cannot help but explore his her own circumstances and wonder if they have what it truly takes to survive if they were left to their own devices Notwithstanding the physical challenges one must ask themselves if he she could overcome the emotional and psychological challenges Perhaps most importantly I believe the premise of the movie is that you are only bound by your own parameters You can survive just about any situation if you look deep down inside your core and pull out reserves you never knew you had It also seems to teach you that you should never give up However if the situation is too much to handle and you have done your absolute best to survive you may just get a little help from a divine source Powerful emotional gripping exciting Highly recommended,9.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1576154/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2002,Contains SPOILERS !!!!,The end of this movie confuses some making them feel that they have wasted their time To me it is the most memorable part of the movie As Chuck stands in the middle of this isolated intersection he finally gets it He finally sees why life has given him a second chance He held on to three things while on the island A picture of Kelly which gave him hope Wilson who gave him companionship and one last Fed Ex package which was his since of duty and purpose in the world he could not return to Wilson was lost in his attempt to rejoin the rest of the world Kelly was lost in his absence the package did save his life by providing that sense of purpose which he followed through to the end by taking it back to where it had shipped from four years earlier Only then when this beautiful woman entered into his life did he realize that the sender of the package not a picture of Kelly represented his future The movie ends with Hanks forming a thin smile on his face because he sees how he and the movie have come full circle,0.0,16.0,20.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566211/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2010,Culture Shock Series: Cast Away.,There was an earthquake in Sino 1978 when the government decided to open the gate of the country and allow the free trade and economics That marks the first wave of material renaissance in Far East That s something you can easily check from any history books nowadays but what you probably won t find in the books is the sentimental values of people at that time When Sino people had their very first color TV first Teddy bear first turbo washing machine they attached their feelings to them only to find out there are far better quality of products out there waiting for them Into the 1990s they are all confused because there s no clearer boundary between good communism and bad capitalism Former garbage and treasures now exchanged ID cards Now in 2010s despite one s denial of his her lost status we are all castaways The image Cast Away portrayed with Tom Hanks is quite simple an everyday man was the sole survivor on a coral island and the only friend he got was volleyball People take an interest in seeing this movie for questioning our take for granted identity of human being etc However the true controversy off the screen comes from the ever clever product placement in it that the storyline actually is one huge super commercial for Fed Ex Wilson sports and some other brands Whoever wrote the script must be a genius Yet we as conscious commercial spoiled human beings are questioning something beyond Chuck Noland s humanity issues That is is there ever a point of rooting your sentimental values on mass produced products How about actually hug the values provided by your everyday Coke commercials and such I am afraid no one will go to bed with a Wilson volleyball even after seeing Cast Away but I am quite sure there are people who get frustrated when they find out half their life was devoted to something equally lifeless as Wilson My first guess is the value system everyone possesses in this world Taking mine for example my system told me the most valuable existence in my life was those time with my family especially when I was only a child who s not ashamed asking for a hug every minutes But that s the answer I got when I was older and things can t be same ever again When I was 18 years old I had my favorite computer Nintendo game console and my admission letter from a University My value system told me at that time the most valuable in my life was again something from the past the moment I celebrated my manhood with best friends the family and hometown I am about to say goodbye to etc There can be many explanations to this stupidity For me it would be immaturity because I was a teenager at the time However the moment my father saw me off the way to the university at the train station he also felt his life was pumped out into a vacuum after parting with me For months and years this vacuum was choking him so harsh Another explanation would be an uneven value system That we do not have multiple types of wealth that can balance out if one goes wrong I graduated from finance major so I personally like this explanation as it sounds slightly more scientific and economic However the dilemma presented to me again was like this as an atheist I accept we are here and now only values But again any reasonable self respected realists would end up in a paradox that any wealth in the long run is perishable so there s no need to raise a family remember you may end up like Chuck Noland that your wife accepted your death when you are just missing there s no need either to plan for your living etc Then in a month or two the wreckage of your consciousness and health would be warning that you are walking drunk and sleeping in death But you won t be that ignorant Like Chuck Noland you will finally learn to pick yourself up and find something to behold Luckier than Noland besides volleyball we ve got football the world cup Beckham s tattoo NBA and what we IMDb guys like the most movies You can even make a ranking list to value them like I did I listed God as No 1 and that s predetermined because otherwise my pastor s going to have a serious conversation with me Then it didn t take very long for me to find out whatever was at No 2 in my authenticated value system tends to overthrow the God Matthew 13 44 The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field When a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field It finally appeared to me that a value system I made that had God on the highest ranking doesn t work Instead a value system put into me by God would be beyond my reasoning It asked me to put behind everything and accept him and him only As a sinner I have run away from this answer several times The enormous ocean washed up Chuck Noland His passion his 5 years of life his family and every other thing possibly he owned in his value system What proved to be waterproof in his heart was pain and loneliness What would bring him salvation I don t know because this is only a movie a world conceived in people s mind which may or may not have the concept of salvation at all But I know his pain and loneliness can t be more real than ours And it doesn t seem like a value system dilemma to me anymore It seems more like a dilemma of soul On one side it s the brooding and evolving sin still escalating in the time line while on the other side is Holy Spirit s unchanged whispering prayers for us echoing in the eternity,8.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265315/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2020,Parable of Life on a Deserted Island,I ve got to keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise Who knows what the tide could bring For a film noted for its sparseness Robert Zemeckis Cast Away is one of the richest film going experiences I have ever had It is a story of mythic simplicity a man stranded alone on an island And yet this film contains multitudes Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland a Fed Ex executive whose life is dictated by the clock The love of his life is Kelly Frears played by Helen Hunt While performing a routine delivery Noland s Fed Ex aircraft crashes and he washes ashore on a small tropical island These are the select few components of Cast Away s plot The film is carried almost completely by character and theme Once the story gets to the island the movie becomes a deeply reflective allegory William Broyles Jr s script is fluid moving organically around its central character following him through the trials of island survival and the human mind It is impossible to discuss Cast Away without mentioning Tom Hanks Hanks performance is an all encompassing master class He is tasked with selling every conceivable emotion from sorrow heartache fear and misery to hope joy and optimism in his time in and off the island Then there is the physical transformation from plump Everyman to raw naked vulnerability as an emaciated creature of the jungle We spend an extreme amount of time with Tom Hanks in Cast Away He is so layered so pitch perfect in every moment that you never want to leave him Zemeckis excels with the details of Noland s years long struggle to survive The direction is intimate and tactile placing us right there with Chuck as he uses relatable ingenuity he is never superhumanly intelligent to fight for each new day While so much of the pleasure of watching Cast Away is the realism in which it depicts island survival The film is always operating on the level of myth or fable The island is not simply a setting Fire is not simply a source of warmth A volleyball is not simply a toy Deeper meaning permeates every pore of Cast Away When Chuck Noland washes up on that island he lays out the pieces of human desire Longing desperation joy companionship hopelessness and resilience Those tenets of the human heart are what Cast Away is really about The story is told completely in metaphor lending every small moment an impact that goes beyond the surface What is so remarkable among all of these ideas is the entertainment value encased within them Tom Hanks makes wonderful company and Robert Zemeckis wisely finds room for humor Cast Away is also a beautiful looking and sounding film It works on very basic levels as well as the metaphorical ones Finally in a third act that left many wrongly underwhelmed Cast Away reveals itself as among many other things a suicide parable and it s themes crescendo In one of the greatest monologues of Hanks career we re given a line that transcendently crystallizes the film s messages A line that has stuck with me for years and one that I believe has the power to change lives To anyone who has ever experienced intense loneliness or depression anyone who has felt hopeless in the face of the enormity of life s challenges Cast Away is a spiritual journey The movie holds a special personal connection to myself as someone who has been emotionally paralyzed by depression Like me it doesn t wallow in sadness but instead pushes toward gentle optimism about overcoming it It provides a pillar to my own philosophy An extraordinary inspiration when I feel marooned within my own life 99 100,10.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5537161/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2015,Story of a plane crash survivor,Cast Away is the film that reunited actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis after their massive success with Forrest Gump a couple years earlier It was written by William Broyles Jr the man who wrote Apollo 13 previously another Hanks movie Here the two time Academy Award winner is basically in every single scene from start to finish and that is especially mentionable as the film runs for almost 2 5 hours Other parts are played by Helen Hunt and Chris Noth who I really liked on Criminal Intent Anyway back to Hanks and the performance that won him another Golden Globe and almost brought him his 3rd Oscar The first half hour we gain an insight into Chuck Noland s life work and family especially into his professional life as a FedEx employee giving training courses in foreign countries After the 30 minute mark his plane has already crashed and he made it to a remote island where he fights for survival for many years until finally after he decides to sail away he gets picked up by a cargo ship The last 40 minutes or so then take place back in civilization again and we see how he struggles with his now remarried wife and life in general That was one of the very few parts that I did not like at all If he is truly the love of her life she also should get back together with him and there is no real excuse for staying married to Noth s character I don t really need a happy end it somehow was one looking at the very last scene but if they make it somehow unhappy it needs to be at least realistic Maybe they should have kept it without the two meeting again and just ended it with Noth leading Hunt s character to the car Anyway one of the best parts of the film is the constant approach to time the way he talks about it before the crash and how he has basically found his peace at the end not trying to beat it anymore Most of that happened on the island where also the majority of the film takes place We see how he fishes hunts tries to make fire is thirsty etc pretty much everything you would expect And we also see Wilson the Volleyball of course one of the greatest performances from an inanimate object in film history He serves as a person being with Noland on the island so he has somebody to talk to and won t go insane due to lack of human relationships The title Cast Away is certainly not only a reference to him being on the isolated island but also about everything what happens when he is rescued There were a few moments on the island during which I felt it dragged a bit and I don t really feel the need to watch the film anytime soon again but as a whole I enjoyed the outcome and would recommend it It came in 2nd most seen film after The Grinch in 2000 and it is certainly a good quality movie with a stellar lead performance And if you have already seen and enjoyed this one here let me recommend you the more recent similar themed All is Lost starring Robert Redford unless you have seen that one too,6.0,5.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3154098/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2021,Robinson Tom Hanks(o),I have to admit my summary line would have worked even better if it wasn t Tom Hanks but Tom Cruise in the main role here that funny anecdote aside the movie is quite the tour de force But as every good story you ll have to wait until the island story begins When it begins though there is quite the hard story to go through You may start thinking What would I do in a situation like that Apart from maybe not working for Fed Ex or any other postal service company which I reckon you can make as much fun of as you want for good reasons you probably would have quite a few issues Or maybe not I know that while survival instincts would kick in I d have quite the trouble And Hanks character does too we see how he has to learn so many things or to live without so many things Most of us are used to a safe place electricity and so many more things that make our lifes easier nowadays even more so than back then cell phones have made us quite dependent on them And with no possibility to charge them we probably would have major issues to determine or find out how to do things that should be common sense The movie does a good job and Hanks has quite the powerhouse performance and that almost without anyone by his side yes Friday will not make an appearance in this native inhabitants have been made expandable one might say not everyones cup of tea but really well made,8.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6789075/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2014,Tom Hanks is Incredible,At the time of its release this was Tom Hanks best effort yet As he appears in nearly every frame the film relies heavily on his screen presence and acting Amazingly he pulls it off with considerable ease I loved the narration and the way it was filmed especially on the island When it comes to realism the plane crash was one of the best I ve ever seen in any movie In western society we come to expect so many everyday comforts as the norm and living without them is both disconcerting and frustrating The central character s daily frustrations and loneliness are well presented and we all felt great empathy with him throughout Plus having audience members nearly in tears over a basketball is no mean feat but that s what happened Everything worked well and the story was rewarding in so many ways especially towards the end I found this film difficult to fault incredibly enjoyable and would recommend it to all without reservation,10.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3058856/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2010,Master-Class!,Cast Away is not an easy film to watch A man stuck in an abandoned Island and his loneliness can be very off putting But when a subject like this is handled by Hollywood Legends like Robert Zemeckis Tom Hanks you know that something great is in store Cast Away is not the greatest film of all time nor is it the best film of the year it released But it s an extra ordinary film that is hopeful by nature About 142 minutes long Cast Away is not about an isolated man it s not about his sadness but about love hope Cast Away is film that has it s heart mind and soul in the right place Robert Zemeckis has gone down as one of Hollywood s most talented filmmakers ever His body of work is impeccable and a true legend Cast Away is amongst his strongest and fittest efforts to date William Broyles Jr s Screenplay is wonderful with memorable dialogue Cinematography by Don Burgess s captures each moment effortlessly In the acting department Tom Hanks is outstanding He is the most successful actor box office wise and as an actor he easily ranks amongst the best in his dictionary Helen Hunt is excellent as well Chris Noth also is very effective On the whole Such Films Come Very Very Rarely A awe struck Two Thumbs Up,10.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2309883/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2010,Cast Away is a good movie,One thing I talk to my friends about is star power in an actor can an actor carry a film by him or herself I explain that it s actually a rarity that we find an actor who can keep your interest for an entire film and also have massive appeal Tom Hanks is one of those rarities if it wasn t already proved enough with Philadelphia or Forrest Gump it s proved with Cast Away that he can not only carry a film but keep you interested in the story and character as well Cast Away is a film that takes chances because this could have been a total flop or a very boring movie After all being ship wrecked onto an island is not a new story The reason it took me so long to see this film is because I thought it would be tedious and most people I know that saw it said it was just an alright film Now I don t think this is the film of 2000 but it definitely ranks up with one of the strongest performances of the decade Not having any dialog for most of the film Tom Hanks keeps your interest as we see this tragic character trying to hang on to any inch of his live and survive hoping to come back home to his true love Chuck Noland is a time obsessed FedEx systems analyst who travels worldwide resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots He is in a relationship with Kelly Although the couple wants to get married Chuck s busy schedule interferes with their relationship A Christmas with relatives is interrupted by Chuck being summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia Flying through a violent storm over the southern Pacific Ocean Chuck s airplane crashes into the ocean making him the only survivor among five He clings onto the life raft as it floats all night in the storm before being washed up on an island Chuck initially tries to signal for rescue and makes an escape attempt with the remnants of his life raft but he cannot pass the powerful surf He searches for food water shelter and opens the FedEx packages washed up ashore including a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball A short time later he draws a face on the ball naming it Wilson and begins talking to it as if it was a person Four years later Chuck is dramatically thinner and bearded with longer hair and wearing a loincloth Finally deciding that it s now or never he ll never be rescued so he ll do whatever he can to get off the island or die trying This was a hard movie to get through because you know it wasn t going to be a typical story If Tom Hanks gets home what is everyone supposed to do or how do they even act around him when they thought he was dead As he s gone through an amazing transformation himself through this journey Of course everyone has made fun of Wilson the volleyball honestly I was expecting it to be stupid because of all the parodies that have been done on it It was possibly one of the most honest characters I had ever seen after 4 years on an island by yourself to keep yourself from going insane you would talk to anything Who doesn t have that moment where they just need to hear their voices The film is very well made and Tom Hanks is a tour de force actor who takes risks and they usually pay off He made his character very real sad funny and sympathetic How could anyone not like Cast Away I would recommend this for the film lovers because obviously for those who do not like this film don t seem to have a passion for the actor s performance or seeing the message in movies Cast Away was a wonderful movie and Tom Hanks should be proud this is one of the finest performances in cinema history 8 10,8.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2265114/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2006,"Slow beginning, then pretty good",The first 45 minutes of the show establishes the Chuck Noland character played by Tom Hanks as a high strung Fedex foreman It could have been done in 5 minutes Then Chuck is on a plane and it crashes at sea and he washes ashore on an island all to himself This part is great as we see the clever things he does to get by Then comes the very weak last half hour of the film I won t say what happened but it was a snore I m not a big Hanks fan but he s OK here Interesting also that he really got in shape for this film For the first month or so on the island he s your typical flabby American Then after a while he truly slims down and looks like a flat belly teenager As others have commented this movie almost plays as a Fedex commercial Really tacky,6.0,5.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1300627/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2018,"A movie classic called Cast Away, not Castaway",Cast Away is about a Fed Ex executive who is involved in a plane crash and has to survive on a deserted island From that description you might think this is a rather mundane movie with no plot and no story It could not be further from the truth This simply put is a movie about time It is a movie about the emotions that time evokes on any ordinary human being You feel like you are in the movie and can relate to the characters and the story Whether is it the deserted island the romance or the job you feel like Tom Hanks character Chuck Noland The one aspect of director Robert Zemeckis films that I think are perfect are how he uses metaphor to tell the story In this film there is a beginning and an end And they are both perfect and complement one another It is hard to believe that a film can make the viewer relate to such a long period of time in 2 and a half hours But Zemeckis does it with this movie just like he did it with an earlier classic called Forrest Gump There was one other aspect of this film that I realized myself and I wonder if others did too If you type into a search for this film the word Castaway you will not find it That is because the name of this film is actually Cast Away with a space And to myself the meaning between the two titles is totally different I think the hidden meaning is this This is NOT a film about a castaway on a deserted island like so many people think It is a film about a guy through some unavoidable event in his life who is cast away by time and has to find himself all over again The beginning and the end of this film made this point beautifully This is a movie classic,10.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4418006/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2012,"Flawed, but worth watching",When I first saw this movie I enjoyed it But I had a nagging feeling that something was off Upon reflection I realized what the problem was the movie is actually very poorly written In fact the only thing that saves it is Hanks s powerful largely wordless depiction of a man struggling to survive in the harsh environment where he has been stranded Everything else about the movie is pretty bad Here are a few of the main flaws Poor dialog and characterization The characters don t behave like real people they behave like movie characters A classic sign of an untalented writer This is especially true of the main character Chuck who undergoes the largest amount of development His character changes but everything basically occurs offscreen First we are presented with an exaggerated caricature of a work obsessed businessman Once he arrives at the island we see him face some of the challenges of life away from civilization Then four years later we see the character transformed into a kind of Robinson Crusoe toughened by years on the island grimly determined to survive in his harsh environment Finally we see him back in society pretty much the same as before but more subdued having found new meaning in his life as a result of his isolation This is all well and good but the problem is that the movie doesn t really give insight into the nature of this transformation it just tells us the results There s not really a sense of gradual change just before and after pictures This leads to the second major flaw a poorly delivered message The message itself that we should appreciate life pursue the things that matter to us while we still can remain open to new opportunities and so on is a good one though certainly one that we ve all heard before But the writer in delivering this message uses the same tactic of telling the viewer what to think rather than showing it naturally The main character even has a monologue where he tells his friend and the viewer what he s learned from his time on the island And the movie ends with a particularly blatant scene of the main character standing at a literal crossroads as he considers his future The writer clearly thinks that viewers are idiots and won t understand the message without scenes like this Give the viewers some credit That kind of didacticism is both unnecessary and ineffective It cheapens the message to the level of a greeting card or self help book The third major problem is inept pacing In an attempt to create a certain unity of action the writer introduces us to all of the characters before the island part then shows us them all again at the end This isn t always a bad thing but he spends far too long doing so A more skilled writer could suggest all of this background with a few deft strokes This writer though gets bogged down trying to show us all the details and tie up the loose ends This is distracting and tedious especially given the unrealistic dialog as I already mentioned Also it gives the movie a distinct sense of unevenness Nothing really happens during the beginning and end scenes The writer is just telling the viewer the setup at the beginning or telling the viewer the epilogue and delivering the moral at the end The result is that instead of a natural sequence of rising and falling action we are given a kind of plot inselberg in a double sense in the middle surrounded by flat rolling hills of boring exposition at the beginning and end Even with so many flaws I d still recommend this movie Tom Hanks gives a truly gripping portrayal of a man almost completely cut off from society forced to depend entirely on himself for survival For best results just fast forward until you see the main couple opening presents in the car then turn off the movie after the scene with the cargo ship The rest is just a waste of time,6.0,6.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2611164/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2003,Slow but engaging drama that is driven by Hanks' brave performance,Chuck Noland is a driven employee of Fed Ex He has a loving girlfriend and a lifestyle that sees him travelling the world When he takes an overnight flight across the Pacific his plane crashes killing the crew but he escapes on an inflatable dingy Washing up on an island Chuck finds himself shipwrecked and must survive until he is found I wasn t won over by the idea of this film when it came out at the cinema and gave it a miss However on TV I m graceful enough to give anything a chance for free In this case I had no hype or bad reviews about the film to colour what I thought of it coming to it fresh enough to have an open mind Fortunately I was in a patient mood and looking forward to seeing it so it didn t bother me that the film was very slow although I can understand why some audiences were straining at the leash for more pace For me the story itself was interesting enough as a human story to defy things happening it was Chuck I was watching the film for not a fight scene or a dramatic rescue For this reason the film succeeds to me it was dramatic and engaging on a character level and because things were always happening to Chuck I didn t need some constant bit of plot to be happening The film is quite brave in that way and while other reviewers have criticised the ending I thought it displayed good taste and control imagine trying to get that ending through a pitch or a preview audience Most films would have looked for a more positive and conclusive ending but this one was very good Hanks does great work to hold the attention for the whole film he is barely off screen for a minute of the whole 120 minutes His performance is good whether he is acting normal or talking to a volley ball he is convincing and never dull he makes it very easy for us to get into his character and his situation which was vital to keep the audience interested Overall I really enjoyed this film but I do feel you need to be ready for what you re sitting down to It is slow paced and if you re impatient then you may feel like nothing s happening Hanks does great to hold the audience otherwise and the film is grown up and lacking in the sort of syrupy smaltz that could have killed the film Not perfect but an great story well told if you re in a patient mood,0.0,4.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566267/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2014,Hanks is Revelatory in His Beach-Stranded One Man Show,There s really a whole lot more to this than just Tom Hanks alone on an island It works on a visceral level as a straightforward tale of survival amidst the harshest conditions imaginable but underneath the surface there s all manner of allegorical goodness also at play It s intense and powerful no matter how you choose to take it though and that s the sign of a real masterwork That whole stack of cards teeters on Hanks s work in the central role of course and he flat out crushes it In a way his whole career up to this point has been preparing him for this kind of an effort I can see shreds of many of his earlier roles alive in his gamut of expressions as he slowly grimly comes to terms with the fact that there s no form of rescue on the horizon He s familiar but lost a modern day everyman denied his tool belt stripped bare to the very core of his being It s an all world performance easily among the best of his career though it didn t quite draw the accolades that his turns in Philadelphia or Forrest Gump enjoyed Behind the lens Robert Zemeckis also hands in some of his best work Experimenting with before their time camera angles and quick effective snapshots of daily life on the island he s able to evolve his craft without losing touch with his typically warm lush brand of storytelling And needless to say Cast Away s famous crash scene remains one of film s most historically intense white knuckle rides I didn t realize I d been holding my breath until it was all over A fantastic picture that only stumbles in the payoff lingering in the moment for longer than it really should then momentarily giving in to its indulgent romantic side,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3095050/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2009,Excellent movie,Sometimes a movie comes along that communicates on a level deeper and more meaningful than words or emotion can possibly express This movie is one such movie Its not merely a man vs nature man vs himself or man vs fate movie its a monologue about life and its meaning The things that are important the things that steal away the times we should cherish how little control we really have over our own lives and hope And oddly enough hope in the face of hopelessness is the one thing we can control not all of the other things in life Unless you have been alone truly alone this movie may not touch you at first put after several watchings it will And if you have been alone you will understand Chuck s struggle almost from the first Oddly it has a lot of action but all the action is in Chuck s mind and the struggles he must face at the start of the movie while on the island and when he returns A classic that will I think and hope stand the test of time Mr Hanks does a magnificent job and conveys the turmoil and struggles of his character in a magnificent and understated way He is the everyman of our time and this movie once again demonstrates his vast reservoir of talent,10.0,4.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2013084/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2001,The last act makes this a disappointment,I remember the day I was going to see this film what I was thinking to myself I was driving to wherever and I began to wonder how Hanks was going to get rescued It would probably be by a plane going overhead or he was going to make an attempt to sail off the island in some crude contraption of a boat and then be rescued by some ocean tanker that transports cars from Tokyo to Nova Scotia I then began to think of what expression I would have if I was the extra in the film that had the thankless non speaking role of the guy that sees Hanks first Would my eyes bulge from their forehead Would I look like I had just seen a ghost Would I just stare in awe as the tiny boat floated by and was dwarfed by the tanker that I was on Would I be smoking a cigarette and it would just stick to my bottom lip as my mouth became agape These are all tough choices to make for an extra with such a vital role in the film Which one of these reactions actually happened in the film Well if you have seen the film you know exactly what happened and if you haven t then you ll just have to read a little further to find out But just saffice it to say that it is issues like this one that made the film a 7 for me and not the 9 5 that it should have been And that is a shame Cast Away is a very good film it s just that it could have been one of the best if only they would have put a little more care into it Even though the film is a good 2 and half hours it deserved to be three When you go to great pains to have a story of this magnitude then why can you not close the deal and make the last act just as good as the middle one What is good about the film is the first act and what is even better is the second one We are introduced to Hanks as a guy that lives and dies by his watch He is always timing everything and he is so busy that he has to schedule in his girlfriend for New Year s It is a promise he guarantees her that he will be home for this festive time of year So far Hanks s character while a little intricate and obsessive seems like many of us We all live by the clock in one way or another It s just that he is a little more serious about it But in these times that we live in we are all bound by deadlines we are all aware of the time and we are all a little obsessive about our jobs at one time or another So again we can relate to his character quite well Of course that all changes when the plane that he is on crashes in the middle of the ocean somewhere Hanks uses a raft to drift for days and he comes up on a deserted almost uncharted island in the middle of nowhere It is here that the strength of the film is presented And this is the most amazing thing about the film We are not only entertained with Hanks on an island by himself but we want more We are captivated At least I was The film moves slowly at times when he is here but it also captures the feeling of isolation loneliness despair hope and a plethora of other feelings in between Hanks does an incredible job of conveying these emotions inspite of the fact that he is the only thing on screen He has no one to talk to so he finds an inanimate object and gives it life It s name is Wilson a volleyball that has washed up on shore that Hanks breathes life into Wilson becomes a great character and when it is in danger at times it frightened me and saddened me that it was I have not experienced an array of emotions the way I did when he was on the island And as much as I wanted to see Hanks get off the island I was completely engulfed in his time there When he eventually did get off I craved for him to be back on that tiny island with Wilson his coconuts his caves his fire and all else that was there Up until his rescue and you knew that was inevitable from the trailers this was easily one of the five best films of the year But what it did once he got rescued was very weak and very poor There was so much more that they could have done There never was that reaction shot of the guy on the ocean liner that first sees him There was never really any reaction to him getting rescued It just happened I wanted to see everyone s faces and expressions when this man that has been lost for 4 years come home But not once did we get that And that is what I meant when I said that this films should have been 3 hours long hell it could have been 3 and a half that would have given us closure and maybe a little more honesty As it stands it is a good film but with the combined talents of Zemekis and Hanks it could have been so much more And that makes it disappointing 7 out of 10 Still a good film and a fantastic journey but it lacked once he got off the island However Hanks should be nominated for best actor and if he wins there should be no complaints It is an incredible performance This film is worth seeing but it also worth noting that there are quite a few better films out there so far this year,7.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565577/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2004,"""See our cast away, here on Gilligan's Isle...""",CAST AWAY has an interesting start Tom Hanks can carry a romantic drama But this movie is not a romantic drama Soon there is a jumbo jet plane crash in the Pacific Ocean The crash as depicted would truly splinter the aircraft and kill all but anyway Tom survives Not only is he fully conscious and makes it to the surface of the water but a lone jet engine remains high above water during the crash and begins to chase after Tom Tom escapes There is a special effects problem here When Tom first makes it to the surface and while he is being chased by the jet engine the ocean has small white caps But then after Tom escapes from the jet engine the ocean instantly has giant swells First the ocean waves are too small to reach the bottom of the jet engine then next they are three times bigger than the engine There is no continuity Tom washes up on the shore of a small tropical island On the wide screen it might be fine but on TV there is never a single shot showing the whole island The movie is spent on a beach always facing in the same direction There is a strong sense that the island is only 180 degrees and not 360 degrees around To be honest if I were lost on a small tropical island I know I would starve to death within a couple of weeks Still any person would do their best to try to survive There are some obvious things any person would do A person would make a home base at a dry shaded location high enough to be far from big storm waves A person would take stock of everything they had All man made items would be saved as being rare and precious In CAST AWAY Tom Hanks digs a hole and puts the dead pilot inside with all of his cloths on and then covers him In real life most anyone would take the cloths off of the pilot and keep them because the clothing has high value Also most men I think would use pieces of the dead pilot s body as bait for fishing In CAST AWAY Tom completely wastes the batteries to his only flashlight and in general he acts like his frantic guy character from his MONEY PIT movie Too often Tom is in frantic guy mode but it is not funny enough to be a comedy The island portion of CAST AWAY does not ring true to life The unrealistic aspects make this movie very difficult to enjoy,2.0,6.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566265/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2012,Wiiillllssssonnnn!!!!...,I found this a totally absorbing film one of those that make the time pass much more quickly than you expect You very quickly get involved in the story and you find that you actually care about this man stranded on this island You really want him to survive and get back to the woman he loves and you feel his pain when things don t go quite right It s quite emotional and can be quite harrowing in places Some people don t like the ending but I really did it leaves the audience to decide just what he ll do next Loved this one SteelMonster s verdict HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score 9 2 10 You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog Thoughts of a SteelMonster,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2684221/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2022,"No worries. If stranded, FedEx will deliver straight to your Island.",You ll need to turn down the volume for about 10 minutes when the plane prepares to crash in this modern variation of Robinson Crusoe It s one of the most intense plane crashes I ve ever seen in a film mainly because you really can t see what s going on outside of the cockpit because it is so dark Being stranded on the island is probably the best thing after the first 20 minutes because Tom Hanks doesn t shut up prior to getting onto the plane He s a problem solver who works as an executive for FedEx traveling the world and on this particular trip he s off to Malaysia right after Christmas As the crash happens at night he can t see anything after he flies out of the sunken plane hanging onto a life draft and only the lights of the fire from the sinking plane give him any indication of what s going on It s a horrifying sequence nearly as intense as the last half hour of Titanic It s one of several scenes througout the movie where I say out loud as the characters go through something horrific I d be dead A bunch of people won t be getting their packages and even when he s rescued Hanks won t be able to take them back because he uses them for survival Of course the deserted island is gorgeous and as he gets to explore it he learns how to be more independent and hopefully a lot more humble It s amazing that use you can find for things that in real life you ve never think of finding a use for although the VHS tapes won t help him out very much But his goal is to get back to fiance Helen Hunt and certainly he s going to be living his life a lot differently having neglected her for his career over and over again The aftermath of the crash brings out Humanity as well being forced to bury the pilots who wash up on the island along with the packages from the wreck and he takes their ID s as a way of contacting their families should be they get back even creating a marker where they are buried One of the scariest elements of the film is how solitary he feels on this island screaming out for anybody to hear him in case the island is populated But only the sound of the ocean answers him and it s not a sound that means rescue A light in the distance at night indicates there s something out there but he s unable to manage the massive waves coming his way so it s a lost cause You never realize how powerful water is unless you re surrounded by a lot of it although you do get to see a bit of its power here as he is knocked into coral reefs that cut up his legs very badly The stars at night are indeed big and bright but they re not enough to give him comfort especially when the rains come So forget Survivor and even Swiss Family Robinson Being alone in a situation like this is Hell on Earth and for two thirds of the movie Tom Hanks is alone and he really doesn t get to say much It s a performance of silent excellence although in the beginning I was rather irritated by him So the film grows on you even though it is rather over long but in a sense it flys by too There s a bit of humor as he opens up all of the washed ashore FedEx packages with one thing being a little nod to his star making sitcom Bosom Buddies Even a pair of ice skates can make a good coconut cracker and sharpen a stick to catch food and create fire The film is both uplifting and depressing and you hope for it to end up triumphant But as long as Hanks retains his hope the audience has hope to and that will keep the audience engaged throughout,8.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7819073/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2007,Not as bad as some Zemeckis films,I m currently going through another one of my watch films that I truly think I m going to hate phases After all this IS a Robert Zemeckis film It does violate one of my rules because I truly like Tom Hanks I ve been a fan ever since I first saw him as Kip in Busom Buddies back in 79 I think he s terrible whenever he s a serious actor like in Forrest Gump or Philadelphia so he s much better here with the hope of an Oscar as far off as a pending rescue Anyway not as bad as I had thought but way too long The official running time is 143 minutes and could have easily been trimmed by 20 minutes The rescue scene proves that when this director wants to just cut to the chase he s more than capable of doing so It s probably the best scene in the film as it comes very unexpectedly and is terrifically shot You only see that Hanks sees the ship and they just cut right from there to him on a what else FedEx plane They could have dragged things out here with a ton of over dramatics but they didn t The ending was decent Of course he delivered the unopened package but I m glad we didn t find out what was in it Revealing that was a no win situation If it was something completely mundane it would have been another unneeded scene And if was a cell phone well that would have been too contrived The one contrived thing people dredge up is the whole FedEx Product Placement framework Zemeckis claims that FedEx didn t pay a nickel for it and I believe him If I were FedEx I wouldn t have put money into any film that had one of my jets going down but I d cooperate with it for free I m sure that the Hollywood types TRIED to extort from FedEx but settled for their help instead If I were a director I definitely would rather use a real corporation in a film like this than a made up one How many times have you seen a movie with a made up corporation and it becomes almost distracting because you just KNOW who it s supposed to be anyway Well I guess that every movie deserves at least one viewing and I m not sorry I spent the including commercials three hours watching this one I love movies and you have to expect the bad with the good with the mediocre The most amazing thing about a major Hollywood movie like this is the amount of people in the credits Seems so simple a film to me but my rough count comes in at almost 500 on the crew alone,5.0,4.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1632294/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2001,"The Decline and Fall of ""Cast Away""",Cast Away has a brilliant performance from Tom Hanks solid direction from Robert Zemeckis and an intriguing plot from writer William Broyles The film quickly grows out of slow beginning to build to the fantastic island sequence which leaves the audience hungry for the final climax Yet Cast Away squanders all these advantages and crashes in the last act Why did a movie with such potential self destruct Some points 1 Turning the film into a two hour FedEx commercial was disgraceful and unnecessary The family is eating Christmas dinner and what do they talk about FedEx Hanks and a friend are flying in a plane and what do they talk about FedEx Who greets Hanks upon his return to civilization the president of FedEx The story would have been much better served with a fictional shipping company which would have preserved key aspects of Hanks character but not insulted the intelligence of the audience People paid to see a movie not a FedEx commercial 2 The studio ad campaign which made a super human effort to give away the ending of the film I don t know who was responsible for the second trailer but I would advise studios not to hire them 3 A poor screenplay from Broyles who came up with a good idea but lacked the talent too properly execute it Top on the list is the failure of Tom Hanks character to undergo any kind of change or growth after suffering through a life altering adventure he emerges as the exact same man as when he started He remains optimistic and cheerful never displaying any anger or bitterness You would think that a man who was stranded on an island for four years and lost the love of his life would be at least a little upset or depressed And after spending these four years alone living in the most primitive conditions he needs no time to adjust to modern civilization except that he doesn t like sleeping in his bed He also feels a need to apologize to everyone he meets for being marooned the island something akin to apologizing for being hit by a drunk driver And the final scene with Helen Hunt looks more like it was written for a romantic comedy in fact that argument could be made for the entire final act which is filled with site gags 4 Casting Helen Hunt What a waste of talent She receives no billing justifiably see this is Tom Hanks movie from beginning to end and has a relatively small role Better for Hunt to devote her considerable abilities to a worthier project and for Zemeckis to cast a less well known up and coming actress that might surprise the audience Cast Away is a movie in three parts a decent but slow moving opener a fantastic middle and a disastrous end It s a movie that could have and should have been better On a scale of 1 10 with 5 being average and 10 being a masterpiece I am forced to give Cast Away a 5 making Cast Away a discount theater or rental movie,5.0,8.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565561/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2001,A waste of film,At the end of this film and found myself just saying why why would anyone bother to make this film It didn t appear to cover any new ground it wasn t a true story so seemed rather pointless The acting was fine and some of the cinematography was good but there were some basic errors The whale scene was poor the scene in Moscow was a joke If anyone has visited Red Square it s behind a number of pedestrian areas and although in special circumstance can be access via road why would you Oh because to show you re in Russia you have to have the backdrop of Red square The scene in question was impossible so I assume it was computer generated The clich scene with Helen Hunt was so Hollywood it was a bit sad Not to mention that she didn t waste too much time getting married and having kids he was only gone just over 4 years Overall I didn t hate the film it was a bit boring but I just could see why anyone would be interested in such a poor uninteresting story,3.0,8.0,20.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565849/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2001,"Good performance by Tom Hanks, good sequences on the deserted island, but the movie really only succeeds by a margin. *** (out of four)",CAST AWAY 2000 out of four By Blake French this comment on Cast Away does contain material of a spoiling nature Cast Away starts on a fairly entertaining note but devolves into a contrived love story and becomes buried in tedious sequences in which its characters have nothing to do The main character spends most of the movie s dreadfully long running time alone on a desolate island but we determined from trailers and TV ads that the character is retrieved after four years which kind of eliminates the tension of whether or not he will get off the island alive Tom Hanks plays Nick Noland a systems engineer for Federal Express who intends to wed his long time girlfriend Kelley Helen Hunt after he returns from a business trip over the south Pacific We are not surprised when his plane encounters a horrible storm During one of the most intensely convincing crash sequences ever made the aircraft plummets into the ocean below miles off course Nick is the sole survivor finding a resting place on a deserted tropical island Time passes he builds shelter losses hope but nonetheless survives If you are not aware of his eventual rescue after four years then you are not among the movies target audience The story really focuses on Nick starting his life over and overcoming extreme odds He finds out that Kelley became married and the rest of society has assumed his death Nick s determination is encouraging but the movie needs more detailing survival on the island The scenes on the island are the movies best The film is very careful not to become idle There are constantly new situations and conflicts being introduced even though their scenes are often slow moving and tedious Tom Hanks does an exceptional job as the only real character in the film all other s are plot devices There are a few attempts to introduce side characters but in a movie like this that is nearly impossible although the actors do a reasonable job with what little screen time they behold Director Robert Zemekis stays focused on a consistent narrative instead of going back and forth between characters like the mediocre Six Days Seven Nights This is a thought provoking situation but most of us already know how the plot concludes The actual conclusion itself is actually dissatisfying and inconclusive Cast Away is still a good production well made and beautifully crafted I liked the directors consistent style and focused narrative the plane crash sequence and I give the film a marginal recommendation,7.0,6.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565854/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2014,A masterpiece,Entertaining moving and powerful A masterpiece of cinema Few actors could carry a movie solo as Tom Hanks essentially does here We feel as if we are right there on the island with him feeling the initial panic the frustrations of getting food and making fire counting the days battling the loneliness struggling to keep it together And the emergency dental procedure ow The length and pacing of the movie suits the subject matter brilliantly Time passes slowly when you re marooned So many movies rush their ending leaving the climax right to the end but this one does not with over 30 minutes of it occurring after the rescue The denouement deals with Chuck trying to find his place in society again and the resolution of his relationship with Kelly,9.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2954686/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,"Don't wish away time, don't even try to speed it up",What a superb masterpiece Tom Hanks really shines in this gripping tale of life before during and after a plane crash at sea The directors use of imagery pause sound and silence is fabulous if you tend to admire film for these little details This one is full of lines and circles I have rewatched this film over 10 times and I am still spotting new things To keep a film so interesting when 2 3rds is only one actor requires great craft At no point in the film do we lose empathy for our character and there is always movement and growth Most of all the film brings you into the main characters struggle By the end of the film you will be able to say yes I would have needed a friend like Wilson and yes I will always be happier here than on a deserted island But what you will never say again to your loved ones is Be Right Back,9.0,4.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4574773/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2011,Cast Away,CAST AWAY 9 3 10 Director Robert Zemeckis Writer William Broyles Jr The greatness of a film is normally traced to the director there are no two ways about that We seldom know who the writer is and are even less curious as to who it might be Cast Away is a case in point it made me shout half way through the film who the hell wrote this One of the finest stories of the 21st century there is much more this film talks about than what it was given credit for The director Robert Zemeckis Forest Gump fame needless to say has done a brilliant job but what needs serious mention is the writer William Broyles Jr The writer marooned himself for a week on an island to understand what people do in survival situations and consulted several survival experts Cast Away deals with the very basics of human life it pokes the viewer with questions we never ask ourselves Or maybe the need to ask these questions never arise Why are we here The film has a strong existential undertone and Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland a FedEx employee marooned on an island after a plane crash has given one of the finest performances of his career The film deals with the struggle of a man who must survive for the sake of surviving Chuck after repeated attempts has given up hope of returning to the civilized world and after realizing he has no control even over the way he wishes to die he simply lives on with the memory of his would be wife Kelly Frears Helen Hunt During the period when Broyles had marooned himself on an island a ball came in with the tide and pop came the idea of the inanimate character Wilson Broyles highlights how a man is so helpless and no better than a rock if his existence is not recognized by another The character of Wilson has given the writer some creative liberty to make the film something not close to a silent film and this stroke of genius mixed with some luck has been craftily used The cinematography is commendable and the almost one sided conversations throughout the film are interwoven with hidden philosophies and memorable humor An emotional poetry of love fate and belonging Cast Away is a milestone in Hollywood cinema To breathe so much life meaning and humor into a subject so dark and tragic needs pure genius Chuck s longing for Kelly and his ultimate acceptance of his fate in the final scene between them is a timeless poem that will outlive the film s critics and lovers Man needs to belong that is the very crux of him Don t forget this This film won t let you,10.0,4.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2420330/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2014,A heart breaking and compelling masterpiece,If you do not enjoy Cast Away there s something seriously wrong with you That s all I need to say Anything else could give things away From the moment the story begins not the movie the story I cannot look away and every moment afterwards Progressive intriguing heart breaking unmissable There are many reason CastAway is widely renowned Tom Hamks a one man show the true story of survival and the power of hope and a pretty decent IQ SPOILER One thing that was brilliant was his connection with Wilson and the denial he had of the fact that this blood faced volleyball was nothing but that I know it s a soccer ball but I cried like a big ol baby when he drifted away,10.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3110688/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2008,A fine effort that falls a bit short due to a couple of poor choices,Cast Away centres on Chuck Noland Tom Hanks a FedEx employee stranded on a deserted island after his plane crashes Entrenched in a desperate struggle for survival he faces constant physical and emotional hardships It s a high concept movie that harks back to the classic novel Robinson Crusoe This was a demanding role for Tom Hanks and he ably carries the picture The middle portion of the film is basically all Tom Hanks with his only interaction carried on with a volleyball that he transforms into a makeshift companion Unfortunately the film s other big name Helen Hunt delivers a performance that really makes you wonder how she ever won an Oscar She and Hanks have absolutely no chemistry together and her poor acting makes the role even more unappealing The surprising thing about the film is how it turns a simple story of survival into an engaging film Obviously life on a deserted island is bound to be somewhat uneventful but Hanks Zemeckis nevertheless retain our interest The concluding portion of the film however leaves much to be desired and nearly ruins the film Part of this is due to Hunt s performance but the storyline is hokey to begin with Director Robert Zemeckis delivers an attractive looking film with a wealth of fine outdoor cinematography Also worth noting is the sound design which really enforces the sense of realism on the island Alan Silvestri s score is wisely dormant during this time which gives it greater impact when featured at other times All in all the entire film is marked by high production values The film s glaring flaws do not outweigh the more polished elements but it is disappointing to see the film nearly derailed by a couple of poor choices Nevertheless the film is certainly worth watching for the good parts,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1992392/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2012,No Q&A here,If you are looking for a life lesson this movie stubbornly refuses to teach you anything It modestly shows what you already know You will give up almost anything just to live because you re human and humans are survivalists It carefully hides what you normally look for in a life lesson story what makes life worthwhile What reward is there for all the pain and toil you may have suffered in the name of survival That s exactly why this movie could be most uplifting to watch AND AT SAME TIME brutally honest about the human situation There would always be some book some authority some self appointed life coach along to show you this is how life works this is the meaning of life this is the big answer and it s almost inevitable you fall for those at some point What normally happens is you try to live the way they tell you fulfilling some goals failing most finally become disappointed in their big answer Confused and cynical you move on to the next stage of your life Yet you still struggle you still try for something you know absolutely nothing about with no logical reasons to ever achieve anything All the while life beacons you on with mystery and you cannot help but to walk on This move is a commentary on life on humans Those who thought this movie is ambiguous are perhaps looking for a life Q A I can assure you you would find no answers here,10.0,9.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2695782/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2007,I watch this movie once a year.,I saw this film in the theater and had to buy it when it came out on VHF I usually watch it once a year The only reason I m writing is because I have seen so many reviews that say it is uninteresting slow and even confusing I find it none of these and can t understand anyone coming to that conclusion First Tom Hanks where is there a finer actor Second the story Excitement from the start Then as he lives his next four years you have to wonder how he can cope with the situation and what you could have down any differently He beats the island not by luck but by his own ingenuity Coming home to his fianc e can he fall back into the old life and live happily ever after or will there be problems Can the problems be overcome And what happens at the crossroad Does he go to the farmhouse or on down the road How can this film be considered uninteresting,8.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1603843/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2001,"Hanks says a lot with so little, but what is in the box?",I was so upset when I saw commercials for Cast Away I mean how much of the movie do you have to let me know about before hand I would have enjoyed the movie more if 80 of it wasn t shown to me in the commercials That being said Cast Away was a very enjoyable movie Especially since Tom Hanks is such a brilliant actor He says so much without saying much at all He is a very expressive actor who lets his facial expressions and body language tell it all The movie was actually well paced I have heard many complaints that this movie was slow and boring As I have said before in other reviews if you can not enjoy anything more thought provoking than the latest N Synch album or the latest episode of Dawson s Creek than this movie is not for you I do have one question though What is in the box I guess I ll have to scour the DVD for an easter egg with that information Hey maybe I ve watched too many episodes of Gilligan s Island Yeah that s it I m all screwed up like these N Synch fans just in a different way,7.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566044/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2013,"Admirable, but couldn't get into it",I had trouble getting into Cast Away right from the start A lot of that has to do with Hanks who I m just not a big fan of And that long FedEx speech while somewhat interesting was just not anything that would really happen I was feeling bored and restless but I knew the real movie was to come and the plane scene was pretty stunning and very intense so that gave me hope Once he made it to the castaway section well I really respect the movie for it s gritty almost wordless portrayal of a man with no camping skills grimly pushing himself to survive It s very brave to offer so little dialog But I just didn t feel it I saw what the film was doing I appreciated what it was doing but I did not connect viscerally with the story I m not sure if this is because of my feelings about Hanks or because of the direction which to me seems a little too Hollywood to really capture the pain and struggle People love this movie and I can see appealing things about it but I gave up after an hour of just not caring,5.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2806358/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2014,Still entertaining after 14 years,This is the kind of Hollywood movie I really like I ve seen it three times now and after 14 years it is still hugely entertaining Hanks is fantastic here This role was perfect for him and he really gives it his all I suppose it s because I enjoy all castaway films however this is a particularly good one Who hasn t dreamed of giving it all up and spending a long period on an island like this To me this movie is pure escapism Unlike Chuck Noland I m sure I wouldn t need a Wilson The main star in this movie is not Hanks but the island of Monuriki Fiji I really wonder whether there is any island like this left in the world anymore Has anyone been truly lost on a deserted island in recent years Most castaways seem to be voluntary nowadays Is something like this even possible in modern times And aren t most beaches in the Pacific covered in garbage We ve already ruined it all haven t we I suppose I could have done without the FedEx promotion However this didn t ruin the film for me I suppose it s all a metaphor for a harsh uncaring universe Sh t happens and when it does you have to get off your a s stop blaming the world and make the best of it This movie could not have gone wrong with Zemeckis at the helm Broyles as the writer and Hanks in the main role Kudos to them all for this great movie It s worth about 8 5 I can t decide whether to give an 8 or 9 but for now I ll round it up I think of this as one of my favourite movies,9.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2963434/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2006,Engrossing,Robert Zemeckis will probably never again reach the heights of Forrest Gump but I m glad he continued making quality movies such as this one Like Forrest Gump this movie is one of a kind it s unlikely we ll ever see another movie that takes the risks that this one did To make a movie where over three quarters of it is just Tom Hanks half naked and not talking takes a lot of guts and a lot of skill So did Forrest Gump and Robert Zemeckis pulls it off again though not quite with the same knack for weaving sentimentality into genuine drama that he displayed with Forrest Gump The first two hours or so of the movie is brilliant Zemeckis and Hanks present us with Chuck Noland a by the clock or die FedEx supervisor who is obviously in love with Kelly Frears Helen Hunt who just as obviously loves him back He boards a plane to Malaysia to deliver some packages and tells her he ll be right back The plane crashes in the Pacific Chuck is the only survivor and is washed up on a deserted island And there is where the real movie begins We see Chuck learn how to survive and fend for himself in sequences that could have been slow and tedious but with the realism in which they are presented become fascinating Tom Hanks s performance is just plain great He takes up most of the screen time and Zemeckis lets us see into his passion and despair Hanks in fact never takes a wrong step It is the screenplay that trips up in the last 20 minutes of the production Some people say the ending feels tacked on I disagree most of the ending is just fine and fits right into this examination of what a real person would do in a situation like this However a few of Chuck s lines near the end strike a forced note not because of Hanks delivery but because one feels that no one could say something that cheesy well Even so this is quite an experience Not as creative as Forrest Gump to be sure but who cares I don t think Zemeckis will ever try to beat his masterpiece and if he keeps making movies like this one he won t need to This is good enough for me,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1486981/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2005,Greatly Enjoyed!,I was not a Tom Hanks fan when I approached this movie Probably my favorite of his projects up to this point was Bosom Buddies and yes that includes Saving Private Ryan I swore and threw stuff at my TV when he won his Oscars What in hell were people thinking giving this guy awards for his saccharine watery eyed everyman schtick This kind of acting belonged in ibuprofen commercials Then I saw Cast Away I was nervous at first although the prologue contained nothing overtly vomitous it was still way too cute for my sensitive palate Cute boring guy s cute boring girlfriend thinks he works too much he very cutely very boringly tricks her into thinking he s not going to propose etc Again to the filmmakers credit the cute stuff was approached with a pretty subtle hand but it doesn t take much to make me gag Then the plane goes down and the movie turns into something else part silent film part philosophical indie part horror movie The direction is really quite amazing especially coming from Robert Zemeckis Who knew he had it in him to combine such beautiful cinematography with such powerful imagery the spear fishing transition is an incredible movie moment all in the context of what can only be thought of as an introspective non story Who knew that he was so tuned in to the power of silence Who knew that he or anyone could milk honest to God tears from a man keeping himself sane through his friendship with a volleyball There were times when I couldn t believe this thing had played in mainstream theaters it was so quiet and strange and sad It had almost none of the usual crowd pleasing crap and that was beautiful And yes Tom Hanks is good very good And I was ready for him to bomb believe me I may have even smiled at the idea of him marooned on an island with no food Where s your watering eyes now Buffy But he surprised me his performance was completely subtle and completely believable and completely sad He probably should have gotten the Oscar this time But of course it couldn t really last and in the final act the cuteness does creep in again But it doesn t really matter You can t take that middle section away from me and in this case that s enough Much has been made out of the endless parade of FedEx logos and you don t have to be a film school graduate to notice and laugh at the over the top mise en scene But who really cares about that All in all the beginning and ending make my grade something of a compromise but I definitely recommend checking this one out 8 out of 10,8.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1147688/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,More Than Just A Soccer Ball,A man obsessed with work time and materialism finds himself in a predicament where none of that matters other than surviving after his plane crashes The movie is about more than just a man losing it on an island and it is about more than a man who becomes separated from his wife but it is about a person who re contextualizes modern life from the perspective of having literally nothing and building a brand new life for himself all the while holding on to just a glimmer of hope that he will be able to return and live his life in a way that truly matters to him,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7992116/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2013,Cast Away — A lone survivor on a deserted island in the middle of the Pacific,Cast Away shows you what life would be for a lucky shipwreck or plane crash survivor on a deserted island in the Pacific It s tough and very lonely The movie does an excellent job of showing us that and also of setting up the character s life and what would happen after he returns home It is a drama but it s not something designed to upset the viewer Everything is done right the editing the soundtrack the camera shots the sets the costumes the accessories the scenario the dialogs and the story Tom Hanks is perfect a high note in his career without a doubt He brings excellent dramatic emotions to the screen as well as incredible poise in the loneliness of his character and his defeated look not to mention going to incredible dietary length to get really emaciated The only negative things I ve found are not that noticeable First the Christmas family dinner is a bit over done in true Hollywood fashion Second the sea during the crash is obviously set in a large artificial basin and the huge waves are CG Third the night time scenes on the island don t look real That being said it s a must see,9.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2757129/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2001,"It is ""Cast Away"", not ""Castaway.""",The title is significant We normally think of the word castaway as a noun referring to the person But this film is Cast Away a verb and its adverb which literally mean to throw fling or hurl from a place or position and that is precisely what happens to Chuck Tom Hanks He is thrown from his time controlled life and into one with a totally different set of priorities Spoilers follow This movie project was conceived by Tom Hanks inspired by an account he heard of someone who actually was stranded on rocks at sea and the experience so terrified him that he never wanted to see that place again Hanks and his writer enlisted the help of survival experts and much of what is depicted on the island is plausible The project spanned about 5 years and actual filming was done in 2 phases before and after Hanks lost 50 to 60 pounds Chuck is a ground ops expert for FedEx and his whole life is governed by the clock When he goes to Russia he ships himself a digital clock to show them how slow their delivery is He has to fly around the world on short notice A cargo explosion over the Pacific causes the plane to ditch and only he survives washing up the next day on a small island Several surrounding islands were removed digitally He has been cast away far away where no one will find him Suddenly time becomes unimportant and that is reinforced over the next 4 years on the island As survival experts tells us the 4 things for physical survival are water food shelter and fire For emotional survival someone to share things with For the latter Chuck finds Wilson which started out as a volleyball in one of the FedEx packages that washes ashore Opening packages was a defining moment for Chuck since it goes completely against what his job stands for Opening the packages is a first acknowledgement that he may not be found He learns how to open coconuts for water and food by accidentally splitting a rock which gave him a sharp blade He learns to take rain runoff from large leaves How to spear fish A hatchet from a pair of ice skates A net from a dress Wood friction and kindling to make a fire for warmth and cooking And a cave for shelter A calendar from a beam of light entering the cave This element of time becomes a tool rather than a captor as it allows him to calculate when winds will be favorable for sailing out to sea The writers initially wanted a discovery and rescue on the island but Zemeckis director said that wouldn t work Chuck had to reach for himself the point where he would make his rescue by risking death at sea A familiar theme The Truman Show and The Matrix come to mind So Chuck makes rope from bark and builds a raft with a sail from half of a portable toilet that washes ashore Another defining moment was when he cleared the waves saw his home disappear and knew it was now a new game him against the sea Back home after a Russian ship rescue for Chuck it is like a resurrection Nothing is the same His girlfriend Helen Hunt is married and has a daughter FedEx and efficiency are no longer important In the very last scene after he delivers a package that had been with him for 4 years on the island with a note your package kept me alive we see him meet the beautiful redhead sculptor in rural north Texas As he ponders which fork in the road to take we see in his face that the sculptor may in fact be the beginning of his new life his second chance that will be totally different I am glad that the writer and director took the moral road in having Chuck tell his old girlfriend you need to go home rather than any hints at splitting up her marriage even though they were obviously still in love with each other Life gives us choices and we have to make them wisely and with integrity Why was this film made I believe to show what it is really like on a desert island and how coming to grips with aloneness and survival can have such an impact on a person and his priorities The experience is not at all like what may have been depicted in older films like Robinson Crusoe and Blue Lagoon or the TV series Gilligan s Island which each come off like a pleasant long vacation And to perhaps show us how easy it is to become wrapped up in a time controlled rat race without soaking up what is around us I thoroughly enjoyed this film and the DVD extras I found the Dolby Digital track slightly more interesting than the DTS track The optional commentary track clarified some points about the story but mostly addressed location challenges and techniques for sound and film I rate this one 8 of 10 It was difficult to make and was made well still the story is not particularly groundbreaking,0.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565913/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2016,Tom Hanks is all alone of a tiny South Pacific island,Chuck Noland is an executive with global delivery company FedEx and he is obsessed with punctuality that is until the plane he is travelling on goes down in the South Pacific during a storm He is the sole survivor and when the storm is over his life raft has washed up on a small island He quickly establishes that there are no other people around and it isn t much longer before he realises that there is no immediate likelihood of rescue as the plane was four hundred miles away from its designated flightpath due to the storm All Chuck has to survive is his punctured raft a few FedEx packages that washed ashore and the limited food on the island He will learn how to exist in a far more primitive manner lighting fires without matches cracking coconuts and catching fish he will also have to cope with no medical help when he injures himself His only company on the island is Wilson a volleyball that he has drawn a face on and increasingly talks to whether this is a sign of insanity or a method of preventing it is hard to say The only other things keeping him going it the knowledge that he has a loving fianc e back in his hometown and one FedEx package that he didn t open and is determined to deliver one day For a film that is over two hours long surprisingly little happens once our protagonist has been marooned on his island that does not mean it is boring though This is almost entirely down to Tom Hanks performance as Chuck as we don t see another living soul from the time of the crash till almost the end of the film That is not to say that nothing happens and his location means that things that would merely be unpleasant become life threatening Some of these events are fairly wince inducing such as the time he is cut on coral and the less said about how he deals with a bad tooth the better Without going into too much detail the film s conclusion is suitably bittersweet As previously stared Hanks is great the camera is on him for almost the entire film and he makes us believe in his character even when he is having a conversation with a volleyball The rest of the cast inevitably have much smaller roles but they are impressive enough too Overall I d certainly recommend this film to anybody who doesn t need none stop action,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3539995/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2014,Awesome,I could go to lengths to point out why this movie is great why the haters are wrong what great craftmanship is at work here but why should i if i can make it as simple as this this movie makes you genuinely cry over a man who loses a volleyball enough said sadly i have to post at least 10 lines so let my just add that i think this movie has a lot a LOT of meaning but it will probably not appeal to you if you absolutely need nonstop action and special effects to enjoy a movie but then again personally i think the action that IS in the movie is some of the best you will ever see the plane crash sequence terrifying the fights against the waves brutal in your face zemeckis does a fine job of translating the fight man vs environment onto the screen this movie is prove that he understands directing his craft is totally developed and he uses the tools of filmmaking like a master painter uses his brushes no go see this if you haven t already this movie was an instant classic and will stand the test of time and be remembered and archived as a defining one of the shipwreck genre damn it s already 14 years old and many many of its scenes are iconic if you happen to have seen it some ears ago and watch it again you will probably find that these scenes have survived in your memory just like Chuck does on his island they stick with you because they mean stuff and yes the movie won t let you go without an aesop of sorts but the way it comes across isn t forced or cheap it comes very naturally from within the story,10.0,4.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2994145/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2003,You`re gonna stare...,possible spoilers I am not going to write the review on this picture If you don t mind I would rather briefly write about my feelings I watched Tom Hanks with an open mounth wasn t able to say anything I was laughing when he was talking to his friend Wilson when they argued or when they made the fire without lighter together I was crying when he felt desperate or when he came back home This movie is not that kind piece of art which is made by new method some kind of art experiment you know this movie is not the revolution in film making But there are at least two things which make this title worth seeing The first one is as I mentioned before the performance of Tom Hanks It his very hard to write about it it is just needed to be seen The second reason why to watch Cast Away is the deep humanity of the story I assure you that your gonna think about it for a weeks There is nothing more to write about I was realy touched My rate is 10 10,10.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566245/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2014,Much more than I expected,Spoilers Much more than I expected Disaster adventure movies are generally quite predictable Plot disaster survive rescue That s it Hard to rate a movie highly that just follows that formula and has very little room to stray from it That s what makes Cast Away so good Yes there are elements of that formula in it but it has so much more than that Director Robert Zemeckis carefully sets up the background of the lead character especially the romantic angle The survival part meticulously details how he works out how to survive and how he survives The movie doesn t end with a rescue it goes beyond that showing how the lead character has to restart his life Great performance by Tom Hanks in the lead role Good support from Helen Hunt but the best supporting performance has to go to Wilson the Volleyball Solid stuff Not perfect The ending feels like it was drawn out too much and the director tried to make something profound out of the unprofound The movie should have ended a few scenes earlier than it did,8.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2980323/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2011,A friend called Wilson.,For me this movie summed up much more that Tom Hanks being alone on a desert Island after a plane crash This film hit home real loneliness in the shape of a ball with a face painted on to give Tom Hanks character someone to talk to and the efforts Tom Hanks goes to to retrieve his ball friend Wilson when it gets knocked off Tom Hanks raft during an escape from the island will make you weep Because deep downside we all know what it s like to feel lonely even among friends we can feel lonely because we are largely a pretentious society living purely on the outside letting our friends see just what we want them to see We do take each other for granted When Tom Hanks finds this ball among shipwrecked goods he inflates it and paints a face in red on it and whilst on this island Wilson is his only friend starring at him with a smiling face from a Rock Hanks has placed him on Personally I found the relationship between Tom Hanks character and his desperate need to create a friend and talk to it and even argue with it more moving than the actual picture Disaaster movies are two a penny in Hollywood even when the relationships have been built up so we all have someone to root for to care about But Tom Hanks and his friend Wilson beat the lot of them I will finish by telling you this in the raft incident and Tom Hanks loses Wilson to the sea and it s current you will feel for Tom Hanks if you don t you just ain t human,10.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2402495/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2014,Difference between living and surviving - exemplified,The commitment to create a marvel does not stop with the director it sure goes a long way than that This movie sure proves the point and when you look at Tom Hanks in the start of the movie and then on after the mishap the physical transformation and the commitment to make this movie work from the actor is commendable Creating a story out of delicate issues such a plane crash with a legit company name FedEx we are aware there will not be any heroism or any racy sequences which is a selling point for a commercial potboiler But if the creators can compromise on the fact the movie can be rated Documentary then a real life event can be adapted But this movie is neither a documentary nor it has stupid goose chases Still wins in every aspect of movie making and the credit goes to the director s mammoth effort and enacting it on the screen by Hero Many movies had limited characters with which the movie churns its story here it has been limited to ONE All over the movie you see Tom Hanks except for the start and the end Being a authoritative FedEx employee Tom hanks has sure got the grit to survive the ordeal and head back home from a deserted island In such movies the end is always predictable the hero lives to tell the tale else how could we even recreate his suffering Despite this fact the creators gives a gripping experience of his daily survival Effective utilization of the resource logic for his actions and the pain agony that the character goes through everyday are the selling point of this epic There has been very little use for special effects team but for the limited usage they have done a exceptional job The wreck is sure looks real and whole incident is eye catching If you look at it from point of a critic i am sure they would come up with flaws but from a common man point of view this movie is success in every way and shouldn t be missed,8.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2948431/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,"A modern version of ""Enoch Arden"" focused on the man's lonely survival",There s a good story behind the making of Cast Away that took six years from its initial idea to locations to a full year of filming with specific breaks and then final production Tom Hanks who stars as Chuck Noland had the initial idea for the film He then collaborated with Bill Boyles and Bob Zemeckis for parts of the story Boyles did the screenplay and Zemeckis directed the movie For all of that this is a unique film in how it came about something quite out of the ordinary way of books plays tales or published stories making it onto film The core of this movie is one man s survival on an island for four years The filming of that Hanks portrayal and all aspects of this part are superb But the last part after Noland s rescue at sea is melodrama To some extent it can t help but be that And this is the part that clearly marks this film as a modern adaptation of Enoch Arden There s no information readily available that makes the connection But one has to think that Tom Hanks or any one of the other moviemakers had known about the early films based on Alfred Lord Tennyson s poem of that title Surely they at least must have seen one or more of the 1940 films that starred Cary Grant Fred MacMurray Melvyn Douglas Irene Dunne and Jean Arthur or the 1963 movie that starred Doris Day James Garner and Polly Bergen I think the last portion of the film after Noland s rescue takes the punch out of the film of the one man s struggle for survival In Enoch Arden there wasn t great publicity about a lost person being found and rescued So he could return to home anonymously after 10 years and see how his wife and family had moved on Then out of love for them and their well being he chose to go away and remain the man lost at sea and presumed dead That was a great ending for that poem and film But it wasn t possible for this film with the extensive news industry that looks for spectacular stories of any kind So everyone learns about Noland s survival and rescue When he returns home he meets his former lover and her husband and sees her at home with her child Initially he was outraged that she was married but after realizing he can t break up her family he moves on and the film presents an ending that is passable What might have lifted this movie to the realm of great and memorable films would have been a different original idea for the opening and ending in which to box the survival story The FedEx aspect is fine but the personal life of the lead needed to be changed Then the ending could be diverted from melodrama to something either uplifting or tied right back to the heroe s survival of the island Hanks is very good in his role and the filming and production qualities are all very good Perhaps Fox didn t want to make the connection to Enoch Arden because the film can t deliver on that film s impact and it can t be another comedy version,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6673563/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,begins to be almost fun,It is rather longer than it might be at the start and then at the end but during for the plane crash and the whole island time is splendid Tom Hanks is excellent for the first part and no dialogue and then really good as he chats away It appears at the beginning that he simply has a stupid number of parcels that had washed up as the FedEx from the crashed plane but gradually he finds them useful and it all begins to be almost fun,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7850119/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2006,Outstanding. A MUST SEE!!,I have to say I was utterly moved by this film This is watching it for the second time after its first release almost six years ago and I think it was better watching the second time Tom Hanks was amazing in his role especially when 80 of the movie is just him The whole story is an embodiment of struggle hope and the will to survive emotions every human being needs to experience It seems that some people have under rated this movie I just don t think they understood the real message behind it Wilson even though just a volleyball was a symbol of friendship he helped chuck in his journey of loneliness The part where chuck loses Wilson was so emotional it actually made me cry at that moment I forgot he was even a volleyball If you haven t seen this film then you re definitely missing out and if you didn t like it or at least appreciated it then you don t deserve to watch good movies like this I just wish Hollywood brings out more good ones like this one Great job Robert Zemeckis,10.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1390569/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2013,Marooned,Robert Zemeckis directed this compelling drama that stars Tom Hanks as FedEx executive Chuck Noland whose plane crashes into the ocean for an undetermined reason and he manages to swim ashore to a deserted island where he must learn to survive as he will be marooned there for several years Thoughts of his girlfriend Kelly played by Helen Hunt and a friend named Wilson a volleyball he discovers among the damaged packages keep him sane though his eventual rescue at sea will in some ways be just as difficult Superbly acted and directed film seems quite authentic and believable even if the later scenes back home seem like a bit of a letdown that may be part of the point,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2920619/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2023,Cast Away,Tom Hanks excels in this well put together depiction of the archetypal rather fastidious business executive who finds himself stranded after his plane crashes on a remote tropical island Completely ill suited for life without any modern conveniences but not without a brain cell or two he has to adapt la Robinson Crusoe to his new life of coconuts and whatever fish he can catch The story takes it s time but that all contributes well to the effectiveness of his performance as he must deal with the physical logistical and increasingly psychological challenges his predicament throws at him Loneliness and despair fight against his human nature to thrive and to survive and cause his creation of Wilson a sort of hybrid between a volleyball and a pineapple for company It was a Fed Ex plane which allows Robert Zemeckis to introduce some brief flashes of humour to lighten the mood it s astonishing what people think to send to each other and there is even a role for some ice skates to serve as a dentistry aid As it progresses we know that rescue is unlikely so are not surprised when his thoughts turn to venturing into the great and turbulent unknown on a raft held together by plant threads and video tape There isn t a great deal of jeopardy so the ending isn t really in doubt but the effort here by Hanks and some solid writing and directing create quite a compelling and at times un nerving film to watch I ve never really been one for the tropical island experience I m certainly not now,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9062585/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,Gump Island,Forest Gump gets shipwrecked on an island He finds a random soccer ball and paints a face on it and cuts a hole where the mouth should be Then he spends a few years cohabitating with his soccer ball which he calls Mr Wilson Wilson balls must have paid a pretty penny for product placement in this movie On the other hand depicting one of their balls as the container of several years of Tom Hanks love goo is not exactly a complimentary look to the Wilson company Though I guess it would appeal to a certain demographic Eventually Gump makes it back to the real world and finds out that his wife and kids were having a good time without him The movie ends with Gump at the sporting goods store buying another Wilson soccer ball,1.0,4.0,15.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8744978/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,Very impressive,I wasn t sure what to expect from this movie i kind of assumed it would be a melodrama not unlike Forrest Gump And that is how it began I thought it was going to be a very formulaic movie about a man who survives for a while on a desert island escapes and then reclaims his love Fortunately it is much more complicated than that Zemeckis and Hanks take a lot of risks in this film There is a great lack of dialogue This will alienate a large portion of the audience who is used to inane dialogue They do find a way around it after a short while by making a volleyball into a nonspeaking character with whom Hanks can converse This does not particularly help the majority of the audience to get more involved in the film In fact to most people it provided comic relief There were many in the theater who laughed whenever the volleyball Wilson made an appearance To a certain extent it was supposed to be funny actually there were several parts that made me laugh To a certain other extent they were completely serious BIG TIME SPOILERS several important critics have claimed that the last segment of the film is anticlimactic where Hanks is rescued and has to reconcile with Helen Hunt the love of his life after a prolonged period of mourning and supposedly false hope married another man Roger Ebert expressed his dislike for this section of the film I don t think he or any other critics with similar criticisms were paying any attention Yes the survival stuff on the island was very exciting and interesting to watch but the final sequence anchors the film and makes it truly special Hanks meeting with Hunt is so overwhelmingly powerful that it brought me to tears For God s sake the only thing that kept him alive on the island was her picture Don t you realize that to leave us without a resolution on the most important plot point is going to disable the film profoundly The scene where they meet is masterful It is extremely realistic and subtle in its emotions This must be Tom Hank s best performance and probably Hunt s also although she was masterful in As Good As It Gets too She is not in Cast Away for very long but I think she should be considered for an Oscar And since Hanks has won for far less good roles i e Philadelphia one of the most terrible pieces of garbage ever made in Hollywood to not nominate him would be sad and I am usually a Hanks detractor I like him but find him too unaffecting usually The finale of Cast Away has been equally debated In my opinion it was a small symbolic but tacked on event the delivery of a package that he decided not to open on the island because it had angel wings drawn on the side of the box I don t care how symbolically the character interpreted the wings as being that package could have contained something very useful and it would be ridiculous not to open it I am very glad that the film did not end with Hanks trying to get the woman in the truck whose package he delivered The real ending is actually quite beautiful Roger Ebert calls the final moment of the film a smile forced whimsy I did not notice a smile I did not interpret his expression as a smile in the least Instead it was a look of farewell His character is now letting go He is choosing to no longer try to run his own fate but just allow himself to be taken along where the world takes him Through his ordeal he knows that it is foolish to try to control fate The final decision he has to make is which of the four ways to go It ends quite beautifully END SPOILER I do have a couple of complaints the film begins very poorly with some very silly and formulaic scenes that establish Hanks businessman ethics If you ever find yourself on your knee outside of a car window about to propose to your girlfriend mere minutes before you step on a plane stop and think about it You are obviously setting yourself up for an imminent death Please avoid this situation at all costs The movie plot gods will strike you down I promise you The biggest pain in the neck in this movie was the CONSTANT NEVERENDING stream of product placements in this film It should have had a large credit at the beginning of the film Producer Fed Ex Tom Hanks character is a Fed Ex exec and the beginning of the film spends an outrageous amount of time telling the audience how good Fed Ex is 87 hours We might as well be the U S Mail I once ordered something to be delivered by Fed Ex They came four days after the company had told me they had shipped it They came to my door rang the doorbell which I cannot hear in my room and walked away without even knocking at the door I later found a note on my door that said that they would try again on the next delivery day Monday three days later between the hours of 8am and 4pm The U S Mail generally arrives at my house approximately 3 days after a company ships it and even on a saturday The only other problem is an annoying third act speech the sort of speech that reveals the point of the movie even though everyone in the audience should have already figured the meaning out already I still give this film a 9 10 It is the best Hollywood film of the year and is the only Oscar type film to deserve even consideration for most anything,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566096/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2018,Flashes of brilliance are held back by a slow opening and a thematic shift in the third act.,There are flashes of brilliance throughout Cast Away 2000 mostly during the daringly dialogue free mid portion when Hanks is stranded on the island It s when the story is told visually that it s at its most compelling with the central performance remaining captivating throughout and the sense of isolation feeling palpable It does have some pacing issues though including a slow opening that struggles to make you care about the character and an off pace third act that takes the focus away from survival placing it on living instead which works thematically but does seem a little dull compared to what came before it A film that can create a compelling relationship between a man and a volleyball has to be admired though 7 10,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4143586/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2020,Tom Hanks did it again,Cast Away is a survival drama movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks Helen Hunt and Nick Searcy The story of a FedEx employee who was living a great life with plans to settle with the woman he loves the most suddenly he met with a plane crash and got stranded on a deserted island with only one companion Wilson the volleyball and his life changes completely The movie depicts different aspects of Chuck s life The transformation of Chuck from an enthusiastic talkative person to a calm and controlled man A person stuck alone on a deserted island finds a companion in a volleyball and started treating it as a human There were two scenes which shows the real emotion of the person first when Chuck throws Wilson the volleyball in frustration from the cave and then searches frantically calling his name as if the volleyball will respond back and secondly when he tries to save Wilson the volleyball when it gets drifted in water from the raft while escaping from the island These two scenes shows pure emotion of human as we all must have or had something like this in our lifetime which we use to treat a living being and was or is part of our life The screenplay of the movie is evenly placed as the first 35 40 minutes he is shown as a dedicated employee who always prioritise work the next 1 20 hours is based on his struggles to survive from catching fish trying and succeeded in burning fire making arrangements for drinking water and then making a raft and the remaining time his reintroduction with the mankind in the form of a transformed man who is quite and calculated The only drawback I felt in the movie was the ending of the movie A happy ending wasn t expected and it was certain that his fianc would have moved on but still that section of the movie could ve been avoided To conclude it s a good survival movie with powerful acting by Tom Hanks as the movie is mainly focused on him and he had done a great job A must watch movie,8.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5750088/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2020,A Remarkable Adventure,This is the ultimate Robert Zemeckis film A man alone with a problem that he needs to solve a handful of tools at his disposal all of which he uses and long takes This is the movie that he was born to make and it s the movie he had been building up to with decades of experience Young Zemeckis could not have pulled off the quiet of Tom Hanks life on a deserted island like this Chuck is a FedEx employee who helps set up and fix foreign branches of the company He starts in Moscow establishing an office and talking endlessly about how Time is the ultimate enemy He lives his life by the clock The clock on the wall in the Moscow office is what that office is to operate by He s constantly referencing the time and how long it will take to do things He has a fianc e Kelly in Memphis Tennessee that he loves and tries to see as much as possible but his work just keeps pulling him away On Christmas Eve Chuck gets a message that something needs fixing in Asia so he jumps on a plane after a nice goodbye with Kelly that includes a potential engagement ring in a wrapped package and the cast away begins Robert Zemeckis is an incredibly talented and technical minded director so the idea that the crash sequence would be good is kind of baked into the cake of Cast Away However this crash sequence is amazing and might be the single best sequence Zemeckis ever put together The build up around the jostle that wakes Chuck up the storm outside the quick look at a screen showing them off course the increased turbulence the sudden explosion the loss of cabin pressure the crash the sinking fuselage the raft finding its way to the surface with Chuck desperately clinging on and then the camera pulling back slowly as Chuck a small figure on the big ocean only lit by lightning strikes gets steadily smaller and smaller It s a bravura sequence that uses image and sound perfectly planting the audience at the center of the chaos without ever losing sight of Chuck or the overall movement around him keeping the evolving action clear while providing us our emotional groundwork in Chuck Once on that island the movie markedly changes on purpose The first section of the film was loud and busy with Chuck dominating conversations constantly as he lived by a clock Suddenly there s no one to talk to and time doesn t matter That change is what makes the life on the island so stark Opening the movie with this would be one thing dropping us into it after thirty minutes of completely different modes of storytelling is something else The audience can feel as isolated and alone as Chuck as he calls out impotently to no one while quietly picking up a handful of floating packages on the shore and sorting them by destination of course and figures out how to survive The grounded nature of Chuck s search for a way to survive is compelling even as it covers small ground Fire of course is something that we can completely take for granted but when the only food Chuck can manage to eat is the meat of coconuts because crab legs are goop without being cooked we can understand the quiet determination and loud outbursts of frustration that grip Chuck as he tries to make fire for the first time This is the introduction of the other main character in the film Wilson the volleyball There s a basic narrative need to give Chuck someone to talk to without him just talking to himself and the creation of Wilson is a good place to direct that energy Born from his own blood after an accident with the fire sticks Wilson provides a face that Chuck can speak to sort out his thoughts and let the audience know what Chuck ends up planning to do That there is an emotional connection to Wilson at all is really derived from Chuck s very understandable need to simply have someone else in his life other than the sand and trees around him His sole companion for four years means something to him and because we can understand the depth of Chuck s plight we can understand that emotional connection to a smear of blood on a white volleyball Maybe we can or cannot share in it but we can certainly understand it There s a time jump of four years and the physical transformation of Hanks from one side of that jump to the other is rather stark The production famously shut down for an entire year when Zemeckis made What Lies Beneath with the same crew so that the pudgy Tom Hanks could slim down to his far thinner frame for the second half of the film but that s only part of the transformation Hanks was nominated for an Oscar in this role and he deserved that nomination The boisterous and gregarious fixer becomes incredibly different through those four years He s quieter and more manic on the island and when he gets off the island suddenly surrounded by the world he had so easily fit into before he s so quiet and small in comparison to who he was The man who was so comfortable in the middle of a crowded conversation now looks like he would rather sink through the floor than bear another minute of it but he s just too meek to do anything about it That personal transformation is far more impressive than the physical transformation The effort to get off the island is the sort of goal based narrative that Zemeckis was so familiar with This is really the core of the idea that this is the ultimate Zemeckis film the goal is the only thing for such a long stretch Chuck decides that he can use the half of a port a potty that washes up on his shore as a sail but he only has a few months to form the necessary rope build the raft stock it and launch it before the weather turns against him until the next year The effort to make all of that happens is surprisingly compelling because we have a clear goal clear stakes and a likeable protagonist that we can root for all wrapped up together and focused on with clear eyed purpose It helps that the combination of on location filming and special effects are so seamless that everything about the production feels completely real The advertising famously gave away the ending of the film in the trailer and made it clear that it was giving away the ending Occasionally trailers will show you shots from late in the film but in the context of the trailer you don t realize it the trailer for Eastern Promises has the final shot of the entire film in the trailer for example but it was obvious that the trailer was giving everything away Zemeckis called it a marketing decision based on research that showed that people liked to know exactly what they were getting before they walked in using McDonald s food as an example he could have potentially used popular police procedurals like CSI as another This really irritated some reviewers like Roger Ebert who couldn t get past the film s marketing to judge the movie and its ending on their own So let me talk about the ending and why it s great Chuck gets off the island and he s a different man He no longer cares about time but he does still love Kelly And yet it s been more than four years since he left She may have been a constant for him in a place without time but time continued on without him Kelly grieved and moved on marrying and having a daughter At the beginning of the movie Chuck was so concerned with the time around his job that he never made the time for Kelly the two needing to negotiate schedule books to discover when they would next see each other when Chuck gets called away for his fateful flight to Asia Now returned to Memphis he understands how to appreciate time and he can no longer have the one thing he wants most in the world He could have had her had he prioritized her staying home on Christmas instead of going to Asia but after he made that decision there s no turning back He has to move on just like she did It s a wonderful embrace of the central idea that runs through the whole film Cast Away is a great technical achievement which is no surprise from Zemeckis but it s also incredibly intelligent thematically and mature cinematically Zemeckis has grown into an incredibly assured filmmaker I hope he doesn t fall in love with weird computer animation though That would be weird,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6303347/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,One of the best Tom Hanks films,Castaway is a perfect Tom Hanks movie where he gets to showcase his skills as an actor Robert Zemeckis has directed a new take on the Robinson Crusoe saga with a man marooned on an island with nothing more than his perseverance and patience This may be an adventure film on the surface but there are underlying themes of loneliness loss and isolation Of course there are some stupendous scenes this being CGI obsessed in a good way Zemeckis The plane crash is a highlight and different from what we have seen in other films and the island scenes with the waves are amazing As mentioned above Hanks is so good you cannot picture anyone else in his role and his collaboration with the director keeps on flourishing they also made the critically lauded Forrest Gump Do not miss Castaway for anything,0.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4251110/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2000,No Tom is an island,Watch the ads for Robert Zemeckis new movie and you d think that this is a movie about a man stranded on a deserted island a la Robinson Crusoe So did I but Tom Hanks character doesn t wind up on the island until a good 20 minutes of filler material have been used Filler material in most movies is the kind of plot information that seems superfluous at first but is later tied into the plot itself So we re 20 minutes into a movie and finally see Chuck Noland Hanks on the island You can see where this review is headed can t you First off there s the title Cast Away Why not Castaway Why make it into two words A puzzlement to be sure I know I know nitpicking No it s not If it s two words it says to me someone has been cast away but Chuck hasn t been cast away he s been marooned Maybe the makers didn t want anyone to confuse it with the Survivor TV show I think they should have gone with the one word title but hey that s just me The movie is a little over two hours long and in the bulk of that time we follow Chuck s exploits on the island We see his trials his failures his successes and his thought processes And it all really is mesmerizing as long as you suspend some of your logic processes This happens with a lot of action adventure type movies because the focus is on what s happening not why it s happening Sometimes you ll see an illogical chain of events in an action movie and you ll dismiss it because you re there to see the action not to be bothered with the plot Well friends I am bothered by it I wondered how Chuck survived the plane crash and why he got out what looked like everything in his pocket just before the plane hit turbulence but once the trouble started he only grabbed his precious pocket watch I wondered if I was watching a long commercial for Federal Express see how many logos you can spot I ve seen some people say this is one of the top movies of the year Sorry I can t see that It s fun to watch but the compelling stuff in the middle is surrounded by a beginning and an end that slow down the pacing of the film immeasurably Sure I care about Chuck s beau Kelly Helen Hunt and I know that setting up their relationship at the outset is somewhat important But it s more than a little contrived when his last words to her before jumping on the plane are I ll be right back Come on All of the supporting plot surrounding his adventures on the island seems to be horribly contrived as if someone said Great love the whole island thing now throw in some more stuff so we can get over 2 hours out of it I mean it all seems almost tacked on and it s all too pat I will say this much though the ending is NOT cliched Hanks is better than I expected He s not really the adventurer type is he In some scenes with his scraggly beard and makeshift clothing he looks like Lawrence of Arabia or maybe Moses from The Ten Commandments He effectively shows emotion determination perseverence wit and ingenuity I d also say he ages well too but then you have to remember Robert Zemeckis filmed this movie in two installments so he could do What Lies Beneath this layoff allowed Hanks to transform from girly man Fed Ex dude to strapping strongman sort of Everyone else is just extraneous This is Tom s game,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566137/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,Hugely enjoyable,This is very good film The plot is intriguing and fresh which is remarkable given it is based on a book written hundreds of years ago The highlights are the plane crash not really a spoiler how else does he end up on a desert island in the middle of the Pacific which is truly terrifying and brilliantly filmed The whole Robinson Crusoe sequence is excellent too People say it is slow but the film is all about time and I think the pace reflects this incredibly well Tom Hanks performance is remarkable and totally believable It isn t a perfect film The Russia sequence is clich d as is the family dinner scene Also the corporate welcome home sequence is clumsily directed as if done in a hurry But the final act is very well observed and really quite moving The conumdrum of the waiting girlfriend having moved on with her life is very well delivered and leaves you thinking what would I feel if that all happened to me The epilogue is good too and leaving the hero standing at a cross roads physically and metaphorically is ultimately uplifting,8.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6437327/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2019,"Seen it a thousand times, now I get it",Caught it today on cable halfway It draws you in Picture composition is astonishing I guess that s just nature untouched Tom Hanks did a hell of a job going through all of the emotions of the character with nothing but his eyes and body language not only on the island but back home too It is to expect that poor movie goers will fall flat on the surface of the coconut and lack the patience and effort to crack it open and delight themselves with its heavenly waters That is to say to not see the island as a metaphor Isn t life an island limited physically Is Chuck crying for a ball or for a friend Isn t a friend someone who is the object of our hopes and joys The lose lose monologue he has drinking with a friend talking about his former girlfriend is perhaps the moment the character s deeper understanding of life occurs There s also a very tasteful for its subtleness criticism to the run market money global news no time to think way of life the dream But it s a hell of an advertisement of FEx and Wilson Is it not mocking them I also really like the end Unknown this way Unknown this way Unknown this way Home,10.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5221144/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2016,Masterpiece,Up until two days ago I had never seen Cast Away Not once in my life I know try not to have a heart attack I knew the whole story each and every beloved plot twist mapped out for me by eager friends word of mouth online fare and pop culture over the years I just never sat down and actually watched the darned thing Well I did two nights ago and damn if I didn t wish I d done that sooner It s every bit as incredible as I ve heard all this time and more so It s one thing to know everything about a film just because of its notoriety and quite another to see it obviously I experienced every scene every landmark event in the film for the first time ever and my foreknowledge of it did not dampen one wondrous second of the experience Few films bring you as close to their protagonist as this does for two and a half patient spellbinding hours in the life of a man whose path has taken a turn for the extraordinary Tom Hanks is the right guy for the job and then some He s immediately likable and exudes currents of good nature and humility Perfect casting choice He plays Chuck Noland a FedEx honcho with a busy life that scarcely makes room for his doting girlfriend Helen Hunt One Christmas eve he s forced to run out on her for an overnight package flight As we all know his plane crashes somewhere in the South Pacific and he s forced to survive on a deserted island for almost half a decade We feel every empty minute every momentous triumph right alongside Chuck from the first dazed stroll along the wave speckled beach of his new home to the final raging ditch effort to find his way back to civilization Director Robert Zemeckis let s this larger than life tale unfold with steady earnest shots and a down to earth score a very simplistic approach that let s Hanks do most of the heavy lifting And lift he does in a performance of sheer courage and transformative qualities We see Chuck go from suburban joe and real world businessman to a near feral being forged into something more than himself by the same forces that govern and mold the geography which he now inhabits while never losing his humanity in the wild chaos The time spent stranded is sandwiched between two segments that bookend the film in which we see his life in civilization before and eventually after his experience The impeccable pacing tricks the audience into feeling like we ve been watching this play out for as many years as he s been living it I mean this as a profound compliment to the filmmakers and not to say the film ever drags in fact for a two plus hour running time it feels surprisinly slight It all rests on Hank s shoulders and he carries it beautifully selling this man s plight with truth humour and resilience An experience for the ages and one that you should see right out of the gate in your cinematic exploration as opposed to waiting till your mid twenties like someone we know Masterpiece,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3488082/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2005,Enthralling Middle Section Marred by Opening and Closing,Cast Away opens with a relentless commercial for Fed Ex even with the crash When it absolutely positively has to be there the next morning and how that claim creates a certain work ethic around the world Cut off the beginning and ending and it s an absolutely terrific modern Robinson Crusoe minus Friday movie The waves were far more effective and realistic and terrifying than the touted ones in Perfect Storm Too bad the special effects won t get noticed precisely because they are so believable rather than fantastical The camera work on the water is excellent Tom Hanks is quite the Everyman as the whole audience wonders if they would be as inventive as he in surviving with an unusual set of resources The silence and Hanks s performance on the island are completely involving The entire audience questioned a closing gimmick that is simply a concluding Fed Ex commercial originally written 1 7 2001,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1243147/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2017,Cast Away Review,The film Cast Away centralizes its focus on a FedEx employee Chuck Noland Tom Hanks who is the sole survivor of an airplane crash only to be stranded on an island that is drastically off course Throughout Chuck s extended stay on the deserted island he battles isolation depravity and the will to survive After Chuck realizes he may never be found he battles the island both emotionally and physically in hopes of one day seeing his lover Kelly Frears Helen Hunt again Even though Chuck is faced with disparaging odds he manages to accomplish great feats while maintaining his sense of humor and his drive to survive The major theme in the film is the importance of relationships Throughout the film this theme was repeatedly highlighted in various scenes For instance every night Chuck would fall asleep while staring at the pocket watch Kelly had given him with her photo in it and in other scenes the camera would focus on the cave walls where he stayed revealing the multiple pictures of Kelly s face that Chuck had drawn Furthermore as Chuck battles the crushing isolation of being helplessly alone his desperation for communication and a relationship begins to show when he begins to build companionship with a volleyball that he names Wilson The bond between Chuck and Wilson becomes so strong that in a certain scene Chuck becomes angry at Wilson and throws him out of the cave only to rush out to the beach desperately trying to find him and apologize Chuck s sanity wavers as the time on the island stretches longer and as his hope begins to fade but with the help of his bond with Wilson Chuck is able to talk through his struggles both physical and emotional as Wilson seems to represent the rational side of Chuck s personality Similar to the Life of Pi Cast Away has a sense of dread and isolation that battle with the will of survival with metaphoric companions There are several techniques the director of Cast Away Robert Zemeckis uses that amplify the feelings and settings in the film to its viewers The camera angles that were used in multiple scenes were able to allow viewers to grasp the perils of Chuck s situation of being stranded on the island In one scene the camera was angled downward as Chuck leaned over the edge to retrieve rope at the island s highest peak this angle showed the danger of the task at hand for Chuck but also conveyed the intensity and tension of the moment Another scene that used angling was when Chuck was attempting to start a fire again the camera switched back and forth between Chuck s sweat covered face and the two pieces of wood he was using in his attempt to make an ember With each shift between Chuck s face and the action of rubbing the sticks together the camera zoomed in closer on his face with each shot This technique created a shared feeling of tension between the Chuck and the film viewers Another technique that was used was lighting in many night scenes where Chuck was in the cave the screen was almost black and all that was view able was the outline of Chucks face or body due to the faint moon beam the trickled in through the small opening at the top of the cave In another scene the cave was tinted with the glow of a fire that Chuck had created as he uses the orange glow to view his swollen gums on the blade of an ice skate Both dark scenes and even those lit by fire produce a feeling of solitude for the film viewer that instills the feeling of isolation Ultimately Cast Away is a story of never ending hope that is riddled with gut wrenching scenes and depicts the human nature and its need for companionship and relationships The old saying you never know what you have until its gone is amplified in this film as Chuck s love for Kelly never fades throughout his perilous journey,10.0,8.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3699573/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,An awesome movie.,A man stranded on a desert island has served as the premise for classic literature like Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson and has even figured into the recent fad of wildly popular and intellectually barren TV shows like Survivor In Robert Zemeckis s Cast Away it s two time Oscar winner Tom Hanks learning to crack coconuts and spear fish he ll doubtless acquire another nomination for this intense work Hanks has been stranded in outer space behind enemy lines and even in an evil toy store owner s office but this performance done with no other actors present during the majority of screen time tops all the others reaching the emotional level he acquired in his first Oscar winning role Philadelphia If only his supporting cast measured up Cast Away written by William Broyles Jr Apollo 13 is presented in three acts The first section which takes place in 1995 introduces us to Chuck Noland Hanks a Federal Express executive from Memphis whose job is to instill in his trainees his own slavish reverence for being on time Never commit the sin of turning your back on time he preaches Although he loves his girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt very dearly he must leave her at Christmas for a business trip halfway around the world As they quickly exchange gifts she gives him a family heirloom pocket watch with a picture of herself inside the cover I ll be right back he says kissing her goodbye Hours later his cargo plane crashes in the South Pacific and Chuck the only survivor washes up on the shore of a tiny uninhabited island with no provisions or supplies except the clothes on his back his tiny picture of Kelly in the stopped watch and the contents of a few FedEx packages he manages to rescue The middle portion of the film following Chuck s adventures from his first day to his rescue four years later is the longest and most engaging part With virtually no dialogue except for the occasional comment to himself or to a volleyball he names Wilson Hanks pulls off an amazingly real performance Acting is much more difficult without a script to suggest emotions or the direction of events Hanks and Zemeckis say with pictures what could not be said with a thousand words The final section involves Chuck s return home after having been thought dead by everyone he knows Kelly now married with a daughter has understandably conflicted feelings about Chuck having already gone through the grieving process and moved on It is wise of Zemeckis who led Hanks to his second Oscar in Forrest Gump to devote such a large portion of the film to Chuck s solitary exploits in his hellish paradise because the scenes which feature other actors are noticeably less effective Hanks and Hunt don t connect well enough before his absence to make their strained relationship afterward appear in stark contrast as it should It is effective on the part of Broyles s script that the film is presented completely from Chuck s point of view rather than switching back and forth between him and Kelly so we don t see her for the entire time he s on the island either Apparently filming was halted for a year in order for Hanks to lose 50 pounds and grow his hair and beard Zemeckis used this time to film What Lies Beneath The change in Hanks s appearance is surprising though some will recognize a similar look during one portion of Gump Don Burgess s cinematography supplying dazzling views of Chuck s tropical prison highlight the irony of his situation and Alan Silvestri s distinctive muscial score although used sparingly also underscores the sweeping beauty of the surroundings If all of Cast Away were as gripping as its long midsection it would be overwhelming still even with its flaws it marks another milestone performance for Tom Hanks as well as for Robert Zemeckis,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4576654/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2006,Wilson should have gotten Best Supporting Actor,This movie has fantastic emotional highs and lows Nothing in this movie ripped my heart out more than when Wilson washed away at sea Even if he was just a volleyball he really deserved best supporting actor The other fascinating prop in this movie was the package he never opened the one with the wings painted on it I always wonder what was in it And it inspires his escape raft which has got to be the best moment of the movie when the sail whips up and he escapes the reef that has trapped him This movie really is a fabulous exploration of how a man can change It seems to touch people on many levels Rent it with a box of tissues,10.0,5.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1319667/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2022,"Superb Direction, Phenomenal Acting and an Excellent Story",Cast Away is a raw movie that offers an outstanding performance from Tom Hanks in a roll in which he is stranded on a deserted island And it s not only his acting on the screen that makes him a star it s the fact that he dedicated himself to this movie by starving himself to look suitable for the role Other than the perfect acting from the entire cast director Robert Zemeckis delivers a great cinema experience with beautiful shooting of a well selected location and some spectacular music The entire area of the movie that simply features Tom Hanks trying to survive on the deserted island is unquestionably perfect There s graphic injuries he suffers that make it extremely tough to watch and to the point where you literally wince Every time he achieves anything big for survival like creating a fire you feel his power pride and strength But you also feel his disappointments and sorrows too Along with this man starving on this island and his physical appearance changing there s also quite a strong emotional aspect to it And it s worth saying that during the time he s stuck on the island there s not a complete lack of dialogue he creates a companion out of a ball in which he makes it a face out of his own blood and he talks and has a connection with it There s dumb movies like the Child s Play movie series in which Chucky is by himself and he talks to himself in a stupid way that makes sure that the audience knows what he s doing and thinking This movie would be exactly like that but with the fact that there s a companion even if it doesn t walk talk or breath Hanks is talking to the ball like he s telling us what he s thinking doing or how he s feeling which is clever and original The only real problems with Cast Away is how the first section also called the introduction is not really engaging and the film s ending isn t satisfying If you liked this review check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8336055/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2006,A Damn Fine Achievement in movie making,Hats off to Tom Hanks for one of the finest on screen performances ever he truly captures the loneliness turmoil and slightly mad eccentricity that grows in the character of Chuck Noland Hats off to Robert Zemeckis for daring to attempt this story and running the risk of serious criticism from the shallow movie viewer and i applaud him for pulling it off without cheapening the experience Cast Away uses no gimmicks gadgets special effects or dramatic music in fact it uses no tricks at all to try and heighten the viewing pleasure for the casual viewer It is simply the story of one s mans struggle against nature and a test of his will and without question it works well Cast Away is realistic fascinating touching and honest 7 10 If its thrills that you re after then avoid it like the plague,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1557235/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2002,Engrossing story with good psychological depth,Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can t Believe I Swallowed the Remote Get it at Amazon SPOILERS SPOILERS The theme of the cast away goes back long before Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe 1660 1731 or The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann Wyss 1781 1830 indeed it probably goes back to a time when people first set out on the open sea in boats It is a wonderfully romantic genre employing the classic man versus nature theme while allowing us to indulge in the fantasy of escape from the confines and restrictions of civilization Here we have Tom Hanks as Chuck Nolan a Fed Ex executive whose plane ditches into the South Pacific ocean He washes up on a tiny desert island as the sole survivor of the plane crash Incidentally both des ert island and de serted island are correct the words des ert and de serted in this context meaning the same thing His four year stay on the island forms the bulk of the movie but perhaps the most engaging part for most movie goers is what happens afterwards Tom Hanks was excellent throughout as usual and the direction by Robert Zemeckis from a script by William Broyles Jr was compelling Especially good was the irony about what happens to Chuck s beloved Helen Hunt while he is gone This has been done before but I forget where and is the kind of heart wrenching development that could have been pure saccharin but instead came across as thought provoking veracious and very affecting Zemeckis also directed the excellent film Contact 1997 made from the novel by Carl Sagan We can see here and there that Zemeckis s work owes a lot to the influence of Steven Spielberg in both a positive and a negative sense Zemeckis like Spielberg can be cloying at times in his effort to secure the audience s identification We can see this in the beginning with Chuck cutely trying to sell efficiency to the Russians with the help of a little boy But splendid was the plane crash sequence the kind of thing Spielberg would want to be intensely vivid and it was And later the startling sight of the huge cargo ship like a sea going skyscraper recalled to mind the first shot of the spaceship from Spielberg s Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977 The Fed Ex packages flying out all over the world engendering a kind of corporate we re all one world feeling like something from a Coca Cola commercial was pure Spielberg But what I like to do when I look at a movie like this is to lean forward and scrutinize it for authenticity Did the cast away lose weight Yes as a matter of fact Tom Hanks must have dropped about ten pounds or perhaps he fattened up for the first part of the film or was that body cosmetology and then fasted for the scenes showing him four years later But did he lose enough weight For those who have been watching TV s Survivor we know he didn t And was he tan enough His hair was little lighter after his ordeal but he really needed to be baked a dark brown which he wasn t I also look at how he ate What was his source of vitamin C Do coconuts contain Vitamin C I don t know But showing him eating seaweed which does contain vitamin C would have worked Using the coconuts to hold water was a nice touch Learning to spear fish with a wooden spear is plausible but spearing a fish with a wooden spear in the open ocean is unlikely Notice there were no birds or bird eggs or bird guano on the island An uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean is always a nesting place for birds This last observation reveals that the setting was not in fact a tiny island but part of a larger body of land Notice there was no clear encircling shot of the island as from the air In fact we never see the other side of the island It was interesting to see how he got the fire going again Survivor fans and boy scouts know how hard that is to do but I was thinking that maybe he could have used the glass on the watch face or from the flashlight as a way to concentrate sunlight to make a fire I also watched to see whether he did what I would have done Of course what I would have done doesn t mean that much but I would not have left the island for the open ocean which seemed almost suicidal unless there was out there on that ocean a ship s corridor so to speak which is possible Of course who can say what a man might do after being four years entirely alone on a tiny island I also would not have tried to cure my toothache regardless of how bad it hurt by breaking the tooth off with the ice skates After all that might make things worse Trying to pull the tooth would have been my strategy but how I liked the irony of finding the ice skates in a washed up Fed Ex package and then Chuck s use of the blades as mirror and knife I know why he didn t take the dead man s clothes but I think he should have plugged his nose and peeled them off anyway The washed up metal sail was a nice inspiration and there were many others the discovery of tool making by striking the vocanic rock at the right angle burning the base of the trees to make wood for the raft the petroglyphs he made in the cave sleeping on the floor in the hotel room etc Best no comment scene Chuck looking at the Alaskan king crab legs at the buffet,8.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566102/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,"""Who knows what the tide could bring""",SCORE 10 10 I know what I have to do now I ve got to keep breathing because tomorrow the sun will rise Who knows what the tide could bring Of course in this scenario Chuck Noland is referencing the Porta Potty piece that he used to help escape the island he was trapped on but it is such an incredible life lesson for people who are struggling That s what this movie was about Human struggles and the true extraordinary capabilities of the human body So many times in life we take things for granted like our ease of access to food water and even fire Our lives have been enhanced with the production of amazing technology that sometimes we forgot how blessed we are to be in the position we are Often we speak of our struggles without truly understanding what it means to struggle This movie is an incredibly strong lesson to everyone to keep fighting and that reaching rock bottom is so much lower than we perceive it to be But of course movies aren t as effective if it weren t for the people who act in them This was a one man show and Tom Hanks proves time and time again why he is so special The dedication it takes to authentically portray a character like this is unreal most notably the physical transformation he went though during the 4 year gap in this movie At the end of the day the concept of this movie was quite simple and different People might call it boring and slow by today s standards but I call it beautiful The simplicity of it all gives it a lot of charm and provides a very unique viewing experience allowing the audience member to slow down and put themselves in the mind of Chuck Noland It allowed me to feel what he was feeling and think what he was thinking It was similar to 2001 A Space Odyssey in that you had to let your guard down and appreciate the style for what it was It was a masterpiece,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8719877/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2005,Cast Away,One of the most interesting and compelling films ever with most of the film occupied by one actor Golden Globe winning and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland a Fed Ex worker who on a Fex Ex delivery flight has a plane crash into the ocean Chuck is the only survivor and when he wakes up the next morning he is alone He finds himself on an empty island with nothing but sand coconut trees and rock Throughout the film he continues to try and survive He finds boxes from the crash on the sand bank The things inside the boxes help him in his survival He even befriends talks to a football volleyball called Wilson This film does have some emotional moments but it does have some feel good moments too e g watching Chuck make fire Hanks had to slim down for four months before finishing the film and he could have got an award for it It it slow before the crash and when he goes back to the normal world after four years and Helen Hunt as Kelly Frears hardly does much but watch Hanks One of the only films to have a nearly one man show It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars and he was number 39 on The World s Greatest Actor Good,6.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1037192/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2022,A real life story of loneliness,Robinson crusoe movie that I watched at a time that corresponds to many years ago But it s weird that people go to the movie and squint and stare with the line Aaaa It is obvious that such a theme will be encountered from its advertisement to its story The only question mark would be how to tie the ending I went to the movie knowing all this All I was wondering was if Tom Hanks gave an Oscar winning performance And I still remember a single scene with Tom Hanks acting that is etched in my memory Tom who managed to light a fire on the deserted beach showed the fire with joy as if he had erected a great monument around the fire and proudly as if thousands of people were watching and applauding him,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8182208/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2001,Forrest Gump goes sailing.,I hated it The film from start to finish was product placement Basically it is an advert for Fed Ex and Wilson I rate Tom Hanks but this was just so dire that it s soured him for me The only interesting scene was the plane crash and him consistently maiming himself aside from that dullsville all the way I wasn t expecting a rollercoaster of thrills and chills I thought it would be really character based but I don t think that worked at all on any level Appalling movie and a wasted opportunity,0.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566052/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2001,"""So... that's it.""",WARNING REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Robert Zemeckis had a brilliant idea for a film strand Tom Hanks miles from civilisation on a desert island The only down part is he decided to bring him back Bobby Zee does well with the directing duties though still lacks the sufficient maturity to carry it off to its full potential Witness the opening scenes where a rather obvious point of view shot follows a parcel from site to site fine for a fast paced cartoon like actioner but incongruous in a film like this But a genuinely unsettling plane crash takes us fairly quickly into the main objective the desert island Despite their being no women on the island Tom still manages to catch crabs In fact that s probably one of the better effects as surely animal rights activists would prevent a real crab being skewered on film The film also gives us a whale though neither is as groundbreaking as Zemeckis achievements with product placement Instead of all that pesky putting them slyly into a scene he simply makes Federal Express part of the plot Though this full bore advert doesn t stop Bobby Zee sneaking in a can of Dr Pepper the little tinker Some of the first things Hanks comes across are a rotting corpse and a football which he respectively buries and hurls away Presumably in a jealous rage in case they act him off the screen Hanks much touted weight loss reminds you of one of the most famous actors to attempt such a feat albeit in reverse Robert De Niro in Raging Bull The comparison isn t favourable Can you imagine Tom Hanks in Taxi Driver You talkin ta me Cos if you are I ll buy you a lovely soft teddy bear and some sweets But mickey taking aside Hanks does do commendably well in what is largely a one man film highlighting his character s madness without ever taking it too far into the realms of comedy And his winsome helpless expression is quite endearing you know sort of like a baby seal before you re just about to club it Hanks spends a lot of the film looking at his watch which is a nice post modern touch as by a curious coincidence that s exactly what the audience are doing There s a striking lack of incidental music so that when orchestral sweeps do emerge they seem overly sentimental and out of place In fact they mark Tom s return to his old life which is where the film falters slightly While Hanks is watchable on his own he fails to generate any real chemistry with Helen Hunt Hanks philosophises to a friend in a chair where he strings more trite clich s together than C J in an episode of Reggie Perrin We then follow him driving his van while the vague Elvis theme running throughout culminates in Return to Sender What would they have chosen if he were a priest Devil in Disguise A garishly unsubtle religious reference wraps up a film that ain t bad but is worthy of no more than 6 10,6.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565783/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2014,one of my favourites,this film is one of my personal favourite films and ones of tom hanks best performances the film tells the story of chuck Noland a very passionate fed ex worker who while taking a journey via plane the crew hit bad weather conditions and crash land in the middle of the ocean leaving tom hanks stranded with only a volleyball Wilson as company the story shows his struggle for survival and the insanity that loneliness can cause this is an absolutely unforgettable and outstanding piece of film that will be remembered for many years more tom hanks plays an amazingly believable character throughout the film it is heart warming at the same time as being at times humorous and on the edge of your seat thrilling from start to finish a true piece of amazing cinema and a must see If you have been unlucky enough to have already I personally enjoyed this film because I think it portrays what it would be like to be stranded in a believable yet not over the top manner which really added to my enjoyment of the film an absolute must see,10.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3108766/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,Tom Hanks Classic,A classic and iconic film which delivers exactly what you might expect Hanks performance is perfect over the longitudinal plot varying in accordance with the circumstances Having a solitary character interact with just his surroundings is a little limiting but the context and backstory is enough to push everything along It is a long film and the tying up of all the loose ends towards the finish can drag a little but really there is a reason why Cast Away is so famous Not many films can get you to care for a volleyball,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7225608/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2001,"Good but not inspired ""star movie"". Too much FedEx",Tom Hanks successfully carries this movie which centers on a single character like few others for a large part of its time It is an unabashed vehicle for Hanks Still I was less impressed with his performance good not great than others on the Net Helen Hunt is good as always but finally does not really get a chance to display her skills fully Like in Forrest Gump I felt that serious moments were somewhat awkwardly acted since I have seen better from both Hanks and Hunt in other movies I ll blame the writing or director In contrast to others I did not feel this movie was disjointed the very distinct parts make sense from the story telling point of view and emphasize the experiences of the main character All in all I enjoyed this movie and it lingered on for while even though the heavy heavy Fed Ex exposure almost managed to spoil it for me,6.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565828/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2005,Mr. Wilson.... thumbs down,Oh boy Another Tom Hanks film Cast Away it received a lot of positive feedback when it came out but it s suddenly been forgotten now Even Mr Wilson the star of the film couldn t bring the audience back and keep them Mr Wislon even put on better acting than Tom Hanks nothing personal against the man but there for a while he was cast away in similar roles of the unsung hero type Cast Away certainly isn t a great film It was enjoyable to watch for a little while It even did a decent job of observing a man stranded on a deserted island It even had a fairly happy ending If you re in for these types of romanticized films you ll probably think this is a pretty decent movie Personally I wouldn t recommend it and say that anyone has to see this film Mr Wilson was the star He needs to come out in a film all of his own,4.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1197867/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2004,Story about survival,Cast Away is a story about survival Chuck Noland is a Federal Express systems engineer whose ruled by the clock existence abruptly ends when a plane crash leaves him isolated on a remote island I was most impressed with the plane crash sequence which takes place about 20 minutes into the film after Chucks character has been established and the equilibrium is understood Chuck along with the crew of a Fed Ex aircraft are travelling above the Pacific Ocean 200 miles off course At this point the audience realises there may be something wrong as Chuck is told by a crew member to fasten his seat belt for a bumpy ride The camera is hand held and is no higher than Chuck s shoulder height throughout this entire sequence This helps us feel closer to Chuck by being involved in what is happening to him The audience is seeing what Chuck is seeing as the sequence is shot from his side of the story We never know more about the situation than Chuck and this adds to the fear The fact that the camera is quite jerky makes the viewer feel uneasy as though in danger These types of camera movements are necessary as there are no external points of reference to show the plane is moving Suddenly there is an explosion and within a split second Chuck is being sucked out of the bathroom This is a very dramatic sequence as the entire mood of the film changes suddenly The camera is positioned on Chuck as he is clinging for life onto the bathroom door frame The sound becomes one of the most effective elements of this sequence in creating fear and panic The noises of the plane as it descends are abstract and eerie A mixture of engine noise and wind howling through the plane become the forefront of the sound and almost block out any other noises for example voices of the crew and the banging of objects flying round This creates a very frightening yet surreal atmosphere which you may expect if thrust into this situation The camera remains with Chuck following his actions and watching his reactions Although there are other people on board the plane the viewer s main concern is Chuck s safety The camera techniques used during this sequence go a long way in creating a very intense and terrifying atmosphere The camera movement allows the viewer to realise the danger the aircraft is in whilst also creating a documentary style which gives the viewer the feeling of actually being there Also the hard cuts and swift pans and tilts again give a factual feel allowing the audience to be a part of the scene This technique makes it seem as if there has been no creative image processing involved and is a very clever example of how a camera can be used to create an atmosphere so intense,0.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566281/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2020,Cast Away is an emotional story 8/10,The whole point of the film is man surviving Nature which is a famous case in a lot of survival movies Only in this particular film It is man surviving an island with a volleyball The whole movie focuses on one character Chuck Nolan Tom Hanks is doing a terrific job Chuck is faced with the dangers of the island and the fact that he is all alone with no one to talk to This is also the kind of movie that I love The kind of movies where the hero needs to face a danger bigger than war or explosions in one word Nature And that is what I want to see,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5736221/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2017,"Dull, slow and overlong",I don t know why this film is popular It starts quite well but the large majority of it is just the protagonist alone on a desert island with very little happening It should be much shorter After such a long boring middle I was expecting a happy ending However I was disappointed there as well It has a feel bad ending he returns home expecting to be welcomed He instead finds out that he was presumed dead and everyone who knew him has moved on That includes his partner who is now married and has a child with her husband,2.0,3.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3686951/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,Outstanding film gave me goosebumps,If you feel touched emotionally by this movie you are truly human The movie ends with Tom Hanks standing at a dusty crossroad surround by dry open fields and there is nobody around It can be interpreted by many as an empty feeling inside such as how they feel when a relationship ends or somebody close has died Where do we go from here now that something has ended When he met his wife again after a long absence it was easy to see that something was missing After all the hugs and kisses there was something missing that once bonded them together Too bad it has to be called acting but it was perfect acting throughout the whole movie,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7903538/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2022,Survival movie,Cast Away has a strong resemblance to Robert Zemeckis previous film Contact Forrest Gump was part folky feel good drama part sly satire Cast Away may not be as well known but it provides a richer more satisfying experience The third act of the film provides no easy solutions to difficult situations Screenwriter William Broyles Jr And director Robert Zemeckis avoid melodramatic clich s Because he is on screen by himself for more than half of the time Tom Hanks is responsible for the film s success Helen Hunt who became a film fixture after Mad About You is the only other significant player This is unquestionably her best work in a long time,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8222106/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2008,Modern Day Robinson Crusoe,Ever wondered if you can survive without necessities such a cell phone internet air conditioning car That s the theme Cast Away explores This story of a modern day Robinson Crusoe is all about how resourceful a man can get if he left to fend for himself all alone in an island Initially I was a little apprehensive about watching this movie since I assumed that a single man occupying the screen would get boring after some time But Tom Hanks in the lead role changed my decision and it turned out to be one of his best movies The movie has simple narrative style without many dialogues obviously and keeps you engaged till the end I d definitely rate it high on my list of top movies,8.0,3.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1921680/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,It was intriguing eventhough there wasn't much dialogue,The plot of the movie which is about a guy being stranded on an island is a pretty simple plot but it still kept me intrigued throughout Obviously there wasn t much dialogue during a certain part of the movie but I was still intrigued as I was wondering how the character is going to get out of this situation Some people might say certain parts or details of the movie are not realistic and I would probably agree with them however this is a movie so it s not meant to be fully realistic,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6480896/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2002,Tom Hanks' Performance Is the Calling Card Here.,Cast Away is an interesting concept that has been done before but never quite like this The film follows a FedEx man Hanks in an Oscar nominated performance who is stranded on a tropical island in the middle of the ocean after a terrifying plane crash What follows is his journey to survive with minimal supplies what he has on the island and a few packages he was to deliver and no human interaction Hanks gives a stunning performance and basically the film is little more than a way to show off his amazing versatility as an actor However Hanks lacks the material and of course the supporting performers he had in greater films like Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan Helen Hunt is only present in limited screen time as Hanks love interest In all Cast Away is worth a look for Tom Hanks but do not expect much more than Tom having conversations with a Wilson volleyball 4 stars out of 5,0.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566110/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2006,what Gilligan forgot to tell us,Maybe we wonder how many movies and or TV shows about people stranded on uncharted islands there can be Cast Away of course portrays Fed Ex employee Chuck Noland Tom Hanks getting stuck on a Pacific island after a plane crash and having to use his own ingenuity to survive even after he ends up looking like a cross between a beggar and Moses I personally think that they could have just left it at that and not had any of the stuff about his relationships with people But Wilson made an interesting character Of course a particularly unpleasant scene portrays his dental work Overall I guess that there s not much here that we haven t seen but Hanks s performance keeps everything afloat especially in the fire scene And I guess that Gilligan did forget to tell us about the coconuts,7.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1338302/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2008,A refreshing change of pace with a touching story,I ll be right back Such were the words shouted by Chuck Noland to his girlfriend Kelly Frears as he hurries off to catch his waiting plane Little does he suspect how horribly ironic these words become once his tale is over In Robert Zemeckis great Cast Away Tom Hanks incarnates Chuck Noland a highly efficient FedEx executive whose life is mercilessly governed by the clock He s in a relationship with Kelly Frears the pretty Helen Hunt yet their love is constantly postponed or halted by Chuck s unforgiving timetable Soon he s called out on a business trip just before Christmas and he and Kelly exchange some quick gifts she gives him a pocket watch with her picture in the lid and he gives her an engagement ring box which she is to open on New Year s Day only with him there with her He then leaves and boards the plane Unfortunately something goes terribly wrong during the flight we never learn what nor is it relevant and the plane smashes somewhere into the Southern Pacific ocean The crash scene with all its technical and visual excitement is the most terrifying and heart pounding sequence of its kind I have ever seen It s so sudden so unexpected and so realistic that you can t help but feel nearly as shocked and horrified as Chuck himself as he sees clouds and eventually waves scream past the cockpit windows coming ever closer He is the only survivor and soon he washes up on a large and eerily magnificent desert island and a quick look see confirms his worst fears he s absolutely isolated in the middle of the ocean and no one knows where he is or that he s even alive By then we re barely a quarter into the movie and the pace formerly so fast paced and hurried suddenly crashes to a halt All time stands still on the island itself unchanged for millions and millions of years only the dull thuds and cracks of falling coconuts or the occasional arriving flotsam provide distraction to the new routine Chuck has to endure survival without any electricity food water or equipment Everything he uses he improvises sometimes with painful results other times with triumph A man who once lived by the pager and the timetable suddenly finds himself in a land where the very concept of time is as alien as fish on Mars and what he does to survive both physically and mentally is where the true storytelling power of the movie lies The movie is very slow paced as we follow Chuck s attempts at staying alive yet unlike most other times where I d say this for this movie being slow is far from criticism it s praise The movie doesn t hurry through Chuck s exploits and actions just to get to the point The story takes its time to settle comfortably into its niche and once it does it s truly riveting even though all we re really looking at is one man on an island drinking coconut juice and suffering from a toothache without a dentist The acting is outstanding especially for Tom Hanks as the castaway in person he supports the entire movie and the audience gets to feel both his triumphs and his pains One scene where he finally is able to light a large signal fire is surprisingly jovial and heartwarming as we see the desperate man jumping ecstatic around the burning flames chanting and avoiding sparks Other scenes truly make us feel terribly sorry for the man but rather in resigned compassionate way For example to stay sane Chuck begins to speak to a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball on which a smeared bloody handprint inadvertently created a vague face Naming the ball Wilson Chuck speaks to him as thought they were old friends and by then we re so in tune with Chuck s desperation and loneliness we barely even realize the oddity of a grown man merrily conversating with a volleyball I naturally can t divulge what happens at the end or if Chuck ever makes it off the island or not but I can nonetheless comment on the fact that personally I found it slightly disappointing It was a logical ending to the tale one you may already have guessed if you haven t seen the movie yet but some parts of it seemed forced even somewhat clich d and corny at times I also didn t understand some of what happened at the very end perhaps it was too subtle for me But then too subtle would also be ground for criticism This is not a movie for viewers who expect action and flash or for sufferers of short attention spans For those who are able to take a break from their lives which so often mirror Chuck Noland s in their pacing this story will be a soothing and refreshing change of pace while it lasts and will make a very good addition to any movie lover s collection For giving us a story with a refreshing change of pace a lot of sentiment and depth and some formidable acting I award Cast Away 8 5 friendly volleyballs out of 10,8.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1994506/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2010,Loneliness definitely haunts........,Imagine being in a island alone for four long years with no company no shelter surrounded by saline water all over How would you feel Only Tom Hanks can make such good movies I absolutely loved Forrest Gump Apollo 13 and now this I just watched it a few days ago and six years later and every part of the movie remains etched in my memory The story is simple it is about how Chuck Noland Tom Hanks a FedEx employee becomes a castaway in a island after a terrible plane crash in the ocean is left to fend for himself The rest is how he survives the island and finally comes out of it The locations are exotic and the story is wonderfully executed As for the Special Effects it s amazing The movie like Forrest Gump The Shawshank Redemption Its A Wonderful Life speaks about hope courage survival and in short about the strange twist and turns of fate Frame by Frame the movie reminds you of Robinson Crusoe but then you realize that even a common man can become a Crusoe if he wants to get back to his world his family his love On the acting front the movies in its entirety belongs to Tom Hanks Helen Hunt does her part well but the rest of the cast come only for a while in the beginning and in the end Its a Tom Hanks show all the way While I can t call it a masterpiece the movie is definitely worth to be watched a few times Thank You for reading,8.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2276123/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2017,Excellent Movie; possibly one of Hank's Best,I Will Do My Best to not include spoilers but if I feel the need I will notify you beforehand Overall This movie is truly excellent and must be applauded for what it achieved I would highly recommend this movie to anyone as it is spectacular Good It was for the most part very well shot with the exception of one segment which I feel was pretty poorly done Tom Hanks does as per usual a riveting performance and carries a movie by being in effect it s only star Robert Zmeckis is truly a cinematic legend if he can get me emotionally attached to a football The music is excellent and sets the tone well The story is beautifully written and every scene after his abandonment bears so much weight and makes even simple things feel like huge challenges Truly a cinematic masterpiece Bad The scenes prior to him being on the island are pretty dull and really only setup him being on the island Aside from Tom Hanks any other acting in the movie was not up to scratch for me There is one scene that I feel was very poorly shot and it was a significant scene so it did kind of ruin that moment for me Best Part SPOILERS When he loses Wilson MVP Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland 10 10,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3615374/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2003,CAST AWAY (DIDIER BECU),There are two ways to see this movie the good and the bad way Let s start with the good one if a movie depends on the acting of one actor then he has to be brilliant especially for a movie that lasts 3 hours and the choice of Tom Hanks is again brilliant as he is a superb actor The story of a succesfull businessman who lands on a desolated island is intriguing especially when he lost his mind just imagine what you would do Of course it s all a bit too Hollywood to be real but still a tour de force for Hanks who once again plays in the sort of movie the whole world talks about And then the bad thing hmmmm this whole movie is sponsored by Fedex and you wonder why they haven t put some commercial trailers in it shameless to the point But all by all more than just a good movie,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566256/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2020,Cast away,I have never seen a more meaningful and thought provoking film Right from the start I knew this was going to be a classic film and my opinion was not changed throughout the course of the movie one bit It delivers such a strong message of fear survival and hope that leaves your mind devoted to thinking about it for a long while after It made me think about all my creature comforts and what is actually necessary in life Talking to a volleyball has never been more dramatic I also loved the fact that there was little talking in the film maybe that was because i was staying in a hotel in France with french TV but anyway it sort of made you guess how he was feeling in a clever way This is one of my all time favourite films and I could watch it again and again without getting bored so go and watch it NOW,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5930518/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2003,Wilson!!!!!!!,Magnificent Robinson Crusoe adventure vehicle that is unfortunately sandwiched between a vapid love story I realize that the movie would probably not work without the home elements but they are just way too long and way too ordinary The setup wastes over 30 minutes of film that I really would rather have been spent on further exploring the difficulties of survival on the island That part the best part flies by way too quickly But what can you do It s still very watchable and the good part is it s the perfect pay channel movie Why Odds are you ll be flipping through the channels and happen upon this en medias res which means you ll have skipped at least part of the boring beginning and if your lucky jump right in during the incredible plane crash sequence Trust me this happens a lot Also you can just turn it off as soon as he makes his final attempt to leave the island See How many flicks are that custom made for the home viewer,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566223/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2023,"When it's good, it is masterful",A rocky opening wonderful midsection disappointing finale That s Cast Away in a nutshell the acting and direction are first rate but structurally it s kind of a doozy I ll say right now that if you re here for an awards worthy Tom Hanks performance you re in the right place This is almost a one man show he shoulders most of this thing and when he s the focus the film shines beautifully I have nothing but praise for his performance on the island The core of the movie is the crash and the desert island stranding What s bizarre about this is that s like half the running time Eventually SPOILERS I think Hanks is rescued and we have a whole third act to go and it s all epilogue anticlimactic too which shocked the hell outta me William Broyles script does some amazing things Wilson for one an inanimate volleyball is a means for dialogue with our main character as he lives in isolation I think that s brilliant It s also a creative means of showing this guy s slipping mental state On the other hand there s also squandered potential Here s what I mean During the last remaining moments Hanks is recounting his failed suicide attempt with a coworker Nick Searcy While stranded he knew that the only thing he could actually control was when and how he would die So he made the rope hung it from a log and the log broke I had power over nothing And that s when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket I knew somehow that I had to stay alive Somehow I had to keep breathing even though there was no reason to hope So that s what I did I stayed alive I kept breathing This is Show Don t Tell 101 Can you imagine how powerful this scene would ve been He could ve communicated his thoughts to Wilson Like I said this is worth every penny for the lead performance But it s almost like as soon as he gets off that rock it takes the wind right outta the sails The resolution is him picking up the pieces of his life and I get the emotional impact Zemeckis is going for But it just doesn t compare to the rest of the movie,6.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9082439/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2001,The real SURVIVOR!,You know it would be refreshing to see Tom Hanks take a couple of years off from movies and do some stage work He could undeniably get away with it He IS Cast Away There is no other performer in this film who even holds a candle to him To work for the better half of this film stranded on a desert island Hanks thoroughly convinced me that he WAS stuck on this island and I had to remind myself from time to time that it was only a movie Director Robert Zemeckis stages one of the most realistic plane crashes I have ever seen and the stillness which fills the last frame of the movie with a crossroads as its focus is perfectly executed My only complaint is that as much as I enjoyed Hanks alone on the island I would have enjoyed periodic flashbacks of his life while stuck alone to develop his character better to show him more dimensionally and not just as a survivor and this probably would have propelled the film into my top five Oh well at least there was Wilson,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565872/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2012,"good, but not as good as i remember",when i was a child i really liked this film being one of my favourites for a long time i finally watched it again a few days ago and I m sad to say its not as good as i remember it granted it is still a good film a very decent one Hanks carries the role very well never for a second giving you the impression that hes just acting he makes you believe he s there making him the soul of this film his interaction with Wilson is believable and well done creating this sort of one sided relationship that battles the loneliness of the island keeping him going another device used to keep him going is a package some packages float ashore from the plane crash and he opens most of them except one a package with wings on which he is determined to deliver it keeps in with his character and makes him all the more believable to watch the thing is though it always seems to be when its just Hanks on screen that the movie becomes really strong I liked the part towards the end where hes now off the island he has new shoes he has ice all the food at the party the lighter all these things that he never had for those 4 years are just there and it makes him appreciate them more its the little things that you take for granted is part of the message and its done really well one thing that did annoy me on the island though is the pacing it felt rushed some scenes barely lasting a minute not giving you enough time to let it sink in if zemeckis had cut some shorter scenes out allowing more time for more meaningful scenes i would have liked it more He gets the loneliness right but it all goes by a bit quickly not giving you the feeling of the long amount of time he spent on the island when other people are on screen how ever the film seems to be at fault its nothing bad it just loses its strength particularly the end i felt quite empty at the forced whimsical ending zemeckis played it ruins the films a little and loses some of good it had been building up the ending of Hanks relationship with his wife was played well to start with but falls flat as it progress overall its still a great film the acting is solid the story is well done and sad at times but is spoilt by certain elements mainly the forced ending and side characters its a strong film with a few cracks in but i would still recommend it it just saddens me that it wasn t as good as i remembered it,7.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2681137/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,"Less harrowing than expected, and more whimsically adventerous.",Cast Away was the 6th film unlocked on my 100 movie bucket list gift I received Its greatest strength is in its pacing Whenever I was beginning to get bored of what I was seeing the plot would jump into a whole new segment and recapture my attention Hanks gives a great performance as usual,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5441004/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2001,"Good, but not great",Tom Hanks is king That s what I think after watching the movie His transformation is totally amazing from a very slightly overweight man to the a very skinny person from a very hard working employee to a survivor Tom Hanks simply amazes me The crash scene is the most terrifying aircraft footage I ve ever seen The sound effects actually made me feel uncomfortable and nervous A masterpiece Wilson was a great idea Sadly the rest of the film left a lot of issues unexplored It should have avoided the before and after story instead concentrating on Hanks loneliness at the island The silent part of the movie was the best for me I could ve cared less about his soon to be wife or his friends at work It was pretty obvious how all that would finish Very cliched Oh and if you don t know by now who paid for the movie watch it You ll all agree it was FedEx At one point I even got to think I was watching an infommercial where Hanks demonstrated that not even being a castaway will stop FedEx from delivering on time Yuck Solid 8 stars because of Hanks the crash scene and Wilson,4.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565770/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2016,This movie holds such a special place in my heart,Where do I start I have lost count of the times I have watched this beautiful film Tom Hanks performance is perfect but there is more the overwhelming feeling I am left with at the end of this movie is that you can overcome anything and what you think you may have lost may not be as good as what you are about to receive I believe that Helen Hunt s character came into Chuck s life so that she would simply be his guardian angel through the hell that was the desert island and its isolation she helped him survive After his ordeal he had changed and she had changed he had become almost worldly and his experience allowed him to become aware of what was really important and what wasn t She either appeared to have become or perhaps the pure genius of this film made me feel as if she was boring or staid compared to the person Chuck had become The angel wings on the FedX package was such a constant throughout the story and I choose to believe that he ends up with the woman at the center of the creation of those wings The message people come in and out of our lives for different reasons we may not know the reason or we may mourn when they leave or move on but it is all part of our journey and with a little bit of faith and luck we can all end up where we were supposed to be at journey s end Brilliant,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3454183/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2001,Cast Power is more like it,Contrived overly pompous predictable and uncompelling is the best way to describe this overrated film If you saw the previews for this film there was really no need to see the movie In the previews they showed A Tom Hanks as a Fed Ex delivery guy who s girlfriend is Helen Hunt B Tom Hanks getting on a plane C The plane crashing D Hanks stranded on an island so long he eventually grows a beard E Hanks saying he d rather take his chances out there than die here as he floats away on a raft F Hanks making it back home G Hunt running out after him in the rain There were no surprises And it s just so unmoving He gets off the island and inside you re saying to yourself ok so what The moment after i saw the previews i knew it was gonna suck but everyone was gonna love it and get all these award nominations just cause it was Tom Hanks Helen Hunt and Rob Zemeckis Notice the commercials pitched it with Zemeckis and Hanks team up for the first time since Forrest Gump I d heard the initial concept was Tom Hanks idea too That doesn t surprise me The last time Hanks had an idea for a movie it came out as That Thing You Do A word of advice for Tom Hanks Stick to what you re good at That s ACTING Leave the writing to the writers Not that they got a good one at that for this film The scenes with the ball and where he starts a fire were just so pompous and overly dramatic God i can just see them in the developement process for this film Hey let s give him a bad tooth in the beginning so that way we can have him knock it out with an ice skate later How freakin contrived The whole time i felt like i was watching a Kevin Costner movie Self righteous and absorbed Basically this was a crap movie that was successful due to star power Do yourselves a favor and CAST this one AWAY,1.0,12.0,37.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565723/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2021,Experience!!,Outstanding Tom Hanks and Wilson 3 It s all about love about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it about an ordeal that led one man to re think what is meaningful in life and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7194989/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2001,A Very Long FedEx Commercial (spoilers ahead),I gave this movie a 2 only because Tom Hanks is superb Otherwise this film has no redeeming features as far as I m concerned It s one big yawn and poorly written to boot One of the pivotal things that enables our hero to survive is that packages wash up with items he s able to use Yet he deliberately leaves one package unopened and at the end delivers it Aw c mon We re talking life and death here In the end he delivers the package to it s proper destination cuz that s what FedEx is all about I guess The movie crawls along showing Hanks adjustment to the island Some time passes we see he s started a beard but his hair hasn t grown too much maybe two weeks Then bam four years have passed Now the first thing that crossed my mind when it was announced that he d been there four years was Why hasn t he committed suicide Well it crossed his mind too and we hear him tell about it twice But we don t see it This crucial scene occurs off camera Bad story telling I m not saying that we needed scenes of every day on the island but some showing his adjustment and time passing would have been appropriate and made a smoother transition into the escape sequence,2.0,6.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565927/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2001,bad bad ending,MEGASPOILERS ABOUT THE ENDING HERE I hate good movies with bad endings and this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth Didn t the writer think we would feel really bad if Tom Hanks didn t reunite with his wife I realise that it s hard to think of an ending with a movie like this but this movie had the worst movie ending I ve seen in a long time All you see in the last scenes is Tom Hanks skinny face and then it stops Finished We have no idea of what will happen to this character we ve gotten to know Will he ever be happy again We ll have to imagine that for ourselves What a disappointment That said I must say that the movie was worth seeing in a theater The scenes on the island are very well made and never boring Actually the whole movie is never boring Tom s separation of Wilson had me teary eyed The scenes on the island are so extremely well done in fact that they single handedly make this movie better than anything I ve seen last year They are scary funny exciting and heart breaking Of course the plane crash scene must also be mentioned which can only be described as masterful action filmmaking This is one of the best action scenes I ve ever seen If the whole movie would ve been as good as the first er 100 minutes I would ve given it a 10 It s such a shame that it had such a lousy ending That brings it as much as 3 points down 7 out of 10,0.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565744/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2001,A strangely unsatisfying journey of isolation and return.,First off I m using the previews for Cast Away s as a guideline for not revealing any of the film s plot The sad thing is that the previews pretty much show everything that happens in the film If by some chance you missed them they basically show Tom Hanks a Fed Ex worker going down in a plane crash and then getting stuck on a deserted island only to return years later This is an exciting premise the idea of a fast paced worker from fast paced world being thrust into an isolated world where time slows and daily decisions become paramount to survival Unfortunately Cast Away manages to cheat the audience at every turn by focusing on the least interesting aspects of being forced into isolation and what how it will affect a person once they return How would you react to the first person you saw in four years How about your first hot shower How about your first hot meal that wasn t fish or coconuts You can keep asking yourself because in a odd story telling decision the creators of Cast Away have chosen to skip over this entire portion of Tom Hank s story What the audience is left with is a protagonist we learn little about his initial life on a deserted island and a return to civilisation that lacks any dramatic punch A real disappointment considering the talent involved,4.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565639/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2002,A half-step away from excellent,Beautifully acted well directed compelling and often exciting this film just misses the level of excellence The story is well constructed and the pivotal performance of Tom Hanks is sterling as always the man hasn t made a single real clinker in his entire career even Bachelor Party and The Burbs were good of their type But the cumulative impact of the finished product just doesn t attain the level of profundity the filmmakers were shooting for that spark of synergy that teases the last 20 minutes or so of the film never catches fire and one is left ever so slightly disappointed,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566177/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2001,"The hell with Robinson Crusoe, go Chuck Noland",This really is a great film in which Tom Hanks succeeds again in starring in one of the best intro s to a film ever after Saving Private Ryan The intro was so good I almost got sick man and that means something It really was heavy and much better than The Perfect Storm s disaster scenes The Island part of the movie was also good and the return to home part was good too Some people hated the ending though but I liked it It could have been longer but it was still good although I do not like having to make up my own ending By the way for people who think that after Chuck gets home the movie stops that ain t so and this can never be bearing in mind the beginning and the fact that the director is Robert Zemeckis Good fun go see it 8 out of 10,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565877/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2001,good movie,I liked this movie I thought it was really unique And bravo to Tom Hanks I think it takes quite a bit of talent to be able to be the only actor for basically the whole film and still make it work It was very realistic also For example the plane crash was the most realistic ive seen in the movies I think anyone should see this movie Its long but its very well made and entertaining,7.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565975/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2008,Guaranteed to shed a tear,A very good movie Cast Away brings to the screen the story of a Fed Ex employee who is stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean following a plane crash Once there it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties Cast Away is a film about human relations hope and second chances but most importantly about trust love and inner strength Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie nevertheless they have outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least All the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows The setting the plot the dialogues and the music are all good In short Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening s entertainment,8.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1941890/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2021,Straight 10/10 full house.,Tom Hanks created this movie took a year out half way through to lose weight showed the ultimate in dedication produced a masterpiece and the story was probably the best in modern day cinema Pretty much exactly like my life except I haven t been lost at sea He was free at the end of it to make a choice He was cast away No matter what life brings you never no what the tide brings Wait until the tide comes in and the sun comes up and just remember to stay breathing COVID free This film should be remade it was utterly the best story and quotes ever Women should learn from this So should men but I guess you ll all miss the underlying meaning I was at a cross roads exactly this way felt the end of a relationship coming even dreamt it Then the reality hits But at at the end of the day it doesn t matter because it s always you,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6780523/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,Huh?,I was bored on Christmas Day so I went down the street to see this film I had seen an interview between Hanks and Charlie Rose the day before so my interest was up While I can appreciate Hanks talent as an actor this film left a lot to be desired First of all the trailer gives way too much of the plot away including the fact that Chuck is rescued and he ends seeing Kelly again the trailer has enough sense not to give away what Kelly did for the time he was gone I got that Chuck being a control freak about time has to reevaluate when he realizes what little control he has over anything I even picked up on the use of the Elvis Presley songs in the movie What was the ultimate lesson he was supposed to get overall The film is very unclear about that leaving the audience with an ambiguous ending,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566009/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2000,A movie that chooses the road of superficiality,I was very disappointed in this movie I expected a decent look into the challenges of living in utter isolation having to survive without modern acoutrements and a lot of reflection on one s place in the universe Oh no This film whenever confronted with the option chooses the road of superficiality over depth Once we get past the deeply Republican yuppie fantasy of ideal existence and onto the island we would expect at least after a while a little reflection on the part of our protagonist But for a film whose star is so eager to declare that nothing happens in its middle section we are treated to unending survival tips and adventures at the expense of any reflection This is a beautiful island surely anyone there would have some moments of appreciating the stillness and natural wonder of the island Well not here Surely after four years Hanks would have developed his own ways his own joys and sorrows new abilities he s proud of or good at but we just don t see them His emotional range remains for the whole of the island portion of the film sad and sadder We re supposed to believe that after he returns to civilization that there s a part of him left on that island well based on this movie he never really seems to BE on the island he s always a yuppie visitor and doesn t seem to engage in his environment This movie could have been much more powerful if it chose to really engage in the loneliness and despair that one would feel after giving up on civilization and realizing one may be alone for the rest of one s life Hanks is a fine actor unhampered by vanity but here what we re seeing is a movie star dropped off on a set every morning The movie s depth never rises above the level of Dude what if you were like trapped on an island Man like what would you DO That would sure suck And that s the one statement this film seems to make being alone in the universe pretty much sucks Hey Thanks Tom you re giving us pearls There are a lot of other details that give the film away as a sham If I was standed on a tropical island the first thing I would do is look for the resort on the other side Tom shouts a few Hello s then assumes that there s no one there At one point he climbs up to the summit at this point a 360 degree pan could have worked wonders but uh uh not here I still think there s a Club Med a half mile away that Tom just never bothered to look for He also never really seems to explore the island and after four years don t you think you d take a little field trip Also after four years wouldn t you have built yourself more than a few spears Tom can t get off the island because of the reef off the section of beach he refuses to leave maybe he could have paddled around to see if there was a break in the reef Oh I guess not This is what I mean when I say this film never really engages with the reality of being on the island and robs itself of the seriousness it so desperately asks of its audience I have read a book of true accounts of people stranded on islands Great Shipwrecks and Castaways it s still in print and it s excellent so look for it if this interests you and a book on how to survive if you must drift for days on a raft and I know that the real problem Tom is going to face once his portasan blows away is exposure to the sun But that problem is apparently not convenient for this film to explore so it just pretends like it doesn t exist This film asks you to reflect only on the problems of nature that Hollywood can easily solve all others simply do not exist A SPOILER IN THIS NEXT SECTION But the real mistake this movie makes in which it betrays both itself and its audience is to virtually cancel out ALL emotional resonance it might have attained by having a hot babe appear out of nowhere in the final two minutes to make everything okay This development is at once disappointing and disgusting Disappointing in that all the sadness we ve built up for Hanks is INSTANTLY ERADICATED by the convenient appearance of a new chick to make his life complete disgusting in the suggestion that Helen Hunt s character who we ve built up such a respect and reverence for can simply be replaced by an almost identical hot chick this one has RED hair though And besides Hunt never amounted to much anyway So as an audience we are left to assume that Hank s character really IS stupifyingly superficial and that the only connection he really had to Hunt all that time on the island is that he needed some babe in his life Hunt or someone else it doesn t matter This puts a nasty taste in my mouth now when I think about Hanks and Zemeckis as PEOPLE But aside from that I am surprised that they would so completely betray the film they ve obviously expended so much effort on All in all a deeply Republican film It prods us to look deep inside ourselves and ask What would we do if one day we didn t have an SUV and a pager But the movie says don t worry about not having a woman around they re a dime a dozen and they re all the same Bleech Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies www cinemademerde

8 February 2023,Heartwarming,Tom Hanks being the supreme actor we ve come to know did an amazing job largely carrying the narrative on his own with the support of great writing and direction The story is literally in the title But what is amazing is how the film goes beyond the narrative of a man stuck on an island by himself It speaks to survival courage and determination in the face of a major crisis in this man s life Of course you have to find some humour in the whole situation and the director does a fine job at finding light in the darkness and make you smile as new situations arise I strongly recommend this film,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8859899/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2002,For those who didn't get it,It s sad but not surprising to hear people complaining that this movie is boring or long This is a simple yet effective story about a man on a deserted island In fact this isn t even an island it s a big rock Now I know that 90 of the audience expected some action on this island You know maybe a huge bear or a lion or a tiger attacking Tom Hanks Well as I said it was a rock Cast Away is a move about a man staying alone on a rock for four year helpless So if you strip man from all the technology and society what do you have Can this creature survive and exceed its limitations Zemeckis did a tremendous job so did Hanks The environment is suffocating and beautiful at the same time Tom Hanks succeeds at making this character believable You can feel the struggle inside trying to stay sane with no one else to talk to This is a triumph of man and a lyrical projection of the power within Best movie of 2000 10 10,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565961/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2017,Tragic Romance/Drama/Adventure,The sheer genius of this script has unfortunately been overlooked by many First of all this is indeed a Romance genre but it is more of Drama genre with Adventure as the spine for the Desire Line And further this is Tragic Romance Oh What could have been The Hero s Desire in the beginning of the story is to be a workaholic and by the way he s also getting married to a great girl The script does not dwell on the Romance genre from the first few pages Therefore the audience doesn t have a vested interest in the Hero and his love interest despite the fact that their very meet up is the Inciting Incident of the story We also see from the very first scene the symbolic importance of time which is ironic as the Opening Story World is barren empty almost as if time has no beginning or end here Very symbolic use of Story World for the writer This time element portends for what lies ahead in Act 2 on a desert island where time no longer has any significance The genius of writing this Story World is that man must find beauty no matter where he is Noticing the stars the flashing lights of the moon the red brown of the Tennessee clay the clapboard houses set off in the setting sun the isolation on an island that is barren yet lush with vegetation How difficult it is when man must survive and bleed and make mistakes as the Hero of this story does All to survive which is the new Desire Line beginning in Act 2 To write a Hero in an adventure drama romance story the decision must be made as to which genre should be primary In the case of Cast Away the writer decided on Drama and Romance as the Designing Principle and Adventure for the spine of the plot The Hero s Desire is to find a way to survive and get rescued The island is both his savior and his prison He understands this as time goes by The photo of his great love is also his savior and his prison as he knows he will probably never see her again Adventure is a sub plot of Action However this is not an Action story by any means In Action genre the Hero must think on his feet and engage in action at every turn Honor is the driving force behind an action Hero The elements of Drama override the Action genre here though There is a very strong moral dilemma in Drama genre The characters are intimate and the Opponent is also a known entity as opposed to Myth whereby the Hero encounters dragons and slays them one after another In Cast Away the Hero says that he even tried to hang himself at one point but true to form after he tested the bough it broke and even his attempt to kill himself was not in his power The Premise of a story for film should include three elements The Hero the Inciting Incident and the Hero s Desire line So the Inciting Incident should have been the plane crash if Adventure sub plot of Action were the genre that took precedence But the Inciting Incident is when the Hero and the love of his life meet up during the Christmas holiday thus taking from the Hero a break in the concept of time that means so much to him in the beginning of his Character Arc So the screenwriter made a very important decision The Romance genre key to the Designing Principle is really the key to the plot of this story as opposed to the Adventure Action genre But the Hero s Desire Line is in sync with the Adventure Action genre The fact that his Desire is also to be reunited with the love of his life is the moral dilemma that he has always faced for the better part of his life So herein lies the genius of this story Sometimes a love that keeps us alive might have to be given up due to life s circumstances There is a story element called a Double Reversal in Romance genre Both the Hero and his great love do a reversal from where they were emotionally in the beginning of the story We see this in a very powerful way in Cast Away Both characters have a moral epiphany and then a Self Revelation that has most of us in tears because this is a cathartic experience for anyone who has ever loved and then lost The genius of the writer was to have the FedEx employee whose wife was dying of cancer as the Hero s audience while the Hero is telling in exposition before the Moral Epiphany and Climax scene what the Designing Principle of this story was really all about About the use of Wilson the volleyball as a character Obviously to craft a story with a Hero on a desert island would be a challenge Because in film as opposed to novel the audience needs to know what s in the character s mind what his feelings are his emotions etc So the Point of View Character also called an Ally serves this purpose The writer came up with the idea of Wilson the volleyball so the Hero would have someone to emote to and thereby express his feelings to the audience in a believable way Again the cathartic emotions we feel are that if we were stranded on a desert island and we had the ingenuity to craft a volleyball friend we would absolutely do it,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3696393/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2015,as close to perfection as a movie can get.,I initially didn t intend to see this film but did so when a good friend suggested that I watch it And that it was one of his favorites I decided it was worth checking out I wasn t expecting any major emotions for a setup like this a guy is stranded and has to get back home And didn t have very high expectations but this movie just blew my mind with how down to earth and simple it was yet how much heart and dedication was put into each and every frame First the positives that I praise are obviously Tom hanks performance as chuck Noland a caring yet very serious and dedicated boss and its very hard not to like him He isn t a jerk and doesn t boss anyone around hes just a guy that wants work to get done He travels on a FedEx cargo plane right after he proposes to his girlfriend but the plane crashes leaving him stranded on an island with no means of communication His character is very believable and realistic and is pretty hard not to root for Aside from that i have to praise how the movie was so natural and realistic it had no music for the entirety of chucks stay on the island I didn t even notice it and it was amazing how well it was done The special effects are quite good but do falter occasionally like when chuck sees a whale while hes on his raft it doesn t really look too real One of my favorite points has to be Wilson his volleyball companion At first i figured there was nothing to him but i found myself actually saddened when he drifted away from chuck during the trip off the island There are very few things I have problems with namely the time span of the movie How on earth did no one find him in four years He clearly saw a ship once before wouldn t one have come there It just bothered me the whole time All in all this is an amazing movie and another masterpiece by Robert Zemeckis who had the balls to actually consider this idea let alone make it,10.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3153868/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2003,Simply Stellar.,Warning Spoilers Ahead While watching Cast Away the word that came to mind more than any other was right Everything except one thing was done right the way it should have been done From Hanks s metamorphosis to the unique ending each decision of each character was perfect If you saw the trailer which gave away entirely too much then you know the basic storyline In the prelude he nails the American obsession with work and time and their conflict with relationships Then his plane crashes and does so spectacularly Nothing is ordinary about how Robert Zemeckis shows the wreck He uses primarily interior shots rather than the standard airplane hurtling from the sky visuals As perverse as it may sound this is the best and most frightening plane crash I ve ever seen on film The middle act features Chuck Noland Tom Hanks stranded on his island This act is split into two distinct parts that are separated by four years The first features Hanks merely adapting and surviving The second shows who and what Hanks has become and how he has honed his survival skills This transition dominates the film The only noise for an hour are the natural sounds and occasional Hanks dialogue How many actors can not only keep but demand your attention for sixty minutes w o scarcely a word Hanks truly deserved another Oscar for his remarkable interaction with the island and Wilson in manners both subtle and exuberant The cinematography here was marvelous displaying both the magnificience and grittiness of the island simultaneously Finally he manages to escape and after several dramatic encounters including the nearly tear inducing loss of Wilson Hanks is discovered by a freighter That set the stage for what I was looking forward to Hanks returning to civilization and adapting back to a different life I desperately wanted to see him experience the joy of a clean shower brushing his teeth or tasting food again But most of those scenes were never shown and that s my singular complaint A few nods to this were seen such as Hanks toying with the pocket knife chugging the bottled water and flicking on the lighter I suppose my desired scenes would have extended the running time too long but I still missed them The stage was then set for Noland s reunion with Helen Hunt s character Kelly who had essentially started a new life in the Hanks absence To continue a theme this was done right In a lesser film the two might have blissfully run off together into the sunset but Cast Away is smarter and more realistic than that While admittedly still in love the two characters realize that they both must move on This is heart breaking There can t be much worse in life than knowing where your heart lies but not being able to follow it because of something ludicrously random The coda is perfect too Noland finds closure by delivering the package that kept him alive by providing hope one of the most powerful feelings Upon delivery and a chance encounter with the recipient Noland ends his journey by standing at a literal and symbolic crossroads not quite sure what s next Perfect because that is precisely where he is at physically and mentally and emotionally Overall so much is well done Bottom Line One of few films in which I have zero complaints regarding the characters decisions Well written made and acted In a dead heat with Traffic for the best film of 2000 9 of 10,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566235/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,An absolute classic.,One of my favorite movies and probably my favorite Tom Hanks performance It was genius of Zemeckis to not use a musical score during the scenes on the island It adds to the immersion and that feeling of being present on this island with Chuck There is something extremely reflective and meditative about Cast Away that I haven t quite seen in another film Ultimately this movie can lead you to questions about your own life and I cannot commend a movie enough for provoking these types of thoughts One of the most emotional movies of all time Incredible themes as well Tomorrow the sun will rise Who knows what the tide could bring,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8454873/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2011,143 Minutes of absolute boredom,To be honest with you I really do not know what the point of this movie was or what it was trying to do It was basically two hours of Tom Hanks moping around on a desert island worshiping a beachball with a bloody hand on it with a face and then finally deciding to make a bolt and getting rescued by a ship When he gets back home he discovers that home no longer exists Hanks plays an executive for a parcel delivery company and while he is on a mission his plane crashes and he manages to pull himself up onto a desert island where he spends the next four years of his life before he decides to escape Is it a modern version of Robinson Crusoe I don t think so because he is the only inhabitant of this island During his time on the island he is forced to learn to look after himself all the while waiting to be rescued and dreaming on returning home When he does return home he discovers it is not home His wife has remarried thinking that he is dead so in the end he is left with nothing but his job he does return a hero though Personally I would not recommend anybody waste their time with this movie and I will honour that statement by no longer writing anything about this film,3.0,1.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2517366/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2019,I HAVE MADE FIRE!,Not much to say tom hanks is just one of the best living actors besides forrest gump this one is my favorite role of him the storyline could be explained in 1 sentence anyway the movie does not fail to keep you thrilled and compelled a truly great movie experience,8.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4570079/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2012,Phenomenal!,I had already watched this movie years ago but I have a bad memory and because of a book that I recently read made me want to watch this movie again I loved the movie from beginning to end I was crying my eyes out by the time I reached the end This story is brilliant and all of the effort that Tom Hanks puts into this movie is just phenomenal No words to express how well created this movie was and how everything seemed realistic From the cut on his leg from the corral to his losing weight having his beard and hair grow out I am just breathless No matter how devastating it ended it was just perfect because it made the story more realistic The tragedy of that plane crash to him trying to survive in that island without the most important thing emergency supplies and any company but Wilson a ball The story was just magnificent overall By far one of the best films out there,10.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2671319/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2017,"Warm, colourful, engaging - one of my favorite films",Tom Hanks answered the question once on a talk show and it went something like What word do you hear most often when fans see you And he answered that fans often yell Wiiiiiiilson His fans like Cast Away but not only them It is difficult not to fall for the movie s charm not to fall in love with natural beauties and landscape of Fiji and not to connect with the main character I watched the movie ages ago but I often remember it It is an ode to human race a hymn to survival and a story that the average can relate to Spoilers Finally we have a hero with no special powers well paid job or a model girlfriend Chuck Noland is an ordinary man who works at Fed Ex has an ordinary girlfriend and he survives a plane crash The story is pretty much simple and resembles the survival tale of Robinson Crusoe It is not the universal story itself that makes this movie so great it is the setting the atmosphere and psychological and physical struggles inside the main character Being left on an uninhabited island Chuck Noland not to be confused with Chuck Norris has to find things from the plane wreckage and use the pieces of material found on the island in order to survive day by day While watching we cannot resist asking ourselves Would I think of that How would I react in the same situation And by doing so the viewers have to admit that they are truly embedded in the story The director and the whole crew succeeded in making us relate to Chuck Tom Hanks acting was tremendous The audience can relate to his feelings of despair emotional and physical pain fear hunger and loneliness He had his ups and downs on the island and I think most viewers celebrated his achievements with him like catching a fish or making fire Loneliness was the biggest issue for him and therefore he made friends with Wilson the ball I bet that the scenes of poor Chuck talking to the bloody face smudged on the white leather background are among the most memorable and humane scenes depicted on screen Whether we admit it or not we all have our Wilsons in our lives in one form or another Another proof that Tom Hanks is one of the best actors is his wish to make a physical change for a role His body literally transformed from the average couch potato who doesn t do sports into the skillful and fast athlete with sunny tan and strong muscles His body changes are really realistic and Tom Hanks put a lot of effort into training so that his body would reflect malnutrition and other challenges that he faced There are many wonderful aspects of the film but it s difficult to list them all To sum up watching Cast Away is an emotional and aesthetic 1st class journey,10.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3652688/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2020,Nice film that is based on a true story but didn't like the ending,There are some certain things that I didn t like in this movie but they are realistic and when I checked I found that this film was based on a true story so the majority of my points have been taken off and will not be written but I have to leave these few points and deduct the score of the movie based on them because I was really annoyed A roller coaster then a bad ending For me personally I hate bad endings I try to understand and not take points from the score of the movie if it was based on a true story But sometimes i just cant because I really hate bad endings This film I got annoyed when he came back after 4 5 years from The island to the city and to his wife just to find out that she had moved on and married another guy I hated it but understood it Ppl have to move on i get it BUT Later on in the film when they met she broke and went to him to kiss him and hug him and they both told each other that they love each other Ok now im happy and waiting for them to get back together BUT he said you have to go home Wow I understand why he said what he said but my personal opinion I didn t like it incomplete ending In the end he stayed alone and went on the road OK to do what where is he going what is he gonna do with his life long film had to skip a few minutes,7.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5677667/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,Way below expectations *Spoilers*,I seen this movie when I was in the US the other day I was expecting a decent movie and I felt as if I walked away with nothing I admit the island survival side of this movie was interesting WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD but once he was rescued from the island the movie just fell apart it had nothing going for it once he was off it could have made an interesting story but it ended up being usual hollywood drivel Still it wasn t the worst movie i ve seen in recent times but if you want a good movie to see over the holiday season then skip this one and go see original pieces like Traffic or Finding Forrester I rate this 4 5 10,1.0,10.0,37.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565560/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2022,Utterly Depressing,This was a long and tragic movie It s harrowing and dark It s not something I particularly enjoyed watching someone living in isolation for four years straight on a deserted island with no human contact and only himself and a few meagre Fed Ex packages for survival The moments on the island were hard to get through because of how real and bleak they seemed This is the same reason though why this movie is so good It forces us to come to terms with our humanity and that comparable comfort we live in and take for granted This movie overwhelmed me with a feeling of gratitude for my situation It s moments like these when you witness true adversity that you realize that all those times you argued over petty nonsense were a waste of everyone s time and disrespectful to your life and your personal purpose for being on this planet This movie will serve as an awakening for many people and for that alone it deserves a high score Now the actual content wasn t that exciting When you re alone on a deserted island there s only so much you can do but I was impressed with Chuck s improvisation skills It was interesting to see him escape a once doomed situation and slowly gain momentum and faith that some day he might escape against all odds And he does just that And it s glorious to watch It s nail biting and tense The only part of this movie I felt wasn t so well done was the ending Instead of seeing Chuck slowly adjust back to his old life it seems like he never left to begin with By the time he s on the plane back to America he seems perfectly normal although a bit pensive Quite a departure from how he was when we was rescued Four weeks elapses from the point he was rescued and in my opinion it would have been more interesting to watch his reintegration and socialization back into normal society through therapy and the various supports they could offer him His relationship with Kelly was also troubling because it s unresolved Does he get back with her or does she stay with her new husband and family It s hard to say Questions remain unanswered but for the most part this movie is well done and exciting to watch so the problematic ending isn t the end of the world,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7770404/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2006,Practically a one-man show,I won t say that this is a desert island favorite this is about the last thing you want to see if you got stranded It s really a major accomplishment for the director Zemekis and Hanks making the film seem vast and isolated without bogging down If Forest Gump didn t convince you that Tom Hanks is one of the most skilled and credible actors in modern history if not of all time then you need to watch this picture to set you straight Little details build up in this film to add to the realism The story involves Hanks as a corporate worker bee becoming stranded on a small island in the Pacific The depiction of his day to day survival and acceptance of circumstances with occasional moments of great learning prove a crucial element in the pacing of the film His gradual mastery over his environment also increases the audience s sense of participation in the drama He learns how to help himself survive Sure it s a low energy emotional performance for most of the picture but the weight of the film is all on Hanks and the shoot looks pretty physical In fact they shot part of the film and then went back a year later giving Hanks enough time to drop weight to look sufficiently half starved The audience can clearly see his early mistakes in prioritizing his survival tools on the island His delay in learning to build a signal fire costs him dearly like his poor priorities in real life cost him The film is a rewarding survival story and comment on modern life If nothing else this film encourages the examination of your life and may make you want to learn how to build a fire or carry a multi tool with you at all times,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1492879/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2020,At Least an Hour too Long and Never Really Takes Off,The first thing that strikes me with this movie is how irritated it makes me during the scenes when our Robinson Crusoe tries to make a fire For god s sake man use the skates and a rock and you get sparks in seconds But why do I get that irritated This movie is just too long and whatever happened to the perfect movie lenght of 1 30 h Even if it would be shortened with an hour it s still too long as nothing really makes the story bind together and from a promising start there s just short cuts for almost two and a half hour with beautiful photage but that s not enough to keep me interested A weak 4 star movie not recommended to anyone except for having Tom Hanks in the leading or maybe I should say only part,4.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6415540/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2021,Everything ends as it should be,In many great films some events don t end with what it should be Sometimes events end too cliche or too optimistic or too surrealist which messes our appreciation for the film But Cast Away was pretty perfect in that While watching his growing friendship with Wilson I was really concerning which fate has the writer chosen for this lovely friendship Chack has been created Wilson in his mind to be his friend in the wild so Wilson belongs to the wild His story must last as long as Chack is in the wild and also must end when he returns And that was what the writer typically chose When Chack indiscretionally throw Wilson from the cave it might go far with the ocean but thankfully he caught him on the shore because there still was time for Chack in the wild The ship appearance means leaving wilderness so Wilson s story must end before that That was sad but it what has to be done We all had feelings with this island and so Chack had That revealed when he kept his eyes on it until ocean hided it That lasting feeling must be reflected into the events And they did that It comes up when he needed to move on after Kelly became not his anymore It s the concept of if you can t see hope just keep breathing until life has something And remember life always do It was lovely that the last scene is related with the first From the sign on car s back we know that the gorgeous woman who showed him directions was the owner of the package he meant returning to its owner Also she is divorced as the banner which appeared with her husband name at the beginning is now removed So Life did I challenge anyone that the writer meant Chack go behind the woman That was pretty clear after he looked to the other 3 ways and ended looking to the way she went through By the way it was cool when she called Chack cowboy like Toy Story Finally thanks god she didn t say to her dog come on Wilson like I read someone wanting as it would be too cliche and mess up all the film,10.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7461462/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2020,"Been wanting to see this movie for year, finally did, and was left with an ehh impression.",When it comes to Tom Hanks while I will give him his dues because he is a great actor Some of his movies for me I either loved hated or it was somewhere in the middle Thats where this one falls in my opinion Pros The visuals for a movie of its era are great Especially when it comes to the water island etc Tom Hanks did great job acting in this film He was beliveble and made you very enthralled with his pain and agony throughout as man struggling to survive Without giving to much away the movie is very touching and emotional Makes you do alot personal deep thinking about quite few things Cons This complaint I ve seen from quite few people as well The middle of the movie gets very boring and draggy after while I thought the movie could used more scenes about his life as opposed to excess of ones they did on the island While it did show some personal background it wasn t enough in my opinion The ending I felt was abrupt and wasn t fan of I know some people enjoyed it but after all that I just wanted little more out of it Overall would I recommend this movie Definitely depends on type of movie goer you are if you re someone whos into deep acting and good story yes you ll enjoy this film If you re someone who is hard to entertain and gets bored easyly stay far far away from this film,7.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6229065/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,How does he keep doing it?,Tom Hanks has done it again He s got another movie that allows him to pull out the stops and show us what a true star can do with a good story Hollywood pours out schlock by the barrel but not this time Cast Away is destined to become one with classics like Casablanca Gone With The Wind etc the kind of movie that when you say the title it just sends a chill up your spine it s so good Go see this movie several times I ve already seen it three times and each time there s something new that you didn t see the previous times And say a prayer for poor Wilson would you,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566042/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2023,First half was involving the second half not so much,2000 Cast Away DRAMA Interesting theme about lone survivor Chuck Noland Tom Hanks from a plane crash survived while stranded on a deserted beach like island but like most of director Robert Zemeckus movies theirs no one two punch to the ending The scenes that is most involving is when Chuck was alone on the island all by himself and him going toward surviving mode using his instincts The moments that brought the movie down is when Chuck finally makes it back home to Memphis after one month and at that point he finds out his actual wife Kelly Helen Hunt has already moved on And that he was already declared dead after his body wasn t discovered when in actual reality most wives does not move to a new relationship that soon unless of course the Helen Hunt character was not actually in love in love with the Tom Hanks character in the first place It s like losing a wife to cancer or some other and then getting married soon after a month Resorting to viewers to wanting to understand this even more by hoping that the movie was longer to answer some questions I as a viewer want answered I think I saw a war movie that consist of a similar theme except that it was more credible for that war film than it is on here And in fairness I think I loathe the one note persona the Helen Hunt character had shown as if the Tom Hanks character is nothing like the plane crashing was his fault and so forth is ind of dumb if you ask me It kind of demands a sequel if you ask me,6.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9374366/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2021,Censored Film,I watched this movie on satellite TV about 15 years ago and distinctly remember the dramatic scene where Hanks character attempts suicide and fails This was his emotional low point of the cast away ordeal and turning point in his determination to survive Now I watch the movie and this dramatic scene is gone So it appears the censors removed the defining dramatic climax of the movie perhaps for religious reasons who knows You know it doesn t work for me to watch a movie one year and see one version and then later see that it has been shortened Without the attempted suicide scene it is not the same movie It doesn t take you anywhere emotionally so ends up being just another movie For that reason I don t recommend watching this movie You are being had The movie was a 10 and now is about a 7,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7212294/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,"Gets Better With Age, Your Age That Is!",When I saw this in the theaters I was in my 20s I was expecting a lot from it considering it starred Tom Hanks and it was a reunion between him and Zemeckis who scored Oscar gold with Forrest Gump I recall enjoying the island stuff but then when it came to the parts when he returns back to civilization it felt anti climatic and that final ending was disappointing But as I ve gotten older I get it You appreciate what you have because it could be gone in an instant And for Helen Hunt s character imagine losing someone you love only to find out they are still alive The guilt turmoil etc especially if you moved on and remarried and had a new life The ending is open ended for a reason Hanks character has been re born He s got a new lease on life and now he must make a choice which road to take And I believe he takes the road leading back to that home with the wings So I would say if you don t like this movie when you first see it give it a few years and revisit it I think you will appreciate it more,8.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5529796/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2005,Cast it away,This movie is really hard to criticize mostly because not much is happening The whole plot seem to be this stranded guy misses his fianc and his love keeps him going bot lo and behold he is for 2nd deserted when he returns and gets stranded on the plains of America this time along with a symbol of Americn consumerism an off roader The only time some real cinematography is on the verge of breaking out probably an oversigt by the director is the first camera motions which lends itself from North by Northwest by the great master I can truthfully state that this was about the dullest film I have ever been unfortunate to witness I see no dramatic storyline no depth of character no development only a captain s log of things the stranded fellow does to survive none of which is even original apart from the dental operation Don t try it at home Imagine the great monologues the main character could have given in the depth of the Pacific night elaborating with newly gained wisdom like an Indian hermit Helen Hunt does a fine job creating a character though but the exhaustion of blowing life into the shallow script takes the better of her and she faints Probably what the director conceives of a climax The movie is going nowhere as was the stranded fellow and it is all rounded symbolically up by Hanks returning to the point he started only with a loss of 4 wasted years He was lucky The spectator wastes 2 fine hours I can only say Avoid this Scyllian reef at all cost and cast it away if the movie strands on your coast,1.0,8.0,30.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1033012/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2000,"Absolutely, positively ho-hum",Greetings again from the darkness I feel cheated A great actor first rate director monster budget the Dreamworks production team and a tropical island and all that results is a two and a half hour commercial for FedEx Is this where our movies are headed Tom Hanks should feel cheated too He takes a year off to lose weight and grow hair and he gets to throw a spear and lay on a wooden raft Please On a positive note Zemekis does provide us with a wonderfully executed plane crash sequence I felt like I was THERE as Hanks struggles for air Hanks has developed into a remarkable actor In the few scenes with other people his skills overwhelm every one of them including Helen Hunt Why the need to skip FOUR years The cheap stunt to make us feel Hanks desperation from the previous year could easily have been a remarkable scene in the movie My tidbit on this one involves Fred Smith CEO of FedEx playing himself in one scene Was this his price to have his company s brand stamped all over this film Or did he receive endorsement funds and have his ego stroked Overall this is a very mediocre movie that proves with enough money even mediocrity can be slickly filmed,6.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565658/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,Outstanding !!,Tom Hanks and Wilson 3 It s all about love about the difficulty of finding it in a world obsessed with success about the freakish accidents that can produce or destroy it about an ordeal that led one man to re think what is meaningful in life and about the need to bring to the pursuit of love the same resourcefulness and courage that enabled the hero to survive on an island for 5 years Tom Hanks is superb as Chuck Noland creating immense sympathy for an ordinary guy trapped not against his will in a job that is eating him alive How many actors could have made Noland s attachment to Wilson believable Yet Hanks does Everything about it works the cinematography the locations the acting the story and this is Robert Zemeckis greatest showpiece Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing The story is so well written in its simplicity and Helen Hunt and Hanks have amazing chemistry It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5783251/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2008,Survival,This is a film about survival Having survived a plane crash the plane sinking and being cast adrift in towering stormy seas the next stage of Chuck Noland s survival is the basic Robinson Crusoe problem of keeping the body part of body and soul together solving the problems of not starving or dying of thirst and of being sheltered from inhospitable elements This film shows us those trials and tribulations but also makes it clear that Noland had difficulties just as great with the soul part of body and soul He survived this barely suicide was not only considered but rehearsed with the help of three psychological crutches One was his companion Wilson the volleyball which he turned into his constant companion and confidante The second was the preservation of one unopened FedEx package as long as that package remained there to be delivered Noland held on to a reason for surviving And the third was the thought of returning to Kelly Frears the fianc e who was waiting for his return In the event of course his engagement to Kelly didn t survive But even the demise of that engagement was something else for him to survive This film struck a good balance between true life adventure action spectacle and human drama Hanks is always good and Cast Away was substantially better than the sentimental drivel of Forrest Gump his previous collaboration with Zemeckis I watched it with my wife and 24 year old son who unusually sat in the same room with us to watch TV and all three of us thoroughly enjoyed this film,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1858966/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2000,reminds me of the movie hell in the Pacific,Warning a bit of a spoiler don t read Tom Hanks plays a stranded Fed Ex boss on a Island The movie shows the contrast between his busy every second counts life to the very mundane what time is it life on the island In fact the push against the clock pushes him onto the plane and into the upcoming events The choices his jobs requires changes plans which effects his personal life I can relate well with this for my job and many other peoples job do this daily On the Island there is very little dialog but the viewer follows the story by his actions very simular to the movie Hell in the Pacific with Lee Marven He make the choice to leave the island or go insane the twist in the story is what happenens to the environment he left 4 years ago The movie ends quite nicly with him at a cross roads on a highway which symbolizes the cross roads in his life A good film fresh and a story that you could see once and any remake would be very redunant,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566153/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2005,Engaging and very powerful,Cast Away is the sort of film that filmmakers should be striving to give their audiences more often While it s not wholly original and influences from the classic Robinson Crusoe story especially shine through we haven t seen all that many films of this nature in recent years and therefore this is a refreshing yarn Tom Hanks stars as the businessman unlucky enough to find himself stranded all alone on an island in the middle of nowhere Completely cut off from any kind of society our hero must do all he can to survive the elements that he has found himself in Unlike most films that we ve seen Hanks in before this performance is very much of a physical nature and his lack of dialogue gives the actor a very different feel to what he usually evokes from the audience Tom Hanks had to work hard to give this performance as the role requires a lot of hard work but he s risen to the challenge excellently and this movie has given me more respect for the actor I at one time didn t have any respect for at all The way that Robert Zemeckis draws us into the protagonist s plight is really well done and throughout the movie you almost feel like you are marooned on the island as well I was sat transfixed with the action on screen and my viewing of this movie marks one of the most engaging I ve ever had in my film watching career It s amazing how Hanks can be sat talking to a volleyball with grass stuck to it s head and have the audience engrossed in the action Ironically Hanks talking to a volleyball was much more interesting than any conversations he had with real actors in movies such as Philadelphia and Apollo 13 The film is very realistic throughout and this helps the movie no end when it comes to drawing the audience in as this could very much be a documentary feature of a true story such is the realism of the picture It comes across most evidently in the scenes that see Hanks writhe in pain after gashing his leg on a stray rock in the ocean We actually FEEL his pain and that is testament to the power of this movie It took me five years to finally catch this film and even then it was only by accident If I was you and I hadn t seen this film yet I d do so ASAP,8.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1095236/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2006,impressive and touching,I don t feel there is any need to describe this movie too much or to emphasize its meanings since anybody who has read or seen the story of Robinson Crusoe has a pretty good idea of what this movie is about I ll just focus on the differences here and on some things that I found charming and some not so charming 1 I don t know if it was done intentionally but Hanks character is a typical workaholic of our day and age a yuppie and someone totally dependent on consumerism So I found myself feeling a slight satisfaction when he was cast away I was kinda going Let s see what you do now Mr Career Driven Corporate Employee CEO of Fedex Wannabe I am sure the makers of this movie had no intention of creating such a blunt statement to the extent I am suggesting but I felt it that way The question here is What do you do if you have nothing except yourself When you re not Mr X with a social status and every bit of your outer world disappears and you are left with nothing but yourself Now the solution of our hero going through pain anguish and suicidal thoughts is to hold on to his past Here is the major difference to Robinson Crusoe Robinson finally adapts Our hero never really does even though he does manage to create some kind of inner balance not without the help of one of the most beautiful characters in movie history the volleyball Wilson Their relationship is extremely touching 2 The emotions of the character are strong and presented eloquently and in an elegant manner to the viewer You really feel with the character The only flaw of the movie in my opinion is that it s just a bit too picturesque Sure some gritty realism like the pulling the tooth out scene but sometimes too picturesque Fortunately the incredible versatility and excellent casting of Tom Hanks covers most of that and really touches you 3 As for the coming back sequence and the ending very very nice Lots of great acting and storytelling here and the conclusion is definitely appropriate and consistent with the character development Great final frame with the crossroads Only one observation in the sense of What would I do in the same situation I would have definitely have opened up the package and adapt like Robinson C at least I feel so The fact that our hero never manages to really adapt is a statement of our fragility as a social animal The fact that he needed that unopened package to be finally delivered as a way to keep his sanity all those secluded years is a sad reminder that it is extremely hard to be really free from your outer world Robinson Crusoe was written centuries ago in the classical pre romantic period of literature in a time when it seems there was a lot more confidence in the ability of man to live at peace with himself I am not sure whether I am more like this Fedex guy or Robinson but I would definitely prefer Robinson Anyway Bravo Tom Hanks and let s hope Zemeckis will make THIS kind of movies as opposed to his usual obnoxious content free block busters,9.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1345505/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2003,"wonderful movie, but very sad",this is a pretty original movie what would you do if you were stuck on an un known south pacific island by yourself i liked the quiet nature of it i mean tom hanks is on his own the majority of the movie that must be really lonely to be without human interaction for 4 years his loneliness gets the best of him and he forms a friendship with with a volleyball he names wilson get it hehe a lot of the elements were pretty depressing tom hanks does add his flavorful humor though very superior acting its pretty much a one man show helen hunt did really good its not exactly a feel good movie but it is quite enjoyable if you have a quiet nature and enjoy more serious dramatic movies this is for you i loved it 10 stars out of 10,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566242/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,I'll be right back,A Fed Ex employee survives a plane crash and is stranded on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean This is a strong piece of visual storytelling with a good performance from Tom Hanks One character stuck on and island for the majority of a film s running time shouldn t really work but the portrayal of Chuck s situation and his battle against nature and loneliness are compelling to watch There is a strong theme about dealing with loss and moving on with life throughout the movie and it s tackled very well Everything is tightly focussed from his perspective starting with the crash that is suitably terrifying in its depiction especially for any viewers with a fear of flying The realisation that he is stranded and unlikely to be rescued never really hits home for the first hour of the film as he tackles one compelling obstacle after another I cannot really go into anymore detail about plot and scenes without spoiling but it s safe to say that the character goes through a very difficult journey right up to virtually to the final scene Visually it is fabulous with very little needing to be said due to the physical performance of Hanks and what the camera shows us The focus on several objects that link to previous scenes and memories is brilliant Also the idea of the unopened package is great There are some typically Hollywood overly dramatic simplistic moments such as the speech Chuck gives toward the end that explains everything but generally I think it s a strong film It held my 5 year old daughter for the majority of the running time which is always impressive in my eyes Helen Hunt is excellent in her supporting scenes and makes you feel for the position her character is in For me it is an 8 5 10 but I round upwards,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7634312/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2015,A time-challenger man caught at his own game ...,What if Cast Away was only focused on the Island sequence Say five or ten minutes of exposition the pivotal plane crash the Island and then make it end with the freighter passing by an exhausted Chuck Noland on his raft Maybe it would have puzzled many viewers but I think the movie would have worked better That ending would have been the film in a nutshell a man overcoming the limitations he inherited from comfortable and convenient modernity in order to domesticate wildlife to make everything we take for granted a challenge worth to triumph over and to find over patience and intelligence the strength to go back to civilization Cast Away was the modernization of the stranded in an Island myth of the Robinson Crusoe figure something that was begging to catch the eye of a talented filmmaker which it did The before and after are only important on a minor screen writing scale yes we have a character s arc to close a man who starts as a cocky workaholic employee for FedEx and then discover that there s more in life than stress around the clock if you try to challenge time beware that time challenges you that would ve made an interesting tag line We ve been through that thousands of times anyway so why wouldn t Zemeckis trust our intelligence and spare us the whole sequence of Chuck learning his lesson while he s back to ordinary life Indeed the film is told through Chuck s perspective like him we find ourselves confined in a hostile world after a spectacular crash sequence we discover the island through his eyes the loneliness the silence only covered by the perpetual sound of tides the darkness only enlightened by the shining stars It s nature at its most majestic and scary Then step by stem through a meticulous and patient directing we see Chuck trying to get over each step of comfort finding anything that would make shoes food or habitat Anything with what is at hands And no matter how famous Robinson Crusoe s story is or how used to Survivor reality shows we are this is clich proof because although we know it s a matter of time before he learns fishing before he makes fire or ropes Zemeckis opts for a documentary film like precision that keeps our eyes hooked on the how rather than on the when We don t have time to wonder what will happen when we re fascinated by what we see And Tom Hanks brings so much naturalness than we share every feeling he has even the ache on his teeth and the inconvenient self made remedy he makes is something we can oddly relate to The trickiest part of the film is with Kelly Helen Hunt She represents his last connection to the real world but for some reason I wasn t impressed by the flash in flash out sequences on her little picture in the pocket watch She s his love life okay He was about to propose her before the crash got it But didn t he have parents Cousins Friends The character of Kelly was made like an artificial synthesis of every human relationship in Chuck s life it made the ending even more incongruous as if Chuck was just a man of his job and a woman Then having lost one he had to focus on the other The romance was too predictable for such an epic start And I m sure Cast Away would be regarded as a masterpiece had it focused on the Island not just a classic film of the early 2000 s The only emotional climax it deserved was the farewell to Wilson Yes Wilson The film s ticket to immortality a character made of a Volley Ball with a bloody hand that drew a smiling figure a hazard leading to Chuck having finally someone to speak to Wilson confirms what was hinted in the pilot s burial sequence a man needs to be a man and one of the first manifestations of civilization were funerals A man needs abstractions he needs to communicate and that s what Wilson is and we re so in line with Hanks performance that we take Wilson as a person too and his disappearance is heartbreaking And it was necessary because that was the only way for Chuck to lose the ultimate connection with the Island to be normal again At one point of dementia he was almost going to drown just to catch a damn volleyball this was the final test before finally getting back to his senses and waiting for either death or a boat to catch him The death of Wilson so to speak was the only possible climax Having Chuck getting back to life and discovering all its insolent accommodations of modern life sleeping on the ground having troubles is important on a broad way but not within the context of the film So why not leaving that for our imagination I thought a man like Chuck would become an instant celebrity would publish a book would understand Kelly getting married would get back to his family etc etc Oddly enough Hanks plays the second Chuck like a kind of Forrest Gump whose slowness would result from that trauma It s like watching a whole other film A pity that the film gets drown in cinematic conventions for a concept that asked for more simplicity and straightforward narrative and I suspect the film would have garnered more awards and nominations had it focused on that and if Zemeckis was so eager showing the aftermath then make a two part movie and leave the Island for this one The Island sequence was enough to make a masterpiece or in other words why would you put a clich kiss in the rain scene in a film where the most memorable relationship and interaction is between a man and a volleyball,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3206999/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2001,A Good Movie Marred By A Very Weak Ending,I have to confess right off that I find the basic premise of this movie difficult to believe I just really do not accept that with modern satellite technology etc there could be very many unknown islands anywhere in the world True the reason that Chuck Noland played by Tom Hanks couldn t be found was that his plane had veered off course and no one was looking for him in the area he was found in OK Maybe But I still find it hard to accept Setting that aside I enjoyed most of this movie Tom Hanks showed again why he is one of Hollywood s best in what for most of the movie is a one man show He manages to hold the attention of the viewer as we root for him in his struggle for survival Noland a hard driving FedEx executive obsessed with time and his work suddenly after a plane crash leaves him stranded on an island finds himself with too much of the former and not enough of the latter The island becomes for him a school of hard knocks as he learns how to survive on his own with just the basics Hanks does a great job with this part and especially compelling is the relationship Noland develops with Wilson the volleyball a relationship that brings forth both laughs and a few tears from anyone watching Humour in a largely difficult movie is also brought forth by Noland s obsessive decision to sort the FedEx packages that washed ashore with him I think this movie would have been much stronger if Noland had simply stayed on the island and we had been able to watch Hanks work more deeply with this part of the role SPOILERS AHEAD Unfortunately he has to be rescued And here s where the movie starts to unravel Even after all the time he has spent on the island Noland doesn t strike me as the type who could build a particularly good raft and the raft he does build doesn t strike me as one that could stand up to the storms and wind and waves of the South Pacific But it does He gets rescued by a passing ship after being watched over by a huge whale Noland then makes what to me seemed to be a very fast 4 weeks transition to life after 4 years on his island except that when he gets home he is absolutely transfixed by being able to turn an electric light on and off They had no lights on the ship for him to experiment with Noland returns expecting to be reunited with his fianc Kelly Helen Hunt only to find her married and a mother Hunt does a decent job of portraying the confusion that would be felt in such circumstances but the entire last half hour of the movie just seemed to be a pitifully weak ending to what had been a pretty good movie although I get the point just as Noland was cast away on the island so is he cast away by the woman he loves once he gets home I have to confess that I was grateful that the movie didn t go for the sappy ending that we seemed to be heading for after Noland delivered his package In the end this strikes me as no better than a 7 10,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565978/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2001,fascinating tale of survival(spoilers),From such established literary classics as Robinson Crusoe and Lord of the Flies to such products of pop culture idiocy as Gilligan s Island and the original Survivor the human imagination has been fired up by tales of ordinary folk being suddenly stranded on a deserted island and forced to survive by sheer wit ingenuity and the unquenchable human instinct for self preservation Perhaps those of us who have been softened by all the amenities we have come to rely on to get us through our daily lives wonder if we ourselves could rise to such a challenge Whatever the underlying motivation the lure of the theme is primal and seemingly universal as evidenced by the recent popular successes of both TV s Survivor and the latest movie opus from Robert Zemeckis Cast Away Cast Away is a film that works on several different levels at once but surely the most impressive is the sheer physicality of the undertaking This extends not only to its setting but the fact that Tom Hanks during the course of the filming underwent a change in physique matched only by Robert De Niro in Raging Bull Even more impressive is that Hanks delivers a tour de force performance portraying a character who for vast stretches of the film s running time speaks nary a word and hence must convey his thoughts and feelings almost entirely through facial expressions and bodily gestures The story is a simple one Chuck Noland is a classic type A FedEx exec one wonders what tidy sum the company forked over for the benefit of this product tie in to end all product tie ins who is clearly too focused on the split second requirements of his hectic job to stop and smell the roses or to formally propose marriage to his girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt When his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean Chuck as the sole survivor manages to wash up on a deserted island and is forced to make it on his own in this strange forbidding world Zemeckis and Hanks do a remarkable job making Chuck s predicament and his reaction to it believable and fascinating We watch the step by step process by which Chuck attempts to bring order to his strange new existence and the equally intriguing ways in which he attempts to cope with the mounting loneliness and solitude that will face him in the coming years if he is not rescued Cast Away is filled with moments of surprising warmth and emotionality The personal relationship Chuck establishes with a volleyball he names Wilson achieves a strange meaning and depth since it speaks to the great need we all have for companionship and love even if we have to invest human traits into an inanimate object to get them children of course do this all the time with their stuffed animals or imaginary playmates The finale of the film rings true as well for we know that in our lives fate often intervenes in ways we do not expect and that time truly does not stand still for any of us The world marches on and if for any reason we fall off temporarily all we can do is to jump back on and try to catch up painful as that may be at times One might have wished for a bit more psychological depth to be applied to Chuck s experiences AFTER the rescue an exploration of the stages a man caught in such a situation would go through in his re assimilation into civilization But that would probably require a whole other film or at least another hour s worth of running time As it is Cast Away is gripping moving and fascinating to watch and it is a worthy entry in a genre that seems never to lose its hold on our imaginations,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566007/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2000,"Bad, pointless film",CAST AWAY MINI REVIEW PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF MY COMMENTS MAY GIVE AWAY CERTAIN PLOT LINES OF THE FILM Cast Away could have been a great film but it turned out to be a real disappointment for me The plane crash and the subsequent challenge of surviving on an isolated island was quite fascinating The problem was that the relationship between the Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt characters wasn t well established It seemed forced and rather phony One minute Hanks character is calling his lover from Russia in a rather matter of fact tone telling her he loves her He barely turns off the cell phone and he s back at his high stress job If only the director had given him even a few seconds to dwell on his recent conversation with someone he is supposed to be madly in love with I just never bought the love story aspect of it so when he returns after being stranded on a tiny deserted island for over four years I just didn t care about her or their relationship Far too much time had passed both in real life and in the movie Having Hanks stare at tiny fading photo of her just didn t work I think Helen Hunt is a fine actress but her tom boyish looks don t do much for my libido And if the audience can t feel what the protagonist is supposed to be feeling well it just doesn t work does it I also couldn t understand why the movie dragged on for so long after his rescue The film would have been much better if it had ended at that point The scene when the freighter glided by his raft was fabulous There were a lot of great scenes in this movie but they didn t lead up to anything dramatically His relationship with Wilson the volleyball provided the most tender moments in the film Wilson should be nominated for best supporting actor Sure his acting was a bit stiff at times but it was better than the mushy acting that preceded Hank s disappearance and certainly much better than the absurd acting and dialogue we had to endure in the aftermath of his rescue Maybe I was expecting too much after reading all the great press All in all a real disappointment,3.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565568/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2016,One Man Show,This film is very interesting because it shows a story of survival in Robinson Crusoe style something not very common in movies It consists of a deep psychological drama which brilliantly explores the despair depression the need to survive in extremely harsh conditions homesickness loneliness If we add to these features the particularity of the film has virtually only one character during most of the time Helen Hunt plays an essential role in the plot but appears very little could be expected a film absolutely still and lifeless But it s not the case The film uses the psychological ups and downs of Chuck the main character played by Tom Hanks to keep moving and avoid dead times finding space for great moments of tension and hilarious moments of humor Hanks is a highly capable and talented actor able to suck his character to the bone and do a first class job truly chameleonic Literally Hanks carries the film with the back thanks to this superb performance The sets and shooting locations are also worth a positive word,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3556575/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,Adventure...,Cast Away is an Adventure Drama movie in which we watch a man working for FedEx arriving on a remote island after a crash landing He has to find a way in order to survive while he has to remain sane and in a good physical condition I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot and it contained also plenty of in tense moments that made the movie even more interesting The interpretation of Tom Hanks who played as Chuck Noland was simply outstanding and he made the difference and elevated the movie His story and his interpretation made us relate to him and follow him on his journey Lastly I have to say that Cast Away is an interesting movie and I recommend everyone to watch it,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7782103/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2020,"hopE, hoPE, hOPE and HOPE",The movie begins in a faraway place continues in an unknown and far off place and finally ends in the same first place Maybe it wants to say that you can live in the distance and somewhere you can be in love you can be hopeful and you can be responsible Because in these distant places there is no supervisor to oversee your actions no judge to judge you only yourself who is the highest observer and judge The philosophy of creation is the same inner discovery external discovery search and hope When Chuck entered the island the rhythm of movie seems to be slowing down and some viewers are complaining that the movie is going to boring But I think this slow pace is intentional to show the daily routine of life As long as there is no goal and we are only trying to meet the basic needs eating and sleeping etc we will suffer from monotony And this story continues for Chuck for four years until it leads to emptiness and suicide Excitement returns to the movie when he decides to fight for his life risk it and escape the monotony Before entering the island Chuck was a lover and responsible person Elements that saved him against loneliness and wild of nature He opened all the packages except one in order to keep it alive in the hope that it would reach its destination and use this lever to escape to life Man is a social being even in pure solitude It is necessary to have a companion even if it is made by one s own hands The film s clear message is hope and a desire to live even in the most cast away places,10.0,2.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5649525/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2001,Even the great Tom Hanks can't make Cast Away live up to its expectations.,Yes Cast Away is a good movie but it is not nearly as good as it was expected to be especially with such big names as Tom Hanks Helen Hunt and Robert Zemeckis director of excellent films like Romancing the Stone Forrest Gump and the great Back to the Future trilogy However the problem doesn t have anything to do with the director or any of the actors As far as I m concerned they all delivered great performances The general bad aftertaste that the movie leaves comes more as a result of the pathetically weak story that is thinly disguised by the big budget and the big names associated with the film Think about it a hard working and fairly successful man goes on a business trip leaves his beloved soon to be wife behind the plane crashes he gets stranded on a desert island But who cares The only way that we are able to develop any feeling for the character is that he s Tom Hanks Cast Away is little more than an updated and much improved I ll have to admit re telling of the old desert island story You have the obvious comparison to Gilligan s Island but there are countless other places where this general premise can be found In 1987 Christopher Walken starred in a film called The Dead Zone in which he plays a man who falls into a coma for several years after a car accident and when he regains consciousness he finds himself in exactly emphasis on exactly the same situation that Tom Hanks was in at the end of Cast Away There s even a short story by Stephen King who also wrote The Dead Zone called Survivor Type and you can guess what that s about Except that in Survivor Type the guy trapped on the island gets so desperate that he amputates his own foot he had fractured his ankle trying to catch a seagull for food and eats it but needless to say a Hollywood film would never get as graphic as that possible spoilers ahead The timeline of Cast Away was also a little too blocky The film up to the point where Chuck Noland became stranded was very smooth and then we get a good look at his realization of what has happened to him and what he does to adapt to life on the island but then the film jumps four years into the future I don t expect every one of Chuck s exploits to be shown onscreen because then the movie would be four years long but I think it was too early in the film to jump ahead that far The rescue was probably the worst part of the film they might have done better to just start the end credits when Chuck raises his hand to the passing ship because to skip the entire rescue sequence and jump straight to Chuck re entry into civilized life is disorienting and disappointing There s really not much left to be done in the desert island area but despite Cast Away s effort to resurrect the theme there is a lot to be said in defense of the film For example there was clearly a lot of thought put into the content of the film almost making up for the lacking story Noland s relationship with Wilson was a crude but interesting and often amusing statement about the human need to interact although their eventual separation was not very believable Why didn t Chuck go get Wilson and then swim back to the raft Did he really need to bring the raft with him Maybe the audience was left to assume that an unseen ocean current rendered that obvious solution impossible but I failed to see the conflict in that particular scene Another thing that was very successful in the film was the portrayal of Noland s predicament Sure it s funny at some points but that s because it s Tom Hanks and he s just a funny guy but that also fits perfectly with the film Here s this guy from the big city who judging from his substantial gut has little experience in the outside world Suddenly he s stuck on an island in the middle of the endless ocean and he has no idea what to do Nevertheless the instinct of self preservation kicks in and Noland finds tools for survival left and right which was one of the things that made the film so interesting Maybe this will teach that foolish Chuck Noland never to say I ll be right back Didn t he ever see Scream Hanks total physical transformation was absolutely astounding and it magnified the effectiveness of the film at the same time as it demonstrated his dedication to the cinematic medium you don t think he agreed to go to all that trouble because he needed money or publicity do you While it is far from Hanks best film or Helen Hunt s or Robert Zemeckis Cast Away was just about as good as it could have been given it s tired premise and it s occasionally jerky presentation,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565760/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2023,"""Cast Away"" is a classic, with an exceptional message of courage and resilience in times of isolation. A standing ovation to Tom Hanks and Zemeckis once more!",Just the fact that Cast Away by Robert Zemeckis is a film that takes place most of the time on the beach of a desert island where a single and lonely man tries to survive should already have been reason enough for the general public to watch it Would have found it boring Contrary to expectations the feature film starring Tom Hanks not only became a huge success with the public and critics but is already one of the great North American classics of the 2000s Masterpiece Forrest Gump years before is due to a combination of factors But the main one I still think is the impeccable rhythm of the second act despite elements that are not very palatable to the common spectator such as the total absence of a soundtrack and action scenes The story of Cast Away is well put together divided into three segments that portray different situations Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland a systems engineer at FedEx who is obsessed with punctuality and work This ends up affecting his social commitments a little in particular his relationship with Kelly Frears Helen Hunt who even though they are about to get married Chuck s busy schedule always interferes On a Christmas occasion Chuck interrupts the party to solve a problem in Malaysia leaving everything behind but promising his beloved that he will be back soon During the flight in a violent storm the plane where Chuck is crashes in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and he is the only survivor for having managed before the collision with the water to improvise an inflatable raft but which loses all and any electronic equipment Ocean waves take you to a deserted island where there is nothing but nature And it is in this part that the film walks through a perfectly conducted narrative where only the main actor is on the scene and this lasts for more than an hour and a half and this time is equivalent in the film to four long years in which the character he finds himself lost and isolated in that place without any contact with anyone But this hour and a half into the movie will show how Chuck adapts to nature Tom Hanks talent prevails making the protagonist s experience believable enough for the public to be truly interested in him and not in a silly caricature of a castaway Note how Chuck Noland never makes the difficulties he goes through a reason for unbearable drama or tears in bulk What matters is the most primitive experience of the protagonist involving his survival and his health not only physical but also mental The screenplay by William Broyles Jr Takes care to craft situations that empathize with Noland rather than pity him We hope for the character s survival but we don t sympathize with him as an inert victim unable to react to chance This general tone is profoundly important in the cohesiveness of the work Otherwise the outcome of Cast Away could never have gone the way it did Hanks gives Chuck the air of an honest man who hasn t always made the right choices Valuing his career more than the time he has in life the character was so dedicated to his professional competence that the rest was levitating in expectations that were never fulfilled And the actor intones each micro expression in an always blunt way showing Chuck s regrets in relation to lost time poorly used Something that only the absolute isolation gave him ironically time to reflect The actor s delivery was so great that the filming had to be divided into two parts the first in which Chuck is healthy and the actor with his normal kilos the second to represent the character in survival mode with 20 kilos less In this sense the ellipse proposed by the script is also fundamental when jumping from the first to the last year of the protagonist on the island In addition to avoiding the slowness of the narrative and the complete loss of rhythm the option of Broyles Jr Surprises the audience with the enormous evolution of the character from the shipwrecked man who learned to make fire with sticks and eat raw fish to the man who is fully adapted to his new world Zemeckis direction is also spot on The raccord that rhymes fire and water two elements dear to the new reality stand out and transitions to a closed shot over a fish A harpoon hits him in the face and the camera performs a tilt to show that the one who hunted him was a new Chuck Noland with enormous beard and hair and recorded by a medium shot that affirms him as a kind of scrawny hero la Robinson Crusoe Here Zemeckis leaves no room for doubt his protagonist acts on reality He changes it and changes with it The crash of the FedEx plane which put the protagonist in a situation never imagined is the perfect hybris to disturb the notion of time in Cast Away Noland is only compelled to react against a new reality and to change profoundly in the face of it because everything he had known has suddenly disappeared Nothing could be more disturbing for a top official in a huge postal company obsessed with the idea of speed and order That was his job optimizing time and his personal life followed equally strict guidelines and deadlines since the wedding with his fianc e Kelly Hellen Hunt was already perfectly underway But the tragic dimension of existence without any Nietzschean pedantry was placed between Chuck Noland and his plans and that is why the treatment that the film as a whole gives him is so dignified by making him a factotum of his own paths Noland reclusive on the island metaphorizes his own existence since his loneliness in every decision is the loneliness of all of us He will be solely responsible for his own survival over 1500 days But the idea of responsibility so well crafted in Cast Away does not exclude the other This is evident in the figure of the most famous inanimate object in the history of cinema the Wilson volleyball As a gregarious being Chuck Nolan finds himself in need of human presence or at least personified But anyone who sees Wilson as just a character why not use the term who serves him as a companion to assuage loneliness is wrong The humanized ball becomes everything another human being would be it is where Tom Hanks character channels his affection but also with whom he argues for whom he cries with regret when he offends and throws him overboard in a fit of fury and for those who feel responsible for having to let go on the high seas The other appears as an imperative in Cast Away It appears as an anchor for love and as a genealogy for conflicts Anyway necessary The character s escape offers a nice hint as to what the outcome will be It is through the adaptation of the protagonist to his new environment that he even comes to know the behavior of the tides In a rare moment of low tide he throws himself into the sea together with Wilson and manages to overcome the waves that challenged his advance In a story so fond of themes like time chance and individual responsibility nothing more natural than the character s salvation would come by his own hands The low tide appears as an allegory of opportunities It is through the combination of fortuna opportunity granted by the sea and virt the protagonist s long preparation to overcome it that the character achieves his greatest objective The sequence in which the protagonist wins this battle is harrowing but rewarding Robert Zemeckis as already mentioned is a huge differential in this production Here he turns the plane crash into a true cinematic exercise utilizing the catastrophic scenario brilliantly as Hanks intones the desperation of someone trying to survive The darkness exalts the sound of the propellers hitting the sea while the flashes show the viewer the state of calamity inside what was once a plane In addition the director makes the life of a single man on an island something tense very similar to what was done years later in Into the Wild and Gravity as loneliness changes the sanest mind Thus the effort to survive both in this film and in the examples cited make overcoming something memorable for those who accompany it but above all for those who conquer it And seeing Chuck Noland s pain in this feature is the credit that Zemeckis direction deserves creating a completely friendly atmosphere in the first act to then shatter the main character s expectations and the viewer as a result Despite making all the right choices in the long sequence set on the desert island he is visibly lost at the conclusion of the plot as if he no longer has any interest in what is about to happen which is understandable since the ending created by screenwriter William Broyles is mediocre at best Be that as it may Zemeckis should be applauded for his smart and courageous decision not to supplement the second act of Cast Away with a soundtrack something that any other filmmaker would end up doing and what s worse possibly that score would end up being awarded By silently following Chuck s misadventures the director intensifies even more the feeling of loneliness conveyed by the film which demonstrates his intelligence By the way the great photography by Don Burgess must be highlighted which precisely highlights the beauty of the island where the story was filmed Cast Away is an experience of contemplative cinema from the early 2000s something that has become increasingly rare with the almost frenetic montage adopted by cinema Celebrating the talent of a team that deserves every applause the result is only not perfect due to the excesses of the second act and the conclusion that

13 November 2019,Still super good,I hadn t seen this in years and had forgotten most of the details Its a timeless movie just as good today as when it came out in 2000 I d forgotten that this is ultimately a love story had forgotten the despair the giving up the suicide attempt mostly just remembered Wilson and Fire Tom Hanks is brilliant in his one man show of survival as airfreight executive Chuck Noland a man who lives by the clock until his plane crashes and he washes ashore on a deserted island in the Pacific For more than 4 years he struggles to stay alive sustained only by the companionship of a volley ball he names Wilson I still I had to question how easily Tom excepts that he is alone on a desert island I lived in the Caribbean some islands are very desolate in parts he might have at least walked around the bay there could have been a Hyatt Regency or a road or a cruise ship dock but no he just hunkers down on the beach Liked the relationship with Helen Hunt how hard it was for both of them That scene with Wilson and the raft still made me cry Best actor nomination to Tom Hanks,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5255066/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2001,Vastly Overrated,What is so good about this film that critics and moviegoers alike insist that is deserves not only the praise it s getting but Oscar nominations I can only conclude that sadly it was such a poor overall year for quality films that we re all so desperate as to rate a below average movie much higher than it deserves Aside from the fact that the story was nothing more than a dull overlong contrived piece that was supposed to be something about time it was just bad filmmaking Frankly I think the little P O V shot of the package near the beginning of the movie was one of the most annoying shots that I ve seen in a long time Just what did that accomplish that a simple closeup of the package wouldn t have Follow the package in extreme CU if you must but please a package nor the hand of the delivery man has eyes for us to see through Unless for some reason there was supposed to be a camera strapped to the package Granted there is some nice cinematography in the film as well but it is overshadowed by the sheer lack of any real coherent storyline Someone else said it best Tom Hanks gets stranded and suddenly he s a man without a brain FOUR YEARS It didn t cross his mind to build a boat before then I hope I don t get stuck on an island with Chuck Noland thank you Why all the silly gaps in time The film would have been much more interesting had we actually seen what he went through in order to survive for that long hmmm think the screenwriter couldn t come up with much for him to do over the course of four years and if he built a raft right away then the movie would be cut in half so hey just put in a long passage of time with a title card and everything is solved It pains me to see a film like this getting so much praise Yes it has been a bad year for movies but there were some good ones too High Fidelity Gladiator heck even Mission Impossible II was a better made film than Cast Away Here s hoping 2001 is better so maybe audiences will start expecting a little more from their movies,1.0,24.0,67.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565618/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2006,"Excellent survival theme; I am not a big Tom Hanks fan, but...",this film has a good message and he is believable in this role Also something is to be said for the story especially in this day and age where everything is taken for granted Yes many books and adventure stories have addressed similar themes Treasure Island Lord of the Flies etc And the theme of being stranded on an island is hardly unusual However the presentation is what counts and this film is worth watching If you are ever experiencing something in your own life that seems insurmountable and happen to catch this film it may help suspend your disbelief and actually make you feel better about life in general After Hanks is stranded on a remote Pacific island he realizes the frivolity of what used to be his life He opens Fedex packages that contain a ballerina outfit a greeting card and some other inane souveniers He realizes the insanity of his predicament and almost starts laughing Eventually he constructs shelter and learns to spear fish in his isolation he creates an imaginary friend which is an alter ego promoting his survival These scenes were particularly well written There is no sensationalism no explosions just a real person trying to survive When he is finally rescued his company Fedex throws a party for him he sees the waste and futility of everyday life lobster and King crab claws he lived on for a month are tossed in the trash He also loses his fianc Helen Hunt to a dentist I thought this was an unnecessary back story Overall you will be intrigued by this film it is not your typical suspense adventure film and Hanks is very good 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1432075/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,Great Movie,Cast Away is a spectacular movie in which a manager at FedEx survives a plane crash in the ocean and ends up on a remote deserted island where he is the only one there There are several challenges that the main character faces including the opportunity to desecrate the worth of another human who was washed ashore dead but he buried him and preserved the dignity of human value This movie was very engaging and had the emotions to pull you right in and to make you feel like you were right there with him on that island This movie is really inspiring because he never gave up he kept pushing and pushing and he was able to make it back to civilization Truly a great movie and properly displays how a human would react in those circumstances,10.0,2.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4183266/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2001,The good side of mediocre,In contrast to most people I found the quality even and unremarkable throughout Would someone explain to me for instance what was so great about the plane crash Yes the moment when the cabin de pressurises comes as a real jolt but shock tactics are easy It s like the moment in horror movies when a skeleton hand suddenly shoots up out of a grave It s startling not frightening All in all the crash storm sequence is humdrum and badly shot What was the point of those intermittent blackouts They re irritating besides Zemeckis has it backwards a storm isn t light punctuated by darkness it s darkness punctuated by light If anything the plane crash was a low point That s the movie as a whole decent but lacking marred by poor craft throughout Among the questionable decisions computer generated whales straight out of Fantasia 2000 FedEx they could so easily have used a made up brand name and too much editing on the island The last really destroyed our sense of the passage of time and with it any idea we may have had of how well the Tom Hanks character was faring How long did he go before finding enough water to live on I don t know but I suspect it s longer than Zemeckis tried to lead us to believe with his frequent cuts All the small sequences before the four years later caption itself a cop out good though they may have been individually collectively come across as mere montage rather than a sustained assault on the problem of survival On the other hand what was so bad about the third act Cast Away is at heart a gently optimistic story of survival its message is that mere survival MERE survival isn t really so bad as all that when you get to know it Some people wanted Tom Hanks to feel utterly bleak to fall to pieces when confronted with civilisation again Why would he Living in a city again after four years would be like re adopting a half forgotten habit riding a bicycle for the first time in a decade The truth is there s nothing much to say about what happens when he rejoins the larger world I found the concluding section the most honest part of the film if a little aimless All in all not bad I remember a reviewer writing that the Oscar Zemeckis won for Forrest Gump would destroy him as an artist I remember thinking at the time Well how could it not He s just been rewarded for creating something terrible And it must be noted Who Framed Roger Rabbit was Zemeckis s only masterpiece But it was also an unrepeatable accident The kind of zaniness it exemplifies so easily turns sour in his hands as in Death Becomes Her or the entire Back to the Future trilogy on the other hand if he keeps plugging away in an attempt to create something grand he may one day succeed,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565942/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2009,The final scene...spoiler,spoiler alert I really enjoyed this movie It is amazing to think that Tom Hanks carried such a huge part of the film by himself There wasn t even much music during his time on the island without much dialogue he was amazing Not too many actors could pull it off I think In the last scene after the girl drives off in the pickup with the dog in the back Tom Hanks stands in the middle of the intersection staring then the movie cuts away What is he staring at and what is he thinking What did he decide to do I can t quite figure out what he is thinking Does he get an aha about what direction to take and why Help,9.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2012593/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2011,Perhaps Tom Hanks' greatest film performance,Interesting that it was the early 90s where the critics and Academy started recognizing Tom Hanks as an actor of considerable depth and universality I really think it s A League of Their Own in 92 that got the ball rolling Hanks totally stole and dominated an ironically female laden film Hanks SHOULD have been nominated Best Supporting Actor in a now iconic comic role as Jimmy Dugan Then in 93 and 94 there were back to back Best Actor Oscar wins for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump respectively Hanks was undeniably great in those films but I still felt like the praise came a tad too early I actually wasn t too keen on some of the nominees that Hanks was up against in those two years so while I felt like he deserved his wins based on his competition there were some actors who were overlooked in those two years that I felt gave career performances Kevin Costner in 93 for A Perfect World and Johnny Depp in 94 for Ed Wood that would have been my personal picks for those awards in those respective years I guess the question at that point for me was Did Tom Hanks just fluke his way to TWO Best Actor wins Then Hanks put my fears to rest He continued his roll with Apollo 13 in 95 and it was evident that he wasn t going anywhere The man proved he was great actor Heck he even was a success in his first directorial effort in 96 with That Thing You do Then of course he stars in Spielberg s powerful Saving Private Ryan in 98 another Best Actor nom for which I think he should have won then the beautiful The Green Mile in 99 in retrospect I think that should have been another Best Actor nom And it all culminates in this film Cast Away 2000 Hanks would receive his to date last Best Actor nomination Right now I ll say it this should have been another Oscar for Mr Hanks Hanks plays Fed Ex executive Chuck Noland whose plane goes down somewhere in the South Pacific Noland is washed away on a desert island for 4 years and must learn how to survive off of instinct guts savvy and determination After learning how to make fire a great scene Noland copes day to day by making friends with one of the packages he was delivering a Wilson volleyball which he attaches the same moniker to I m still astounded as to how Hanks pulled this off Tom Hanks and a volleyball is one of the best pairings in Hollywood history Of course Hanks went full method with this performance literally losing a large amount of weight since his character had to live off of sparse island food for 4 years But of course Hanks pulled it off totally involving the viewer and putting us in his place The great actors will do that Many complained about the late scenes of Hanks back in civilization but I have no problem with them They re really not that long I liked the scene with Helen Hunt Chuck s ex fianc e who thought he was dead and had married someone else in his absence It was emotionally involving and I love the music accompanying it with the rain pouring down on them I also love the real ending with Noland deciding to go cross country delivering the Fed Ex items recovered on the island and then meeting angel on earth of a woman that you just KNOW Chuck ended up with Generally I think Robert Zemeckis is an overrated director with Back to the Future being his undisputed masterpiece But Cast Away 2000 is definitely 2nd on my list of Zemeckis films It is involving throughout without ever devolving into being boring or unbelievable Hanks was robbed big time at the Oscars This is perhaps his greatest role and film performance and should have been his 3rd Oscar,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2462833/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2022,Very entertaining Hollywoodish survival film,I ve seen this many times since it was released but not in a long while It s still a very good movie but it was never a great one It s main attribute is the lead performance it s main ingredient as it s a one man show from Tom Hanks and one has to give him some major applause for the physical transformation he went through for this role To put it simply it s an engrossing tale of a man stranded alone on an island for four years Period There s some background love story at the beginning and end of this film involving a sincere Helen Hunt but that s more of a frame than a part of the big picture It s a survival film with a rather exciting and thoroughly convincing early section of how he got to that island There is some nice cinematography but it s not in the league of another stranded on an island film The Black Stallion,8.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8648216/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2005,"Quibbles with ""Cast Away""",I was quite impressed with many aspects of this film but I have to point to a couple of quibbles which helped keep it from being the fully realized work of art it could have been 1 The first 15 minutes of the film contain as many product placements as I can remember seeing in that short of a time This is a MAJOR negative to me as it destroys the suspension of disbelief and immersion in a cinematic world which is so important to the enjoyment of narrative film The profusion of FedEx logos was comical at times as in the Moscow airport scene The film would have been far more effective in my view if Hanks has worked for a fictional delivery firm rather than the real life FedEx My teenage son argues that use of brand names makes the film more realistic I firmly disagree The use of brands and logos is a constant reminder that you are watching a commercial enterprise backed by labyrinthine financial deals I thought this was a major problem with ET as well I would give them a pass on the ball called Wilson that was a pretty good joke but overall far too many product references 2 The filmmakers make the same mistake that Defoe made in Robinson Crusoe the ending is too long and anticlimactic If you ve read Crusoe in its original text you may remember the superfluous episode of a race over the mountains to Lisbon after Crusoe s return In Cast Away judicious editing could have shortened the denouement by at least 10 minutes and still made all of its points The result would have been a better film,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1137627/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2001,Powerful Drama Courtesy Of Hanks And Zemeckis,We live in a world in which the latest technology is taken for granted on a daily basis and the Fast Food Generation is in charge everything has to be done yesterday and there s literally not enough hours in a day to do what must be done In Cast Away directed by Robert Zemeckis a man who has bought into all of the above suddenly finds himself plucked from it seemingly at random and given something new to ponder Life Life in it s most basic and primitive form where all he has for survival are his two hands his wits and whatever nature in all her glory can provide Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland a supervisor for Fed Ex who lives and dies by the clock a world traveler whose time at home and with loved ones is calculated to the minute On Christmas he exchanges gifts with his intended Kelly Frears Helen Hunt in the car before boarding yet another flight that will spirit him away to oversee the job in yet another city another country But this time somewhere over the ocean elemental forces take charge his plane is forced to ditch in the sea and Noland s life in a few seconds is changed forever He survives only to be washed ashore on a small uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere where he must confront Time and himself as never before Though comparisons to Robinson Crusoe may spring to mind immediately tuck them away in some back pocket of your memory because what Zemeckis and Hanks give you here is anything but that You learn enough about Noland and Kelly during the time leading up to the ill fated flight that by the time Noland lands on the island you know who this man is what makes him tick and also about the life and the love he leaves behind and what it will mean to them both And knowing what you do his time on the island becomes more than just a handbook for survival it s an intimate portrait of a man coming to terms with himself and learning the hard way with the core of his existence the clock negated what it is that really matters in life Among the invaluable lessons he learns is that indeed no man is an island for he sorely lacks the one thing nature cannot provide Companionship Hanks gives a tremendously subtle yet powerful performance as Noland if there is any doubt consider the fact that he carries the film for more than an hour by himself without allowing the tension or the drama to lag Zemeckis of course must be given credit for keeping it all on task including what his star is doing and together they make it riveting drama that keeps the viewer enthralled not only by what is happening in the present but by maintaining a sense of anticipation that something is just around the corner about to happen The real strength of the film is in the way it s presented and the way Hanks so successfully connects with the audience to create the empathy that allows the viewer to know what it would feel like to be in his place understanding that sudden regard for all the things that are taken for granted every day The simple creature comforts a book of matches water having someone to share a laugh with And most importantly knowing that alternating sense of hope and despair Noland must live with without respite A message so succinctly driven home and so well done that it leaves you with a real sense of awe The metaphor of a man at the crossroads of his life has been done many times before but never like this with a nod to Zemeckis and Hanks there is a purity to their treatment of the aforementioned theme with this film that is unparalleled The supporting cast includes Nick Searcy Stan Lari White Bettina and Geoffrey Blake Maynard Graham all of whom add so much to the success of this film But the performance that really ties it all together is given by the gifted Helen Hunt who with a limited amount of screen time makes Kelly a heart felt memorable character It s an exceptional performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress Cast Away is an engrossing film that make no mistake is about so much more than how a guy survives on a deserted island it s about enlightenment and taking stock of the things that matter before it s too late A wake up call one could say for a generation mired in technology and governed by Time I rate this one 9 10,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565605/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2002,"Religious Overtones? *******Spoilers""*******",I was surprised by the number of religious themes in Cast Away I should have suspected though it s the story of a hard charging yuppie go getter who because of a plane crash is stranded alone on a tiny Pacific Ocean island There he is forced to live by his wits and keep his sanity while he waits for deliverance Knowing these story elements I was expecting to be bored to tears The only reason for renting it was to see Tom Hank s performance But no I was not bored at all The first quarter of the movie introduces us to Tom his fianc e and job as a FedEx troubleshooter He s a nice guy but something s missing The fateful flight over the Pacific fills us with dread and by the time the plane gets lost we re on the edge of our seats The middle half of the movie covers his castaway years on a tropical island and how he learns to cope both physically and mentally The final quarter of the film chronicles his escape and return to civilization Religious symbols and themes are all over Cast Away from the blatant the angel wings on the only FedEx box Tom never opens to the more subtle the cave iconography and the meaning of the hangman s rope Cast Away is more than just a storytelling movie there s lots to think about also I highly recommend it for a family rental,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566205/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2001,Does Hank's pull this off?,Before i saw this film i had my own pre concieved ideas of what it would be like I knew this film was about a guy who get stuck on a deserted island and i wondered how and if they could make this interesting If anybody could make a film like this work it would be Tom Hanks Lets face it how many bad film has he made Does hanks pull it off I m not too sure if he does The film is good but because of the concept of the film it is hard for it not to be a little boring and it is at times Credit should go to Hank s because he does a De Niro stile Weight Loss to make his stay on the island look realistic but i dont think it is enough Don t get me wrong Cast Away is not a bad film it just not that exciting,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566010/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,Transitions in Cast Away,I watch this film a lot It s one of my favorite films of all time It s a fun film to watch with others and analyze Every scene can be discussed It s also a film that the entire family can enjoy that is NOT animated or full of fluff I watched it with the grand kids and they loved it The story pulls one in to the point so that a person can feel the remoteness of the island and the respect for the friendship Noland forges with Wilson It s not a silly volleyball but a representation of a friend like the friend who washed up on the island beach My view of the film is that it is all about transitions From Moscow to Tennessee to the brink of death to a remote island to the dark Pacific to hopelessness when the paddles are finally to the ocean to the whale who seems to bring a smidgen of hope I can t picture any actor but Tom Hanks in the lead either,10.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3616329/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,"Overblown, bloated, with a completely insulting ending!",SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT This is the kind of moviemaking that makes you sad to be alive Somewhere hidden inside this overblown Hollywood DRAMA is a lovely little film begging to be let go Zemeckis once again proves that he was at one point a minor director with major assets and now he is a major director with rapidly diminishing assets The special effects are wonderful the photography is good but the cast reaches soooo desperately for dramatic intensity it practically makes you cry Helen Hunt has captured the crown of Queen of Unwarranted Pauses in the Cinema Pantheon Either she or her directors believe that simply keeping the camera on her while she purses her lips and widens her eyes is something akin to acting It is not Tom Hanks perhaps the luckiest actor in the history of film don t get me started on his TWO Oscars does a fine job throughout the island portions of the film but falls completely on his face in the God awful last half hour of the film Here comes the spoiler Although anybody who has sat through the preview has seen it by now nice marketing in Hollywood nowadays Once he returns to the mainland and attempts to reconcile with Hunt s character we are reminded how mediocre a film this truly is I continue to be shocked that Zemeckis would actually have Hanks standing in the crossroads of his life This kind of blatantly stupid visual metaphor not only insults the audience s intelligence but is simply laughable I would have been content with Hanks travails on the island clearly the most interesting and believable portions of this film I can t help but wonder if this would have been a much better movie with less known actors and at least half an hour less screentime This film aims squarely at the lowest intellect in the audience and by that standard it wins A sad waste of celluloid,4.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566130/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2002,It's all about survival.,After watching this film several times first at the theater then at home I ve reached the conclusion that it s about survival Not just about Chuck Noland s survival but the survival of the most important person in his life Kelly He lost civilization as he knew it and had to use his resources to survive Kelly although very little is shown from her point of view lost the most important person in her life Both suffered losses and though it was hard they did what they could to survive and get on with their lives I have no doubt that many see this film as being just about Chuck and his survival on a deserted island for four years but if they look at it more deeply they will see much much more Great acting and chemistry by Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt A must see,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565924/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,Superb!!,This movie is emotional and brilliant The music was too good that you feel emphatic once the score comes after the long stretch of isolation The acting and screenplay on isolation even makes the viewers to feel with the character and contemplate on life Fantastic movie to watch alone,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6368574/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2001,Huh? What a waste.,One word sums up this movie Huh They made us sit through hours of watching this pathetic character bumbling around on this island Why So he could deliver a FED EX package And it wasn t even delivered He returned it to the sender This movie is a two hour Fed Ex commercial Not worth the rent The main character was stupid and boring not worth watching There was no resolution at the end not even one of those Leaves you wondering endings Just stupid This movie left me so angry that I will never use FED EX again Oh and I ll never buy a Wilson ball again either,2.0,8.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565992/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,Time and tide wait for no man,The title may be a pun telling us that we must cast away all the junk we call civilization Hanks gives his trademark low key everyman performance in this post modern Robinson Crusoe tale which shows that choices lead to consequences and even when we think we are at a dead end we are only at a crossroads This is an intriguing story with no formula conclusion and it is Hanks that holds the whole saga together,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565471/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2001,"A Great, Big, Fun Adventure!",I watched Cast Away in theaters and the whole theater was full Which gave me the sense that this was a good movie and it was excellent Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt were brillaint in this film I just bought the dvd and it has a lot of cool special features This film is a great sometimes funny and exciting adventure that anyone should enjoy I give it a 10 out of 10,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565925/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,One of the best simple movies,Why simple Because there s barely any dialogue you re just on a silent ride of exploration and survival with the main protagonist And that s actually really immersive as well as simple in a good way Why one of the best Because rewatching it after a few years it s still as engaging and entertaining as the first time I can t say it features amazing acting or my favorite actors but almost everything about this movie is iconic and holds up 22 years later A must watch Plus it s pretty realistic that we have a man who suffers for 4 years hoping to get back to his loving wife only to find out that she buried him and remarried immediately forgetting about him yet he keeps crawling back Typical Tom Hanks movie in that aspect kinda like Forrest Gump But that sad cringe aside good movie,7.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7659040/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2021,Oscar worthy performance by Tom hanks,Before I even get into that film Tom hanks was extraordinary in this He s amazing in literally every film I ve seen He s definitely one of the top top actors of today The film itself was great it slightly annoyed me when he wouldn t open the fedex boxes because that would ve been the first thing I would ve done I like to think I would ve lasted quite a while on that island but he definitely did things that I would ve never thought of If I ever get stranded I ll be stealing some of those ideas The only bad thing about the film is when he got of the island it went so slow it was unreal but other then that I know now why people call this film an all time classic Great film great acting I enjoyed it a lot,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6902150/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2005,Castaway,Castaway stars Tom Hanks who plays Chuck Noland a Fedex executive who is involved in a plane crash and is forced to live on a deserted island Hanks performance in this film is brilliant such an original idea and exceptionally hard to pull off considering he does not converse with anyone for the bulk of the film Very hard one to keep the viewers attention and for them to enjoy it I felt it was just lacking considering it is just Hanks Like it or not you have to admire the skill of a individual man and a film set in one area Pros Hanks Originality Enjoyable and Hard to make successfully Cons Individual and not a cast,5.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1042212/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2001,Tom Hanks is one of the best,The thing I liked the most in that movie was the crash of the FedEx plane at the beginning Still it was a pretty good movie from beginning to end A bit long sometime but that wasn t too bad Tom Hanks delivers another stellar performance It s good for an 8,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565869/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,Tom Hanks saves it!,To Hanks saves this movie from failing This movie was created for a great movie actor and Tom Hanks did a very good job No real suprises in this movie and we got exactly what it promised The movie reminds us that anything can happen in life and our journey can take very unexpected turns anytime It would do us a whole lot of good to keep this in mind so we may be better prepared mentally when such events happen to us We must never expect our life journey to be predictable We can only do our very best to achieve our goals but at the same time be constantly aware how easily events could cause very divergent paths to anywhere The weak points are it s predictability and condescending start Lenin s picture being taken down in Moscow for example but it s weak points were not enough to ruin this movie A near classic Another touchdown for Hanks,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566118/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2009,"Uneven film, good Hanks, generally engrossing",Castaway has a slow start and the film initially tends to drag until a terrifying plane crash which is very well depicted The long mid section with MINOR SPOILERS Tom Hanks all alone on a deserted island is well worth watching Hanks is a good actor and watching him trying to survive is an engrossing experience Unfortunately there are some mawkish scenes involving a basketball named Wilson which should have been more subtle There is some annoying product placement as well The last act is interesting to watch Helen Hunt has a supporting role and is alright Overall 7 10,0.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2025131/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2001,"The longest Fed Ex commercial, ever!",The only reason to see this movie is Helen Hunt and she doesn t get as much screen time as the words Fed Ex Tom Hanks spends years Cast Away and goes thru his entire emotional range a to b and doesn t get scurvy The air crash is very well done thanks CGI and the ending is gripping thanks Helen Hunt but Tom Hanks on a deserted island for two hours I could ve rearranged my sock drawer and had a better time,1.0,20.0,61.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565708/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2002,Excellent movie!,Tom Hanks makes another blockbuster how do he do dat Pretty much anything that Hanks touches is a huge hit Sure he s a great actor but that can t explain his phenomenal success Anyway this is yet another great film starring Tom Hanks He s by far the major player in this film considering that he s alone on an island for much of the film He s cast perfectly and he delivers perfectly The story has been reviewed dozens of times I m certain so I ll not go into that The film is a commentary on the resiliency of man And casting Hanks was a very smart move,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566216/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2021,Modern Robinson Crusoe-minus Friday!,Probably NOT a good idea to watch this whether freeview or other after having a bad day Tom Hanks IS 90 of this film plus a basketball called Wilson For me waste of a couple of hours nothing really exciting here Plane crash one survivor several years alone on an island returns to civilisation loses long term girlfriend to someone else end Not really much in this,4.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7211786/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2001,Dramatic moments beyond my wildest expectations,Most of us I think knew the general outline of the plot before reaching the theatre However the plane crash early in the film was drama beyond my wildest expectations This incident from the initial warnings to the actual plunge into the Pacific was one of my most horrifying cinematic experiences I literally went down with that plane The Robinson Crusoe like scenes which followed were interesting to a point although I thought Chuck Tom Hanks was rather slow in discovering a method of catching water from the torrential rains While it was necessary for the scriptwriter to introduce dialogue I found some of the conversations between Chuck and the face on the ball rather silly and even a bit embarrassing but I came to accept them in the knowledge that Chuck was on the point of madness anyway after years of isolation A great piece of cinema followed when the ocean liner sped past an almost dying man face down on his broken raft I was so anxious Would the officers on the bridge see him or not The final homecoming was so touching so moving and with such unexpected consequences Yes this is the story of a man who through 4 years of loneliness holds a dream close to his heart Fate plays strange tricks and when the outcome is analysed no one is really to blame,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565806/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2005,Little lacking criticism of modern life,Man alone in in a deserted island Robinson Crusoe springs in mind when watching this movie it s just modernized version from it And Friday is replaced with a volleyball In the end whole movie is hanging in the shoulders of one man Tom Hanks And he is good he actually shows very well in this movie why he is considered to be great actor he s as believable as anyone can be as a marooned man He talks to his imaginary friend Wilson the Volleyball he creates fire and utensils to do fishing He loses weight and gains more wisdom in survival But it all is a little bit of boring he is there alone It s just a one man trying to fill the whole film with his isolated survival Of course he gets out from the island and his readjustment to society is quickly recorded but it isn t given much of thought He just visits his ex girlfriend Helen hunt and the he continues his living trying to figure out which way he want s to take with his life As a movie everyone must have known how risky it was It s not filled with action or sexy women It depends on it s critical elements towards todays electronic dependant society less can be more we need a human touch As for now Cast Away is too long Robert Zemeckis has left some unnecessarily long sequences in but over all it is a nice little reminder for us all And it doesn t even have sappy Hollywood ending,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1078379/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2003,This movie should be cast away...,First of all let me say that I generally enjoy Tom Hanks films Well not The Burbs or Joe Versus The Volcano and oh yeah Dragnet and Volunteers but I digress However as to this flick let me just quote the Tom Hanks character from Big I don t get it ATTENTION SPOILER COMING UP OK so Chuck Noland s stranded on the island for several years He builds the raft and finally escapes By sheer luck he s picked up by a cargo ship In the next scene fiancee Kelly gets a call informing her Chuck s still alive and she faints Flash to the next scene Four Weeks Later Chuck s sitting on the FedEx plane headed back to Memphis Yet as far as we know he hasn t already spoken to Kelly He also hasn t spoken to his pal Stan For all we know Chuck hasn t spoken to anybody since he was rescued Don t they have ship to shore telephones on cargo ships Or was Chuck confined to a hyperbaric chamber for four weeks This movie made absolutely no sense SPOLILER COMPLETED If you want to rent a good Tom Hanks film I d choose Mr Mom Wait that was Michael Keaton,0.0,5.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566233/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2014,Much better than I originally thought.,I never really enjoyed this movie when it first came out but after watching it again over 10 years later I have found a new appreciation for it I think initially I was too young to appreciate a film that consists of one man and a desert island for an entire 2 hrs After I overcame this initial view I discovered that Cast Away is actually a really good movie Tom Hanks truly is one of the best actors out there He has the ability to catch your attention and keep you entertained with limited assistance There still are the major cringe factors in the movie and also the scenes of heartbreak And I never will love the ending but it really is a great movie that was very well done,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2961507/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,Robinso Crusoe with Tom Hanks,An excellent film with an excellent Tom Hanks Most of the film is played by him alone so it is all the more amazing how he plays the role with a lot of energy and conviction The story is told so emotionally that you almost cry in the end Even after 20 years this film has lost none of its charm Director Robert Zemeckis had already been able to rely on his actor Tom Hanks for his film Forrest Gump As in this film a perfect double,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6377307/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2001,Lack of the Survival aspect.,While Cast Away is an entertaining film the love story portion between the Tom Hanks character and Helen Hunts character seemed getting down to brass tacks to do very little for the over all story The ending which was also pointless went on way too long and likewise served no purpose The film shows that Hanks Chuck Noland survives for four years on the island but offers only glimpses as to how he does it Instead of a tale of survival the viewer is given the old standard two people in love separated by an act of fate with one eventually giving up and finding someone else then the other returns looking for their old flame This picture does not rank up there as a great movie about survival but it seems it could have had that been the emphasis,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565923/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2001,Mediocre story propped up by outstanding Hanks performance,The last time Tom Hanks teamed up with director Robert Zemeckis the result was Forrest Gump I can safely say this is no Forrest Gump FG was a terrific story further enhanced by outstanding acting This is a decent story propped up by phenomenal acting The initial premise was intriguing A Fedex employee is stranded on a deserted island and is forced to use his ingenuity to survive At first it is fascinating watching Chuck Tom Hanks adapt to his stark environment However after about an hour of screen time devoted solely to his island exploits the film begged for a cut to somewhere else There were numerous themes that were running simultaneous to his island struggles There was the search and rescue and Kelly s Helen Hunt coming to terms with his loss to mention the two most obvious themes that were completely neglected Instead Zemeckis decided that we should have all Tom all the time which despite his gargantuan talent and over the top performance became just a bit more Tom than I could stand Zemeckis did a superb job with the photography and induced one of Hanks best performances Unfortunately the film became one dimensional and began to bog down The ending brought no relief from the drudgery leaving viewers adrift without the emotional release necessary to bring the story to closure Tom Hanks was in top form He deservedly was nominated for yet another best actor award by the Academy his fifth It seems everywhere I turn lately I see Helen Hunt She made four films in 2000 and I have seen them all in the last two months This was one of her better performances of the year though the part was small The film grossed over 200 million which shows that for most people just being able to see Tom Hanks is enough I rated it 7 10 The one dimensional story and flat ending stifled my enthusiasm despite a tour de force performance by Hanks,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565981/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2016,Good but left hungry at the end,This is one of those films that seems to set up everything in the story for a massive emotional landing with a lead actor like Tom Hanks the same director as Forest Gump s and this incredible journey the protagonist goes through one could feel that something great is in the brewing process But not really Not at all in fact The very beginning is pretty boring up until the crash scene which is amazing and much more intense if not brutal than one would expect of such a mainstream production while not being overdone either Just a great cinematic moment on all accounts Then it was very ambitious to make a film with such a main idea The film goes on 2hrs25min and the bulk of it does take place on that island And yet it never gets boring and as an audience we re spontaneously mandated to participate in the adventure as being people ourselves we immediately relate to the great difficulty of surviving both physically and mentally in such dire conditions The film does a good job staying fresh from scene to scene and not bordering on the purely depressing realm this easily could ve dwelt in The problem is a highly forgettable final act it s made clear at the end that there isn t any of that earlier high promise that will be fulfilled and a very ordinary and flat out weak if not also ambiguous and unclear in itself conclusion to a story that seemed to possess immense potential on an emotional and human level Some elements that seemed important get a very plain and often disappointing resolution in the ending narrative and one really would ve wished for a much stronger depiction of the protagonist s relationship with his dearest love of his life something of a deeper kind with parallels back and forth between his current hindering life and the one he longs to get back,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3549848/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2002,Jon Monsarrat review: Fascinating & accessible drama; not too arty,I came into Cast Away with a couple of strikes against me Although I have a lot of respect for Tom Hanks I hated the melodrama and sappiness in Forrest Gump And I m not usually into dramas because they re too deep for me But since I m an action movie guy I figured there would be some action in the film There sort of is But the film is primarily a drama thriller with plenty of suspense about our hero s survival chances Tom Hanks makes the movie I can t say it plainer than that The acting is so gripping so compelling and keep in mind on a desert island he s mainly playing off inanimate objects that even though I m not an arty type I just had to watch fascinated similar to how in a good action flick I m fascinated at how the stunt people put together the stunts The only negative comment I might make is that the end of the film was slow paced and not entirely satisfying to me Who should see this film Everyone even if you hate dramas I ll give Cast Away a near miss perfect 9 out of 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566128/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2004,Great movie with an entriguing story full of courage and hope,I was really impressed in what this film was going to come out to be I was suprised how good it was I thought it was just going to be one of those other Robinson Crusoe movies but this was different and I loved how the story was Some of it was slow and boring at one scene but that s just some of it Most of it was really entertaing and I loved the landscaping of the film with the deserted island and the ocean It also had humor too like when Tom Hanks was talking to the volleyball Wilson I also liked how Tom Hanks ate his fish for survival and making his little boat This was an interesting film and I would like everyone to see this movie 9 10,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566282/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2016,Very good film,For a big Hollywood film this is good As ambitious Fed Ex worker Chuck Noland whose plane crashes into the Pacific and who washes up alone on a deserted island Tom Hanks is great The cinematography by Don Burgess is lovely Director Robert Zemeckis keeps a tight pace and engages the viewer constantly despite just one character little dialogue and one location The plane crash is shot brilliantly just as you d imagine it would be like One minute you re doing something trivial the next the plane is diving towards the ocean You feel like you re inside the plane and you can see Chuck thinking this it it The film has a lot to say about how consumerist and shallow we are and how utterly work obsessed and ignorant of what really matters Chuck is before the accident On the island he proves to be both incredibly vulnerable and incredibly resilient as he learns to feed himself find shelter and even create an imaginary friend Wilson the volleyball It s to the credit of Hanks and Zemeckis that the volleyball Wilson yes an inanimate object almost seems human at times On second viewing I understood the ending I love the final scene But most of the coming back scenes go on for way too long Hanks and Helen Hunt don t have much chemistry Maybe the situation of Chuck s resurrection after being dead is just too hard to act out I like how Zemeckis is very serious about what a tragedy what a loss his four years without human interaction have been And he depicts well just how harsh unforgiving and godless Chuck s life as a castaway is The choice Chuck makes to leave the island is rightly seen as a momentous one If he stayed he could have continued to eke out a living but it was a pretty paltry existence with a poor chance of ever being rescued By building a raft and paddling out into the ocean he risks death but also gains a greater chance for salvation The most effective feeling the film evoked in me is what would I do in the same situation So it s a film with both empathy and sympathy for the enormous bad luck that befalls Chuck,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3496991/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2004,What happened after his rescue?,Overall Cast Away was a really good movie But there s a big hole right in the middle of it Hanks is finally rescued and in the next scene he s all cleaned up and on a corporate jet heading home What happened between the rescue and the flight home Give us 10 or 15 minutes showing Hanks readjusting back to civilization catching up on the headlines marvelling at new technology seeing his family for the first time sitting down with a therapist something,0.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566263/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2007,"A lesson for all of us, who do not enjoy life today as it happens",A movie of depth at many human levels Cast Away was a unique film among the many of the great films of the 20th Century And what a great film and story to start the 21st Century this new Century that is certain to hold rapid change for the human endurance as was the last The main character Chuck Noland lives in the fast lane his life but a blur representing a person who is but a cast away from family and life a runner in a global world of change and commerce with little time to ponder the important things in life putting all the important things aside But as fate would have it Chuck Noland is cast away into another world one of loneliness and stripped to the bare essentials of life in a quest for survival on a remote island he is now a cast away from the civilization Apart from the life he took for granted and his love he is stripped to the bare essentials with only the slim hope that he might one day see his fianc again and not take everything for granted as he did before With little chance of rescue he carries the human quality of hope Hope for rescue and hope to see his fianc and family once again and this hope is granted through a sail which starts him back towards a return to civilization But his human struggle was not over Upon Chuck Noland s return he must again cast himself away from the love he once knew and cast away a love he once knew that carried him through all those years of loneliness Once again in the middle of all of modern civilization Chuck Noland is again a cast away from the life he knew and is alone again But as fate would have it he would find himself again with hope as he struggles to return to the meaning of life and like the winds that helped rescue him from that desolate island he again finds hope in the emblem an image of angels wings that had sustained his existence for a very long time And in this moment among the empty expanse of land not ocean he once again casts away his past and must begin a new life where time is not a master having learned to enjoy life as it comes It is this meaning that all humans must learn or suffer being a cast away in the sea of humanity in a world of sea of change A story perhaps but maybe there is something more meaningful for all of us and a lesson we could all learn easily,9.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1785600/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2002,About as entertaining as watching paint dry,CONTAINS SPOILERS This could ve been a good idea for a film but it suffers from an abundance of total silence For quite a portion of the film we hear nothing except the waves softly crashing upon the shore as we follow the adventures of Chuck Noland Tom Hanks a FedEx employee who survives a plane crash and washes ashore on a small island in the South Pacific where he stays for several years before finally being found However the viewer may have a hard time staying awake by this time It would be nice if something anything crucial would happen during that time on the island as Hanks portrayal is practically completely reduced to pure pantomime and grunts It won t ever reach the heights of such strong Hanks vehicles as Forrest Gump,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566206/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,"Long, depressing, dreadful commercial.",This thing is way too depressing for a holiday movie and the most shameless product positioning movie I ve ever seen It was more a two hour commercial for the carrier and incidentally for the ball manufacturer how many times did he shout Wilson at the waves than an entertaining movie And the ending a crossroads experience An eyebrow raising leer for heaven s sakes Gaack I must give credit to the makeup artists and Hanks for the ageing and weathering process well done indeed Hunt s cameo appearance it really can t be called much more than that surely was wooden at best absolutely no rapport with Hanks and his performance was only mediocre A movie suited best for late night TV they wouldn t even have to interrupt it for commercials since that s about all there is to watch,2.0,3.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566119/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,Better Than Expected,For a film that spends a fair amount of its runtime with a single character trapped on an island with nobody but a volleyball to talk to this movie was surprisingly entertaining It takes someone with the acting capabilities of Tom Hanks to be able to portray something like that and do a good job of it This movie surprisingly has a lot of story besides the stranded scene stuff It s wildly entertaining from start to finish but it also manages to have a lot of heart Overall it s a very well done film,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5553558/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2001,Hanks delivers,A compelling central performance from Tom Hanks carries this familiar material about a man stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash Half the film is all Hanks alone talking to a volleyball and yet it never gets boring That certainly is a testament to his performance The harrowing plane crash sequence may keep you out of the airwaves for a while though GRADE A,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565491/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2000,Strong adventure saga,Cast Away reteams the star and director of Forrest Gump Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis and the final result a terrific adventure film that s just a few notches down from Gump Hanks plays a FedEx employee who hitches a ride on a FedEx plane that s flying over the Pacific Ocean until disaster strikes Flying through a severe storm the plane suffers major damage and crashes in the ocean The Hanks character survives the crash and washes up on a deserted island It is here where he does everything he can to stay alive and it s not an easy task Cast Away was shot in two parts When they finished filming the first part they stopped making the movie for a while so Hanks could lose 40 50 pounds to make it look like his character had been stranded on the island for years This will guarantee Hanks his fifth career Oscar nomination for sure He s brilliant in Cast Away It took alot of guts to lose all that weight The other familiar face in the cast is Helen Hunt who has a nice small supporting role as Hanks girlfriend In between the two parts of making Cast Away director Zemeckis went off and made this summer s hit film What Lies Beneath Cast Away is much better than that film It brings Zemeckis back to full form in addition to Forrest Gump some of Zemeckis other great films include a trio from the 80s Who Framed Roger Rabbit Back to the Future and my personal favorite Romancing the Stone Cast Away has just a few boring spots but it moves at a brisk pace It s an exciting adventure Plus there are a few funny spots the scenes where Hanks talks to the volleyball made me laugh a couple of times A very good movie 1 2 out of four,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565746/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2023,The CAST collaboration of Tom Hanks and Wilson Really Blows Viewers AWAY,This is a fantastic film The storyline might have been simple and straightforward but it took the film to new heights It was really well executed and the cast was phenomenal This is a real story of strength and survival Tom Hanks was the right choice for the lead for this film He truly has the very knowledge to bring his character roles to life To have his character communicate and build a relationship with an unanimated object is a great addition to the storyline With this added into the film viewers receive the insight and perspective of the characters I enjoyed this film It was original and it had the real aspects and clear message of what the storyline was about,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9179569/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2000,nearly hits the mark,For a film that features basically one actor for an hour and a half this delivers pretty well Hanks is some sort of air courier whose plane crashes in the middle of the ocean He manages to find an island and do the old live off the land thing for awhile One of two things I didn t go for was the length of time he supposedly spends marooned Others have spoiled it but I will leave it to you in finding out it just seemed too unreal I feel he would ve lost his mind after just a few months if he didn t die from the elements first Hanks really manages to hold the film together pretty well as they interject a good amount of comic moments The filming style is a bit odd as Bob Z uses a sort of documentary style using no music and shooting Hanks work activities mostly in close up It s all well photographed especially a very dramatic plane crash But that other thing I didn t like about the film makes a real difference the totally dissatisfying ending After about 90 minutes on the island the screenplay only dedicates about 15 minutes to Hanks homecoming yes that could be considered spoiling but you probably saw it in the previews anyway Not enough of his return to society was explored and things close out with a dull stare into the camera that doesn t resolve anything Also look out for shameless plugs for Federal Express and Wilson volleyballs which Hanks actually befriends That could ve done with a little trimming as well his wacked out love for the ball I know he s lonely and needed a companion but they should ve said enough already with the tears after he loses his buddy But I would suggest you go for the survival element which totally shocked me with its pace I usually check my watch a few times during a film but was amazed to see it was the 2 hour mark when I first did it with this movie Zemeckis directed the most excellently paced movie ever in my opinion Back to the Future and he doesn t fail here keeping things going with engrossing vignettes of what Hanks goes thru The meager other cast members are good like barely seen Hunt who found herself in big holiday movies two weeks in a row But look out for that ending which sinks Cast Away from being great couldn t resist,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565603/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2001,Not disappointing,I hope everybody understands that the strong point of such films is not the plot but the scenery the audiovisual effects and less the acting Given this Cast Away is a decent production which rewards the audience asking for suspense and agony As Gladiator it is meant to be seen at DTS THX theaters Unfortunately after the predictable rescue you will feel an inevitable urge to sleep,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565848/?ref_=tt_urv

Full of Jungian archetypal images and symbols,I saw the movie Cast Away and enjoyed it not only for the fine acting by Tom Hanks who doesn t need my praise but for the thorough integration of Jungian psychological symbols throughout the movie The image of the island is an age old symbol of alienation where the ego is cast away note that the name of the movie separates the two words usually conjoined when referring to a person but separated when referring to a physical state or in this case a psychological state and meant to engage in a task of self discovery Hanks does so throughout the rest of the movie We see the character played by Hanks at the beginning of the movie a slave to the clock an executive of a company a cog in a system Who cares if it is Fed Ex as some of the other commentators have mentioned So what Would they feel better about the movie if the air courier service was named No Name Airlines After the plane crashes he makes his way to the island where shortly afterwards he undertakes a symbolic burial of his old self or ego when he finds and buries the crew member of the airplane Then he descends into the island cave an image of his unconscious where he encounters himself Four years on the island To any Jungian this is a quaternity symbol Other Jungian images are apparent the faint light he sees in the distance to which he tries to swim after on the island a short time his goal that he is not ready to assume the waves his unconscious push him back Wilson the basketball a symbol of his self with whom he converses by why of psychological projection The primitive paintings on the wall of the cave in which Hanks sleeps reminiscent of the ancient wall paintings in France and Spain all archetypal images of the collective unconscious The whale which looks at Hanks after his release from the island a symbol of the dynamic unconscious with which he has reconciled or rather integrated Finally the eagle wing symbol on the Fed Ex package the symbol of the archetypal Self in Jung s psychology the very place he seeks at the end of the movie and which he finally realizes at the very end while standing at the cross roads He has arrived at himself and integrated his life no matter what direction he goes in it doesn t matter There are many other Jungian symbols in this very good movie Some are very explicit while others are subtle Think I m over psychologizing this movie Ask Semekis the director I bet he has either undergone Jungian analysis or read an awful lot of Carl Jung himself Those are my thoughts,0.0,9.0,18.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566049/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2006,Touching island survival tale with a disappointing ending,This is a rather unusual take on the Robinson Crusoe deserted island survival tale I agree with another reviewer who noted that it s the only movie where you get all emotionally attached to a volleyball In fact I was so attached that I cried over that foolish volleyball Yes I cried For me this film is all about Wilson The movie chronicles the survival tale of a workaholic Fedex systems engineer Chuck Noland whose plane to Malaysia crashes during a storm stranding him alone on a tropical island with little prospect of rescue He stays alive for four years by catching fish copes with dental problems in a primitive manner and keeps his spirits up by looking at a picture of his fianc Kelly who s back home with no news of him Finally he builds a raft and sails off hoping for a return to civilization During his isolation on the island the loneliness of having no human contact forces him to come up with some sort of companion he can communicate with This turns out to be a Wilson brand volleyball that he names yes Wilson Wilson is really the co star of the movie and the recipient of Chuck s conversation This dramatically illustrates one of the movie s main themes just how unconsciously dependent we all are on companionship even those of us who are not particularly outgoing None of us realizes the devastating psychological effects of extended and complete isolation The film shows Chuck s various struggles on the island for food water and shelter In fact the island segment is the most interesting part as far as I m concerned the earlier portion showing his relationship with Kelly Helen Hunt not particularly gripping The earlier scenes serve mainly to outline his workaholic lifestyle ever dependent on the clock I didn t object to the jump from his ship rescue to four weeks later when he s reintegrated into society However I was disappointed with the movie s ending I didn t mind that his fianc Kelly has moved on with her life married and has a child all as you might predict given the circumstances of his presumed death However I found the whole crossroads scene at the conclusion ambiguous and unsatisfying and felt I wanted a bit more information as to Chuck s fate even if it didn t involve a love interest Other than that a gripping survival story and touching tale But I ll warn you if you get too attached to Wilson you d better have your Kleenex ready,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1325132/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2001,Not bad at all,Spoilers With very mixed reviews Cast Away is a good and entertaining film but it is not very thorough and it is somewhat flawed in the timeline department I was actually very satisfied with the film I had expected nothing more and nothing less so for once my expectations were met almost exactly So what s wrong with this film In hindsight I can easily spot the flaws but sitting in the theater I didn t mind them much First and foremost that which most negative reviews and comments focus on is the 4 year leap We get to see Noland surviving adapting and realizing that he will not be found Suddenly the action jumps 4 years ahead to the point where Noland finally gets a chance to leave It wasn t very frustrating to me Zemeckis and his crew obviously wanted to focus on the difference between Noland the survivor and Noland the Robinson I find the stark contrast rather refreshing because seriously what should they have filled the intervening time with More injuries More reinventing the primitive tools of the caveman I don t think so It would have lengthened a film that in the end is not about the life of a Robinson but about adaptability strength and resolve And to that end the abrupt jump in time is not only acceptable but necessary What I do think is a great flaw and the only one that actually bothered me while watching was the carefree way with which the movie deals with his homecoming Sadly overlooked the reactions of people around him and the massive amount of attention that he undoubtedly would receive would have been valuable to the movie in terms of entertainment and clarification just how did the world go on without him Then again the focus is not the world but Noland It s his sentiments his life that has altered so profoundly and the gap in time between his rescue and meeting with his former girlfriend is also a gap that is functional how mindblowing mustn t it be to be rescued after 4 years alone on a tiny island with just a volleyball to talk to How blank would his mind get after finally being brought back to civilization The 4 weeks after his rescue would be filled with a weak sleepy Noland without much to say or do What Zemeckis could have added without much effort is a sort of media commentary on Noland s story The 4 week gap feels too much like a loss Zemeckis has an eye for human emotions and facial expressions that say more than words and music would We get to see Hanks perform stunningly as usual regardless if he is a crowd pleaser or not and his time on the island is void of music and almost void of words The film is superbly shot some sequences almost taking the breath away Some details weight heavily on the viewer the removal of a bad tooth by way of an ice skating shoe that had the entire audience cringing in their seats and the realistic and frightening scene where he tries to escape with the rubber raft and injures himself All in all I think the negative reviews on this film are unfair and inconsiderate I would like to know what should have been done instead I just have a hard time seeing this film made different without losing focus Noland and his life before during and after his stay as a Robinson,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565656/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2002,What's in the FedEx package he DIDN'T open ?,9 10 A Must see Very nice movie Maybe not original as a story guy on a deserted island trying to get home I hope Hanks knew when reading the script that there wasn t a girl not even a granny unless you consider Wilson a girl but Tom Hanks plays it very realistic and as a movie i have not seen anything like it The movie has only one shortcoming in the end he returns one unopened FedEx package but what the hell was in it,9.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566192/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,7 is a big rate too if I'm thinking more,It s for Hanks anyway He was good as always but the story could ve been better In my point of view if in the island scenes it had soundtrack or any kind of music it would be much better but not the same track that played by the time he came back til the end of the movie many more and diverse the scene from her house they made some noises who sleeps that deep We re talking about a husband and a child who is a handful not a deaf kid the raining pouring while they re kissing no thank you It would have been better if both could be mature and let go and on the last scene he could have followed the lady I don t think I m the only one who thought about it he deserved it I saw the trivia and he deserved the nomination for the Oscar too better than the Philadelphia one which he won But the other things for me nope,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7027655/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2019,Boring Movie,A Boring movie created I imagine because Hanks and other people Needed a Paycheck at the time A man s plane crashes into the Pacific He washes up on an island and is marooned there He paints a soccer ball he found in a Spaulding box with a Face so he will have something to talk to But I think this part is ridiculous and wouldn t have been done in real life a person would more likely have found some way to play ball with the ball like Steve McQueen in the cooler with the baseball in the great escape Joe Versus the Volcano is a much better film This one is a waste of time,1.0,4.0,19.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5367599/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2023,Definitely worth a couple viewings.,I ll be honest the first time I saw this film I wasn t too sure if I liked it I mean I certainly enjoyed it but I just wasn t too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around And just got better with each additional viewing I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first But all in all I ve watched the film enough times now that I can say I love this film When I really stop and think about it the film is brilliantly executed The scenery is absolutely breath taking the special effects are so well done that you don t even realize that there are special effects present This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis case and point Forrest Gump The acting is very good although there s only 2 real sources of acting in this film Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt The rest of the cast was good but their roles were very minor Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance as usual You really can feel all of his emotions while he s stuck on the island Also not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film I truly applaud him for his work As much as I liked Russell Crow in Gladiator I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more although that would be his third Oscar Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance There is also a good deal of comedy in the film and it is done very well This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch There aren t a great many films that I would say this but this one I would Although if you aren t a fan of Tom Hanks then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island So if that is the case then you are off the hook So I hope you watch the film and I hope that you enjoy it,10.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8903253/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2014,Review,Cast Away is survivalist film starring Oscar award winner Tom Hanks that takes place on an island in the South Pacific after a disastrous plane crash The main character Chuck Noland who is played by Hanks works for the FedEx company shipping packages around the world During a storm Noland s plane goes down and he is stuck on an island fighting for survival Far away from home and any form of society he starts to break down emotionally and physically The plot of this film is the strongest story I ve ever seen captured on film This is probably the only film that can make me feel distraught over a man losing a volleyball Chuck is battling loneliness and depression while he is trying to survive Hanks performance makes the story come alive and really immerse you The reality of the plane crash and the island was incredible To further the realness of the film they include Chuck s desperation to get home as he paddles in his deflated raft trying to get over the waves The director and actor really worked together to show the emotion and desperation of this man Chuck Noland I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies The cinematography is lacking a little bit as it uses elementary camera shots and angles However the literary element makes up for what the cinematics lack,9.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3100239/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2001,"If it weren't for Hanks, this film would have drowned.",Tom Hanks gives a VERY good performance in this film and I was never bored The cinematography of the island and the shots at end which are symoblic to the story are great and Hanks acting talent is unreal I don t know how he does it here s a guy who was basicaly a stand up comedian and a television actor until Big hit the screen and then he ended up in great roles in films like Phillidelphia and Forest Gump He is the key in this film if they got some other actor that didn t work this film would have been terrible This being said the film has constant What would you do scenarios throughout the entire movie and I am not always crazy about that The biggest flaw I think with this film is that the trailer GIVES away the fact that Hanks gets off the island in short the trailer TELLS you the entire movie This is stupid and the director said he did this deliberatly Second Hanks return to the real world I think is VERY unrealistic and RUSHED through and perhaps even somewhat unnecessary Basicaly he ends up back and there is literally a short scene where he is having a welcoming party with his office colleagues They all come up to him and say things like Well we see you back at the office tomorrow regarding meeting Hey how about we shoot a round of golf I am teeing off tommorow at 8 no no no How about Let s spend 1 year in psychotherapy to figure out how to live again after not interacting with humans for 4 years This would be more the norm and more realistic POSSIBLE SPOILER DON T READ IF YOU WANT TO SEE FILM And thirdly the meeting with the other husband was done VERY badly meaning it wasn t acted out or handled well That s my take END SPOILER This being said it is NOT a perfect film it is NOT deserving of Best Picture it is NOT deserving of Hanks WINNING Best Actor but it does deserve a nomination but I don t think he should win not because his performance is bad but because I think that other actors in films I have seen this year did better Hanks did a fantastic job This movie I think is more of a spiritual psychological awakening movie than a tearjerking sappy love story film Even with all this I did enjoy the film and was never bored through it s 2 1 2 hour run time Rating 7 out of 10,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565657/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2002,weak,For a start you ve got a premiss for a movie that pretty much gives the whole story away before you ve even sat down to watch you know this guy is going to get trapped on a desert island and you know he ll escape this being Hollywood So where s the surprise Where s the hook Secondly you realize this is a weak idea for a movie pretty soon after Tom Hanks washes up onto the island See the beauty of a novel like Robinson Crusoe is that it has the ability to express one man s loneliness on an island through the power of provoking images in your mind as you read Of course film can t do that at least not mainstream Hollywood film so it s left to the director to patronize the audience because he believes we couldn t possibly cope with watching one man never talking so he makes him talk to a soccer ball Unbelievably the director convinces us this is rational by displaying this as some kind of coping with loneliness and the onset of madness Another sign of its weakness is the incredibly bad fact that about three quarters of the way through there s a fade out and the hugely weak concept of a FOUR YEARS LATER caption appears on screen and suddenly we re transported to a long curly haired bearded Hanks who somehow has survived all this time with no account of how Worst of all this movie is disgusting in terms of the intense amount of product placement for FedEx where their logo is shown in pretty much every shot Is it a movie or merely a commercial It doesn t even attempt to do this in a tongue in cheek way Also the moment where Tom Hanks struts around banging his chest and shouting I have made fire is possibly one of the most unintentionally horribly comic things I ve ever seen Cast Away does score a few points in the fact that it s well shot the plane crash is great and it kept me watching but it s a little too long and frankly a pretty weak idea with a horrendous amount of product placement,4.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566077/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2000,Once again Hanks demonstrates his dynamic range.,Cast Away Life inexorably flows by whether it s slowing down while we re at work or speeding up when we re at play days blend into weeks and into years Not surprisingly few people especially those who would benefit from it most ever take the time to engage in serious introspection If however the opportunity did present itself what do you think you might learn Or would you even dare to try Chuck Noland is obsessed by time it s his job is to ensure that those packages that absolutely positively have to get there overnight do and he s willing to do what is necessary to get it done even borrowing a child s bike if necessary He loves his girlfriend but their relationship is subject to the whims of his daytimer Ripped away from yet another Christmas dinner for a quick job he gives his girlfriend a hurried kiss tells her that he has something important to discuss with her and promises her he ll be right back Of course time is relative By now everyone probably knows that this film is different in several ways First the concept and movie came before the witless Survivor phenom and many people were concerned that the show might taint the movie Second many people were hoping for a repeat after Zemeckis and Hanks struck box office gold with Forrest Gump Third after filming the beginning of the movie the production went on hiatus for a year while Tom Hanks shed almost fifty pounds going from portly to waif Zemeckis filled his time by filming What Lies Beneath Fourth although there are peripheral characters the bulk of the film focuses on Chuck s time alone on the island and consequently dialogue is sparse There is also an absence of special effects with the notable of exception of the superbly staged plane crash and the soundtrack stops soon after Chuck crawls ashore Finally the initial ending was scrapped after it garnered lukewarm responses from test audiences I never dreamed that the cross dressing star of a cheesy sitcom would one day be one of Hollywood s biggest draws I m sure he didn t either It is difficult for an actor to give a good performance at the best of times but when you are playing off a volleyball water and occasionally adverse weather conditions the situation is far more challenging Hanks proves that he is up to the task Even starker than Hank s amazing physical metamorphosis is his spiritual and mental transformation As his carefully ordered life disintegrates whose wouldn t after being jetwrecked Chuck begins to understand that what is truly important in life water food and shelter not withstanding is living not just surviving As he struggles with desperation triumph and insanity he accepts that he cannot dictate what happens only his response Could this have been the subtle reason for titling the film Cast Away vb to dispose of something rather than Castaway adj a shipwrecked individual As I don t think I will be talking with speak with Mr Zemeckis in the near future it will remain unanswered The location shots are both beautiful and treacherous paradise with a hitch and reminded me of some of the islands I visited while in Fiji thankfully they had places to stay and food I didn t have to hunt down The cinematography is tight and Zemeckis deserves congratulations for his simple understated yet simultaneously daring direction if only he d shown such restraint in What Lies Beneath My only complaints would have to be that the beginning and ending feel too artificial when viewed in the context of the rest of the film but not overwhelmingly so One of the most powerful films of the holiday season,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565791/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2002,Better than expected,MINOR SPOILERS I saw this movie literally because I had nothing else to do I wasn t expecting much I mean come on a guy lost on a deserted island I think that s been done a time or two and since I read Robinson Corusoe and The Swiss Family Robinson and have watched every episode of Gilligan s Island I didn t think this would be much more than a few wasted hours It just goes to show how low expectations can affect your viewing and it also demonstrates how the lost on an island fantasy still appeals to us hey why do you think they have all those deserted island Top Tens and such Of course this had some added attractions such as the thrilling plane crash and the extended ego that is Wilson I also liked the fact that they continue his story after being rescued in some depth His welcome back into civilization and ultimate meeting with his lost love were well portrayed I guess the bottom line here is that if you can relate to the guy and put yourself in his shoes you will probably enjoy this one If you don t you probably won t Because so many have asked I will give my take on the unopened box He leaves it sealed simply because it provides the only sense of mystery he has left in his dull existence The reason he says it saved his life is that because the pondering of what was in it gave him reason to live And as far as the ending I think he s at the crossroads and thinking about the lady s advice It s up to you to decide which direction he takes Personally I hope he goes after the woman in the pickup,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566100/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2006,Cavernous apology of transcendental consumerism,Replete with blatant contradictions Cast Away serves as a highly interesting case study of Hollywood s dominating mood and the psychological repressions of mainstream American and by extension so called western society Its main tag line being that you need to free yourself from the material world in order to achieve true personal freedom it paradoxically links all emotions to objects from the material world volleyball soda drink ice cubes skating shoes football franchises car etc hence the shameless product placement that has rightly spurred harsh criticism though cause and effect are certainly hard to disentangle The plot itself illustrates this inherent struggle between materialism and spiritualism the part dedicated to the protagonist s inner developments devoid of musical score and with little dialogue monologue in fact is squeezed in between two very talkative and to say the least corny accounts along the lines of before after However what Zemeckis and Hanks attempt to achieve in the long run is no less than the reconciliation of both worlds At the end of the inward journey stands the morale that consumerism and personal emotional fulfillment are only seemingly opposites They can be pacified provided the individual precisely by identifying with the objects he produces by humanizing them as it were Wilson gains detachment from the the material world and more prosaically transcends the ugly things in life And what better way to hit that home than to use real existing brands that every movie goer in the western hemisphere can relate to In a way the question as to whether or not the makers of the film should have preferred imaginary brands has no incidence In this perspective Zemeckis s tale is the diametrical opposite of Robinson Crusoe who chose to live as a free individual distrustful of what he perceived as civilisation whereas Chuck Noland s sole aspiration is to return amidst his peers after an incidental cathartic incursion into the cavernous shell of his inner life In other words where Defoe outlines utopia Zemeckis casts dystopia As such the metaphor spun here constitutes a deliberate attempt to rid the sphere of culture of its persistent though mostly latent or repressed bad conscience when it comes to financial issues getting in the way of artistic license Similarly it exempts audiences at large from having to resolve the negative equation of art vs commerce of spirit vs money etc thus consolidating the conservative liberal economical stance so well embodied by Tom Hanks and FedEx alike Quite openly it says that you shouldn t feel guilty for liking products as they are part of your emotional fabric a semantic twist more commonly known as branding The other dominating theme in Noland s emancipation is masculinity The character s deep psychological turmoil is chastely symbolised by the island with its moist cavern and erect mountain The underlying assertion is that Noland needs to crawl out of his allegedly safe hole and climb the phallic hill to restore his deficient masculinity the very premise to reintegrate a self assertive modern society Ultimately his restored maleness allows him to let go of his former love who returns to her new family and thus reinstates Christian moral order embodied by the institution of marriage In line with this bigot mentality sexuality is alway only addressed in germ free metaphors Have you noticed that the lush atoll is practically devoid of animals other than meaty crabs and the occasional fish Where are the birds snakes worms spiders and the armies of undefined crawling species that you re entitled to expect in the wild Artistically speaking the film has a handful of redeeming qualities one being obviously its sheer length the freedom it takes to deploy its story thin by modern action standards while nonetheless omitting or merely evoking certain episodes or riddles a choice which runs counter to current cinema viewing habits Incidentally that is precisely why so many people on this site have complained about the missing suicide attempt the undisclosed content of the parcel and the open end it would seem that today s movie goers can no longer bear that something is not explained to them didactically explicitly But all things considered the contrite redemption theme used to validate a consumerist society and its ethic corollary fundamental religious values makes Cast Away a disturbing illustration of a dominant white male ideology As such it is clearly propagandist in all senses of the word,5.0,2.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1260201/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2001,"well made, moving film",If this movie would ve starred anyone else it surely wouldn t ve worked as well as it did Tom Hanks plays his character as an everyman Not as an ever confident superhuman but not as a total wimp either That makes it easy to relate to his character Chuck Noland Technically the movie is a marvel Beautiful cinematography and excellent use of sound They had the good sense to let out a music score to convey the utter silence on the island The situations on the island he finds himself in are realistically portrayed mostly thanks to a well written script by William Broyles The way he used the volleyball to make him have someone to talk to other than air was a master stroke SPOILER AHEAD It s even more amazing that the movie makes us sad when Chuck loses the ball That is perhaps the saddest moment of the film Some people were disappointed with the ending Well trust me it s the only way they could ve wrapped this kind of film up Think of any other plausible ending and it just wouldn t ve worked in the film Everyone involved did a very respectable job in this film making it one of the best ones released in 2000 This is in any case a film worth viewing,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566033/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2015,Another triumph for Hanks and Zemeckis,After winning Oscars for Forrest Gump star Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis teamed up for a 2000 epic called Cast Away a compelling and well made drama but for me a very difficult film to watch with minimal re watch appeal Hanks plays Chuck Noland an executive with Federal Express whose life is changed forever when he is involved in a plane crash which he survives and ends up stranded on a deserted island for four years No episode of Gilligan s Island here as we watch this man initially in denial about what has happened to him anticipating rescue in a few days but as time passes he can no longer deny what is happening to him and must learn how to survive while simultaneously trying to cling to his sanity evidenced in an actual relationship he develops with a volleyball which he names Wilson and takes care of like a newborn baby This film is challenging because it goes places where other plane crash dramas have never gone For example there is a horrific moment when Chuck actually discovers the body of the pilot of the plane and goes through his wallet I don t ever remember a film like this where the body of someone who didn t survive was even mentioned let alone revealed The film also takes its time in having Chuck accept his plight I like the way Chuck keeps his clothes on initially because he really thinks he s going to be found quickly but eventually he starts wearing less and less to the point where he is just in a loin cloth and his pants are now covering his head Even common health issues come to the surface here when Chuck develops a toothache and has no choice but to pull the tooth out himself a scene I literally cannot watch anymore Director Zemeckis employs a keen eye for detail and realism here this film contains what is probably the most frighteningly realistic plane crash I have ever seen in a movie The moments before the plane hits the panic in the pilots voices Chuck s iron fisted clutch of a picture of his fianc e Helen Hunt it all rang true and was just horrifying to watch and when Chuck was literally underwater trying to fight his way out of the plane I was literally holding my own breath Another Zemeckis touch to ensure realism is that after the initial scenes up to the plane crash were filmed he shut down production of the film for a couple of months to give Hanks time to lose 30 pounds to make his desperate diving for fish in the ocean look more desperately authentic and to show that Chuck was no longer eating regularly Zemeckis also knows how to make his viewer squirm particularly in his depiction of Chuck s relationship with Wilson the moment when Wilson falls off the raft and Chuck is unable to save him is heartbreaking and pathetic You feel for Chuck while at the same time you can t help but think Uh it s a volleyball One of my absolute favorite cinematic pictures occurs in this film as well the shot of Chuck s raft quietly floating in the ocean as a giant ship floats by right next to him This film is beautifully made and tells a very difficult story Tom Hanks received a richly deserved Oscar nomination and Helen Hunt makes the most of her small role as his confused fianc e but this film is really hard to watch Putting myself in Chuck s shoes was a very uncomfortable experience that I don t wish to duplicate It s a superb movie and I m glad I saw it but I have no desire to ever see it again,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3221230/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2001,9 on a scale of 10,There is a lot to say about this movie It was 2 hours 23 minutes but had about 6 hours of memories The airplane scene was a classic Nothing in a movie terrifies me but I have to say that was about as terrifying a scene as you will ever see The most amazing thing is that it held you in terror for what must have been 10 minutes There were a number of other times that the movie caused you to cringe in perceived pain And each time set a new standard Half the audience hid their head and the other half closed their eyes We all knew what was going to happen But that aspect of the movie was only a part of the overall experience It was also a powerful movie about the human spirit about courage about endurance It is impossible to fully appreciate what it would have been like but CAST AWAY did a pretty good job of helping us to imagine it Also it was a rather moving love story as the Hanks character was in love with the Hunt character all the years he was stranded on the island When they were reunited it was truly one of the great scenes ever in movies The conflict between desire and reality was extremely intense No pat endings but definitely symbolism and a sense of coming full circle You felt sorry for him but you also wish you could have the freedom that he obtained after he escaped the island And I don t mean just the freedom from being stranded I mean the mental freedom of knowing who you are and knowing what is important,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565500/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2001,great movie,I don t think I need to give a plot synopsis I m sure you know what it s about Tom Hanks as usual gives another good performance Seeing him struggle to live on the island the film generates a good deal of sympathy and you find yourself really feeling for him The airplane crash sequence is intense Helen Hunt was just her usual self but she s not too bad Alan Silvestri s score what little there was about 15 minutes or so and none of it heard until the final half hour was effective My only complaints the final half hour was a bit overlong and I wish that instead of cutting from Chuck s early days on the island to Four Years Later that they had shown a montage or something to let us see what all he went through during that time especially how he found a way to set up a calendar system using the sunlight in the cave But that aside CASTAWAY is a great film that at 2 hours and 25 minutes flies by like 15 minutes Robert Zemeckis remains high on my list of favorite directors,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565971/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2002,**SPOILERS** Well-made but unsatisfying **SPOILERS**,I had high expectations for this movie and really wanted to like it since it contains many themes that I like in a movie And it is well made and cleverly done But after seeing it I am left unsatisfied At the end nobody is happier than they were at the beginning Chuck s and Kelly s lives were turned upside down he was in agony and lost four years of his life she grieved for a long time and gave up her dreams but for nothing By the end I was searching for a reason for the movie but instead there was an unclear open ending The Texas character shown at the very start and the very end was written as a woman for some reason but I don t know why There s no hint that Chuck goes in her direction and there was no reason for him to I found no message moral or lesson to this film Not every movie has to have a point but the best ones do Yes Chuck triumphed over the island but if the movie was supposed to be just about that the beginning and ending wouldn t have been included And even the victory over being stranded is shallow considering the cost involved When it was over I asked Why did you tell me all of this,5.0,9.0,19.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566168/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2001,Even Tom Hanks can't solve all problems,What a time everyone would have moaning about this movie if Tom Hanks weren t in it too long too thin disjointed inconclusive ending longest product placement in the history of cinema But because of his presence most of these criticisms fade away and in any case the film probably wouldn t have been made without him The majority of the audience including me are happy to watch Hanks whatever he s doing on screen because of his charisma and sheer acting ability But there are some faults with this movie that Hanks cannot solve and at least one where he must bear some responsibility To start with the latter I just don t think he does enough in the early scenes to make Chuck Noland the time driven man that the movie needs to make its point that there is more to life than rushing around watching the clock and meeting deadlines Yes he s a busy diligent executive who possibly cares as much for FedEx as for his lover Kelly Helen Hunt but on a personal level he doesn t come over as particularly harrassed or obsessive I don t really take him seriously when he s shouting at the Russian operatives We must blame the producers and director Robert Zemeckis for other problems A major one is that by omitting a proper rescue scene the movie misses an opportunity for dramatic action and good feel action to balance the all too realistic air crash and also cheats the audience of the release of emotion and tension it deserves after sticking with Chuck through his long ordeal The cut from the moment of rescue to Noland a few weeks later flying home is too abrupt Another complaint is that though I have no quarrel with the ending as regards the plot the locale where Bettina Peterson lives which we ve also seen at the beginning of the movie is just too empty flat and boring I m sure Zemickis had good reasons for choosing this location but he doesn t seem to have had the visual appearance of the movie much in mind If he simply wanted to convey remoteness why not have her live in the mountains or deep in the everglades Hanks has now become a movie icon in a very literal sense the audience enters a cinema where he is starring with much the same feeling of veneration as does the congregation entering a church This near idolatry is reinforced by the parts he plays almost invariably men of charm integrity and in Cast Away courage tenacity and resourcefulness It would do both him and his fans good to play a less saintly role and this may be the case in The Road to Perdition now in production where he s due to play a killer,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565898/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2001,A resplendent spiritual journey.,Even slight flaws appear to loom larger when embodied in a near perfection The few defects however do not mar the overall excellence of this fine production Here we learn once more that our journey through life might not be what we expected and that it might hold challenges that will in the end make us stronger The spiritual depth of this film is profound At a more superficial level it is an engrossing adventure a story not just about love but how badly we humans need each other for our happiness Robert Zemeckis by this creation seems to have blossomed from an imaginative filmmaker to one of penetrating depth Like Frank Capra before him Zemeckis draws upon the subtle whispers of the spiritual realm beyond and in so doing has delivered to us a timeless movie,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565912/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2023,"Hanks with a volleyball, came close to winning his third Oscar",You can call it a one man show Yes the film focuses on Tom Hanks solo performance and his ability to carry the film with such depth and nuance is a testament to his talent as an actor He only missed his third Oscar losing to another spetacular performance from Russell Crowe in Gladiator The cinematography complements the film s themes of isolation and survival It captures the beauty and harshness of the island contributing to the film s immersive and atmospheric experience Cast Away explores themes of survival resilience human connection and the value of time It delves into the essential human need for companionship and the emotional toll of being separated from society,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9214521/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2015,Fascinating,Cast Away is an excellent film It has a great performance by Tom Hanks the script is smartly written and the cinematography is great I believe the movie has two flaws one too many characters are introduced in the beginning and in the end which really aren t relevant and the second one is that the early 2000 s CGI really doesn t hold up There s a scene in the movie where you see a whale and it just looks really fake But these two things are minor really and don t really affect the movie experience This is also one of the saddest movies in my opinion There are two moments in the film that get me every time in tears when Wilson drifts away and when Hanks goes to Helen Hunt s character s house in the rain near the end of the movie Hanks great performance only adds feeling to these moments The last act of the film usually gets a bad rep which I really don t understand because I think it is an essential part to the movie and the last scene is the perfect ending in my opinion Cast Away is heartbreaking touching and often hard to watch It is also a great film,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3267388/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2000,Without a doubt one of the years best films.. no question about it.,Unlike last year this year didn t have as many good movies as last but this year is definately not a bad year Last night my birthday I saw CAST AWAY and let me start by saying that I expected A LOT I ve known about this movie for a little over a year and I couldn t wait to see it I thought I may have been dissapointed that it may be too long or even too boring but it was far from it This is a wonderfully created picture I thought it was done so well on so many levels Many people I heard were not happy with the ending but I won t say anything except I wasn t thats all I have to say about that the ending Like always Tom Hanks is fabulous in this not only does the audience feel like they are on the island with him they feel his emotions especially in the scenes with Wilson who deserves an academy award for best supporting object This movie is defiantely one unforgetable picture and if not number one one of the top five best movies of the year Thank You,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566131/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2001,I'm a surviver...,was probably a No 1 song for Tom Hanks as he returns in up to date life Can anyone in a modern life imagine life without mobile TV car No Neither did a Fed ex employee till he hit the deadly ground of the tiny island in Pacific Great story for a movie huh A story who cries out to become a masterspiece movie Did it Well Tom Hanks proved once more that he is one of the best actors around although he proved his talent much more in academy awarded Philadelphia and Forrest Gump Heln Hunt did his part correctly while others are un noticed Why didn t I grade this movie better Hmm mostly it was too long there are some scenes which are totally unnecessary and I guess that this is the director s blame Plus there are some minor things that bothered me for instance after the crash he collected all of the crates but he opened it in a day or two Why I guess everyone would opened the crates imidiatly Don t you agree He might found a cellular phone in it Anyway all in all i quite enjoyed in a movie so that s why a 6 out of 10 is appropriate,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566050/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2007,Cast Away,The Forrest Gump team tries another film together and it s not bad what a surprise In this first sentence I yet tried to include also the reason why it s not really good This film takes no risk in nothing I mean if you have Tom Hanks you could at least take some risks in your story or in the way you shoot your movie or in the themes you choose to treat You have Tom Hanks people would still come and watch it But instead Zemeckis is satisfied with pure mediocrity and delivers us a movie with a little bit of action a dominating love story a sad end a whiny score and Tom Hanks To cut it short A little bit for everybody I hope Zemeckis is not surprised if someone accuses him of making boring movies some day Boring through their volitional mediocrity I repeat It s not bad what we get here some parts the first 20 minutes on the island were actually good but who cares You won the predicate Film for the whole family,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1759246/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2000,Superbly Made (SPOILERS!!!),Ordinarily I don t post comment on widely seen films not that anyone s been holding their breath because the many reviews that do get posted for the most part accurately and astutely convey the film s quality or lack thereof There s really nothing to add that hasn t been said But scanning over the early comments on Cast Away I m amazed at the number of critics that are misinterpreting and overanalyzing this straightforward and excellent film I m sure that many of these folks are far more intelligent and perceptive than I am but I do feel compelled to contribute an alternative point of view Cast away is a consistently gripping tremendously satisfying old fashioned tribute to the resiliency of the human spirit performed and directed with great skill and commitment by three of the brightest talents Hollywood has to offer Tom Hanks Helen Hunt and Robert Zemeckis Reading the criticisms I m reminded of the man who complains that the square isn t enough like a circle and that the circle should be more triangle like This is a quietly powerful story about love loss and hope timeless themes that will always resonate Don t over think it don t read more into it than is there Don t be like the researcher last week who ludicrously attacked the prevalence of snowmen as opposed to snow women on holiday greeting cards Some of the criticisms assert that nothing interesting happens in the middle section of the film Oh yeah nothing happens all right Tom Hanks workaholic every man only gets stranded on a deserted island after a harrowing plane wreck and has to figure out a way to keep himself fed clothed sheltered and sane Not much at all For the uninitiated this is what is known as compelling subject matter No tricks or gimmicks are necessary just a great actor and director going to work The audience is right there with Hanks as he experiences each thrilling victory breaking coconuts open without spilling the precious liquid inside starting a fire extracting a rotting tooth and agonizing setback realizing of course that the man s very survival hinges on these heretofore mundane tasks This is man vs nature and man vs himself not man vs routine adversary borrowed from a thousand other films Those hoping for Hanks to stumble upon thieving pirates bloodthirsty natives or a top secret military base will no doubt be disappointed Might I advise renting that classic Six Days Seven Nights instead I ve read that there is too little sense of Hanks being transformed by the experience that one doesn t see him fully exploring and exploiting the benefits of isolation as well as the rest of the island Please We see a man who in his job as a Federal Express courier and spare me the product placement complaints this is a movie set in the real world he works for just such a company it s unavoidable get over it is a slave to time and deadlines As the overnight packages from the plane wreck silently wash ashore he quickly recognizes the cruel irony and humor in his predicament This is not someone with an artistic temperament who is going to stare at the stars scrawl bad poetry in the sand with a broken stick and befriend a bunch of animals Here is a guy who we ve seen as a decidedly social creature abruptly deprived of the companionship of friends family co workers customers clients competitors and especially the girlfriend he deeply loves The only thing that keeps him going is the slender hope that some day he will get off the island and see those people again So while of course the harshness of his new environment dramatically changes external characteristics internal non visible ones for the most part stay the same Significantly however he does adapt and then apply the survival skills he s developed over the years to achieve his goal of getting off the island That dream never dies No amount of months or years stranded there is going to snuff out that desire If anything it would logically sharpen and hone it until it becomes an instrument for its realization SPOILERS AHEAD For those who contend that there s too little impact when he does finally make it off the island I point to the beautifully understated shots of Hanks and this is after an exhilarating sequence where he braves the giant tides on his makeshift raft simply looking back at the massive formation in all its stubborn splendor The shot says it all for better or worse this was his home for four years chosen because it s the same length of time that it takes to get a college degree It won t be forgotten Zemeckis has been criticized for choosing not to focus on Hanks readjustment to civilization that it all seems too cut and dried and that again he seems barely changed But this is where an appreciation for the art of subtlety comes in right handy Hanks is changed He moves slower talks slower thinks before he speaks considers his words He s taking things in reabsorbing the world from a whole new perspective There is no need especially so late in the story to show him shaving his scraggly beard re learning how to eat with utensils wearing real clothes and so on That s been done The focus is where it should be and it s always been sort of a parallel unspoken narrative throughout on his now deeply problematic reunion with Helen Hunt the woman he loves who thinking he had died has married and become a mother And this is where I must really take issue with the many complaints of those who say the resolution of this affair is an indecisive letdown In fact Zemeckis has supplied the kind of scene actors dream about and Hanks and Hunt who have a rare and believable chemistry nail it The director stands back and lets the couple feel their way through the minefield of emotions they re experiencing in what is a psychologically and emotionally convincing encounter that is as moving as anything Hollywood has produced in years Is it sentimental Sure but there is a place for sentimentality in movies as long as it s earned What makes it work here is the way both Hanks and Hunt s characters fight it and struggle against it but ultimately it s no use Newsflash Human Beings Are Often Sentimental In a movie like this the audience as well as the characters deserve that moment where the music swells and the tears flow It s the only appropriate payoff for what s transpired and it s all beautifully filmed The closing scene has also been misunderstood The pretty woman in the truck is not the equivalent of Helen Hunt or some tidy replacement The film s major theme is that just as fate dealt Hanks a major blow by stranding him on the island and he survived he is also capable of surviving the even crueler blow of losing the love of his life due to circumstances beyond anyone s control The girl in the truck represents a possibility among many visually conveyed in the closing shot where Hanks is standing in the middle of an intersection with all roads stretching off into the distance As an adult he has done the SELFLESS thing rather than the SELFISH in letting Hunt go as painful as it is All he can do now is hang in there and hope the next day s tide will wash up something worthwhile This is a tragic love story superbly made All those who want their squares to be more like triangles by all means see something else,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565512/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2002,A Thoughtful and Moving Film,Cast Away is at once both a simple and a complex film At its core it is the story of a man who survives a plane crash and lives for four years alone on a deserted Pacific island But it also deals with the profound changes in its hero s life after his rescue wrought by four years in isolation under circumstances that had long ago convinced all his friends and loved ones that he was dead In a role in which many actors might have been tempted to eat the scenery Tom Hanks is restrained and always believable Cast Away avoids easy answers so it is ultimately ambiguous and a little sad as parts of all of our lives are ambiguous and a little sad Not to be missed 10 out of 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566089/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2002,Two-thirds of a good movie (major spoilers),In my opinion it s Tom Hanks performance that makes the film work at least up until the third act When we first see him he is a modern civilized man He is concerned with doing his job smoothly and on time He romances the woman he loves In other words he is much like any normal person However that one fateful night changes his life forever A storm downs his plane in the ocean The only survivor of the disaster he must learn to adapt to solitary life on a small island Tom Hanks does an excellent job in making the transition believable Before seeing it I was worried about how the scenes with Wilson the volleyball would turn out However I now realize that given the circumstances it was about all that he could do to prevent his own insanity It s not like he had to worry about how others would perceive him With this in mind the first two acts are often effective However just when I was getting into it Cast Away takes a wrong turn and descends into predictable melodrama Helen Hunt does a decent acting job but alas most of her scenes should have been written out of the script In fact it would ve been better to end the film with a long shot of Chuck adrift on his raft which would ve lent it an air of ambiguity 1 2 out of Released by Dreamworks Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566122/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2000,"Truly one of the best films of 2000.Tom Hanks best performance since ""Philadelphia"".",Cast Away is a wonderful film with an excellent performance by Tom Hanks that deserves to be recognized by the academy I left the theater not being able to forget how emotional the movie ran through me At a full two hours and thirty five minutes I was entertained by Tom Hanks performance which made me feel the same kind of emotions that I had when I had seen Philadelphia Tom Hanks is a Fed Ex delivery executive who happens to be in a plane that crashes into the ocean He drifts onto an island where he is forced to spend four years on a deserted island On that island he must learn to survive and fight for his sanity Tom Hanks has delivered some of the most incredible performances in his acting career and his second collaboration with director Robert Zemeckis is a real treat for fans of Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis Tom Hanks is well supported by Academy Award winner Helen Hunt whose performance should be recognized with another Academy Award nomination And I mean should because she deserves it Even if she doese not win she should be recognized by the academy Director Robert Zemeckis brings the audience into a spectacular beautiful world Choosing the locations set on the islands and the ocean were a breathtaking experience The cinematography and the score are among the film s best contributions Cast Away along with Forrest Gump The Hurricane and Saving Private Ryan is a must see Take the time to see Cast Away because you will walk out that theater feeling good inside yourself Cast Away is truly one of the best films of 2000 and Tom Hanks proves that he scores My vote for this film One of the best films of 2000,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565614/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2021,It takes its time but it's worth the wait!,The start is probably the slowest part of the movie but is also the part with the most character development Obviously the movie had to start slow to build up tension for the inevitable disaster that takes place It does this really well but could probably have been a bit faster The moment of the plane crash is absolutely horrifying it s done so extremely well Once he is stranded on the island the music cuts off and really emphasises his loneliness The acting is spectacular but after the huge skip in time the movie becomes extremely predictable This predictability makes the movie rather dull but it still manages to create an atmospheric and sad ending really well The whole romantic side is a bit overplayed and annoying but it all works out well in the end,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7163065/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2001,Average for a Tom Hanks outing,Cast Away was only an average Tom Hanks movie which does means it was better than a lot of the major studio stuff out there but it was nowhere up to the level of Philadelphia or Forest Gump I liked the fact that the ending was the way it was not necessarily happy not necessarily sad and I liked the look of the island that Hanks was marooned on The one problem I had with the film was that there was no initial indication that a FedEx executive would ve had all of the survival skills that Hanks exhibited but I suppose that there really would ve been no way to foreshadow that in the opening part of the storyline I would have also liked the film to delve more into what Hanks was thinking while on the island perhaps digging a bit more into his past It seemed his life began and ended with Helen Hunt there had to be more to what made him who he was than just her I viewed the DVD version of the film and found most of the second disc to be pretty lame the survivalist featurette was interesting at times but the Wilson featurette was lame I know why the character was there and why there was a need for it but to overly glamourize it like had been done was just dumb,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565934/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2004,Two Movies In One,Cast Away was two films one that I very much liked sandwiched between two that I found dull As it opens Chuck Noland Hanks is a time obsessed slightly rotund Fed Ex executive He has everything is life a good family a good job a nubile girlfriend Hunt He leaves on Christmas eve for an undefined emergency and has to fly overseas The plane goes down and the meat of the movie begins The second act of Cast Away is brilliant Hanks is marooned on a island after the plane crash and director Robert Zemeckis makes some very daring moves to strand us with him No music Noe other characters No animals to befriend And most importantly no flashbacks to life back home without him The only other cast member is a volleyball that Hanks uses to maintain his sanity The acting here is particularly great since it is so isolated We get to sense the various stages that he goes through shock desperation survival a touch of insanity This is a performance that truly draws you in From this point the movie slides down a rather slippery slope of mediocrity largely due to the performance of Hunt I have seen Cast Away a few times and I am so exhilarated by the second act and so let down by the third See it for yourself and you can judge Still the Cast Away s middle act occupies the lion s share of the film and makes the entire experience more than worthwhile out of,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566275/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2003,Walk Away From Cast Away,After a friend recommend this film to me after crying during the viewing of it I had to see what the fuss was all about Tom Hanks plays the role of a FedEx worker who is stranded on an island He s out in the middle of nowhere so the life that he had is basically no more This movie is so sappy that I wanted to throw up I had no connection with Tom Hanks character whatsoever Once you see this you ll think Why didn t he just to leave the island If this movie would have starred me it would have lasted 10 minutes because I would have found some way to get off that island in no time at all The movie was boring because all you deal with is Tom Hanks Tom Hanks Tom Hanks and more Tom Hanks He s a good actor no doubt about that but seeing him for 2 hours straight gets boring Plus this movie was too drawn out The film tried too hard to be something it never could be I give this movie a 2 out of 10,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566249/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2001,TOM HANKS IS AMAZING IN THIS FILM,Tom Hanks is an amazing actor He dominates Cast Away so fully that one doubts it could have made without him He should have won his record third Oscar but the Academy in their usual good judgment I m being sarcastic chose Russell Crowe for Gladiator Boy did they miss the boat on this one Hanks is pretty much alone for about 110 minutes of this 143 minute feature I m not going to spoil it for you since the advertising teams from Fox and Dreamworks have done such a good job already sarcasm again Not knowing anything about the film is a major benefit I don t pay attention to ads and I was able to appreciate the film s surprises I loved the fact that it records an existence So many filmmakers today think you have to have wall to wall action in order to keep an audience interested But Hanks and the director Robert Zemeckis understand that a good story and solid characterization are even more effective This is another winner from Zemeckis who has been making one great film after another lately Forrest Gump Contact the chilling What Lies Beneath actually he has yet to make a bad film The film s Panavision photography by Don Burgess resembles Kubrick s 2001 and George Stevens The Diary of Anne Frank in making wide open vistas claustrophobic Just because I really really liked this film doesn t mean it s flawless Cast Away has some problems One is the ending While I appreciate the fact that Zemeckis didn t tack on a sentimental syrupy ending the final shot of Hanks in this film comes off as forced This is probably a compromise with the studios and I don t blame Zemeckis Hanks or even the screenwriter Another is Helen Hunt Nothing personal but she has yet to find a role that can eclipse her Oscar winning work in As Good As It Gets Here she has a nothing part that could have been more substantial What Women Want also had that problem and she was the LEAD Here s to hoping that she ll find a good juicy role worthy of her talent If there s one thing I hate it s squandered talent Still Cast Away offers many pleasures and is riveting filmmaking from start to finish This film deserved better treatment from the Academy But since when does the Academy actually do that The answer is hardly ever Shame out of 4 stars,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565945/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2001,"The most beautiful thing in the world is the world itself""",Cast Away is a powerful and fascinating movie and one of those kind movies we rarely see today Despite its long time it s not boring and every sequences is worth watching The story deals with issues which is forgotten these days such as humanity nature world Watching Tom Hanks marooned in a deserted island confronting the force of nature and talking with his new and only friend Wilson makes me compare early people at the cave age when a piece of stone and two pieces of a wood values as a gold and today people who have everything but nothing Sometimes I rather have a stone and a ball as a friend and live in such a peaceful place than have a knife and an enemy disguised as a friend The movie also wants to teach us some important thing that Hope is the only thing that keeps you alive when you observe no relief and with hope you can survive Really The most beautiful thing in the world is the world itself,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565962/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2001,A touching movie,I think this movie was a good one because it has some touching scenes in which Chuck Noland Tom Hanks had to try to get out of the island he suffered a lot and also got hurt because of rocks waves etc His teeth also hurt I was impressed as he hit one of his teeth with a stone I thought I had my teeth like that for a minute It hurts me a lot sometimes I think about somebody who suffers because of the teeth it s horrible to have a pain like that so it makes this movie very different and really touching The plot is excellent it has a lot of interesting things like a true love but at the same time it turns like an impossible love When Chuck Noland finally got to get out of the island he found out that the love of his life got married to somebody else and also had a little baby This movie is very realistic Tom Hanks really seems older when he got back home but it s because the film was halted for a year so it makes it a very realistic movie I enjoyed this movie a lot The scene when he thought that he had a volleyball for a friend was touching as well as funny and sad I think when anybody is alone they can think anything for having friends even if the friend was a volleyball This movie is very good you should see it and think a little about it,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565986/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2019,What a great classic.,Obviously I am many years behind with this review but it is only a proof of how this classic despite the age is still able to deliver an enormous satisfaction in its theatrical form Cast Away is a film that I like to use quite like the example of good cinema it is a film with a simple premise simple in his veins but with a fantastic execution fun and emotional It is an art of being able to see it entertaining from top to bottom full of classic moments that we can remember forever moments that are already captured as part of the history of cinema Everything inside the movie is great I was sincerely hoping to see something simple with a little adventure but ended up being a trip quite emotional and passionate about the survival story of a poor FedEx worker who ends up spending years lost along with nothing but his companion mind which makes great use with the classic ball Wilson And practically these are the two protagonists of the film although if there are several characters the story itself is concentrated in Chuck perfectly personified by Tom Hanks achieving that we have a great affection for the person and his interaction with the world around him Finishing with an excellent and simple end emotional and moving a classic instant that despite the years must be seen,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4903541/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2023,Really a stupid movie,So he washes up on the island Pretty obvious with no Huts around or natives that yelling for help is going to accomplish nothing So is he sits on the beach is life raft could be washed away but he just sits there looking at stuff He does get the life raft I will give a point to the fact that his wife remarried that was part of the storyline Hence the spoiler I suppose you keep the budget cheap even in Tom Hanks movie They Don t Really show the rescue They could have that would actually have added quite a bit to the story The crew sees a life raft comes to a full stop tries to figure out who s on the raft And rescue him but that s entirely left out This movie was really dumb Go ahead give me thumbs down I don t care I m going to stick with this review,3.0,0.0,14.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9099147/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2010,Never commit the sin of turning your back to this one...,We often find ourselves at crossroads wondering where to go and what to do next The ambiguous expression on our faces probably would not be any different than Tom Hanks when he stares right at us before the screen fades away thus leaving things to our own interpretation It is also up to us to conjure what could have been inside that FedEx box that supposedly saved Tom s character Chuck Noland s life which he leaves at the door of a house in rural Texas Could it have been a satellite phone what an irony it would have been had it been revealed An open mind and a sense of adventure is what Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks expects the audience to bring along to this movie In a way it is a thinking man s movie because it is a little slow for a generation fed on YouTube clips has no dialogs or music for several minutes and the ending is not the dessert that an average moviegoer would like after such a lengthy feast My qualms however are with the part when Chuck rejoins civilization after living on a deserted island for four years His interaction with people especially Kelly Helen Hunt is for the lack of a better word average and mirrors the humdrum of life which is the last thing you would expect from a character that has put the taste of such a sweet performance in your mouth The writing here is not at par with the golden second half The soliloquy that Tom s character deliver however is a gem and it captures his state of mind after suffering in isolation for years and the pain that he felt after losing the love of his life all over again Interestingly for the time bound Chuck Noland No Land get it a systems engineer for Fed Ex no thought of a life altering event or the fear of losing his girlfriend had probably ever occurred except the fear of running out of time And in a bid to beat time he ignores his health and even proposes to Kelly in the car en route to board a last minute flight to Malaysia which unexpectedly crashes a very scary and a believable plane crash and he finds himself marooned on a deserted tropical island with nothing but a broken watch and all the time in the world to ponder on his future The scenes featuring an overweight workaholic s struggle to survive on an uninhabited island are by far the most intriguing ones ever recorded on film And Tom Hanks fails not once not even by chance Very soon his struggle becomes our struggle as he learns how to use day to day objects as tools of survival how to crack coconuts how to fish how to build a shelter how to light a fire and most importantly how to survive the odds without any human contact A volleyball named Wilson fills this gap for him and becomes as real to him as Kelly was in his past His faith in his love and a strong desire to see Kelly helps him survive on that island Cast Away benefits mainly from another amazing performance by Tom Hanks He right from the beginning has us believing that his character a typical worker bee will probably continue to live like this forever and never suspects a life altering event to strike him ever But once this event strikes and takes it toll it leaves him at a crossroads his conscience once a mere cog in a massive clock becomes ambivalent because it now holds the wisdom of what time can do to you and constantly reminds him of how uncertain his life has been and that his future or rather his notion of future will never be the same And this wisdom disguised as an ambiguous expression is the reflection of our own dilemma of never knowing what he would do next,0.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2205758/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2004,"A good adventure, a joy",Hey an enjoyable film even though Im not too much a Hanks fan Type of story has been done before That is the loner survivor castaway struggling with the elements Even in a tropical setting Hanks survives a plane crash the sole survivor in fact is marooned on an island for 4 years It s a tropical island which means he can sustain himself food wise from the tropical fruits vegetation as well as with fish His whole life changes emotionally literally After he s rescued by a passing cargo ship he comes home to find his wife re married with a child Heartbreaking but what was she supposed to do with him missing Carry on of course The story seems to be left open for a sequel if you can believe it We ll see But the same sort of Robinson Cruesoe situation was done in a silent film called White Shadows in the South Seas 1928,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566276/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2001,While the Cast are away,This is clearly a subject which easily captures the human imagination but I will give Zemeckis his due credit in that I although I groaned at the prospect of two and a half hours of learning to catch fish light a fire etc etc my need to get up and move on remained on hold So Good points An impressive air crash with an underwater ballet reminiscent of Tom Hanks trying to reach a Normandy beach A wonderful sense of the power and beauty of tides both in their height as Hanks battles against them and their omnipresence as beautifully portrayed from the island mountain top panorama But most of all for me was the middle of the night eyeball with an enormous whale Did we dream that Ron Viewed 11Feb01,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565827/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2002,It didn't seem long,I was surprised to read after seeing Cast Away that it is almost three hours long I didn t squirm as I usually do while watching a movie of that length So that speaks well for the movie However I didn t think it was a super wonderful movie either Roger Ebert complains in his review that Zemekis and company revealed too much of the plot in the trailer for Cast Away I concur with Ebert although I may have come by my prior knowledge by reading reviews or talking to people who saw the movie The ending was a good idea with our protagonist meeting the woman who sent the FedEx package at the beginning of the movie classic envelope pattern But it wasn t filmed well with Hanks standing in the middle of a dusty Texas intersection pondering which direction to take next I wish it had been more like the ending to Heaven Can Wait when the man and the woman started talking and it was clear they were going to hook up I would have given Cast Away a rating of 6 but raised it to 7 because the movie didn t seem as long as it was,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566193/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2004,Engaging Hanks-Driven Drama,POSSIBLE SPOILERS Cast Away is a concept that could not have possibly been imagined without some of the most brilliant and touching acting talent around as the audience would otherwise be bored to tears in watching an ordinary man stranded on an island for the duration of about two hours Luckily for us the wise and gifted Robert Zemeckis decided to re team from Forrest Gump with one of the best actors in Hollywood to produce a film that is propelled by emotion engagement and enthrallment through acting This is a simple story about a man constantly in a haste he s a Fed Ex manager who is about to get engaged to his girlfriend Helen Hunt yet before he proposes to her must venture around the globe on one last delivery stop before Christmas This is when we find Hanks stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere as his plane suffers from turbulence and is shot down from the sky the pilots killed instantly It is difficult to adapt to the conditions of solitude and living the life of a productive castaway but Chuck Noland Hanks manages to find coconuts albeit struggling to crack them open catch fish build fires rafts and rescue me flags and apparently survives for four years on the island living the same routine every day His survival is stemmed from his hope in his remembrance of his love Kelly Hunt through observing a Rolex watch with her picture inside determination promising to deliver a lost package when he leaves the island and companionship he befriends a volleyball which he appropriately names Wilson as somebody to converse with Hanks delivers one of the most human convincing and heartfelt performances you will ever behold proving here that he is just as brilliant in playing a castaway as he is a mentally deficient savant My complaints of the film bely in the resolution The initially endearing premise of romance between Hanks and Hunt becomes particularly wanton and confusing and unfortunately amounts to virtually nothing We understand that life has changed dramatically after four years of desolation and survival and by the end we would rather see Chuck Nolan back on the island living adventures with Wilson and making the best of life rather than confronting an apathetic and ungrateful society who hardly cares about him after four years of estrangement Absorbing direction excellent acting decent enough screenplay weak and tarnished resolution Cast Away is focused near shore lost back on land yet overall a decent engaging experience out of,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0967881/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2001,Wilson the Volley ball ROCKS!,After enduring stuff like The Beach Castaway the boring TV series and the hideous Temptation Island this sand surf and sun drama is more entertaining than the rest of the genre by far Mr Hanks was extremely good in this film He plays his character Chuck convincingly When he ends up marooned on the island you really feel for the poor guy I even asked myself why didn t he try to make a fire earlier especially when he s waving and yelling at the light far out to sea and it s night But then we remember he is an urbanite stuck on this small island in the middle of the pacific and these logical things wouldn t come easily at first to the mind of a city dweller The main story of this film isn t so much his life on the island and Tom Hanks portrays this excellently but the way Mr Hanks rebuilds his life once he gets back home I was rather disappointed because it would ve made more sense to see how he managed to survive on the island for 4 whole years The long final third of the flick when he s home again could ve been reduced to maybe 20 minutes The plane crash is one of the scariest I ve seen in a flick Also the best action scene in this film For fans of action this will NOT be the movie for them Admittedly its a sad reunion at the end and things don t turn out in a typical Hollywood Cliche manner CONCLUSION Wilson the volley ball ROCKS No only kidding,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565874/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2020,The true meaning of life,I think one of the good things about this movie is that it sets up a suspense story in which the man who opens the door to receive the email betrits his wife who is the last person destined to be with Chuck The wings of the angels run all the way through You have to pay attention to detail Why had he left the mail with the angel s wings on the desert island and insisted on sending it back Why a pair of wings painted on a door made to be a sail He also wrote It saved my life on the note The angel wings on the car of the girl he was destined to be with made him smile as he looked at the direction of her house because he had found his final home and was doomed to never be with Kelly Perhaps this is life sometimes desperately want to get something after many years has changed leaving only endless imagination and desolate But you gotta live like Chuck said I gotta keep breathing who wouldn t admire that spirit After watching it I cried for the lover was not married for the fate of his injustice more strong hero,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5716012/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2001,"OK, but with a script by JG Ballard it could´ve been great",Quite interesting and engaging despite som cliched moments The psychology of Hanks character is quite shallow and traditional I wanted to know more about his thoughts and dreams beyond merely wanting to return to civilization I wish the script could have been written by JG Ballard The plane crash is spectacular as is some of the panoramas of the island and I like Zemeckis restrained use of music I think there s no score for nearly 90 min which is really nice in a Hollywood movie But when it does surface it is of course the same romantic nonsense we ve heard a million times before Despite that the ending was better than I expected and it has a quite nice epilogue,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566029/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2001,blast away,after all it s not just about a drifted man like robinson crusoe story basically the movie is divided into three segments the first part is the normal modern life of chuck very related to us hardly use his feeling all things revolve around logic and routines the middle part and the tiresome one off course is the drifted part where he was sucked back into stone age where he has to recollect his basic nature as human being not as a civilized person and the last part is the reunion not with his girlfriend but with his lost humanity like painting the style and the gradient is much like forrest gump telling us about how uncertain life is but this one tells you more transparent message the most touching moment is when chuck telling himself that i m so sad that i lost her but i m very glad she s there with me all the time it is indeed a mature way to deal with loosing someone you love cast away is more a spiritual story than just an adventure movie it is indeed a must for everyone who s been questioning about our everyday life it is a reflection of how you deal with difficulties in life and how you handle towards god s plans a parallel course with alive but with more deep enlightment a must see for anybody who wishes to recollect their value of relationships with others and with god x,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565764/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2001,go see the film because of Tom Hanks,May contain a spoiler The Robinson Crusoe s story is as old as I can remember and this movie is a sort of take off on that old story and it s quite a good take off Basically the film is divided to 3 parts before the crash the island and after the island This structure help convey the transformation Hanks character has gone through the film however it is the film weakest point The middle part is the best one in the film and the longest the 2 other parts are simply not in the emotional scale of that part I am not a huge fun of Tom Hanks Sometimes he tend to be very annoying but sometime with the right script and director he gives a good performance see Saving Private Ryan This is the case here His performance is superb and his 3rd Oscar is almost certain to land in his hands He carries the film on his shoulders and do best with what he has been given in the first place which is not much If you are a Tom Hanks fun you have already seen the film If not go see it Hanks deserve every praise he gets,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565817/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2001,Isolation and desolation to its' fullest,Cast Away 2000 20th Century Fox DreamWorks Pictures Cast Away enables a viewer to experience isolation and desolation like no other film in recent memory Director Robert Zemeckis What Lies Beneath Forrest Gump crafts an ambitious and elegant story revolving around Chuck Nolan Tom Hanks a Fed EX employee who is stranded on a desert island for several years due to a horrific plane crash Zemeckis makes no secret of handing over the complete second act to Hanks to retain the viewer s attention No music no 45 degree camera angles just simple storytelling to demonstrate Hanks isolation Cast Away is quite an achievement in terms of a film s power to play with the human emotion This film is structured into three related yet completely different acts which all have a different story to tell The film opens with an energetic and rowdy scene in Russia where Hanks s character is leading a giant Fed EX shipment With the use of frantic editing and great camera tracking including a p o v shot from a Fed Ex package Zemeckis demonstrates the importance of delivering packages on time Here we see Hanks character s obsession with his work in which he utters these great lines We live and die by the clock We must never allow ourselves the sin of turning our backs on the clock Yet in watching the film closely we see completely that Hanks had to have let go of this mantra to survive Within this first act we enter Hanks life through an enormous Christmas dinner with his girlfriend Helen Hunt and discover all that Hanks has to live for Cut quickly to a terrific plane crash sequence that comes completely unexpected in which our main character finds himself stranded on a deserted island with nothing but his sanity to keep him grounded In this second act we are limited to extraordinary filmmaking with little use of dialogue and musical score Instead we are treated to Hanks tour de force performance in which he commands his screen presence We see Hanks struggle with the impossibility of starting a fire from scratch making acquaintances with a volley ball named Wilson and deal with the inevitable possibility of never returning home The third act is in essence a closure to all the events that have occurred in the film Therefore we will not go into detail yet some might find the last act a tad disappointing yet it is evident that the filmmakers stuck with the most realistic ending possible As far as the film is concerned it plays on no other level than human emotion Zemeckis leaves us no choice but to sympathize with our beloved character as he struggles to maintain his dignity in a world where there is none We also see our character struggle with an unbearable weight loss as he wrestles with famine in a place where food is scarce and loneliness inevitable The best thing about this film are the subtle yet present symbolic events or images that convey the notion that although we might seem alone we never are It might take a second viewing to notice these but they are there and that is just one of the many great elements that compose this great film Giancarlo s Rating out of four,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566022/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,Flawed But Insightful Journey Into Loneliness,Cast Away is Tom Hank s latest Oscar hopeful performance but rest assured a nomination will not be garnered Though the film is at its best when Hanks is in the drudges of loneliness it fails to convince us of Hank s relationship with co star Helen Hunt Though their scenes together are few it certainly detracts from the mood set throughout the film Cast Away begins by showing us Tom Hank s character as a man obsessed with time he has to be since he works for Federal Express After saying goodbye to his wife Helen Hunt in a flat one note performance he is in a plane crash that leaves the others dead and himself stranded on an island Time apart from loved ones and friends is an essential theme to Cast Away that is time should not be wasted during his ordeal on the island the pain Hanks feels is not for the loss of food shelter or material possessions His inspiration for survival is the love of his life Helen Hunt During his stay on the island his need for a companion grows to the point where he takes to talking to a volleyball In fact the most emotionally stirring scene takes place between he and the volleyball and not the ones with Helen Hunt when sports equipment makes a greater impression with the audience than a top actress there s something quite wrong Tom Hanks performance as Chuck Noland may not be Oscar material but it certainly is well done and the long stretches and scenes without much dialogue are enlivened by some funny instances and Robert Zemeckis ironically lush photography of the paradise like island turned prison for Hanks There s also quite a few touches of irony in the film and also inventiveness that comes in the way of Hank s novel uses of some of the FedEx packages that wash ashore with him For all the buzz that s been generated by this Hanks Zemeckis project the film lives up to it in the beginning and middle but the end feels like it was hastily put together the scenes between Hunt and Hanks feel contrived the dialogue is flat and they have zero chemistry If only the film had ended 20 minutes sooner the solitude and meaning of the film would have gained fantastic strength and momentum unfortunately it s undone by a rather banal ending,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565824/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2001,Cast This Film Away I Say,One of the most generic bloated ego thinly woven films I ve seen in a long time I was bored by the ten minute mark and insulted by the fifteen A long go nowhere Fed Ex and Wilson Volleyball commercial that didn t properly analyze the true ramifications of Hanks isolation spent too long on his life while trapped we ve seen this before and Zemeckis offered no new insight and didn t believably portray what one would experience in that situation and had a resoundingly unappealing and unsatisfying finish Pure garbage Don t bother regardless of what you ve heard this is a stinker,1.0,13.0,47.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565644/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2007,brilliant....a feast of the sneses,Arguably Tom Hanks s BEST role ever He captures Chuck Nolan and puts him on the island PERFECTLY Directed by Robert Zemekis this adventure tells the story of Chuck Nolan executive director of Fed Ex as he crash lands on the island and has to fend for hmself against the ravages if nature But as the coconuts fall what is that Chuck cries And the scenery MAGNIFICENT and what tension I particularly enjoyed the storming the beaches scene with the guys jumping over the sides of the bats Don t miss it,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1719404/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2007,Hate the ending and will always hate it,I signed up for an IMDb com account just so I could post this I ve watched this movie 3 times I ve watched it that many times not because I like it but just to see if I could understand why it was written the way it was Still can t and will no longer bother Helen s character admits that Chuck was the love of her life For that reason 2 3 years of marriage with some dentist has nothing over the destiny that her and Chuck were meant to have She should ve left her new husband and gone back with Chuck True love is true love and if you ever have a chance to be with the one true love of your life you should never give it up let alone after just 4 years The movie is decent but I HATE THE ENDING AND WILL ALWAYS HATE IT Chuck deserved to have her back Period Post a counter argument if you want it will be dismissed I ve made up my mind on this BUT OK Well then could destiny have something better in store for Chuck Gee the writer doesn t even ever let you find out Because we never get to see Chuck begin a new love with this angel wing lady or anyone else So basically it s like Chuck get s f d on an island then looses his one true love and that s it Oh yeah great stuff eyes rolled,3.0,8.0,24.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1633693/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,Tom Hanks delivers...,a terrific performance Maybe I m a little shallow reading the rave reviews on here would seem to indicate so but I thought the film was about 45 minutes too long I realise it is not meant to be an action movie but for me the story was stretched too far One or two reviewers weren t sure about the ambiguous ending but I didn t mind that The way was open for Chuck to take whichever path he wanted but I like to think he would have kept in contact with the woman whose parcel saved his life,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6441221/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2002,WOW!!!,I just have two thing to say Tom Hanks is stunning in this film as he is in all his films and This film is brilliant It is so good sad and touching that it even makes a grown man cry I m sad to say that I say it with my own eyes So don t miss this film at a theater near you,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566162/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2001,"Flawed, but Good",Cast Away is a very good film I ve put off watching it for a while because many people have told me it s boring well it s not True if I had to see just ONE actor on an island for about two hours then Tom Hanks would not be my first choice but to his credit he is very good The film starts by showing us the day to day triviality of the FedEx department and their task master boss Chuck Hanks After bidding goodbye to the love of his life Kelly Helen Hunt he boards a plane Of course the plane crashes on a desert island leaving Chuck the soul survivor The Island scenes are the best of the movie Hank s everyman personality helps us identify with the character greatly he isn t skilled in action hero jungle tactics so the smallest things can create a problem making a fire for example The photography by Don Burgess is also spectacular the use of deep focus lenses letting us take in the full beauty and at times terror of the island making Chuck seem small and insignificant in the middle of this huge unknown territory Four years pass and Chuck has now become skilled in hunting for fish and now with his only companion s Wilson the Volleyball and the picture of Kelly he must make the decision to stay on the island or take the step to get home SPOILERS The problems with the film however is that Zemeckis doesn t know what to focus on sometimes he shows us Chuck experiencing things but the four years later tag that fades up on screen means we miss a great deal of interesting discoveries Chuck s suicide attempt how he s managed to figure out the months and days The tag seems lazy as though Zemeckis just couldn t be bothered to take the extra time instead rushing towards the sentimental ending This is another problem the ending just isn t handled correctly Four years has passed but Kelly just excepts Chuck like he s been gone for a couple of weeks never mind the fact that she s now married with a daughter It s up to Chuck to tell her it s over which I just didn t buy Personally I don t rate Hunt as much of an actress I think she gives the same performance in every film and this is no exception We never get a real feel for her character or their relationship prior to Chuck s crash so it s hard to feel any real pain for them I was more upset by the loss of Wilson at sea SPOILERS END It s such a pity that the ending of the film couldn t have been more satisfying because for the most part Cast Away is a fascinating and well acted drama a film not afraid to take risks Just a shame about that ending 7 10,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566051/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2001,Solitude examined,The film takes an average citizen caught up in the fast paced world and subdues him on a tiny habital island The primitive nature of the human comes out as we watch Tom Hanks learn how to survive without the means of comfort Two questions arose while I viewed Cast Away 1 What was his relationship with God 2 What about sex I would have enjoyed these two aspects of our existence analyzed than the ones presented The film could be anything I suppose pending on the character stranded Tom Hanks I feel represented the common suburbanite trapped in the rat race trying to survive a man who seems to have forgotten about what it means to be alive I would have rather seen a priest stranded or a prostitute The film deals a lot with isolation and the need to have personal contact I did not care too much for Tom hanks character He seemed bland but I guess that was the point or was it It was a nice touch with Helen Hunt s recognition of no return but can I have a hug and a deep kiss to remind me Then the finale at the crossroads Was not big on it But the film s attempt at showing how we can begin again after a long haul in the rat race succeeds and it would be nice to see if the common man woman seeking comfort with this world might open his or her eyes to an alternate way of thinking should their soul be dying The film looked nice at times Well photographed See Swept Away an Italian film by Lina Wertmuller It s stranded people are more interesting to watch,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566016/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2001,"Good film, pathetic ending.",Cast Away is good that s true I knew exactly what it would be all about even before seeing it But I still had fun And the plane crash is awesome freaky to death The moments spent on the island were purely great but the rest suffered of the Spielberg like pathetic ending Tom Hanks played his usual role but who cares He plays it well Maybe a change wouldn t be so bad Anyways his character was pretty intelligent and he reacted just like I would have reacted except for the swear words he didn t even say one F word And Zemeckis really convinced me that Tom Hanks Volley ball was his friend I even felt stupid after the movie because of that The backgrounds made me feel like I was in paradise And this film is an exception to his genre and it s a very good thing He was always alone on his island there were no stupid cannibal tribes or anything It s like Robinson Crusoe but with its own advantages and its own weak points This is surely a good movie and I m sure it will get some Academy Award Nominations because it s exactly the kind of films that will touch the heart of the judges and please to their Right to Censorship mind Most of it was a good moment but the other parts suffered of the pathetic syndrome And by the way this is not a very touching movie it won t make you cry or anything but it s very agreeable to watch And you can also interpret it as a critic to materialism Good film 7 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565520/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,An absolute Masterclass.,I have watched Cast Away a few times Story being very simple and straight forward However the direction and screenplay takes it to a completely different level All important aspects is an average human life has been beautifully visualizes Survival friendship Wilson love humility and the importance of basic necessities in life The music on top of this beauty makes your heart go even softer This movie is a complete package and a absolute lesson to the new movie directors and a treat for movie lovers and critiques,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4360746/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2001,Another solid Hanks film.,Cast Away is far from being Tom Hanks best film but still is a very good movie The best part of this movie by far is Tom Hanks great performance his best performance in a movie since Forrest Gump I believed every moment the way he acted on the island I don t know how I would act if I was stunk on an island for a period of time but like Hanks character I m sure I would act a little weird The downside to this movie is the begining and ending They weren t bad just not near as good as the middle section Also I will not give anything away but I was dissapointed the trailor did which did take some suspense away Cast Away is still clear proof that Tom Hanks can perform another type of character in the line of many that he has played well I give Cast Away an 8 out of 10,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566011/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2017,One of the greatest films,This movie is slow so if you are in a hurry watch Transformers or something However if you want to slow down and think and enjoy a cinematic epic adventure with perfect acting writing and directing This is the movie Tom Hanks is awesome Helen Hunt has a small but beautiful role I dare you to try to NOT CRY during the loss of wilson for if you can you are a better man than me,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3648729/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2014,An Exceptional Film,What would you do when faced with tragedy How would you react if you had no human interaction for a year Would you be able to make it without the amenities that we enjoy every day Would you go crazy Would you kill yourself Cast Away puts you in this situation We get to peek into a tragedy situation comfortably from home while Tom Hanks fights for his survival for us Our main character Chuck is a FedEx manager He is extremely focused on getting his job done in a timely fashion His job keeps him very busy due to his trips around the world The film picks up right before Chuck is about to take another trip While on the flight Chuck awakes to turbulence After a few minutes of struggling the plane crashes into the ocean Chuck survives by hanging on to a life raft He eventually loses consciousness and awakes on the shores of a remote island He quickly finds that there are no other inhabitants of the island and that in order to survive he is going to be pushed to his limits Cast Away explores many themes Coping with loneliness and isolation is something that is hard to display in film but is shown beautifully throughout this film The cinematography does an amazing job at getting these themes across The film features very little dialogue but you won t even notice it due to the very visually appealing sets Long shots out towards the ocean and aerial shots of the island get the points across easily Such a potentially dark premise is given a bit of light with lovable comic relief such as Wilson It is hard to find a drama that everyone in the family will enjoy equally Cast Away is no exception To get the point of the film across darker elements had to enter into the film such as suicide This isn t the movie that you bring the whole family to although mature children could handle it and most likely enjoy it Cast Away receives a 9 10 from me due to the exciting premise and unique way of telling it,9.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3099722/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2001,"Riveting, against all odds",PLOT SPOILERS WARNING You have to give it to the man Bob Zemeckis who I consider one of the best directors in Hollywood lost some of my appreciation after the dreadful Contact If even he wasn t able to save that script maybe it s because it was so bad that nobody could have but he has proved this year that he is well and truly back on track first with What Lies Beneath and now with this virtuoso tour de force To keep the spectator glued to the screen for two hours when all you have is one man and a volleyball in a deserted island is almost defying logic yet Zemeckis manages to pull it off thanks to excellent timing and rhythm a phenomenal setting where is this island I want to go there beautifully photographed and a fabulous Oscar worthy performance from Hanks again these two were made for each other portraying the amazing odyssey of endurance and self discovery of a man who had lost sight of the important things in life In fact I was enjoying it so much that I wasn t sure I wanted the poor guy to escape from the island I wanted to keep watching his adventures I loved the relationship of Chuck with his alter ego Wilson which becomes as real a character as you could wish for in fact I can think of a couple of action movie stars who could probably take acting tips from it and was truly saddened when Chuck is forced to abandon him The fact that Zemeckis could extract so much sympathy from an inanimate object a face painted on a ball reminds me of how menacing Kubrick could make a round red and yellow light look in 2001 or how much Lucas charmed us with R2 D2 s grumpy character even if we couldn t understand anything he said I also loved the fact that in keeping with his character Chuck maintained his integrity what he considered his essence at least for the first few days by not opening the boxes It did bug me a bit that when the circumstances force him to do so he left one of them unscathed to serve as a symbol a reminder of his former self and his mission in life as the note says This box saved my life I thought it was a little bit unrealistic and I was fearing some terrible but daft final revelation about it look a cellphone but in the end it turns out that what the box contains is not important Pulp Fiction style but what it represents which is not only his mission but his new future brought in by the tide If he hadn t saved it he would never had met his future partner come on did anybody really not get the hint of where he was going after the final scene Nice final touch All in all a beautiful film and a great performance by Hanks and Zemeckis They were robbed of a bunch of Oscars if you ask me,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565690/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2001,Weak but entertaining nonetheless,The plot was good but I expected a little more Robinson Crusoe and a little less mental illness This was an excellent performance by Hanks though as good as Apollo 13 when there was dialogue but for the amount of the film that was dedicated to watching Hanks in near silence the writing wasn t creative enough to show any depth to the character You liked the Hanks character mostly because of the first five minutes of the film rather than the bulk of it spent on the island And I know the escape from the island wasn t the climax of the film but they still showed too much in the trailer,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565750/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2001,Good movie with a bad ending and a little too much Fed-Ex publicity...,Cast Away is a movie that could have been very boring because of its unoriginal subject but which is very good Hanks playing his usual nice American role which he does so well gives a good performance although it probably wasn t hard to do so since this role ressembles a lot of the ones he has had in the last years The rest of the cast is not very important The movie starts off well and the plane crash is simply terrifying and shows how well Zemeckis can direct The part on the island is very entertaining and you take pleasure watching Hanks learning to live in nature The idea of making this part an almost silent movie is very good and I loved the concept of Wilson I won t tell you what it is but I will tell you it is GOOD What was bad was the fact that this movie has a truly unsatisfying ending nothing really original to offer and Fed Ex logos everywhere But it is still intelligent entertainment 74,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565759/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2001,Overblown,Cast Away doesn t even begin to live up to the hype that surrounded its theatrical release It s not a bad movie but this updated version of Robinson Crusoe would warrant little attention without a box office megastar like Tom Hanks Rating 6 stars 10,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565948/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2001,"Excellent, despite a s*it ending",Cast Away goes down as one of those films that s excellent all the way until the end There are several films that make that cut I can t think of any off the top of my head but you ll figure it out Hanks is Chuck Noland a workaholic FedEx employee who s married to his job and about to be engaged to Kelly Helen Hunt His job has him travel all around the world ensuring better FedEx services by serving as a hustling efficiency expert who shapes the offices In one ill fated night however after proposing to Kelly Chuck s plane over the Pacific goes down in a fiery storm and he s washed away to a deserted island For the next two hours Hanks finds himself surviving off his natural instincts and his smarts as he begins to salvage what he can in his life The story is remarkably smooth that fleshes out Hanks character as a decent man who s good at heart It s a chronicle of his life as he lives day by day on the island and it s actually fascinating to watch how he lives Whether it be discovering how to start a fire to gathering food we watch Noland do it all However and there won t be many people that will disagree the ending really sucks It s on a so so basis where you have absolutely no idea what happens to his character I think part of the reason why the ending isn t good is because audiences want to see Hanks character live the rest of his life and his re adjustment to society something you don t get to see much of All in all though Cast Away is a great film to watch,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565821/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2021,wonderful movie,The film is very beautiful and I received the feelings of the character in an excellent way and all this is due to the representation of the legendary Tom Hanks and I liked the way the character s feelings conflicted while he was on the island and how he suffered a lot in it The film is very emotional and touching and it deserves to be watched strongly,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7639197/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,The Shortest 2+ Hour Movie Ever?,At first glance a shipwrecked Tom Hanks growing a beard didn t sound very appealing to me Thus I was pleasantly surprised at the end of the movie Tom Hanks is terrific in this role as his depression and descent to near madness as he loses hope of escape is very empathic Interestingly enough however I found the time on the island although the core of the movie to be very short for what is supposed to be 4 years time This is a small complaint however and Tom Hanks triumph of human spirit will make anyone s day,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565911/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2001,good movie which could be much better,This review contains some spoilers nothing direct just some references I expected cast away to be an oscar winner I do not believe it is going to win an oscar after i saw it Few reasons The beginning was too long they spend 10 useless minutes at the start which can be done better The ending was very weak with no point Usually after someone thought to be dead for a long time company least going to keep his job The island part i thought was the best part i seen this year If they added more to it like him building home adapting to the environment maybe build some part where he keeps caught fish and other food you cant expect him to only eat what he catches same day If they added those parts i think it be a great movie Volleyball scenes were very good cause it kept him communicating while some think of it as insanity i believe it saved him from going insane he believed the volleyball was like a person so his decisions were based on them two more rational considerate I still think its a very well made movie just not perfected as i have come to expect from Hanks movies,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565576/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2002,I Loved this movie to death!,Cast Away was the best movie of 2000 and deserved a lot more than what some people gave it Tom Hanks went through so much trouble losing and gaining weight at times during the filming Fed Ex supervisor Chuck Noland Tom Hanks has just returned from a business trip in Russia just so he can spend Christmas with his girlfriend Kelly Frears Helen Hunt After the celebration Chuck finds out he has to go back to Russia to close a deal When he agrees he boards a plane not knowing that it ends up crashing at sea with him still inside He hops in an emergency raft and awakes the next morning to find out that he is ona deserted island He hopes every second that he will be rescued soon well it turns out that he spends 4 years on the island all by himself After 4 years of nothing but bordom Chuck decides to leave the island and head out to sea hoping he will be found Later he is found by a supply ship and is taken back to America What s weird is that when he returns everything has changed and he feels even more isolated than when he was one island Robert Zemeckis did such a brilliant job directing this movie and he should ve gotten a best director Oscar for his work on the film Cast Away was the best film I saw of the first year of the century,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566170/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2006,Another example of the excellence and diversity of Tom Hanks acting ability.,This is a movie definitely worth seeing and for myself watching about once a year I have enjoyed Tom Hanks in a number of movies this one being near the top of his list The scenery is spectacular in a confined environment His struggle and his evolution to primitive being shows the determination to live where many would simply lay down and die wallowing in their own self pity for being stranded seemingly without hope And his recovery from devastation when he realizes he has lost the love of his life for the second time shows a similarity to the persona he had to bring out simply to survive the adverse conditions in which he found himself when he crawled out of the ocean An absolutely excellent film,10.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1308660/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2016,Superb,I can t say much about this stunning movie that others haven t said before me but I did want to remark on a few memorable things The deeply portrayed emotion between Helen Hunt and Tom Hanks utterly sensitive and spellbinding The plane crash scene probably the greatest cinematography and special effects of such a scene in all of cinema Makes the shaky cam effects of TV s Mayday look like rank amateurs Also Alan Silvestri s magical haunting score Without that score it would have been a loss for the movie equally as great as when Chuck loses his one true love Sometimes you are so blown away by a movie that you can t even get up to leave the theatre and just here the composer treats us to his masterful work It washes over us like the waves on the island Beautiful,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3405404/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2001,Some very good acting,This is one of the most unusual and enjoyable movies I ve seen in a while For almost 95 of the movie there s only one actor two if you want to count a volleyball and in a way he it does become a very significant character Why did I enjoy this movie so much Tom Hanks Need I say more Ok maybe Wilson the volleyball He was pretty good too strong silent type Actor of few words Tom Hanks plays a FedEx executive sent to Russia to setup the first courier operation the country has ever seen His life revolves around the clock and following very specific rules There is no such thing as basically being on time You re on time or you re not and you better be on time He comes back from this trip and we re briefly introduced to his personal life We meet his fianc played by Helen Hunt and get a very brief glimpse of the life he leads away from FedEx Shortly after his arrival to the US he is called away again on another trip After a hasty good bye he s on the plane to his next destination We all know what happens next and basically for the rest of the movie so I m not going to go into any more detail about the story Making a movie with primarily one character in it is kind of a risky venture but this movie proved that it can be done Tom Hanks is proving why he s one of the best actors in the business with this movie It s amazing the amount of stress he puts on himself with the physical changes he goes through to make this movie look authentic There isn t a lot of dialogue either Hanks has been able to marvelously show the transformation a person goes through when isolated from the rest of society for a long period of time There are many moments in the movie where Hanks doesn t say a word but is able to communicate so much to the audience My favorite is when he s sitting on his haunches looking at the remains of a port a potty that washed up thinking of how to best use it It s a very simple scene yet Hanks is able to say so much without ever uttering a word The few weaknesses that I did see revolved around the ending I guess with a movie of this nature there are only so many ways to tie it up Either the character remains stranded on the island forever or he gets rescued They chose the latter for this movie but to me it seemed anti climatic The ending was tied up a bit neatly but they did try to incorporate a bit of a human interest into it by having a problem arise between Hanks character and Hunts character It s not overly interesting and I won t spoil it for you but trust me when I say that you will be amazed by the portion of the movie that revolves around Hanks time on the island Overall I d say this movie is definitely worth seeing on the big screen and it should be seen on a big screen There are too many quiet subtle instances that you will miss if you watch it on a TV It s worth the price of full admission,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565881/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2011,Hanks and Wilson Can Do No Wrong,Baseball Cool Ranch Doritos Tom Hanks What is more American than these three things That s what I thought Nothing Tom Hanks will forever be America s funny charming Uncle He s a guy you want to be like makes you feel better when you see him and most importantly you are sure he would like you too He s the kind of guy who could be stuck on an island with only an ugly sweater and a volleyball and you d still want to watch him do his thing And if you ve had dreams like this I know I have you re in luck because there s an entire movie with this exact premise Cast Away Chuck Noland Hanks is a hard working oft traveling FedEx honcho He s well liked and respected and all signs point to Chuck having found the woman for him in Kelly Frears Hunt It seemed like just another routine flight aboard a FedEx plane to which a smiling Chuck says to Kelly I ll be right back The rest as they say is history It as at this point that we get to see the true talents of Tom Hanks really take flight no pun intended After a truly amazing plane crash sequence this becomes Tom s movie Hanks literally transformed himself for this role gaining and then losing 50 lbs and growing his hair and beard so long it that surely made ZZ Top question their own follicle abilities After years on the island the result is a rugged fish catching shelter making fire starting tiny shorts wearing survivalist who would no doubt make Bear Grylls proud Hanks is nothing short of mesmerizing on screen As one of the most recognizable people in the world it s not easy for an actor of his stature to completely fool the audience in thinking it s somebody else on that big screen but Mr Hanks rises to the challenge again This is not Tom Hanks this is Chuck Noland A man thrown into a situation few will ever experience And in becoming Chuck Hanks has shared with us one of the greatest performances the cinema has ever seen I will not go into the specifics of what takes place on that island That is for your eyes only This is simply a great performance in a phenomenal film Go watch Cast Away Thank me later,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2474996/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2001,Hanks and Zemeckis - a winning team!,Tom Hanks is Chuck Nolan He s a FedEx manager and travels around the world His clock and his filofax are the most important things in his life besides his girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt But one day the world changes as Chuck s aeroplane crashes down on the ocean He s stranding on a lonely island And it s not Gilligan s island This is year 7 after Forrest Gump I guess it was damned hard to top it But Hanks and Zemeckis did it again Hanks gives a breath taking one man show I think it s good that he comes more and more away from his image as a comedian by playing dramatic roles He touched me deeply especially in the scenes when he is talking to Wilson the volleyball If he won t win the Oscar I can t help it Also Helen Hunt gave a very strong performance though she had only a few scenes But it also gave me something to think over Maybe that sounds a little banal now but we should be thankful for the simple things in life like having something to eat and drink good friends etc things that we don t really care about because we re too ignorant sometimes Think about it After watching this film you will see the world with different eyes,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565838/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2001,"Hanks is great throughout, the last fifteen minutes are a letdown however.",A very impressive performance by Hanks It really is quite an achievement to carry an entire movie singlehandedly Absolutely no interplay mere glances and expressions Also it was fascinating to see how engaging the island scenes were even though they were terribly low concept Hanks trying to crack open a couple of coconuts Hanks opening a bunch of boxes that washed ashore Hanks catching some fish The direction was very good indeed I was let down however by the last 15 minutes The story was completely aimless and empty and i also found it very frustrating to see how the idea of hope for the future was being enforced upon us The crash sequence deserves special mention as it had me on the edge of my chair what a terrible cliche The level of realism was astounding,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565842/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2001,An excellent piece of work,It was really intriguing to see how this film can succeed using such a basic principle A large part of the film is carried solehandedly by Hanks whereas there is no dialogue to speak of no dramatic tension in the traditional sense no score to accompany the imagery Yet Cast Away keeps us completely involved I m not exactly his greatest fan but i think Hanks is to be commended He really deserved the critical acclaim for this role I think it is terrific to see such great names Hanks Zemeckis taking these great risks in filmmaking Unfortunately I rarely see this kind of experimental filmmaking in mainstream hollywood The film s ending leaving us a bit puzzled perhaps the story could have been resolved in a better way and i never cared much for Helen Hunt however all in all this is still a great piece of work The plane crash sequence deserves special mention as it is truly spectacular as well as frighteningly real,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565689/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2016,A pure masterpiece!,How did Tom Hanks do it First of all I wanted to say that the emotional quality of this film was impeccable Chuck Noland is played brilliantly by Tom Hanks to be honest I believe he brought unmatchable emotion to this film Well Wilson is a volleyball who is a great addition to the film You must be thinking how is a volleyball a important part of a film I will tell you this now you have to watch the film to feel what the volleyball brings Obviously the graphical quality might not be up to the flabbergasting quality it is at today as the film was made in 2000 though it is fine and shouldn t be discarded for its age For a film shot a number of years back it still could get a high scoring box office taking Of course Tom Hanks is a great actor and has starred in numerous films but being able to talk to a volleyball and mean so much pure emotion is a wow factor for this film I would definitely recommend this film to anybody who is an adventure movie fan What a masterpiece of a film,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3421636/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2000,Untimely ending,Movies like Cast Away which center on someone trapped in a hostile environment are all about timing There must be adequate time for us to get to know the character before he embarks on his adventure but not too much time or we feel the director is delaying the inevitable The time the character spends in isolation must be just right Too little and we don t feel the depth of despair the character feel too long and we get antsy And the resolution must also be timed perfectly If it happens too quickly it seems too easy too long and we begin to feel exhausted along with the main character Director Zemeckis times Cast Away perfectly Throw in an amazing plane crash scene and an Oscar worthy performance by Tom Hanks and you have a good film Good but not great Zemeckis sets Hanks up as a time obsessed Fed Ex executive We want to see Hanks obsession with time change but we don t get a clear payoff that it does The movie ends on an ambiguous note leading us to question which way Hanks will literally head It s a question best resolved but it isn t here,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566147/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2001,The return of the silent film (sort of),Warning this may contain spoilers If you watch the current trailer for Cast Away you might go in expecting this Indiana Jones style exotic action adventure film Dreamworks is selling something they re not delivering on which is a mistake No matter how good the film is many viewers are going to feel duped I didn t Yes it moved slower than I thought it would That s only because I ve come to expect differently from a major studio Films that seem to have a lot at stake tend to worry too much about the audience feeling things like bored and impatient The result is a rushed story that ends up disappointing anyway Cast Away actually trusts its audience That s why at the end I really felt like applauding I d just been shown something great and meaningful Except to my surprise no one else clapped I am by nature shy so I let the opportunity pass I can t say I blame anyone either There is so much bad filmmaking out there and people see so many films so when a film of true quality surfaces people don t recognize it Quality work is so rare it becomes unfamiliar What this means is that Cast Away probably won t be a huge success unfortunately Why Well because it s gulp too good I ve read that the concept was Tom Hanks idea who produces and plays Chuck Noland the film s subject But the greatness of this movie really begins with its script by William Broyles I certainly hope enough people in the Academy will recognize this Probably not because it s not flashy It doesn t contain a lot of great dialogue It isn t really even that clever But Broyles does the most difficult thing a writer has to do which is tell a story that doesn t need words I m waiting for the day a director makes a silent movie that a major distributor takes a chance on The motion picture medium was created without spoken words in mind Cast Away could be a Christmas present to the hearing impaired I believe they would see the exact same story as anyone else with no subtitles The words Broyles does write are great They do what they re supposed to do stay out of the way Many people who see this will wonder what happened to the score There is one somewhere but it doesn t show up very often For good reason director Robert Zemeckis who s managed to make both one of the year s worst films What Lies Beneath and one of the year s best uses music sparingly The lack of music especially during the island portion of the film is just as effective as the best John Williams composition would have been For this entire island portion of the film interrupted only briefly when Chuck sets sail on his raft of tree branches all we hear are the natural sounds of the island and one man s voice Hanks has already won two Oscars Now he s grown even further as an actor This is such a huge role I mean the guy IS the movie The odds of him not winning a third Oscar are slim no pun intended True the most demanding portion of the role is spent talking to a volleyball named Wilson This is one part of the film that really sticks with you the image of a face painted in blood on a piece of sports equipment For four odd years Chuck is able to keep his body alive through sheer human ingenuity But it won t mean a thing if his mind doesn t survive as well That s why he creates Wilson Many viewers will think Chuck is going insane On the contrary it s merely survival It may be the most powerful performance by an inanimate object ever Cast Away makes you think about a lot of things Chuck s life before he was stranded on the island was controlled by time and technology He has so little time he uses things like pagers and cell phones just to keep his relationships alive He s also a trainer for Fed Ex so as with most of today s professions he relies heavily on the advances in technology that human beings have made When we watch him find ways to survive upon being stranded and completely isolated it s only then we see what a human being is truly capable of THIS is how far we ve come as a species It s a not so subtle point the film makes very well The most important thing that the film has to teach is so great That thing is this sometimes the only way to know what you re really living for is to have everything taken away Only then will you know what you want returned to you All Chuck wants back is his girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt When Chuck returns to find that the world has moved on without him that the love of his life has moved on without him the true test of survival begins Chuck is now a phantom He wonders if he even has a place in the world anymore But how many of us feel that way without the benefit of being stranded on a tropical island alone for four years And there it is Extraordinary applause Grade A,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565519/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2001,Pretty Good ( contains story + spoilers),Castaway is a good movie I just came back from the cinema with my friend and we both liked Castaway Both of us like Tom Hanks so this was not surprising The story The FedEx worker Chuck Noland Tom hanks is very lucky with his girlfriend and with his job But after a plane crash he is the only survivor and comes to an island anywhere in the Southern Pazifik But he finds none on that island He tries to manage himself with the few things he has a volleyball named Wilson that is almost as lovable as the mouse of The Green Mile a pair of skates a few videotapes a rubber boat and some clothes to wear There is no plane finding him on that island because they thought that they are 100 miles north of him He stays on that island for four years and then he constructs a raft out of wood He takes his volleyball and a door of the plane to get off there On the sea he loses his friend Wilson but then he is rescued by a ship Arrived in Memphis again he gets to know that his ex girlfriend has a husband since she thought that Chuck was dead Delivering a package that he has not open yet he finds himself at a crossroads where he has to make a choice between going west north south or east and to start a new life there Tom Hanks is as good as always maybe this will be his third oscar none can understand why Saving Private Ryan was not But my personal fav is Russell Crowe for Gladiator The ending of Castaway is a bit too long I think but the scene with the crossroads is good and meaningful Maybe it is a clich but who cares I don t There three two bad things in this movie the sudden impact before the plane crash the lines Four years later and Four weeks later They do not belong there were they belong I think it was a bad idea to film at first the first 10 days on the island and then the last week I should have been more lengthy But there are also some good moments the loss of Wilson the ending and the crossing ship This is definitely not Tom Hanks best movie All his big films are better Saving Private Ryan Sleepless in Seattle Forrest Gump Philadelphia But it is a good one All in all I rated this movie 8 10 and recommend it to fans of Tom Hanks or to guys who liked Six Days Seven Nights although that has been more a comedy If you have any questions feel free to ask them,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565758/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,"Mr. ""The World on Time"" gets his clock cleaned.",POSSIBLE SPOILER REGARDING MOVIE SCORE Just coming back from seeing this movie on Christmas Day I think Tom Hanks has another Oscar nomination coming One of the most interesting things is that there is absolutely no movie score or other music for the first 75 minutes of a 143 minute film It works Music would get in the way Hanks is a FedEx motivator for problem offices The film opens with him telling Moscow workers that wasting time is a sin and unforgivable all the while starting the official office timer which counts down the time remaining before the truck has to leave to take the packages to the airport We also learn that Hanks one time stole he claims borrowed a bicycle to get a package to its destination on time A trick he uses to pressure the employees is that he sends himself a package from Memphis TN his home and FedEx HQ to Moscow It s a digital timer running It shows 87 hours lapsed Hanks yells at the employees that that is disgraceful It is ironic and to me very satisfying that Mr The World on Time not only gets his clock cleaned but his world turned upside down and is cosmically told Here make sense of THAT The comic strip Sally Forth attributed to FedEx this trend and corresponding time pressure and called it artificial urgency How many things are done just in time more accurately know as at the last minute not because it is necessary but because the capability is there There are a few people I know worshippers of just in time who I think should be cast away as a lesson,0.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565482/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,such wonders,In many ways Cast Away reminds me very much of another very good Robert Zemeckis film Contact Both of them had endings that were somewhat disappointing as one person I heard said it about Contact I waited three hours to see the aliens and they re her freaking father Cast Away s ultimate conclusion was even more ambiguous and troubling but that does not keep it from being an enthralling and interesting film and one of the ten best movies of the year just as Contact was enthralling and interesting and one of the ten best movies of its year In short Hanks plays Chuck Noland a gung ho Fedex supervisor trouble shooter slave driver who travels the world licking troubled Fedex centers into shape He loves Kelly Frears Helen Hunt a Ph D student close to finishing her dissertation On Christmas Eve and on the eve he was to propose marriage he is sent on a flight to Asia The plane goes off course and then down in an incredibly gripping sequence Noland No land even his name has meaning in this film is the only survivor and he washes ashore onto an isolated rock in the middle of the Pacific with nothing to survive with He salvages his raft the survival kit and flares went down with the plane and some Fedex packages that wash ashore and sets up camp The bulk of the film is made up of Hank s attempts to survive on the island primarily in two episodes how he acclimatizes and learns to survive and then four years later when he at last has a chance to get off the island The script is really remarkably well done considering that Hanks has no one to speak to for the bulk of the film although he does create a friend out of a volleyball with whom he converses The Fedex packages that wash ashore at first seem worse than useless but their uses are very clever and hidden Noland does all of the things you think of doing yourself often at the same time you are reaching the same conclusions although I have to say he s many times more resourceful than I I would have died on that island The drama of surviving and Hanks abilities as an actor to keep everything human are engrossing Noland s island is a forbidding spit of sand and rock way out somewhere and there is no man Friday to help this Robinson Crusoe Every problem he has from making fire to dealing with a rotting tooth with no anesthetic and no tools are dealt with in a straightforward and realistic fashion Zemeckis s direction is outstanding The crash scene is tense frightening and incredibly well done so well done it deserves mention more than once Zemeckis and his cinematographer strand Hanks on an island that they show is both amazingly beautiful and also barren and desolate Hanks buddy Wilson the volleyball is handled so well by the director and the script that Hanks constant banter with it makes you begin to understand how he relies on the volleyball to keep his sanity while at the same time imparting the feeling that the ball really is talking back somehow Noland s escape from the island is also very well done and this should be no spoiler to anyone who has seen a commercial for the film that gives this part away The bittersweet reunification with Hunt s Frears is effective and Hanks has a wonderful speech at the close of the film that encapsulates the film s theme about the powerlessness and hopelessness we sometimes feel in life and the importance of tides Then it maybe goes on a little too long and leaves with a totally ambiguous and unfulfilling ending Oh well I ll only have to watch this one nine more times before I m sick of it Nine out of ten Laughing Lion says go check it out,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565630/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2000,"Very good, avoids most expected pitfalls",This was a very satisfying movie and Tom Hanks once again shows that he is a fine choice for serious treatments of characters who are alone isolated one way or another I should mention that my comments wil l focus on several plot points so SPOILER ALERT as if the trailers left much out The Setup The movie takes planty of time to show that Hanks character is a type A go getter always zipping around the world no time for anything addicted to his cell phone and pager This makes the isolation and barren local of the island good for the producers that they found a truely tiny one as made clear from Hanks first peek from the summit a perfect contrast Some other user comments complained that there was not enough action in the film but teenagers apparently miss concept that it is the boredom and isolation that is the whole point The interest comes from how he will use his native resourcefulness to cope The Crash there were two aircraft disasters the storm and the explosion and that one would have been sufficient Obviously the storm is required so that the crash will take place far away from where the searchers will eventually look The explosion is required so that the plane crashes The storm cannot account for the crash since the pilots have gone around the worst of it as they would really do and this film is trying to be realistic Same with the explosion these things DO happen as we know from ValueJet The crash seems pretty realistic and the floating pieces or wreckage are consistant with real plane ditchings My only beef is that the jet engine would almost certainly NOT still be running The Homelife Some have complained that the happenings back home are not shown concurrently with Hank s island vacation The movie does it right Hanks is the character we see the film through and he obviously has no idea whats going on elsewhere We find things out when he does once again realistic The Unopened Package Beside setting up the final scene this makes some kind of sense for Hanks to leave at least one FedEx parcel alone His whole personality is based on getting packages to their owners in a speedy and reliable manner It was clear to me from the situation and setup of the scene that Hanks views the final package as a reason to survive He needs to get at least one through in the end Also pay close attention to the scene in the beginning where the package from Texas is delivered to an obvious American in Moscow who is cheating on his wife Pay close attention at the end where Hanks arrives to deliver the unopened package notice the change in the sign at the ranch There is really very little left to doubt here The Fed Ex Placement According to articles the producers wanted authenticity and a sense of reality for their film They felt that they needed a real cargo carrier not a made up one UPS said no they don t like people thinking about packages lost in a crash FedEx said yes but was reportedly not paid for this nor did they pay the producers This does not then qualify as the usual product placement that Hollywood indulges in Overall a well thoughout and realized movie for serious viewers,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565531/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2001,Amazing and not boring,Cast Away in spite of the long part with Tom Hanks solo is excellent I was a bit afraid of this being dull but it wasn t that way He has proven again that nowadays he s one of the best actors Too bad he has relented and made forgettable movies like Forrest Gump a crying shame for an actor of his level WARNING Possible spoilers Not that the plot is something new essentially harks back to Robinson Crusoe s days If we except the time reference but the film is pretty good The scenes of the plane being blown by the storm are quite realistic The parts on the island are good as well especially when he talks to that little ball he has named Wilson and when he finally succeeds in making a fire and celebrates it by singing Come on baby light my fire To me the only downside is As some other people have commented here the fact of having used the product placement device with FEDEX They could have used a bit of imagination and come up with a invented name but they didn t Helen Hunt shines again though her appearance is brief Ten out of ten,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565963/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2001,This movie should be cast away.,I was warmly looking forward to this movie since I love the ocean and I generally enjoy Tom Hanks movies such as Forrest Gump and Sleepless in Seattle Unfortunately I was very disappointed in Cast Away The movie opened with a variety of global snippets creating a sense of speed and excitement After a while and a few borrowed scenes from airplane disaster movies of the 70s we found Hanks in a predictable marooned situation on a tropical isle doing all of the things we would expect finding water food shelter The plot drearily and ploddingly followed each step of the way The only freshness and creativity was the introduction of the new star Wilson I admittedly cried when Dumbo s mother was locked up in the Disney movie Dumbo but I just couldn t get into this Wilson thing in Cast Away I was dry eyed the whole way through Call me crass call me hard hearted but I never cried for poor enigmatic Wilson Perhaps my greatest disappointment was the movie virtually ignoring a gut wrenching issue throughout 95 of the film Sure Hanks was lonely on a deserted island but what about his love interest Helen Hunt She faced a very difficult issue give Chuck Noland Hanks up for dead and start a new life or cling to the chance that he might still be alive Watching a great actress like Hunt grapple with this tough decision fraught with emotional drama and trauma would have been much more interesting than watching Hanks fishing and losing weight And what is more relevant to most of us getting cast on a deserted isle or having a loved one disappear kidnapped killed a runaway The questions facing Hunt were by far the most relevant and engaging ones to be touched and indulged by the film Alas it was not to be Helen Hunt s role was almost a cameo in comparison to Hanks And for the little time she had she should be given the Charlie McCarthy award for the wooden delivery of her lines Strangely and sadly Wilson was the best supporting actor in this movie I give Cast Away a 4 only for the upcoming star Wilson and for the island and ocean surf which actually were quite lovely By the way the symbolism of the crossroads was lame too,4.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565965/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,Great Movie.,Might contain spoilers Great Movie Need more be said Hopefully this one will nail a few Oscars since the competition is very light weight this year In my opinion the best movie since Fight Club A truly great story about the triumph of the human spirit This movie is seperated in to four acts The first is the set up where Noland becomes a person to us we know who he is and understand what his life is about The second act is his first couple of months on the island where he starts learning the key to survival with out modern tools or technology The third act is him four years later where we find him the master of his domain and his leaving on the raft The fourth act is him when he returns home and finds things much different than they were before We see that he feels like a Cast Away again because of what happens while he was gone The best part of the movie is Noland while he is on the Island Without any musical score we feel isolated on this small island We get to see him show what it could be like to really be stranded My two favorite parts are 1 where he finds the dead man and buries him and 2 When he writes on the rock if anyone ever shows up there again Truly great moments If I ran the Oscars I d say Best Picture and Best Actor But it won t happen BTW Wilson Rules,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565470/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2001,Good adventure,Cast Away is a good adventure film but had a pretty predictable plot line The plot line was the only disappointment that I got from the film The presentation of the story was good and it had its comical moments I also liked that it showed the difficulties of going from civilization to a cave man existence Over all good film 7 out of 10,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565988/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2000,An involving story of survival.,For FedEx manager Chuck Noland played by Tom Hanks time is everything It s the unforgiving taskmaster that enforces order in his life and adhering to that order making sure packages get where they have to be when they have to be there gives Chuck a sense of control a false sense it turns out It s not until his FedEx plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific stranding him alone on a deserted island that Chuck is forced to confront the difficult truth that we all are merely at the mercy of the ebb and flow of fate This involving examination of how a modern man stripped of his pager and cell phone might react if left to survive on his own in the wild comprises the premise of Cast Away Being alone on screen for nearly an entire film would be an immense challenge for any actor but Hanks proves he s more than up to the task The actor also deserves extra kudos for his dedication Production on the movie halted for a year while Hanks shed 55 pounds and grew a long beard for the movie s second half which takes place four years after he was originally stranded Guys with two Academy Awards who make 25 million a picture don t have to do that sort of thing Helen Hunt is also very good as the girlfriend Chuck leaves behind As bleak as Cast Away can be in its darker moments the film does leave us with an uplifting message it s the philosophy that ultimately motivates Chuck to survive One tide of fate may land you on a deserted island but the next tide might just deliver you home,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565462/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2001,Very good movie!!,Before I saw this all of my friends were telling me how great that it was I had nothing to do so I decided to see it I mean Tom Hanks has never been in a bad movie and Robert Zemekis is a good director I was not disapointed I think that this is one of the best movies of the year The movie starts out good and keeps getting better till the end Some people said that the movie was too long but I disagree I think that it was the perfect length any longer would have been boring and any shorter and there would have been something left out Also some people didn t like the ending but I thought that it fit perfectly at what Chuck Tom said earlier in the film I really recomend that everyone sees this It a really good movie that I think everyone will enjoy After this I am going to get a volleyball and name it Wilson hehehe just kidding 10 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565699/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2001,Survivor movie,Cast Away is in fact a good movie A man all alone in an island trying to survive there are quite few movies about that The movie is slow even when Hanks character isn t on the island and that s a real problem if there is almost no dialogue in most of the movie But Tom Hanks did it very well specially his insane dialogue with Wilson I think Cast Away is the perfect movie to watch on a DVD but too slow to be seen in the big screen 6 10,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565735/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2000,Are there two Cast Away Movies ?,Either I have lost my mind or there are two movies called Cast Away and the people who gave it 8 stars saw the other one or they have lost their minds Explain to me someone please how it is that an Oscar winning actor gets involved in a mess of a movie like this one Was it for the money As virtually the only actor in it did he get the entire acting purse of 3 trillion dollars and a promise of all the cream filled donuts he could eat for life Otherwise surely he would rather have died in the plane crash early on the only good moment Perfect Storm meets Airplane 17 than appear in the credits of yet one more movie written and produced by People Who Have Had Their Brains Removed or Lost Them on the Cutting Room Floor Hanks is a great actor but there is a limit to how long you can watch even him rub sticks together to make fire or talk to a volleyball Through a deadly awkward sub title we are informed that Hanks s character apparently did this for four years it certainly felt a good deal longer But matters worsened when he returned to the enthralling offices of Fedex and engaged in conversations which proved that if you dedicate your life to getting parcels there on time you cause yourself severe cerebral damage His best friend s wife has died of cancer Hanks says I should have been there I am sorry I should have been there He doesn t go on to say Indeed I would have been there if I my plane hadn t crashed in the Pacific Ocean His friend could at least have said don t worry Tom I understand why you didn t make it SPOILERS AHEAD Hanks returns and his beloved s new husband meets him and says Hi remember me I once gave you root canal treatment This must go down as one of the all time greats alongside Hamlet saying to Laertes in Act Five Hi remember me I once resprayed the side panels of your Dodge Durango or Jesus to Barabas Hi remember me Each of these nails they re putting in was hand turned on a lathe and coated with an environmentally friendly anti oxidant Or maybe the implication was but that s nothing to what I m going to do to you now He meets his beloved and she a makes him a coffee b tells him she has a big mortgage or her husband has a big mortgage or a big something else which is why she fell for him he is after all Mr Big from Sex in a Cargo Plane and then cheers up the hopelessly depressed Hanks the dime had dropped as to the movie he had gotten himself into by telling him she hung on to his car after he died and look here it is At this Hanks forgets about falling forty thousand feet into the ocean and spending the best years of his life communing with stones and becomes as happy as any Walmart shopper stumbling across a bargain I have to admit that was the moment when I expected the oxygen masks to fall from the ceiling and save us when they didn t I had to make a break for the air outside So I don t know what happened at the very end But there could be no miracle great enough to redeem this cynical movie Hanks had better be careful what kind of project he attaches himself to next brand names degrade with misuse faster than Fedex,2.0,4.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565549/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2001,Disappointed!,Tom Hanks performance was excellent but the movie was boring I m not sure what the message was Cast Away offered little action and not much entertainment and certainly no message Helen Hunt s role was minimal at best She did a good acting job but overall Cast Away is insignificant Wait for the video,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565719/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2011,"Review of ""Cast Away""",Robert Zemeckis Cast Away is a movie that is not only a revolutionary piece of film but it is as poignant and affecting as they come One of the most interesting and often unsung aspects of Cast Away is that Zemeckis and his crew basically crafted this movie on the fly and during production In fact the whole concept of Wils on The Volleyball was not conceived until about halfway through shooting Another interesting aspect of the film is that a very large portion of it has no dialogue yet it still remains highly entertaining experience Much of the film s complexity comes from the incredibly moving performance as Chuck Noland a FedEx engineer who is tragically separated from everything he loves Which leads me to another point and possibly my favorite aspects of Cast Away the themes conveyed The movie is deeply driven by the central idea that life can be cruel and unforgiving thing but that shouldn t stop us from pursuing something better This theme is accentuated to an enormous degree by the movies soundtrack by Alan Silvestri Though the soundtrack is absent throughout most of the first half of this movie the movie s main theme is slowly introduced towards the end of the film It s a very solemn musical piece that effectively illustrates the pain the Chuck Noland experiences throughout the movie but it also presents a sort of hopeful tone to the film In the end I feel that Cast Away presents a number of innovative and impressive techniques that ultimately make it a perfect film,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444561/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,"Great acting, dopey script",Cast Away is sure to nab another Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks and in a relatively weak year for film he may just win his third He would deserve it and not just for his physical transformation Any other actor in the world would get laughs if they recited the dopey dialogue or monologue I guess since he s alone on that island I can t imagine Ralph Finnes being taken seriously if he proclaimed I have made fire but Hanks somehow pulls it off You may be aware that the studio moronically gives away the ending in the trailers and commercials it is inexcusable and blunts much of the emotion of the situation This is a solid film with a fascinating second and third acts but a flat footed fourth act They paint themselves into a corner with no satisfactory ending and then fail to come up with a satisfactory conclusion But with Hanks acting and Zemeckis eye popping direction this film is very satisfying,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565552/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2000,Tom Hanks is brilliant,Cast Away 1 2 Cast Away is very close to brilliance Tom Hanks is an excellent actor and he gets to prove that in this movie Also there is some beautiful scenery The movie is about Tom Hanks character who is a Fed Ex man getting lost on a deserted island He is on a Fed Ex plane and it goes down Some of the mail washed up on shore A volley ball named Wilson befriends him It was very neat seeing how he did things He made shoes and fire and other stuff that you need to see the movie for I would go crazy on the island He occasionally does but maintains sanity for the most part Before he left to get on the plane he had a girlfriend whom he loved She is played by Helen Hunt She isn t in the movie much which is sort of a disapointment Tom Hanks is brilliant He is a great actor who has a lot of talent He makes the movie work Showing off his acting skills and making it look easy This must have been a difficult film to make But through all that his talent keeps going on The reason I did not award it four stars is the ending It was vague All dramas end that way but this was unclear There were so many possibilities Oh well The island that the movie was based on was beautiful Throughout the movie it is a feast for the eyes Great scenery In closing the movie is all around brilliant Just try and ignore the ending,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565669/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2006,Another good Hanks movie,Tom Hanks is an interesting actor Or rather the reactions he provokes are interesting There are those who love him and those who scratch their heads wondering why he has achieved such extraordinary success in his career He is after all quite ordinary He is not a great actor though not a particularly bad one His main claim to fame seems to be his unfailing ability to generate sympathy from the audience for the characters he plays You always like Hanks in his film roles Varied as they are that s quite an achievement And it is based on that very ordinariness that many of us seem to find perplexing Cast Away is a very good example of this Hanks has to hold the attention of the audience for the bulk of the film as he is the only human character on screen The vast inescapable power of the ocean and the primitive beauty of the island vie with him for that attention but come off worst He is certainly not the only actor who could pull this off but it is still a neat trick and there were certainly many who felt in the run up to the launch of the film that this would be the one that finally found him out as a rather average talent It does no such thing He slowly draws you into the predicament of his character and persuades you to suspend the cynicism that might make you question a number of the events in the plot And true to form he has you firmly on his side at all the most critical moments The direction and photography both help to sustain the illusion of what you are seeing and the plot though faintly ridiculous has enough meat in it to allow the drama to play out Though the period of isolation on the island is the main body of this film one of the more interesting aspects for me was the way the character inter acted with the real world Without giving anything away there is a deeply emotional thread to this story about an intense personal relationship that is destroyed by cruel events and this I found to my surprise provided some of the most impressive scenes towards the end of the film Rating Cast Away was for me a decision between 7 and 8 I went for 8 in the end perhaps generously because it is basically a feel good movie which works You should not watch it expecting much more than that Few deep human questions are asked here and when reviewing the plot after the film has finished you conclude that even as it held your attention at the time it was in fact quite formulaic Nevertheless it is as I said another classic Tom Hanks movie And these have become almost a genre in themselves If you like The Terminal The Ladykillers Sleepless in Seattle and You ve Got Mail you ll enjoy this film too essentially for the same reason the star himself,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1381662/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2006,An Otherwise Trivial Mistake in Physics Derates this Film for Me,I do like Tom Hanks He puts in a fine acting stint here almost a tour de force But why don t movie makers especially Directors take remedial classes in Basic Physics Usually I am quite forgiving of trivial mistakes but this one in Cast Away rather spoiled the entire film for me As the doomed FedEx jet heads in what appears to be a damned steep dive into the Pacific Ocean our hero is facing the cockpit watching through the pilot s window the ocean s surface rapidly approaching At impact any non secured object e g our hero would experience with the plane s interior as our reference system a tremendous acceleration FORWARD basic Physics i e towards the water Yes virtually instantly accelerated to maybe 125 150 mph depending on how fast the jet was moving This would quite quickly be followed by a similar DEceleration as this moving thing our hero hit some immovable object e g the pilot s window now buried in the water But these basic laws of Physics apparently do NOT apply to our hero he gets propelled BACKWARDS at a velocity that is definitely not death dealing All the other guys in the plane die probably due to that instant acceleration deceleration but NOT our hero I tend to rate movies highly I can watch over and over again I just can t watch this one more than once at least until maybe a month goes by Our hero s suffering is just too darned interminable Sigh,6.0,0.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1437222/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2000,"A surprise, then a letdown",Before I saw this film I thought to myself that they could not possibly make an interesting movie with the majority of the movie being himself alone After seeing it the film proved me wrong Cast Away was powerful far beyond my expectations of it However I enjoyed it because I set low expectations for it The movie does have a lot of letdowns which I will focus on instead of the predictable plot that the film somehow turns interesting First is the movie s intentional way of not using any music during Tom Hanks whole stay at the island Although I am aware that the producers meant for this to symbolize the loneliness of being stranded I feel that the lack of music played a bigger role in reducing the passion and interest of the film Second and THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER I was very disappointed at the end because the lone unopened package during his stay was left unopened Tom Hanks delivered the package and just left Now the film sort of developed in a way as if to say that the package held some very valuable contents so I had been eagerly awaiting to see what was inside I know it was his job to deliver the package but a much better way of ending the film is to deliver it and then see the person open it In the end this is still a worthwhile film,6.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565545/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2001,A good film. Worth the journey,I like Tom Hanks I like him in this film I usually enjoy Zemeckis films I enjoyed this film a lot The best part is indeed the stranded on an island part Hanks is no superman just a reasonably intelligent guy who got lucky Lucky to survive a landing on water which for big jets is usually fatal and lucky to be washed across the reef and onto an island Lucky also to be able to survive significant puncture wounds that would kill most people through infection You have to have a strong constitution to survive daily contact with a coral reef It looks so peaceful and beautiful but it is very dangerous the book Castaway by Lucy Irvine is a good read and may well have been an inspiration to Hanks and company The boat escape from the island was pure drama getting over the big wave was such a thrill Remainder of the film was not that interesting but I thought the ending was effective I gave it a 9 out of 10 stars and I would be glad to see it again,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565623/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2015,Wilson!,Cast Away is a movie about a man who is going on a business trip when a storm storm crashes his plane He make his way to a remote island by holding onto wreckage and he wakes up to realize his lonely state Chuck Noland Tom Hanks is in no way prepared for the task of surviving out in the wild Chuck realizes that it doesn t really matter how prepared he is because he is now in a situation where he either learns quick or he dies We see him go from white collar business man to shirtless survivor man Chuck is desperately trying to survive and get rescued from this island so he can get home to his lover He will stop at nothing to get home to her and for her company that he so desperately desires His loneliness almost leads to his insanity which Hanks manages to make very comical actually I really believe that Tom Hanks is one of only a very few actors in the world who could have pulled this role off so brilliantly For about 98 of the movie Hanks is the only actor on screen but it wouldn t really matter if there were other actors present anyway Hank s performance is so great that all the viewer s focus would be on him regardless Cast Away is a movie about a man trying to live and dealing with the loneliness of living on an island by himself Tom Hanks at the top of his game 8 10,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207659/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2002,A pretty good movie.,This movie was pretty good I actually found the time Hanks was on the island alone to be the most interesting I found myself getting transformed to the island Hanks is one of the few actors that could keep you interested with very little dialogue The movie really lost my interest when Hanks is rescued From then on the movie relies on standard cliches I didn t care for the way the movie ended but I wasn t as interested in the movie by the time it ended It s not Hanks best work but it was still a good movie I was disappointed that Wilson didn t even get a nomination as Best Supporting Athletic Sports Equipment I give the movie a 6 out of 10 stars,7.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566080/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2005,I'm not one to give out a ten; however . . .,The Oscar goes to Russell Crowe Honestly the only man that could have beaten Hanks or at least could have contended with him no pun intended did Gladiator was amazing as was Crowe but come on How much dialogue did Hanks have And yet three hours felt no more than a breezy and tight hour and a half movie Simply amazing Hanks was just plain fat to start this movie and admits it was done purposely He and Helen Hunt make an abnormal couple initially a bit awkward but solid acting by both makes it very very real rather quickly Frears reluctance amidst Noland s patience in union ironically because it is usually the other way around gives substance to their relationship Both are passionate individuals who want each other more that they need each other I believe they love each other Chuck s best friend in the movie is very sincere and earnest Hanks realizes how time obsessed he is with his job then realizes he has let his best friend down He has an inability to really offer emotional support That gets tested and amazingly and intimately delved into later in the film During Christmas Noland s job calls him and one of the most amazing wreckage scenes in terms of believably and realism not morbidness ensues leaving Chuck to float aimlessly like his structured life to a deserted island A simple idea already used however Hanks is outstanding here His first instincts are pretty natural for he is not trying to survive but merely hold over We see him slowly give up hope of being rescued and turn over to staying alive Noland finds some FedEx pieces and they literally figuratively and emotionally keep him alive but for how long Isolation is a killer and that is where Hanks co star comes in Hanks goes from outstanding to who will beat me for an Oscar which was Crowe of course Time passes and Chuck s exterior is concurrent with time elapsed including the makeup Chuck s sun lesions to his bleached hair gives Hanks tremendous grit and believable desperation Noland s mind remains very sharp and trivia on this site allow for some of the implausibilities but certainly not impossibilities from taking this movie down a notch Also it is obvious Chuck is knowledgeable learns continuously through observation and travels enough that observation seems to occur quite a bit The best part is when Chuck is forced to give us backfill It is an organization tool that doesn t detach or break up the movie My credit is to Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for keeping this movie sharp until the end The whole crew was meticulous and brilliant as seen in the making of special at the end of the movie The beauty of the island of spiritually of fate through choice is all explored here And personally only Tom Hanks could have done it which is the definition of Oscar,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1142026/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2001,Liked it a lot,This is a great movie and Tom Hanks deserves much praise for it His acting is excellent and his physical transformation very impressive Helen Hunt s performance was sort but especially in the second part very good I think the movie was very realistic in the scenes of Tom on the island overall the movie works well,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565698/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2000,Hollywood gets existential,A much smarter movie than I had expected subversive modernism doesn t usually come out of big budget filmmaking The main character begins by teaching capitalism to Muscovites and ends by chasing Texan artists That s quite a journey And by the way Helen Hunt was perfect as Ms Convention when offered what she really wanted her only response was I m terrified Hank s loss of weight is only one of the more obvious metaphors about losing fear like floating on a raft on the sea,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565501/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2002,"I really, really liked this movie.",Wow Another well deserved Oscar nomination for Tom Hanks Most of this movie is with no dialogue just Hanks expressions And aren t they one of the best expressions the movie industry has ever seen This movie is great It makes you think makes you wonder What would you do if you literally lost EVERYTHING and EVERYONE whoever meant anything to you within just a few minutes This is what it s about One man s desire to live his struggle to survive The hope that one day he will make it through all this strengthened by his love for a woman who s face in a photo is the only human face he ll see for years His loneliness only adds to his desperation so much so that he befriends a volleyball Wilson which he paints a face on with his blood and talks to all day No replies in return but just having it there is the only thing keeping him from going totally insane Great performance from Helen Hunt too although her role was short If you haven t seen this go and rent it Excellent excellent movie,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566212/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2004,Smart and breathtaking!,Wow what an amazing movie Wow what amazing acting Robert Zemeckis is definately still one of my favourite directors The script is extremely smart except some little things and well written Cinematography is awesome so are the special effects Well in some places you see how Tom was copied onto the background eg ship going by the raft The three scenes that amazed me most are the airplane crashdown I sat there and held my breath the first time Tom climb up the big rock and looks down and the scene where he meets Helen again This movie s simply excellent A class of its own in its genre Worth watching and watching over again even just for Hanks acting My ratings acting 10 10 tom hanks story 9 10 directing 9 10 cinematography 9 10 special effects 7 5 10 drama 7 10 My overall rating 9 10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE WHO APPRECIATES PERFECT ACTING,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566262/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2012,An obvious advert for Fed-Ex,Just because it has Tom Hanks in it does not mean I m going to give it 10 10 For no reason at all the door of a delivery plane rips off and Tom ends up stranded on a remote island for years after the plane crashes into the ocean using plane debris and washed up packages in order to survive Of the washed up packages there is one that he reserves and when we come to the end of the movie as he gets back to America he delivers this one package hinting that no matter what Fed Ex will deliver your parcel even if the delivery guy was stranded on a remote island for years I really wasn t into this movie at all it just wasn t appealing to me Watching a guy living in a small cave talking to a volley ball and no background music just wasn t my idea of a movie,5.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2691869/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2000,A perfect exegesis of the existential plight of man.,This movie beautifully confronts the attentive viewer with the essential challenge of existence We are alone and we must each find a reason to live and a means to do so Tom Hanks is outstanding as he has been before in the role of everyman And the film doesn t wimp out with a happy neat all is resolved ending much to Roger Ebert s consternation,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565567/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2001,"Might have been a good movie, had they bothered to finish it.",I just wasted a chunk of my life watching this horrible awful movie I enjoyed the survivalist mode of him being on the island but that should ve become the focus of the movie and then they could ve ended it when he gets found by the ship But no we have to try and make it a character movie or it s a mystery movie Since they never really showed much characterization of Hanks character before it s really hard to say how his character was impacted apart from the run of the mill love lost and moved on cliche Then let s look at the mystery of what was that package Sorry no answer there Not important you say Then see my characterization gripe I d go into more but I m not going to waste my time further on it,2.0,2.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566059/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2011,A very absorbing movie,Yes it s too long Yes there are lots of goofs And if you watch closely enough errors of time and place But this is one movie that is worth watching closely Even if as I found at the fourth sitting through a TV showing you have to watch a raft of cleverly placed product placement ads OK we know that FedEx comes out of it well And Snickers bars And Wilson the sports goods maker But it does not improve a movie to show ads for men s deodorant Nevertheless it is a truly absorbing show On TV the film runs for three hours But it remains watchable Looking back at the several versions of this film that I have seen it is apparent that many viewers have not seen the original hardtop version An example In one TV version the suicide attempt has been cut In another it is elaborated in a conversation between Chuck and his friend Perhaps television broadcasters have their own agenda with regard to timing of programs In one TV version there is much footage wasted with no significant visuals Is this so that ads could be inserted by local operators I believe that good movies and this is a very good movie deserve better,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2401121/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,A lackluster bore,At times I felt as desperate as Hanks character to get out of the movie theater I checked my watch no fewer than six times The attempts at literary symbolism were glaringly obvious although not well executed There was some suspense with no surprises Perhaps the book is worth reading but I would not recommend viewing this film,2.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565537/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2001,wake up...this is nothing special,This movie is not good Yes it has a great plane crash but after the great suspense Tom Hanks lives damn Wow I can t believe Tom Hanks was on the screen by himself for soooo long well I can t believe so many people watched this garbage for soooo long and actually enjoyed it From what I understand Hanks has wanted to do this movie for a while If it meant that much to him he really should have waited untill something better came along from the Hollywood script dept Yes he performed a great physical transformation for this movie but others have done just as well and for much better movies DeNiro Raging Bull Tom Hanks has done a great job in some great movies he now has to try to keep himself known as a great actor he now has the power to wait untill the next gump or private ryan comes along But Hanks answered our question when we asked what do you do after playing a role that great in saving private ryan You sign yourself up for You ve Got Mail that s what you do They should have stopped after Gump if ever again I hear the names Zemeckis and Hanks in a trailer I ll run like hell If you re interested in seeing some of 2000 s best stay away from this highly overrated film I Have Made FIRE and now I will toss a copy of Cast Away into it,4.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566028/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2000,Only Hanks Could Have Pulled This Off,There s not much dialogue monologue action sequences special effects explosions grand musical scores breath taking scenes or the other stuff that usually stick in our minds It s just Tom stranded on an island with no one to talk to and nothing to do That Tom could take this movie and totally keep my interest and thoroughly entertain me was incredible For that Tom deserves major kudos and this film deserves its high praise It s a great drama that explores the experience of living in total isolation and the human desire to live and our need for companionship DP,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565518/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2001,Awful slow movie without surprises,I can hardly believe that so many people voted around a eight for this slow movie You can anticipate every action in the movie five minutes in advance You have to shout at the actor to use his flashlight It is one huge commercial for FedEx and Dr Pepper And yeah really your are cast away on a desolated island for four years and you do not open a package which can contain granted quite unlikely a satellite phone Get REAL Granted the plane crash was quite nicely done,1.0,15.0,46.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565733/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,Everything The Perfect Storm was not. Just extraordinary.,It s not necessary to use many words to describe this movie as it doesn t use many to tell its story Awesome silence and aching loneliness mold and sculpt literally a man who must deal with cruel fate and cruel nature The waves that come crashing in on his little island to imprison him as surely as steel bars are far more real real looking and fearful than the computer generated fakes in The Perfect Storm This is the real thing Tom Hanks is a shoo in for a Best Actor nomination,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566085/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,Expectations Met,In my honest opinion Castaway is nothing short of a safe viewing That s not to say it s great or terrible just about as good as throwing Tom Hanks on an island and watching him survive sounds At times the runtime does drag a little especially when you can t help but begin to question where this is really going as there are only two options realistically he gets off the island he doesn t That being said Tom Hanks makes use of his acting chops here by delivering a gripping performance Though I can t speak for the realism of certain circumstances that doesn t for a second stop this from being a really entertaining film,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7062733/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2001,well up with some tears and experience a moment of passing profundity,Stories about being stranded on a desert island have an elemental appeal to the human imagination so it seems appropriate that the premier spinner of high tech cinematic fables Robert Zemeckis would step up to the plate with his 21st century spin on the tale Interestingly the title Cast Away is rendered as two separate words Could this be a way to emphasize that the cast of the movie is away for most of the film Perhaps it s because cast member Tom Hanks is also a producer and collaborator on the film hinting that cast away may be a little like anchors aweigh where the new Hollywood launches another tale of Everyman for a politically morally and spiritually confused and transitioning time It s time to take stock of ourselves in our high paced world Who better to take us through that journey than the common man du jour Mr Hanks Like Forrest Gump or with anything featuring Tom Hanks or directed by Zemeckis the film has quality and integrity Life is struggle we all go too fast we don t value the really important things in life love is powerful and enduring fate works in strange ways life is what you make it Their themes are crystal clear bordering on painfully obvious That s OK too because great effects and fabulous scenery in service to good commercial filmmaking is virtuous and inevitably appealing not to mention boffo box office The three part structure of the film is therefor entirely appropriate Those who feel the rescue section I won t say what happens just in case doesn t work miss the purpose of the storytelling It is not created to make us leave the theater in an existential quandary but to be entertained well up with some tears experience a moment of passing profundity and briefly ponder a few big questions Expecting the film to do otherwise is like having Johnny Appleseed sow his seeds across the America only to find out they never sprouted The film s artificiality is part of its appeal Perhaps that s why I find myself watching the credits until the very end I needed to find out whether the large crab on the spear caught by the Hank s character at in the beginning of his island stay was real or animatronics It was animatronics,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565701/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2005,Cast out to sea. Never to return,If I didn t know that Tom Hanks starred in movies like Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan I would have given him all the Oscars there is Cast Away is the brilliant story of survival in every word of the title of a FedEx shipper who stays on and island and manages to survive in complete isolation for 4 years without any phone connections and living with a volleyball that he later becomes friendly with Wilson and icon for all of us who need someone to talk to even if its inanimate As I watched this movie time and time again I picked up on some ways of survival ways of starting things socially as once again Robert Zemeckis can keep an audience captivated by the one movement of one man of the one man who can make a major difference Its hard to say whether people can learn or debate by watching this flick by saying all the garbage about how someone can really do it Switch yourself with Hanks for a week and then lets talk about how manly someone is Helen Hunt who plays Kelly and Hanks who plays the brilliantly stable Chuck Noland have great chemistry together as both light up the screen with flavor and pizazz which seems that no movie nowadays possesses Watching this movie will make you frightened and make you cry but the lessons are numerous Ready to take on the next 4 years of your life OK Now here s the challenge unplug your TV and disconnect your telephone and computer systems Now that you re ready open up the new page in your life and Begin,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1247098/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2000,A nice pot roast but not filet mignon,Cast Away is a fine movie for mainstream Hollywood It is a Sears kind of movie Nothing too offensive or challenging stays on main street no forays into the darker sides of the psyche Hanks chooses his vehicles well as compared to many of the other male superstars like Hanks and Gibson who have sold out completely I found the plot a bit contrived and the most impressive special effect was the Hanks weight loss Helen Hunt is in too many movies Period She needs to take a vacation,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566158/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,I wanted to see more of Helen Hunt,I think the drama at the end of the picture would have been enhanced if we had occasionally been given a look at what Hunt Hanks s fiancee was going through while Hanks was on the island I can t discuss specifics without spoiling here but we learn about Helen Hunt s agonizing decisions only after Hanks gets back to civilization It would have been more interesting for me to see what she was going through parallel to and intercut with what Hanks was dealing with on his island I think the failure to do so accounts for my being able to leave the theater dropping only a few tears instead of spouting a gusher,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566140/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2001,Another great to many greats for Hanks!,Cast Away could only of been successful through one actor alone and that actor is Tom Hanks This guy has to go down as one of the best actors of all time The plot of cast away is straight forward as you d gather from the title Tom Hanks plays the part of Chuck Noland who is a FeDex operative transporting packages by air The plane nose dives into the ocean through bad weather and only Chuck comes away alive he then drafts to an unchartered island where he is on his own The crash scene was very brutal and it almost made me look at flying in a completely different way then i convinced myself it is a film But the scene was so realistic that it can honestly change your opinion Hanks once on the island is very capturing you see him struggle to survive and then LEARN to survive The acting by Hanks alone should of beaten off Russell Crowe for the Oscar i feel He shows great emotion and presence within the movie to back that statement This is another great movie to go in Tom Hanks record of achievement and its another great film to go into my collection 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565905/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2001,Is there anything Mr. Hanks can do wrong?,Forget The Beach not hard this is the best desert island flick of them all It s funny moving poignant and Tom Hanks is outstanding However I only gave it an 8 because it goes all schmaltzy at the end which is a common mistake just see The Family Man for God s sake Robert Zemeckis directs it well as per usual and as mentioned Hanks is a marvel You become captivated by watching his actions on the island especially those involving Wilson the volleyball Hanks does many bizarre things like eat live fish and do dentistry on himself which are fun to watch if not a little sickening Not totally brilliant but it s so engaging you ll hardly care A must for fans of Hanks and director Zemeckis,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565749/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2007,Weird!,This is a weird story Tom Hanks is a time neurotic guy who is very busy Then he gets on a plane and the plane crashes Okay fine Then what Unfortunately the island he finds himself stranded on is unpopulated So far so good Now the story turns into a classic man versus nature story That s fine and dandy because this theme is very relevant since Mr Hanks is portrayed as this time neurotic guy who always seems to be hung up on what time it is and how much he has to do before this and that and now he has to go back to basics and live off the land ZZZZZZZZZZZZ Now the weird part starts He turns into a madman He becomes indeed VERY friendly with a volleyball A BALL This is not natural Unless somebody has paid good money to promote Wilson volleyballs He is more attached to that one ball than to his own very naturally attached balls and that s just weird I don t care that he is lonely and has been so for 4 years You just don t make friends with a ball and you certainly don t name it I only want to give it 3 out of 10 because my mates and I once had a laugh about that best friends with a volleyball part Other than that it was just plain boring If you like Hanks watch something else I recommend Turner Hooch,3.0,3.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1623614/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2001,Cast Away? Perhaps that should be Cast Out,I ll start by admitting that Tom Hanks does nothing for me as an actor In fact I think his only two decent films to date are Big and Philidelphia and that s at a stretch I went into the film with a healthy dose of skepticism but was fully prepared to be surprised Oh well one outta two ain t bad This is the sort of film where if someone asked me what it was like I respond with the cinematography was very good Hanks joins Robert Zemeckis for the first time since Forrest Gump don t even get me started on that waste of film The story itself is one of survival d uh Chuck is a jet setting Fed Ex efficiency expert who jumps on a plane and the plane decides to jump into the ocean Chuck survives and has to eke out a living on a deserted island That s all there is to it really Oh he s kept company by a picture of his girlfriend Kelly and a volleyball named Wilson There were some fleeting glimpses of brilliance in the film how Chuck overcomes adversity living on an island cooking fires home dentistry etc but nothing too extraordinary In fact boring in parts I think the film could have benefited from cuts to what s happening back home while he s on the island mind you it would have meant involvement from the other actors which would have spoiled the Tom Hanks alone in Cast Away effect of the film Oh OK credit where credit is due Hanks did trim down fantastically for the film and he looks well not that bad I think taut would be the word But that s enough gushing Fed Ex too must be rubbing its hands in glee with the free advertising this film has provided for them It s a film that I wouldn t recommend highly to people but at the same time it s OK and worth a trip to see it on the big screen because I think it ll lose a bit on the TV Now would someone please explain to me why Tom Hanks keeps winning these damn Oscars because I m stumped,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565771/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2001,Predictable With No Real Insight,Now the predictable part didn t bother me much because I was expecting the movie to delve into the psyche of the main character and reveal something profound about humanity Instead the film is extrmeley shallow Here is the question the movie poses What would it be like to be stranded on an island Now the average person has certain preconceptions when thinking about this question The job of the movie is to provide depth and material which forces the viewer to reconsider these preconceptions No such material exists in the film It has the intellectual blandness that is typical of popcorn movies but with most of the action removed As a result the movie failed to hold my interest Besides this basic failing there are also some minor nitpicks The film took the more marketable and typical gender designations with the male being lost on an adventure and the woman at home This formula has been around since The Odyssey and I would have liked to see Helen Hunt and Tom Hanks reverse their roles But seeing a woman on screen without make up and perfect hair A woman who can survive alone We can t have that now In addition no one spears fish standing twenty feet away from the target It just isn t done Tom Hanks also was remarkably chubby and healthy looking during the first few days on the island After returning from the island the movie cheats us by magically producing a Tom Hanks who has managed to reintegrate himself into society in a mere four days Sure he s a little reserved but after four years alone his behaviorisms would take a wee bit longer to disappear The scenes with Helen Hunt manage to be painfully melodramatic which is quite an achievement considering that the situation would seem to allow for melodrama Finally I predicted the appearance of the beautiful woman in the final scene about a minute before she showed up which was depressing It suggests that all a lost man needs to provide him with some direction in his life is some other pretty girl in too much make up So all in all some nice scenery but not enough to make up for the films inability to inspire thought in the viewer,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565739/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2001,This is what i call acting,Tom Hanks doesn t ramble on and on and on He doesn t make complex forts like in other movies of the same nature He doesn t make complex hunting tools He doesn t befriend the wildlife around him He sits and he sits thinking about who he loves the most The silence on the beach which in a way made you feel his pain Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar but no he got robbed because he had already won 2 I refuse now not to watch another show for the rest of my life Did you feel his pain when he lost his beloved friend Wilson the vollyball I did Did you feel his pain when you found out he had lost he most beloved friend I did I advise you to watch this film and to not judge it right after you see it just think about it,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565870/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,roleplaying,Tom Hanks work on the role was just amazing I admire the way he worked out his flabby tummy into Bakibaki abdominal muscle Bakibaki is Japanese However I felt the movie was a bit long It could have been a little more compact As Tom Hanks there are no violent sexual scenes so even those with children can easily enjoy this movie,6.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7390316/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2001,A metaphor for Life!,Not being a fan of either Tom Hanks Robert Zemekis or American movies in general I wasn t expecting much from Cast Away It was an extremely hot day in Adelaide that day and the closest movie theatre seemed to be the best escape from the heat I walked out of this film feeling fully entertained plus taking with me much food for thought None of the performances moved me terribly but I found the screenplay most interesting It was obvious to me that the story itself was a metaphor for life and within this was a strong message to us all Whatever message you take away will depend on your basic values The story covered the 3 stages of life I know everything and I can do what I like Good grief I don t know everything and now I have to learn about life from the ground up I can rejoin the human race but I m changed beyond recognition The catalyst to Stage 2 in the film was the plane crash and Tom Hanks character being stranded on a remote and uninhabited island For the rest of the human race this catalyst is generally far more subtle but it inevitably leaves us feeling that our lives are out of our control Feeling out of control is generally a neon sign that change is needed Whether the screenwriter intended this film to be a metaphor I can t say but the result is a sharply and succinctly edited piece which is so unlike other big American movies I welcomed the change it was like a breath of fresh Pacific Island air,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565832/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,Another Great one from Zemeckis,I Love his movies They are filled with detail Sometimes you don t realize until a day or two later how much detail is dropped into a Zemeckis film It is in the details that his stories are really brought to life At face value I would have given Cast Away a 5 of 10 as an average movie Then I started rolling over it in my head and when I awoke from a realistic dream about that tiny island Tom Hanks was deserted on I knew it was more the first washes across you You have to watch it more than once I decided You HAVE to look for all the details The religious symbolism The Major Zemeckis theme throughout many of his films Fate versus Free Will The Man Vs Nature The Comedy is an average man s faults These are the things a Bob Zemeckis film explores and makes you feel I loved this film I give it a nomination for Best Director and I give it 50 50 odds of winning I nominate it for Best Picture It will be a close race with Almost Famous and The Grinch Tom Hanks is definitely a nominee for Best Actor He was simply REAL There is no better performance this year Maybe an equal but no better performance Amazing As I said at first glance I didn t like it much The ending was something I didn t like After some time to re think it through I think the ending is brilliant This is one of the three best films of 2000 Go see it for yourself,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566107/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2021,I haven't been disappointed,Eventually I took the opportunity to watch Cast Away and it exceeded my expectations I don t like Tom Hanks and his movies and this one was again It is really amazing how he does not show any emotions Even a volleyball is more intriguing Some examples mute the movie an replace sounds as follows Scene when he is on the beach Monty Python Scene when he is at the airport and got told the truth a movie when a guy is waiting for his prom girl Scene when he H Hunt walks in the room with maps on the table Da Vinci Code If the audience would not know the story and development of the plot no one would know what each scene is about Take a picture of a random scene in Cast Away and ask someone who didn t watch the movie what it is about There will be 1000 different answers completely contrary to each other Right after Cast Away I saw some indi movie with at this time unknown actors There wa s scene when the kids got told about the fate of the mother The emotiona expression of those unknown unexperienced actors looked so real I could take a picture of this scene and everyone would understand what was going on at this movement in the movie,3.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7623531/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2001,Pretty good - but too bad someone from Fedex didn't edit it.,We re going through another puffed up time in film making This is a good story with a good cast all brought together by a good director who s had too many hits In this film after 25 minutes we ve learned about as much as good writing and editing could have shown us in 5 minutes But it just might be that we have a situation where no one can tell this very successful director Hey we need to chop this thing It s a terrific story with a survival segment sandwiched in the middle The structure is valid we see how the protagonist loses his obsession with time though I m probably in the minority in saying that the middle third is just another man stranded on island story It s the relationship story that I loved and it would have been even more effective if it could have been condensed For example we start with an entire segment in Russia But why Just to show the humor of trying to teach Russians the value of time I hope the reason for this movie s 148 minute length isn t to teach the audience not to worry about time Then we have a long Christmas dinner scene with 16 people at the table A bit of gabbing some holiday cheer How does this help the story What do we learn Mainly that Hanks has a tooth ache Instead of a trip to Russia and a big dinner scene I would have loved getting to know the Helen Hunt character better It could only have made the final third even more poignant As it is we have a good flick that feels it needs to give you more minutes for your money I would have preferred more impact It s a shame one of the Fedex people one a bit more cognizant of time passing couldn t have put in a good word or two,5.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565863/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2001,There's no Immunity Idol here... only man vs. nature. (Possible Spoilers.),While CBS s Survivor may be entertaining it certainly is nothing like being stranded on a deserted island all by yourself with no comforts of home First of all on TV all the contestants have each other other people with which to communicate to fight with to laugh with and to cry with They also receive various trinkets and surprises from the producers of the show Survivors Yeah right more like rats in a cage Along comes another superb Tom Hanks film Somebody somewhere said that nobody could do this like Tom Hanks and it s true Where else can you find a film that you can watch for 50 minutes with only a small bit of spoken word and remain entertained I ve watched many a film late in the evening with much more action than this film and still fallen asleep So what is it about this film You want to see what happens next Tom Hanks pulls this off beautifully The ups and downs the trials and errors the good and the bad it s all in here As a high level FedEx employee Chuck Noland Hanks knows about the passage of time he lives by it However when his plane crashes somewhere over the Pacific and he finds himself stranded alone on a deserted island with nothing except his wits an old watch containing a picture of his girlfriend a rubber raft and the contents of a few FedEx packages that have washed up on shore he has to make the best of his surroundings This begins a quest in which Noland learns about himself his surroundings and his will to survive and beat the odds It is a beautifully filmed story with superb acting and an excellent plot This is a definite must if you are a fan of Tom Hanks or if you like to rent movies which draw you into the story It is also an eye opener for those of us who don t know how we would deal with the tremendous obstacle of being alone with little hope of rescue Most of my time on this movie was spent afterwards exploring how I felt about the film and the situation That if nothing else is worth viewing this film My Rating 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565918/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2023,The film begins in a rush and continues,The movie has a lot of box office clout because of Tom Hanks outstanding performance director Robert Zemeckis captivating visuals Helen Hunt s modest but crucial role and more An extended theatrical life could result from a great opening and positive critical reception followed by potential Oscar nominations However viewers could find it difficult to get invested in a film when feelings of isolation annoyance and sadness take up so much of the screen time The screenplay by William Broyles Jr Initially takes this well traveled route before venturing into the less trodden region of accepting a successful survival After suffering physical and mental tribulations in exile the hero discovers that his return to civilization is just as perilous as his island life And this is where the movie falls short of fully exploiting its theme,8.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8872863/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,"Great Acting, Sad Story, Weird Ending",Phenomenal performance by Tom Hanks This story is very sad as he crashes on a flight for work over the Pacific Ocean The crash scene is absolutely terrifying and so realistic The next 4 years he is stuck on the island with nobody to befriend but a volley ball he collected from the floating packages left over from the crash He begins building a raft for him and his volleyball friend Wilson to get back to land so he can see his girlfriend again Helen Hunt During this trip he loses Wilson the volleyball and gives up on his own aspirations due to sorrow and it is truly tear jerking The ending of this movie though I don t understand why it went like that They never quite explained the significance of that package and why they chose for him to willingly keep quiet about it when he drove all the way to Texas to deliver it is just kind of dumb,8.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6656518/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2001,"Strong first and second acts, worth contemplating.",Cast Away had strong first and second acts Well the middle part was most of the movie but Tom Hanks again does a fine job and it leaves you contemplating and thinking about your own chances in that situation Of course you ll never want to get on a plane again But the third act is weak I will not reveal what happens except to say that Zemeckis doesnt quite achieve the same impact that hangs with you during the middle part Some bad writing and cheesy acting angel wings girl ugh but all in all the quality is pretty good Worth seeing,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565939/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2001,one of the years best,Tom Hanks gives another Oscar worthy performance as a time obsessed Fed Ex worker who after a stunning plane crash gets stranded on a deserted Island for about 4 years During this time wee see Hanks become self sufficient and more mature He learns to forget about the unimportant things in life and focus on the most important like trying to survive He also begins to lose his mind the only thing keeping him alive is the thought of being reunited with his girlfriend Helen Hunt Cast Away is a truly unique film The hour and a half of Hanks on the Island contain practically no music and very little dialog In fact Hanks only company is that of a volleyball with a face on it This may sound a little dull but it isn t The film runs about 2 hours and 40 minutes but it zooms right by and I felt it wasn t long enough and that more time needed to spent on the island The most interesting thing about this movie is just watching Hanks try to survive To see how a person adapts to conditions they have never experienced is always a fascinating thing The film is also beautifully shot and director Robert Zemeckis does a wonderful job of showing Hanks isolation Not only is this one of the best films of the year but it will probably be loved by anyone who sees it,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566066/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2000,Gilligan's Island it is not.,Cast Away has to be the most boring uninspired movie of 2000 Going into the film from the previews I knew that Tom Hanks was going to be involved in a plane crash and stranded on a deserted island And seeing that Helen Hunt was the supporting star billing ho it was pretty obvious that he d be back to his Memphis home town where seemingly a la Kevin Costner s Robin Hood everyone has a southern accent except Hanks So what happens between that time Everything you d expect He aims to survive Food clothing shelter Fed Ex shipments But there is no tension no drama no suspense and despite what Hollywood is hyping as some 20 minutes of gripping silence there is no good acting So you end up not caring and it doesn t get much worse when you don t care what happens to the star of the show I felt sorry for Gilligan he was too inept to rescue himself But I won t feel sorry for Tom Hanks Especially if he makes Cast Away II And the Harlem Globetrotters,2.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565562/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2001,Third act fails the movie,CAST AWAY 01 13 01 It s a great Hanks performance vehicle ruined by a seemingly tacked on conclusion The film could have ended with Hanks character being either rescued or Zemeckis could have shown us those conveniently missing four weeks Those alone could have been a movie within themselves But all in all I enjoyed my time with the film Serious film goers will note that one beach scene obviously gives a nod to Kubrick s 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY Hanks self professed favorite movie and mine as well 7 5 10,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566056/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2002,Fascinating,I ve got to admit this movie is one of the finest I have ever seen Not only it focuses on survival it also has an interesting field on how we can enjoy those many things that keeps on fascinating us We all know that there is a saying no man is an island well beleive me everything can be possible if we try to look deep in our hearts on what we really want and what we can really focus on For all those things Cast Away gives an example for every one of them It gives us inspirations to lead us to a life full of enlightment and love for oneself Not only this movie gives these valuable messages in life but for me it does tell us how beautiful the world really is And on how we can love and interact with it for all our problems and struggles we can just look at on how pretty the world is For me this movie is one big inspiration and will be one important part in my life,9.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566181/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,"Riveting, emotional and powerful journey",I went into this movie with very high expectations Reuniting Tom Hanks with his Forrest Gump one of my all time favourite films director should be a formula for a surefire success And it was This movie far exceeded anything that I thought it could be and the film s weight was carried in large part on Hanks considerably slimmer shoulders Tom Hanks performance alone is reason enough to see this film I felt everything that his character felt right along with him How he could create emotion of this magnitude while being on screen totally alone for more than half of the film s length speaks volumes for his talent as a performer He portrays all of his thoughts and feelings with very little dialogue while playing off nothing but a volleyball He moved me to tears on numerous occasions This is to say nothing of the rigorous weight loss program he must have gone through to lose the 50 lbs his character required he is truly dedicated to his craft The screenplay was very clever Once Hanks meets his fate and ends up marooned on the island we are immersed solely in the events of his life There is no music very little dialogue and no other back at home scenes for us to see what has happened in the aftermath of his disappearance We see Hanks struggling to survive all the while never losing sight of the one thing that will give him the strength to get off the island Kelly the love of his life Hunt does well in her role as Hanks love interest Even with her reduced screen time she develops her character into someone that we can care about and empathize with While many people have complained about the film s ending I thought it was perfect Possible spoiler It is nice to see that the screen writers didn t cop out and go for the unbelievable Hollywood style fairy tale ending There is a real emotional dilemma completely realistic considering the circumstances Anything less would have been a great injustice to a perfect film Another great success for Zemeckis and Hanks kudos to all involved,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565473/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2001,well worth seeing,I had read quite a few reviews on IMDb and I have to say they resulted in a great lack of enthusiasm to see this movie I read stuff like Tom Hanks not talking for half an hour and Hollywood dribble and I had to be dragged off to see it I really was much better then I expected It never lags and is full of action suspense and interesting themes You don t watch Tom Hanks on the Island for 30mins you see Chuck Noland It is really a great film and I was surprised it was as good as it was Don t let other critics jade your idea of this movie cause it really is a very good movie Go see it now,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565798/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2001,Hooray for Wilson!,I have seen this movie twice and both times when I walked out there were people complaining about the movie and declaring that it was boring and unlikeable I would have to say the opposite The plane crash was extremely realistic and intense and happens quickly after the movie begins The action on the island is RIVETING You are constantly interested to find out what Chuck Noland does next and it is amazing how he is able to use the contents of the FedEx boxes Tom Hanks turns in a fabulous performance with little words and big gestures and also by losing weight for an awesome transformation after his four years on the island He was ROBBED to not get the Oscar for Best Actor this year The movie even made a mere volleyball an interesting character You scoff now but you ll grow to love Wilson and his tree hair extensions In any other movie there would have been typical Hollywood details thrown in a beautiful mermaid living on the island to keep Chuck company a shark attack while he is riding on his raft Chuck managing to have a packet of waterproof matches on him when his ship goes down ANYTHING unrealistic This movie manages to stay true to its cause and explores the dire situation of being stranded out on an island in a simple yet effective way The ending of the movie was a bit overdrawn but the ambiguous ending satisfied me so that I could come up with my own ending for Chuck When you first hear that the movie has Tom Hanks in nearly an hour of film time with dialogue you wonder how it can be entertaining But oh boy it surely is Don t miss it 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565896/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2017,"I love it, but...",I ve seen it a half dozen times and always love it for the sense of adventure it stirs within me at the thought of being stranded on an island like this and having to survive even though in reality I probably wouldn t last more than a month But upon watching it again recently a couple things struck me that I think are a bit off Firstly I don t think his woman would have moved on from him and gotten married and had a kid If she was so in love with him as is depicted in the beginning and if he was as she says in their final hug after the reunion the love of her life and she had always been in love with him and always would and again as she says I always knew you were alive even when they told me to give up and move on I still knew then four years is not long enough for him to be gone for her to move so completely on with her life She might have dated but I don t believe she would do this for at least a couple years and she might have needed to find a guy to have sex with but maybe not but I do not believe that she would get married and have a kid not in only four years The second thing that struck me as being off was the entire sequence involving the hanging tree at the top of the cliff Watching these scenes I started thinking about the practical reality of this supposed scenario and realized that it was probably impossible Firstly given the closeness of the dead tree to the cliff s edge I doubt anyone could tie a rope to it then carry or lift such a heavy test trunk and throw it off the cliff without losing their balance and falling over the edge But let s say that part was doable okay but when Chuck goes back up there to retrieve that extra 30 feet of rope there is NO WAY he could go back up there and to such a precarious perch reach out for that rope stretching his hand like he did to actually grab the rope and then haul that test trunk back up one handed on that cliff edge He d fall for sure Of course in the movie they cut out just how in the hell after getting a hand on the rope he manages to then get himself the rope and the trunk into a position where he can haul it They cut from his hand precariously grabbing the rope to him standing with both feet firmly planted and both hands hauling the rope up But what did he do in between those moments Use magic super powers The final thing that bothers me is all the nonsense with FedEx deliveries in the beginning boring but luckily able to be sped through using the trusty fast forward or skip buttons Otherwise still a great movie,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3758670/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2022,Nothing less than an absolute masterpiece,The riveting performance by Hanks truly is the culmination of all that Hollywood was created to do and is complete by the score that engrosses what was left Hanks is remarkable at capturing every emotion and thought wrapping it up and serving it on a platter only to do it over and over again This movie comes full circle we only have ourselves at the end of the day We are home Hanks I saulte you for this performance you outdid yourself,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7726857/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2015,Yet Another Good Robinson Crusoe-Like Movie,Lost at sea stranded on an island movies apparently agree with me All is Lost and Life of Pi are a couple of perfect modern examples but Cast Away does a fairly good job as the stranded on an island variety Directed by Robert Zemeckis Cast Away features great visuals and a miraculous gathering of greater actors Helen Hunt is Chuck Noland s wife and Chuck is played by the one and only Tom Hanks Chuck and Kelly are happily married always happy to see each other once Chuck gets back from his journeys he works for FedEx It s around Christmas time but Chuck has to leave anyway and heads out on the plane until something unknown happens to the plane to cause it to go out of control and crash and make Chuck the lone survivor He floats up on an island and does his best to survive wisely using the FedEx boxes that get washed up on the island Even Wilson the volleyball comes in handy helping him keep his sanity although sometimes all it seems to do is make him insane He struggles at first taking an infinity trying to light a fire and open a coconut Eventually though his experience grows and he acts like he was born on the island surviving until he can get a raft built While he works he makes small chat with Wilson even jokes around with him a bit You want to hear something funny My dentist s name is James Spalding He looks at Wilson a bit expecting him to laugh but apparently Wilson didn t think it was funny Cast Away can be a bit dull sometimes or slow going but it is also thoroughly entertaining especially near the climax When he gets back home it turns out that he s not as happy as he thought he would be Although the time on the island is enjoyable the heart of the film lies in his return and what tragedies await him and the chance to start a new life 82 5 100,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3358956/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2000,Quietly Compelling,How many actors would you pay to watch alone on screen for nearly an hour and a half Casting Tom Hanks in Cast Away is a no brainer Not many other working actors could carry this film or even Tom Hanks loincloth Director Robert Zemeckis won the first battle just getting Hanks to star He won another battle getting Fed Ex to agree to be featured in the greatest product placement since ET s Reese s Pieces Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland an executive with Fed Ex who flies from meeting to meeting on the company s cargo jets He has to survive one of those plane s crashing and learn to thrive on a deserted island in the south Pacific I have to admit I was thinking about the TV show Survivor as he struggled to catch food and make fire But sadly for Chuck Hanks there were no reward challenges to provide him with the occasional call home or water proof matches Cast Away is such an appropriate title for this film because not only is Chuck a castaway but for Hanks the rest of the Cast is Away Most people feel Tom Hanks is a talented actor but also an interesting person I think someone we d like if we hung with the Hollywood crowd And whether that was Chuck Noland out there on the island or Hanks I didn t get bored watching him get acclimated to his lonely life because I cared about him One of my younger co workers says he was bothered by the fact that there was no soundtrack and the quiet of many of the island scenes I would hate to generalize by age group but the silence didn t disturb me at all I didn t even notice it until later in the film when I thought Hey they should have some big building orchestrated music here I think the lack of background noise was perfect for the movie All you can hear most times is the relentless crashing of the waves on the beach and reef and that s a terrific scene setter Mostly I love Cast Away for what was left out of the film There are some major questions left unanswered when the credits roll That s so cool Studios seem to want everything tied up in a neat package at the end of movies Could Cast Away be the start of some novel trend Let s hope so Cast Away is rated PG 13 for intense action sequences and some disturbing images including the death of a toy Cast Away earns three and a half stars on my scale 0 5 Bottom line if you like Tom Hanks you ll like this movie And if you too live and die by time be sure you ve got two hours and 23 minutes to enjoy him,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566129/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2000,One of the few movies of 2000 I thoroughly enjoyed,The TV spots really did give too much away wouldn t you say Despite this the movie was quite solid Hanks impressed me with his work on the island watching his struggles and successes during the ultimate test of survival skills The mood of the film was nice I appreciated the quiet diligence that surrounded all the mundane tasks Hanks had to master shortly after being stranded I felt immersed in the solitude Hanks character was thrust into following the crash Not only did his behavior seem right for lack of a better word but his survival of the brutal plane crash what a scene didn t seem too outlandish His behavior upon returning to civilization was perfect too the silent nods and gestures given to all the well wishers who welcomed him back the impression that he felt crowded can you tell I was impressed with his work I will agree with the naysayers on one point Hunt and Hanks have zero chemistry The best part of their relationship seemed to take place when he was on the island and she was a still picture inside his watch Well OK here s a second point The I ll be right back line was ick Why bother Amazing how well and to such depth a story can be told without much dialogue My favorite segment of the movie started at the crash and lasted until the birth of Wilson I connected with the feelings Hanks was trying to convey through his actions very satisfying I do wonder this Did you or the people you watched this movie with laugh much during this movie There was laughter in the theater that I felt was misplaced maybe I respected the film too much Whatever A good movie in a bad year but not because it was a bad year This movie would have held up in most years,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565465/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2006,"Should have been called ""Survival"" if only for the effort to get through it",Cast Away strikes me as a movie that Hollywood decided predominantly to make to cash in on the huge success of the Survivor type reality TV programs which began in the late 90 s which to me seems a fairly lame and mercenary reason to make a movie Of course it also gives rise to the natural survival instinct question what would I do if I was in his shoes and this however was a reason to approach this movie with anticipation Much was made of Tom Hanks preparation for his role in this movie which at the time put him in contention for another Oscar If he had won then I think his main co star for much of the movie a character called Wilson should also have received the award for best supporting actor The basic premise of Cast Away introduces us to FedEx Problem Solver and Logistics Man Hanks who at the beginning of the film in a typically condescending American way enlightens both us and a pitiful crowd of Russian Fed Ex employees of how important time is and how we live and die by the clock Meanwhile while our hero Hanks is shooting round the world in air freight jets his patient and it seems long suffering fianc e Helen Hunt waits uncomplainingly back in Memphis USA Of course he jets home in time for Christmas only to be beeped off again on Christmas night leaving only the shortest time for exchange of presents before he flies off again promising faithfully to be back for New Year Of course we know that he won t be After the plane crashes our hero Hanks emerges relatively unscathed as the only survivor from the plane wreck onto a tiny volcanic island jutting out of an expansive Pacific with no population save for a few coconut and palm trees and the few Fed ex boxes that wash up on his private beach Being a man of the modern world to whom time is of the essence the survival instinct in our hero takes quite a bit of time to click in and even when it does it tends to manifest or reveal itself in the most basic juvenile and pathetic of ways Eventually Hanks begins to show a bit of initiative by utilizing what he can from the salvaged Fed Ex boxes but even here on this futile desert Island his illogical enslavement to corporate America and time remains when he retains one of the parcels un opened so that he can deliver it some time in the future In at least something of a nod to other much better thought out survival type pieces of literature and movies Hanks sets out in a quest for fire and companionship The companionship comes relatively easily in the guise of the aforementioned Wilson which manifests itself in the shape of a volleyball which bears a crude face when he accidentally smears it with his blood His quest for fire of course is a considerably more involved and convoluted procedure In that context whilst it is very irritating it s not altogether surprising to have the movie very suddenly jump on a whole four years and to discover that save for losing a lot of weight and growing a lot of very shaggy hair our hero Hanks has in fact moved on very little from his first few days Indeed the growing incredulity of the film at this stage is further established when then after four years a piece of a Portaloo washed up on his island suddenly seemingly overnight finally inspires Hanks to try and get off the island His survival instinct and initiative which seems to have little progressed or developed in the intervening four years then suddenly kicks into gear again and he does display some encouraging enterprise in building a raft from logs and video tape and a rope which we learn he d contemplated to use in his suicide sometime in the four years It could have been a much better movie if we d had more time to find out the specifics of why he didn t Of course it s no real surprise to reveal that he does succeed in his escape and is delivered into his rightful place back in the civilized world again though in another bit of appalling continuity his undoubtedly required psychological and physical rehabilitation is compressed into a simple and casual but very irritating Four weeks later flashed across the screen Back in the real world however life and also unfortunately his fianc e has moved on so Hanks is confronted with a new set of realities in addition to the added trauma of merely trying to readjust to normal life Of course out of its more comfortable and familiar setting on the island the movie again begins to lose its way and even threatens a sickly sweet Hollywood ending but even fumbles that ball and ends up pretty inconclusively really which the malicious or cynical part of me might speculate could have Sequel or Prequel or even Interval The intervening four years written on it This was one of those movies that had its wonderful potential most irritatingly buried by getting such things as too many story lines and a striving towards Oscar status again for Tom Hanks get in the way of writing a concise and tightly knit story of survival in the face of awful odds and more especially the psychological effects of loneliness and isolation and a study of the primeval instincts of survival in man This movie only briefly flirted with any of these subjects and if it had even chose to concentrate on one of them it could have been great,4.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1443741/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2001,"Exciting, bittersweet film with a clear message.",Tom Hanks will probably win an Oscar for his portrayal of Chuck Nolan I was very impressed with this movie I was expecting a remake of Robinson Crusoe but this is more of a love story than an adventure albeit a very bittersweet love story The message clearly stated by Hanks is that you must carry on no matter what because the sun will rise tomorrow and you never know what the tide may bring,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565490/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2006,Cartoons run the world!,I have to give more credit to cartoons for my cinematic education than I tend to like to admit If it hadn t been for my early love of Warner Bros cartoons I probably never would have seen many of the films from the 40s that I have and almost certainly wouldn t have entered my longtime infatuation with filmmakers like Welles and Hitchcock The Simpsons got me to watch more current classics to get their injokes and now Family Guy has brought the trend up to the newest films So that s why I watched Cast Away when it came on television though I otherwise had no other interest in it And once again I have to thank cartoons for broadening my horizons just that bit farther I won t rehash the story of Cast Away since it s surely been done enough on this site and even if it hadn t it s pretty much in the title I will simply say Tom Hanks has done another surprising job while staying within the confines of his nonacting the only time I ve seen him be other than Tom Hanks as was probably The Road to Perdition and that s fortunate since he has the responsibility of carrying most of this film himself The story is another Robinson Crusoe kind of affair with a volleyball standing in for Friday If I have any issue with this movie it s that it didn t follow more truly the formula of such films too much in society not enough cast away And that s IF I have an issue with it This is not a great film The direction is utterly straightforward and the writing is only as good as it needs to be The ending is a little much after what is a fairly simple concept tale but I ll leave it at that So see Cast Away if you ve nothing better to do At the very least it ll give you a leg up on the latest parodic cartoons At the most it s a decent enough picture that won t make you feel like you ve wasted the last hour and a half like Coyote Ugly,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1483216/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2001,The best film that I have seen so far this year,I enjoyed this film because it had a touch of realism and the event portrayed could happen to anybody who flies frequently that is if one was lucky enough to survive a sea crash The actual crash was well done and very convincing I liked the way the film began and ended It related fate something to which we all suffer I was left really wanting to know if Chuck was going to have a new life with the lady who owned the Fed Ex which he returned It would make a nice sequel film It is easy to find fault with Chucks stay on the island How did he survive looking so well for four years with not enough food and wood for his stomach and fire How did he avoid fatal infection after being cut so badly and his rescue was most unlikely But remembering that it was only a story the acting by Tom Hanks deserves an award the direction was excellent and effects well done I would like to know if many stunt men were used The story jumped around and left large gaps It would have been good to have these gaps filled and the film longer Congratulations to the production team for an excellent and enjoyable film,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565831/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2001,Superb!,I cannot understand the negative comments regarding this movie I thought Hanks was superb and it puts you in the position of a man stranded in a very realistic way All the way through the film I found myself in thinking of being in that situation and what steps I would take I am quite an unemotional person especially with films but the scene when Hanks little self made friend went bobbing away into the distance of the ocean reduced me to tears I watched the film on my own and was blubbing like a baby All in all a great movie,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566058/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2001,Worst Tom Hanks Movie,I couldn t wait to see this movie after all it was staring Tom Hanks it had to be good Boy was I wrong Almost everyone I spoke to about this movie agreed it was not worth seeing I had a good mind to demand my money back I really do like Tom Hanks and have enjoyed much of his work but not this time The crash seen was great and the first few minutes on the island was good too but what next Suddenly it was 4 years later come on do they really expect us to believe that the only thing he did for 4 years was open 5 packages I counted at least 16 and learned to fish and how to eat raw fish without getting sick I am for the most part a city girl and even I could have thought of more to do on the island than that I could go into details about what he did and didn t do and what he could have done but that would take too long Let s just say that I would strongly not recommend this movie to anyone and I would be shocked if it got any kind of award,2.0,1.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565970/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2003,Great film,Cast Away is a great film I couldn t believe all the negative comments on this one I mean sure it s a slow paced movie and it has a simple storyline and you know what s gonna happen at the end but Tom Hanks shines in this This is one of his best movies It s right up there with Philadelphia awesome movie and Forrest Gump which are the two movies he won Oscars for He is such an amazing actor The plane crash scene is very nerve racking and it keeps you on the edge of your seat But I just loved watching the scenes of him alone on that island trying to survive I thought the fact that all he had to talk to was a volleyball named Wilson was very creative Some scenes made me cringe like when he had to knock that tooth out of his mouth with a skate and a rock Ouch I also cringed at the parts where he cut his leg on the coral and his feet on the sharp rocks in the water Thank God there weren t any sharks around This movie makes you think What WOULD you do if you were stranded on a deserted island all by yourself This film was also very sad He loved Helen Hunt so much and he kept her picture all those years Then he finds out she s married to HIS doctor and they ve got a child after he s rescued The scene where he lost Wilson was also kind of sad That was his only friend for four years The transformations that Tom had to go through to make this movie were also amazing He truly is one of the best actors out there This is one of the greatest movies ever made and I thoroughly enjoyed it I am so glad I own it on DVD now Thanks for reading my review,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566258/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2002,good but something missing,I liked this movie but from start to finish I kept feeling like something was missing I think what it may have been was character development I m sure the director as well as the viewers wanted to get on with the main character getting deserted on the island but I think they hurried it a bit too much The whole time that Chuck I think that s right is on the island we see just how much he loves his wife Kelly but we can t really relate because we hardly know her That s the way I felt anyway And even Chuck we don t really know him we know that he takes his work very seriously and allows it to take time away from his wife but that s about it I just didn t really feel I knew the characters But the portion of the movie starting from the crash and the time he is on the island I thought was very good I know many people would have laughed at the idea of a grown man making friends with a volleyball but I think if anybody was alone on an island for 4 years they might be desperate enough to form a close personal relationship with a volleyball I might talk to an inanimate object after being left alone for a few hours but then again I might be a little crazy anyhow overall I liked the movie and I gave it an 8 but I thought it needed better character development Tom Hanks did an excellent job but the lack of character development took away from his good performance I thought Also I thought it should have explained that special package a bit more For some reason this package meant a lot to Chuck I chalked it up to well he had an intuitive feeling but I thought maybe I was missing something,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566103/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2001,A Superlative Performance,After seeing Cast Away you realize just why Tom Hanks is our generation s finest actor To be able to carry off a movie on his own with liitle or no dialogue for major sections of the movie is quite the achievement not to mention the difficult conditions that the movie was shot under and the physical demands of the role as well Although there are parts of the movie that feel rather stunted it is a movie about a man stranded on an island and trying to cope with loneliness and survival on his own What I loved was the middle part when he s on his own but there is no music no drama just Tom Hanks and the sights and sounds of the island around him Ahhh I lust after that tranquility don t get me wrong I don t ever wanna be stranded I think I d die within days The Academy chose Russell Crowe instead for Best Actor Now I am an Aussie myself well Indian born but true blue at heart and I was glad for Russell he s a gem of an actor but it truly did belong to one guy who wasn t even nominated Michael Douglas for Wonder Boys was my clear choice for Best Actor But after his non nomination I was firmly behind Tom Hanks making it three in a row Do not watch this movie on a Saturday night with friends Watch it all alone and rejoice in the fact that we have an actor of Tom s calibre for our entertainment Cheers Rahul Prasad,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565867/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2000,A film that falls somewhat short of its lofty goals,My trip to my small hometown of Peterborough Ontario included a visit to their new Galaxy Theatre I must say I am impressed In a city of 65 000 to see a theatre that would be at home in a major centre was quite a surprise On the schedule for the night was Cast Away One of the saddest lessons I learned was that importing a high class theatre does not guarentee a high class audience My enjoyment of the film was harmed immensely by chatty idiots all around me To quote Max Eilerson from the criminally short lived Babylon 5 Crusade series I hate it when I go the movies with kids in the audience because there s always someone there that tells me I can t kill them when they get loud Now who makes up these rules anyway With that out of my system I ll move on to describe the film First will come my spoiler free review and some spoiler notes will be at the bottom You have been warned Cast Away dares a great deal Only the attachment of big names like Hanks and Zemeckis could have gotten this movie made And to be certain Hanks is amazing and should be considered the Oscar frontrunner as of now His performance is very believable and the lengths he went to for the role should be given credit by many in the Academy Cast Away is based on a book and before seeing the film I read a review speculating the film would shy away from many of the darker aspects of the storyline It doesn t However there is so much story to cover here that much of it has to be told in shorthand This is not a film that spoon feeds its audience everything they need to know You are expected to be able to fill in a lot of gaps yourself It s refreshing to be treated as a thinking perceiving being for a change though judging from the comments of idiots around me they weren t up to the task I guess I won t recommend the film to idiots which should only serve to enhance the moviegoing experience of others but the gaps in narrative can be jarring at times Still if the greatest fault of the film is that its reach exceeds its grasp that is only because it has reached very far And a film that dares and falls short is far more satisfying to watch than a formulaic film that touches all the bases in a routine home run I give Cast Away an 8 out of 10,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566159/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2002,Notes on the ending (SPOILERS AHOY),First things first to that guy from Ireland who claimed Hanks was still fat after four years on the island i suggest you go get your eyesight checked He looked very much NOT fat he looked as a person would look after four years of a coconut crab fish diet If you expected him to look like gandhi then you re out of your mind he DID eat out there If you expected him to look like some track and field athlete you re again out of your mind people who don t partake in an excercise program coupled with a balanced diet don t actually look like that didn t you know As to the movie well made brilliant acting by Hanks the first half hour was a bit too long 20 minutes would have sufficed As to the ending I don t buy the love of my life talk If Chuck was the love of Kelly s life she could have full well dumped the dentist People get divorced over issues far more trivial than the love of one s life returning from death Abandoning one s husband doesn t mean abandoning one s child And speaking of the child from the pictures around the house she looked to be about 3 4 years old Seems she got pregnant rather hastily after the crash and subsequent shacking up with Chris Noth Okay would be wholly plausible but Zemeckis directs and Hunt acts in a way to make the character a person for whom Hanks WAS the love of her life so she just lets it go for the children,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566161/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,God knows what made people so love this movie,For the most part I felt what could be shown in two hours could be done in a matter of twenty minutes Yes I understand that it wouldn t create the same feeling but boredom killed me as I continued watching movie What stopped me from leaving it was I was looking forward to a great ending But that s me that s how my taste works I leave this with a 2 10,2.0,2.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5500777/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2023,A classic dashed with Hank sauce,From the beautifully shot crash to the final escape it s hard to bring up survival media without being reminded of this movie Is it perfect Well that s a matter of preference It falls to an eight for me simply due to the blas drama and romance typical of movies from this period and of Tom Hanks He is an exceptional actor and the advent of Wilson was iconic providing some much needed humanity ironically and dry comedic relief These are the strengths of this movie and have cemented it as a classic There s a lot you can do with this setting and the time span of 4 years In fact a lot more would happen than what s even shown assuming he wouldn t have developed an infection in his leg from that under emphasized major injury He does no base building and is even depicted sleeping on a rock which is uncharacteristic of men Since the movie is somewhat based on reality these are weaknesses To be frank the beginning was boring for me and the ending too bittersweet leaving me with a feeling of emptiness This is something I m not a fan of and I m assuming others given the rating But I understand that this is also less common in cinema and was built to add meaning Yet with the level of cinematography acting etc As well as a favorable setting it is hard to go wrong And of course Wilson So it has earned its place to say the least,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9327416/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2002,A Normal Guy... A Stranded Guy...

25 March 2001,"A Story Of Loss, and Survival",This movie has been reviwed by many and has taken some blows that do not do the story credit This is not a story for those who ve become accustomed to fast paced action although there are moments of that This is the story of one who is forced to respond to events survive or perish And given that it is the story of survival on an isolated South Pacific island it has a pace that probably does not satisfy some It is a satisfying movie however for those that would give in to it It is missing that last magical integration of elements that could elevate it to a classic which it is not It is however a wonderful story that leaves one with an overriding sense of loss with just the element of hope and survival at the end that brings the loss into balance The cinematography has moments that are breathtaking especially when the viewer is given the sense of isolation amidst the vastness of the ocean For one who grew up in that Pacific these moments were especially effective This movie may not be for everyone but for those who are ready for something other than chocolate and vanilla this may just hit the spot I recommend it,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565864/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2010,rewind of scene to lengthen it,I love this film and whenever it s on I watch it I even own a DVD copy and have been known to watch it on that format The only thing that truly bugs me is the end the close up of Jack at his crossroads is rewound then played again I know this is for a brief second or two but it s so obvious that it s annoying There are so many other films that don t rate the reviews that do this and that s expected I just watched it again and felt the urge to comment about it So there I feel a little better but that rewound scene is always gonna be there and it really bugs me If you re a fan of the film and have never noticed this you need to watch it again,10.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2331890/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2005,Who knows what the tide could bring?,This is my favorite Tom Hanks performance He carried the movie through out It is also one of the most tragic movies After crashing on his way to work for Fed Ex and leaving his lover Helen Hunt Chuck Noland Hanks must live on an island for about five years He makes friends with a volleyball name Wilson I am still trying to figure out whether or not his relationship with Wilson helped him keep his sanity or not When Noland returns home for the climax he must learn about how time ran his life and how when he lost it it erased everything he ever had Cast Away is a powerful movie that keeps you on your seat through out,10.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1023100/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2004,Cast Away- Emotionally,I believe the older a person is the better one is able to understand what Chuck Noland experienced on that island One has to be beat up a little to gain life s true perspective Watching the movie several times I still am moved by Hank s ability to bring out the sadness of his character s plight At 66 years old I see things in the movie that move me to tears About my third viewing I was moved by the scene of his getting over the wave As he turns to start rowing he looks back toward the island That look on his face shows such ambivalence What he learned on that island has such a bittersweet after taste This is so significant to Chuck that he turns Wilson around so he can take a look Then the rain and fog come in to fade out the island Great stuff This is where also the theme music begins it has been silent on the island What a moving musical score It comes in when there is emtional conflict in the remaining portion of the story,0.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566277/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2003,Romanticize,Possible spoilers within A man alone on a island is a decent idea obviously But it doesn t work here The problem is that it is excessively real and that isn t interesting in this case We do want to see ourself and we do that in Tom but we also want escapism in movies At least if we happen to be on an deserted island which i furthermore can t imagine many people have been Romanticizing is the key I believe,6.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566120/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2012,Tom Hanks Can Do No Wrong :),Cast Away has a place in my top ten greatest movies of all time Which includes Forrest Gump another Tom Hanks classic Cast Away is perfect Every actor actress played their parts to perfection I honestly can t pick out one flaw This movie wasn t too long or too short It was extremely entertaining and is guaranteed to have you guessing whats going to happen next you ll be surprised more than once Movies with predictable scenes can take away your interest in watching them but this movie has a ton of scenes that you just won t see coming It was a perfect balance of funny thriller drama and romance all put together If you haven t seen this yet you gotta pop some deliciously sweet kettle corn Get yourself a crave case from White Castle Pick your favorite beverage and get ready to sit back and witness one of the greatest movies you ll ever watch,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2615925/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2021,Not a Fan...,I ve enjoyed the vast majority of Tom Hanks movies Not this one or Forrest Gump These characters are way too annoying Here Hanks plays an Uber type A personality I loathe these people I know they believe that they re the reason the Sun rises each day and that civilization even exists They re not they are the reason we are destroying the Earth and killing each other in every more horrific ways So the movie opens with Hanks character Chuck Noland manipulating the world around him to do his nefarious bidding He s obsessed with FedEx and getting everything done yesterday His friends are obsessed his family is so obsessed they spend holiday dinners discussing the mythic origins of FedEx I have little empathy for the character and since the entire movie revolves around him the movie fails Or maybe not Maybe it s a scathing indictment of these people After all he loses his friends a big chunk of his life and even his wife But no in the end he just resumes his asinine course and delivers another package This is just a commercial for FedEx corporate America and capitalism,6.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7543209/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2005,"Good, but not as good as I thought it would be.",This film like a lot of films was hyped up and did not in my opinion live up to the hype It was to me very slow moving to him finally arriving on the island The acting was good and the story was easily comprehensible but overall it is a better than average Tom Hanks movie I think the FedEx scenes were long and drawn out and were not completely necessary to the plot Tom Hanks talks to Volley ball Wilson on deserted uncharted island That is the basic crux of the movie In other words been there done that Well maybe not a Volley ball I think that Hanks saved this movie from being less than adequate Helen Hunt was good but there is not enough of her in the movie either,6.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1125795/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2001,Simply beautiful cinema,There is little doubt in my mind that people would just rag on this movie However Bob Zemeckis s film making talent just got even better and he didn t need his usual plethora of special effects to depict the movie He in fact used them but much more subtlely The beauty of this movie is the ending I real life it could only end this way and it was film making magic One thing comes to mind the winged logo that kept Hank s character going throughout his trials and trevails there were lots of things that madfe him keep going Wilson a picture of Helen Hunt etc Little did he know even in search of the packages rightful receipient that another life far removed from the one with Helen Hunt or alone on the island was on the horizon It s depicts fate the human heart and more then anything hope Tom Hanks once again has turned in a performance of a lifetime and while many will feel that he lost out to a Richard Burton s ghost like performance by Russell Crowe this years awards which was severely criticized beforehand for the lack of quality It sure produced some great and epic movies Gladiator Traffic and Castaway not withstanding As a movie enthusiast I can only look even more forward to the future We have now entered into a Golden Age of Film that may be looked on in years forthcoming as monumental Certainly Castaway has helped in this cause,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565899/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,Great Movie but. . .,It really seem like one big ad for Federal Express I think it would have been better if there was a fake company Hanks character worked for I guess the same would apply for the ball named Wilson there is too much commercialization in American movies So much so now that there is no need for ads in between breaks now You see an actor drinking a Coke calling someone on an Ericsson cell phone driving a Pontiac Aztec That trend is taking away from the true art that was American film,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565606/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2008,review,I have heard many people call this Fed ex add and i have to agree with them It seen Fed ex bosses abuse their workers they have no lives their jobs consume them their family life suffers and even then the packages still go out late Their planes aren t safe their pilots are poor and if they do loose a package they have no problem opening it to see if there is anything useful inside Very exciting start when the plane went down laughable to find out that Tom Hanks was able to survive the crash from 25 000 feet Anyone who works in shipping has to wonder why a package being delivered to Texas would have ever been on a Fed ex plane going over the South Pacific It wasn t logical Last of all i couls not accept the fact that his girlfriend could turn her back on the love of her life only one year after he disappeared and married someone else It actually made me quite angry at the end,2.0,6.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1806928/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2001,Excellent movie with BIG flaws,This is an entertaining and visually stunning movie that has something terribly wrong with it That something is inconsistency I think both writer and director contributed to the good and the bad Again and again ideas of pure genius are mixed with unlikely even irrational points that are impossible to accept For starters could a Caucasian spend 4 years in the blazing sun of a tropical island and come away with crusted lips and no trace of sunburn Not even a tan Tom Hanks is good and likeable as always But he carries the picture only in the sense that for much of it no one else is onscreen Although his role calls for him to do lots of unusual things they re really script stunts not acting He needs that talent only sporadically For me the film s 3 big plusses are the plane crash the photography and the story s conclusion The crash at sea is seen wholly from inside the craft from the passengers point of view It s reminiscent of Hitchcock s masterful clipper crash in Foreign Correspondent 60 years earlier The photography by Don Burgess keeps us in precisely the right place every second His camera is often at water level yet thanks to digital work I assume there s never a drop on the lens The movie ends in an ideal location and on a perfect note of indecision and nearly limitless possibilities Among the film s best bits is Wilson Tom s volley ball companion whose loss is heartbreaking For a good and skillful movie however far too many questions remain The island s beach is littered with FedEx packages from the plane s cargo yet it seems days before Tom even thinks to look in them for useful items Why Eventually nearly everything proves to be valuable He also takes too long to secure the inflatable life raft that got him from the crash site to the island And once that s lost in an unsuccessful attempt to get away ages pass before he even thinks of trying to BUILD some sort of escape craft I just don t believe it Among the dumber script flaws is Tom s toothache With all the genuine crises facing a castaway this affliction seems contrived and superfluous But despite the irritating lapses in Cast Away the splendid good points outweigh the clumsy ones and best parts are unforgettable 8 stars out of 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565688/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2013,true grit comes through,from the very first scenes of the plane in a crash dive robert zemeckis has once again proved what a great director he was and probably the only one who could pull you through this drama is someone of tom hanks capacity once again hanks versatility as an actor has shown through as one thinks along with him as to the next important thing to do one almost becomes hanks character himself on the astute recommendation of a friend i picked this one to see don t know how i missed it back then and she was right this is engrossing to the hilt and uncompromising in its ability to pull you in if you haven t already seen it go out and rent it today or if you ve seen it already do it again it s certainly worth the 2 hrs and 23 mins worth,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2733968/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,spoon-feeding you pseudointellectual fluff,This movie is the dumbest thing ever If you are under 40 years of age and are not currently experiencing a mid life crisis skip it The message too simple We know that materialism is bad I have a degree in Sociology so maybe it was a little too remedial for me but come on aren t we all a little beyond this simple a life lesson Unless you are a yuppie and are currently also on your cell phone this movie will not enlighten you The acting too bad Helen Hunt CANNOT ACT Hello Hollywood Are you reading this SHE CANNOT ACT SPOILERS She shows no emotion when he comes back when she says she cannot take him back nothing And the plot that she would not try to take him back is totally unsupported since the creators thought we needed to see 45 minutes of footage of him trying to open a stupid coconut instead of developing her character who only has about 5 minutes of screen time The movie will not surprise you ever Everything everything is foreshadowed The film is as dry as toast And spoon fed Did we need to see him play with the lighter to realize how much we take fire for granted WASN T THE 30 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE OF HIM RUBBING STICKS ENOUGH And why on earth did he keep that package The 5 year old in front of me asked out loud HOW did it save his life and the whole section turned to their partners and whispered yeah how DID it save his life The film was too cute too perfect and had a warmed over you never know what the tide will bring in maybe a box of chocolates type moral Gee thanks I hadn t considered that I still cannot believe that they had to go there and make a happy ending where he finds some new woman In fact the romantic subplot altogether seemed incomplete undeveloped secondary and just added in because the executives formulas say that movies need a romantic sub plot even if it adds nothing to a movie Instead of 2 hours of Hanks trying to eat a coconut and talking to a volleyball perhaps the film could have given us some REAL insight to the metamorphosis in his mind OR let us know what was going on in her life They could have cross cut scenes between the two to break the boredom and complete the film And lets face it the volleyball was just a device so we could hear his thoughts really wasn t it I know it was supposed to show him as crazy and needing companionship but I think that they only really used it as a device The movie succeeds in two areas 1 It really does make you go through what he goes through the viewer feels bored tired exhausted and starts to go crazy just like he does The director accomplished that task And 2 the film displays human vs nonhuman technology Traditional Weberian theory quite well Before the crash he uses nonhuman technology things that control people the clock beepers etc On the island he uses human technology things that people control a blade to cut coconuts tree bark to make rope etc But alas I am a socialist and realized a long time ago that the value of an item is decided by its usefullness and not its so called market price Nothing new to me or the Russians in the film I was most surprised that FED EX would use its name in a film that A displays a crash and death of employees and B as mentioned in the above 2 paragraphs is essentially anti capitalism But hey advertising execs are never too smart and probably just thought there s a blockbuster lets hop on it A bit of irony no,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566074/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2000,Tom Hanks Does It Again....,Great movie Even though it will become a commercial success Cast Away has this understated edginess to it It s by far the most captivating performance by Hanks since his Oscar winning turn in Philadelphia He is by far one of the best actors alive This movie has everything Slapstick comedy drama action oh and did I forget to mention Tom Hanks He does a terrific job of making the audience feel what he feels I felt like I was on that island with him And then when 4 years had passed and I saw his frail body on the screen my heart ached Never in my entire movie going experience had I empathized with a character so much You know you re watching a terrific artist when they say and do very little and still seem to ignite the screen His subtlety was brillant and so was the film,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565736/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2004,Stands the test of time...,Upon my second viewing of Cast Away on television I became sad sad because I had forgotten what an outstanding movie it truly is To me it s one of those films that can easily stand the test of time and no matter how many times you see it it s STILL that good Zemeckis is one of my favorite directors and just does an amazing job of using not only Tom Hanks but the surrounding environment appropriate timing on music and lack of and overall camera work to make you feel everything Chuck Noland does And ultimately that s EXACTLY what a director should do It s very well done,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566264/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2001,Cast Away over rated,I heard many great things about Hank s performance in this movie When I watched it I couldn t help but turn my head at times not because of grotesque scenes or scenes that were too real Instead there were scenes of Hanks getting down on his belly and melodramatically licking water droplets Come on Also the scene where he 4 years later can harpoon a fish from 20 plus feed out The camera pans up to him standing there all stoic nonesense I realize that some of this is the directors fault letting Hanks go too far with some of this stuff But for the people tauting this as Hanks for Oscar etc no way Also the last 3rd of the movie lagged and could have editted to half Not a great film too long and too many melodramatic scenes Also the whale scene was so fake I couldn t take it With all the modern technology these days that scene was pathetic As for the product placement I didn t find it distracting as it was part of the story fortunately or not,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565843/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2023,great acting from Ton Hank,I almost skipped the first 30 mins it has nothing to do with the island Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film I revisit this film about once a year and find things about it that make it even better with each viewing The story is so well written in its simplicity and Helen Hunt and Hanks have an amazing chemistry It is a love story with action and heartbreak like few films have been able to pull together I guarantee you will never pass a Wilson volleyball again without a big smile It is so well directed with an absolutely stunning performance by Tom Hanks that you are going to remember it forever It is very positive that it starts by building some story creating some romance and then it becomes survival emotional and dramatic Some scenes are classic a true piece of art Ending could go to 2 directions but the writer wasn t too greedy and he made the reasonable logical decision that tells a lot about this love story That was good too,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9101534/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2005,Incredibly interesting.,Robert Zemekis and Tom Hanks pull off this magnificent film seemingly without much effort The movie stars really one man and takes place really on one island So what makes it so good For starters this movie is very original At first who wants to see a movie about a guy stuck on an island No one BUT then you ask who wants to see a movie about a man who struggles against his environment forces to make friends with a volleyball and desperate to escape to see his long lost wife after five years well everyone Tom Hanks should have been at least up for an Oscar for this performance It was truly remarkable Not only was this movie very good but it was also popular Wilson volleyballs will never seem the same after watching this movie,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1002842/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,Hanks needs better material,Tom Hanks is fine in Cast Away It s too bad the script is another of Zemeckis s uplifting pieces of puffery Hanks does a fine job in the center of the film the portion devoted to his stranding on an island with little hope of return to civilization Here the character is well drawn and his strength of determination is admirable It is when he is rescued that the film falls apart Instead of all the product pushing of Fed Ex and his evident affection for those responsible for the loss of a large chunk of his life it would be a great deal more satisfying to see him getting a high powered lawyer to sue the blazes out of them It is time for Hanks to stop being likeable and take the role of a thoroughly despicable character He runs the risk of continuing to be the Jimmy Stewart of this generation One of those was enough No more treacle,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565625/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,Damned Good !,Well after seeing his latest film I feel that I can forgive Robert Zemeckis for his lame ass Summer film and inexplicably a HIT that aped Hitchcock in the worst way s What Lies Beneath That film was made while production was shut down on Cast Away so that star Tom Hanks could recuperate Its about time that Hanks was declared the modern day Gary Cooper and or James Stewart as he is just so memorable in everything that he does and nobody plays the common man as well as he does The trick is all his common man characters are so wonderfully complicated and fascinating to watch Despite that Hanks always brings something different to each role and in Cast Away as the taskmaster Fed Ex dude Chuck Noland he invests the character with strength pathos and early on a bit of surly attitude he seems a bit nasty barking out orders to the confused Russian Fed Exers at the start but ultimatley Noland is a man that we care about and we want to see him LIVE and return to his beloved played by an unusually restrained Helen Hunt I enjoyed the bejeebers out of Cast Away and I recommend that you rush out and see this right after you get done digesting your thirtieth dry turkey sandwich its a Christmas release natch and I guarantee that the tryptophonic effects of the bird will have no effect on you as you watch Hanks offer up an acting tour de force Note to Robert Zemeckis all is forgiven for What Lies Beneath,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566138/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2001,"Engaging Thriller, without a Villain",I finally saw Castaway and thought it was an absorbing drama of human resourcefulness I resisted seeing it for fear that the time spent by the Tom Hanks character in isolation marooned on an island would be boring It wasn t The cinematography is great beautiful sunsets and skylines crashing waves and natural beauty The endurance skills he develops are admirable as are the ways he tackles small crises and shares his thoughts with us His survival episodes engage us including building a fire searching for water and food communicating for help fighting the elements looking for life on the island attending to his wounds simulating a human companion and maintaining his sanity His appearance after an extended period with a full beard and loincloth make him look like a genuine prehistoric man The film s strength is how Tom Hanks makes it all believable It would be hard for a lesser actor to pull it off Adding to the movie s appeal is the simplicity of the story It s man versus nature for survival what could be simpler An auxiliary but equally straightforward plot is his courtship with Helen Hunt There are no complex motives to decipher nor cruelty or violence We can all safely root for Hanks as he battles his loneliness his environment and his separation from his fianc e It can roughly be compared to Jaws with the non human enemy changed from a whale to the forces of nature The air crash that leads to his ordeal is magnificently dramatized but is not for the faint of heart Those with a fear of flying may not want to see it although the plane itself is not a commercial airliner Even his romance with Helen Hunt dismissed as contrived by some rang true for me That may be because attractions between people around 40 are rarely shown in films and are seldom resolved as depicted here The publicity for FedEx in the film is extensive and positive and probably merited I certainly recommend this movie,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565795/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2000,An amazing experience.,The best way to describe Cast Away is that it isn t a movie it s an experience It seems like so much more than just a movie it is almost like you are living on the island with Tom Hanks For the duration of the film I found myself totally lost in it I was also a cast away There are a few films which are able to have just one brilliant moment in the whole picture Cast Away contains several if not the entire movie itself The plane crash is one of the most intense scenes in recent memory and rivals anything in The Perfect Storm The scenes where Chuck Hanks is trying to make a fire have a desperation and perseverance that accompany them The raft scenes are also outstanding and incredibly suspenseful The best part of Cast Away is no doubt Tom Hanks I have never seen an actor carry a film on his shoulders like Hanks does The majority of the film is Hanks and only Hanks It takes an amazing performance to pull something like that off and he delivers His emotional state throughout his time on the island changes and he doesn t have to say anything It s all in the eyes and the body language Tom Hanks may not beat Russell Crowe for best actor but a nomination is assured The mastermind behind Cast Away is none other than Robert Zemeckis He directs with patience and maturity He allows Hanks the breathing room to make the tedious island scenes work I have not seen editing this effective since JFK He delivers a movie with a lot of suspense and drama The film s end is one of the best I ve ever seen and really is appropriate Go to the theater and experience Cast Away Remember to bring your beach towel and sun block,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565547/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2017,Chuck was a time obsessed FedEx executive who was on his way to an assignment in Malaysia when his plane crashed somewhere over the Pacific during a raging storm.,Cast Away was released in 2000 starring Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland Chuck was a time obsessed FedEx executive who was on his way to an assignment in Malaysia when his plane crashed somewhere over the Pacific during a raging storm As the only survivor Chuck washed ashore on a desolate island On this island Chuck learns to survive after he finally realizes that no help will come for him The theme that Cast Away is based around is to never take things for granted At the start of the film Chuck leaves behind the girl of his dreams because he s always chasing time Little did Chuck know when he boarded the Malaysian plane his schedule was about to clear up for the next four years Chuck was driven to replace his relationship with a volleyball named Wilson that this is when it was finally apparent to him what he lost When Chuck finally escapes the island and finds his way back home the first thing he says to Kelly is that he should have never left that night You could always tell how much Chuck regretted leaving her that night on the island one of his pass times was laying in the dark shining a flashlight on the portrait she gave him before he left This is a perfect example of how they used lighting to show how Chuck was realizing what he s missing He was hoping that she was still there waiting for him When Kelly found out that Chuck was alive her world was turned upside down everyone kept telling her that he was dead they even had a funeral for him Unfortunately for both she ended up moving on and having a family with someone else all because Chuck left that day and never returned The film Wall E exemplifies a similar theme having robots to clean up after the mess that humans made The humans in the film kept taking the robots for granted and never realized that they developed a dependency on them This dependency lead the robots to become misguided all while the humans had no idea what was going on To tie this together Chuck is similar to the humans he became dependent on keeping schedule and took granted that the one he loved will always be there waiting for him and the robot captain is similar to Kelly as she became misguided by others saying that he would not return to her,7.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3697109/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2006,Fantastic Metaphor for Divorce,On the surface this movie appears to be another stranded on an island story however it s a very deep metaphoric exploration of a man s experience of going through a divorce The acting pacing and audio are sensational Great work by all involved with the silver lining that life does go on and you can find love again Hanks at his absolute best and perhaps more deserving of a best actor award than any of his prior performances Hopefully over time this movie will garner the staying power and recognition that it truly deserves,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1545763/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,"Good, except for the publicity",this is meant for people who saw the movie Overall I would say I enjoyed this movie It s been a while since a 2h30 film didn t seem long and I didn t complain about the chair since The Green Mile actually but that s another story It s a good movie but yes it could have been better Before I went to see this movie I was pretty sure it would be a movie to make money out of the Survivor wave but it s a little different than I tought But I would have liked to see more of the life on the island instead of the beginning and the end his suicide attempt for instance and more That movie should have been 3 hours it would have been worth it Many people didn t see the package on the raft well look again it s used as a pillow and with a lot of videotape around it it s there all the way But again why didn t he open it That s another part of the very annoying publicity in this movie the reason why this package saved his life is because it gave him a REASON to live this package and his fiancee he kept this package because he wanted to deliver it and the photo of his fiancee also I don t see another reason But again I was a little sick of seeing overuse of publicity in this movie FedEx Dr Pepper Wilson come on we are paying to go see those movies cut the prices if you want to add publicity in the movie this way we ll agree This is enough to keep me using UPS as a courier service Seriously I found that part of the movie very annoying having a fake company would ve been better But besides that that was a good movie but I would have liked to see more from it I found it too short even for a 2h30 movie My 2 cents enjoy,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566139/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2001,"More island, less mainland",I felt the movie TOLD me about how much it would suck to be stuck on an island I would ve opted for an additional ten or fifteen minutes of running time on the island to reinforce how excruciating it would have been Sorry Four Years Later just doesn t cut it The time could ve easily been made up by losing some of the simpering at the end such as the explanation about the aborted hanging Bonus points however for making me get sniffly about a bloody volleyball The credit for that rests entirely with Tom Hanks,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565705/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2010,Tom Hanks refreshingly out of his comfort zone,This movie is a refreshing and successful representation of isolated life and survival Well written and directed exceptionally The basic concept lack originality but the depiction accounted for it Emotionally it depicts struggle love and underlying depressing themes with a splash of comedy at the beginning to lighten the feel a little well chosen otherwise one of the main themes may have been depression As for the acting Hanks is brilliant and clearly breaks free of his stereotypical extroverted anxious character Very good emotional depiction considering the fact that for long stretches in the movie he has no lines to work with whatsoever Hunt is good but a little disappointing in comparison to her in As Good as it Gets Overall a very good movie and an exceptional piece of Hanks,9.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2204852/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2001,Predictable and Pointless,Cast Away 2000 Out of Reviewed by Matt Doolittle This is a movie about Chuck Nolan or was it Jack I don t know because different people call him different names At one point he is Jack and the next he is Chuck Anyway he is married to his job and is about to get married to his girlfriend He is then called to South America for his job He gets on a plane and later the plane crashes in the Pacific Ocean He is the only survivor and he floats on a raft until he finds an island The island has nothing on it except for the FED X packages from his plane He later opens them only to find a pair of ice skates a volleyball and some other seemingly useless items He lives on the island for 5 years and goes somewhat insane until he figures out a way to get off By this time the volleyball is his best friend named Wilson and they talk to each other all of the time He makes it back to his home and he finds out that every one thinks he is dead Actually they have already had a funeral for him and everything so he then has to decide how to start his life over Although a funny movie it is pretty pointless The plane crash is no big surprise because he says goodbye so many times that you know something is going to go wrong Also there is no chemistry between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt so their relationship is pretty unbelievable The volleyball is an attempt to be funny but just gets annoying after a while Over the period of Tom Hanks stay on the island he seems pretty crazy but yet he knows exactly what day it is and he practically does Calculus in his head to achieve his plan to get off the island Tom Hanks does a good job with his role but I was a little disappointed with Helen Hunt s character Although she does a good job with it there is not much she can do She is supposed to be a main character yet she has about 10 lines in the whole movie This movie is not horrible but is not great either but if you are one of those people who like happy medians this is your show,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565499/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2001,A much used plotline doesnt diminish this film's power....,Rating 1 2 out of 4 Review When I first heard the plot outline for CAST AWAY I was praying to God that Hollywood wasn t going to go back to Gilligan s Island territory and use a much respected actor Tom Hanks as a way to make viewers not realize their the plot had absolutely no originality which about 60 of all Hollywood films are currently and increasing every year However thanks to a perceptive screenplay by William Broyles Jr this film practically made me disappointed with myself for making those assumptions Even worse it wasn t until I saw Hanks on the THE TONIGHT SHOW a few months later and explaining that his inspiration for CAST AWAY came when he viewed a documentary on the life and disappearance of Amelia Earhart as well as the startling theory that she may have lived another 50 years on a deserted island after being discovered missing On that note there will most likely not be another time I will misjudge Hollywood for what I hear before I actually buy my ticket and popcorn and watch the movie and not putting my opinions down on paper before I actually watch the final frame Director Robert Zemeckis who helmed the much loved favorites BACK TO THE FUTURE CONTACT and WHAT LIES BENEATH teams with Hanks for the very first time to tell the story of a FEDEX employee who finds himself washed ashore on a Pacific island after a frightening plane crash It s now Man vs Nature as Hanks collects small amounts of water from coconuts and rain builds a fire to cook crab make attempts let people know he is there and be rescued and even creating a companion to talk to a Wilson volleyball I will not divulge what happens to Hanks eventually for the purpose that this film develops an emotional intensity during the final half four Just as it sounds this is Tom Hanks show all the way the two time Academy Award winner has been giving outstanding trademark performances all throughout his career from playing a 12 year old trapped inside the body of a 30 year old BIG to a homosexual battling AIDS PHILADELPHIA and finally to a sweet simpleton who only is only barely aware of his surroundings and the people in this life FORREST GUMP In CAST AWAY Hanks makes his character someone to actually care about which is one of the most important elements in any good performance he makes his lost FEDEX worker convincingly go through different emotional phases which results in a strong development in the character Academy Award winner Helen Hunt AS GOOD AS IT GETS plays the woman he loves with earnestness and compassion Still the one character that practically steals the film is Wilson the volleyball who Hanks creates as a friend in order escape insanity and as a lesser reason to have something if not someone to talk to Wilson s final sequence is truly moving and unforgettable In more ways than one CAST AWAY surprised me and I loved it from beginning to end if anything I truly believe that with any other actor besides Hanks the character would be dull and the viewer wouldn t get involved The film also boasts a fine score by Alan Silvestri a regular on many Zemeckis films as well as gorgeous photography and finally William Broyles Jr s wonderful script which managed to dodge cliches and make the film overall seem new and fresh For that reason I know that next time I go see a film a famliar story that I will not print a word until the theater s lights illuminate once again,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565888/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2001,"Like drinking a warm, flat soft drink.",This film is just like that It is good if your desperate and it doesn t contain anything awful but you could have better and it leaves you unsatisfied and you wouldn t want to have it again I liked Tom Hanks in this but would just as well see him in something like Apollo 13 or Forest Gump There were a few creative and entertaining elements here and there but the ending was bad So his girlfriend got with some other guy and married him Big deal He was gone for 4 years did he just expect her to wait by the phone for all that time In closing you ll probably see the film but don t make the mistake that I did going in with high expectations,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565555/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2019,Solid,I didn t like the time jump in the middle of the film and I think it was pretty obvious the scenes after he got back from the island were shot before some of the ones on there and at the beginning the camera angle on the parcel was terrible but I enjoyed 90 of this movie and it s definitely a must watch if you re looking for something to do The acting is spot on for the most part and the film really makes you think about the gap in time By the time Chuck is stranded on the island is a perfect change of pace and by the time he gets back is a welcome change in pace Solid 8 10 I feel 2012 s Arrow references this film way too much,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4568711/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2000,This movie will leave you wondering why...,As always Tom Hanks gives us a wonderful performance It s really easy to enjoy spending time with him alone on an island talking to a volley ball but I don t know what they were thinking with the book ends they stuck on the movie I guess it comes back to my lack of enthusiasm for Helen Hunt she plays Hanks love interest in the movie or maybe just that things happen kind of fast First we re in Russia and we see that Hanks is an enthusiastic Fedex employee Then he s home for Christmas then he s on a plane then he crashes then it s four years later he escapes the island and next thing you know he s sitting on a plane going home to Memphis And what s the point of making him grow that awesome beard when he shaves it off as soon as he gets back to the motherland I will say however that it s a good movie in that you barely notice that it lasts 2 1 2 hours but it could have been so much better I know it s easy to criticize but keep in mind that I always extend props to those who work on features It s a lot of work and they do it well And please stop casting Helen Hunt she really ruins movies for me,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565569/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2001,Falling Coconuts,SPOILERS AHEAD FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END I regret to say that Cast Away is a terrible movie Even the title is a dead giveaway that we are about to be subjected to one of those unforgettable moral lessons that should be cast in bronze for the future generations to behold Which is too bad because I like the gentle quirkiness that Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis bring to the movies they do together One can almost feel the love they pour into their work well thought out carefully crafted professionally done pieces of entertainment Humble fables on a grand scale They consciously try not to insult the audience s intelligence or offend them in any way But the operative word I m using here is consciously And once we finally recognize what the moral of the fable MEANS what it is is deeply disturbing Chuck Noland Tom Hanks is a time obsessed overseas manager for Fed Ex whose plane crashes and gets stranded alone in a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean and when he gets back he finds that he has lost everything that mattered for him and helped him survive his ordeal Now totally lost and alone he must decide what road to take to go on with his life Not a bad idea for an adventure movie even if they turned it into a silly no brainer which this movie clearly isn t Being that so what happened For starters there is not one moment in Cast Away where I felt that anything was at stake Not once Since we know that at some point he will get back home those fat exposition scenes at the beginning are ripe for some neat payoffs we at least expect for something terrifying to happen to him while he is in the island And so we sit back and wait for those moments of transcendence to happen those shocking instants when he suddenly realizes that he is alone that he is mortal that he will never be rescued that he does not want to die We just don t want to watch him as he buries a dead body opens coconuts makes a fire knocks out an abscessed tooth or builds a raft We in the audience want to FEEL what is going on inside this man Those moments never do come Perhaps the most significant episode where he tries to take his own life is never actually shown but rather explained later in the most naked and weakest scene of the movie What we end up getting is a gleam in his eye a volleyball and the sound of falling coconuts and that last one is played for a couple of startlers and a laugh Hanks works very hard Harder than on any other thing he has done up to this point production was shut for one year until he lost fifty pounds and he IS impressive he is a gifted actor but he is still a lightweight actor and he is paralyzed by the too worked out conception this goddamned control freak mania among filmmakers to tie every single loose filament together until there is nothing not a single open space for us to walk into and rightfully reclaim as ours There is something else simmering under the surface of this movie Cast Away What it is being casted away Is it doubts Hopes Fear Jealousy Love Chuck Noland hated that island and returned to the white middle class values he was violently torn off he has ice in a glass again his work he lost his girl but still has another chance At the end we get our moment of transcendence the conception this movie was working towards from the beginning Noland alone in the intersection where the movie started looks around at the four roads he has to choose from His brow is clean No words come out of his mouth What decision is he going to make Music Fade to black End credits My guess is he doesn t need to make any decision he is Everyman we are meant to decide for him We witnessed his decency concern bravery toughness tenacity and self reliance He didn t really need anyone to survive We can do If Tom Hanks doesn t hurry up and cleans up his act he will turn into the favorite poster boy for the ultra conservative right Book burnings and Nazi flags should be the next step,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565882/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2001,Zemekis Owes me for this one.....,Warning contains spoilers not that there is much to spoil Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob what happened I truly expected better from the director that gave us the outrageous comedy of Used Cars and the warm and fuzzy whimsy not to mention airtight continuity of the Back to the Future films I can t say much that is positive about Cast Away except that whoever it was that got Federal Express to go along with this could sell ice cubes to Eskimos Tom Hanks is Chuck an annoyingly ambitious yuppie who trots the globe for FedEx verbally whipping third world FedEx employees about time being money After some scenes with his girlfriend including a huge family holiday dinner and melodramatic marriage proposal that do nothing to develop character he hops aboard a FedEx plane to dispense some more boot camp motivational tactics at some far flung FedEx hub You ll notice that I mention FedEx a lot because FedEx shows up in the movie so much that I think the film muist have been financed by FedEx product placement fees paid by FedEx when it absolutely positively has to be there overnight Anyhow Chuck s plane encounters a storm on the way to Tahitti and plummets nose first into the ocean an experience that he miraculously almost unbelievably survives Chuck finds himself on a small uninhabited island For the next hour we watch Chuck bang cocoanuts on rocks bang rocks on cocoanuts develop an unnatural relationship with a piece of sports equipment and then we suffer through an interminable amount of failed exposition with Chuck trying to light a fire When he finally gets that fire lit the scene is not triumphant instead you find yourself wishing that this insufferable yuppie corporate tool would just throw himself on the burning driftwood Then in a most flagrant cinematic cheat the film flashes forward four years Zap Just like that Thank goodness or we would have spent another hour watching Chuck learn to weave vines into rope One four years later morning a chunk of a construction site porta potty washes up that for the weakest of reasons makes it possible for Chuck to build a raft and sail it off the island He does is picked up by a passing freighter surprisingly not a FedEx ship and is returned to civilization Once there he finds his finacee married and his life literally at a crossroads Then the movie ends No resolution no further character development no sense that the character learned anything or was changed by his four years of solitude He comes back catches up on the missed sports scores accepts that he s lost the love of his life and carries on proving again that the character is nothing more than an insufferably shallow yuppie corporate tool I hate this man so much that I don t even want to ship things via FedEx anymore There s not even a scene of him reuniting with his gigantic family probably because he doesn t care about them either All he cares about is delivering one of the FedEx packages that washed up on the beach while he was stranded Corporate tool Corporate tool I was hoping the FedEx package contained a ham radio and a flare gun That would have been great But no the film ends with him standing at a crossroads with no hint of what he might do next or what he wants to do Two hours of nothing ending with a big nothing Tom Hanks is a fine actor but he doesn t have much to work with in Cast Away The film is like taking a vacation by shipping yourself FedEx there s no time to enjoy the scenery or make friends you just barrel through to the conclusion Unfortunatley when this package arrives the box is empty Instead I reccomend The Harlem Globtrotters on Giligan s Island The characters are much more likeable there s a better plot and the sports equipment is put to more entertaining use,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565938/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2002,Funny,When I saw this movie it was a non stop laughter fest It was hilarious seeing Tom Hanks yell at a volleyball It was also amusing to see him try to catch fish Overall I would give this a 10 out of 10 because it was funny good plot and the acting was good,10.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566165/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2008,What an amazing performance by Tom Hanks,Cast Away is phenomenal amazing indescribably fabulous and the list just goes on and on Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors to ever set foot on this planet yes but this wonder of a performance is a giant leap even for him Tom Hanks takes you through all of the roller coaster emotions that you actually experience during extreme loneliness Cast Away is just overall a brilliant film about what one man must go through to get back home When Tom Hanks meets and becomes friends with his volleyball friend I m not going to give out any names you actually start to become attached to the object just as Tom Hanks was in the film when what happens at the end happens the viewer actually feels sympathy for the volleyball That s how great this movie is The viewer actually begins to treat the ball as a person Cast Away is an instant classic and is a film that absolutely everyone should see,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1871508/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,"Thoughts About ""Wilson""",I did see the movie in the theater and did watch it twice on TNT over the weekend but the part about Wilson bothered me in the theater and it still bothers me since this was just a volleyball and even though I like volleyball and play it often my serve is just okay I hope that I d never make a volleyball into a companion My point in reality he did bury a man that he knew aside from saying Well that s it on burying the man s body without even a decent prayer it would have made more sense for him to do something that I did just yesterday on visiting my parent s graves it s their anniversary even though in your heart you know that they are not there another part of you deep down does feels comfortable talking to them when standing at the graveside In my mind it would have given Chuck Noland much more comfort if he had talked to this man as often as he felt the need to stand at his graveside during his time on the island again since many people do that every day in real life and this brings up another issue many in real life talk to God every day when alone I ve done this more than once why didn t he resort to this instead of using a rubber ball as a confidant It gave me the impression that Chuck might not believe in God since during the entire film he never mentioned God once except as an exclamation which isn t very useful to anyone though sadly it might have been the filmmaker s attempt to remain politically correct I did have to chuckle at the 4 Year Chuck Noland who looked very much like the 3 Years Running Forrest Gump Talk about life imitating art as I typed this the FedEx truck just pulled up and I signed for one small but dry FedEx box and one FedEx envelope the man didn t look like Ramon Fyodor or Chuck Take care Frank P S Did anyone notice Joe Conley s Ike Godsey from The Waltons in the role of Joe Wally in the Christmas Eve dinner table scene Apparently the Director even gave Joe the courtesy of having a line that everyone could hear since all went silent during his comment to Chuck on checking on this site sure enough it was Joe Conley,0.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493406/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2001,Dumb plot and interminably long,This movie might be enjoyable if you can shut off your brain to the inanity of the plot but since most of the moviegoers I know are more sentient than a Pet Rock walk out after the awesome effects in the plane crash scene or prepare to be bored for the remaining 2 hours Don t say I didn t warn you,1.0,3.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566071/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2001,Infomercial,OK so does anyone know how much FedEx payed to have their name plastered throughout this movie I can only think of a few scenes in the entire movie where their name wasn t on the screen That got very annoying The movie itself was just excruciatingly boring You could have easily trimmed 40 minutes off of it Just stay home and watch Forrest Gump on TV and wait for a FedEx commercial,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565627/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2001,FANTASTIC!,Once again Tom Hanks doesnt disappoint his fans his work is once again brilliant As in all his roles he delivers his lines with sheer genius quality however in this film he spends much of his time alone and not speaking yet his acting touches the audience as if he is verbally communicating Just the look of his face the gestures everything all communicates to us his pain and suffering The plane crash scene is just amazing it is so very vivid and you find yourself in your seat gripping the armrest and holding your breath as if you are a passenger on this plane as well What the character Tom Hanks plays goes thru in order to simply survive the plane crash is just the nightmare beginning for him I personally felt such a spiritual feeling from this movie His character s guardian angel is the one who gets him thru this long ordeal and perhaps you will agree with this interpretation once you see it This is really a must see film and please dont wait for the video or the television showing of it you MUST see and hear it on the big screen,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565826/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2000,Cast Away: about as thrilling as a nap,Well Tom Hanks acting was good the location was good and the photography was good However I found the movie to be long dull plodding a collection of cliches The story seemed stagnant and unoriginal and there seemed to be numerous chunks of the film that should have fallen to the cutting room floor Not a bad film but not a good film either at least insofar as entertainment value goes,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565933/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2001,What's all the noise about?,A friend and I went to see this movie the day it opened in our local cinema We heard so much about it and the reviews were very good so But we were very very disappointed There s no plot no character development no real excitement apart from the plane crash and no emotional involvement on the viewer s behalf True the main part of the movie is supposed to be slow calm and even ponderous but it s not it s boring Also the most interesting parts of the story are left out i e the time spent on the Island Instead we see Tom Hanks getting on the island getting a few scratches making fire and then he s suddenly on his way home like you would have expected otherwise what can you say about a movie in which a volley ball gets the best lines and its acting is much more convincing than mr Hanks Willson should get an oscar for his performance Otherwise this movie is so overlong boring and pretentious it s a sure winner of the Academy award,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565704/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2001,"great acting, but where did the years go?",Cast Away is a great film for the family to see together Except for being long it showed the resilence of a human being trying to survive The movie jumped from Tom Hank s arrival then suddenly it was 4 years later It might have made more sense if his years on the island were divided up into individual years In the beginning he was at a loss as how to survive By the end he knew how to use his resources In between it might have shown how with each year he acquired new skills The crash scene was really convincing Tom Hanks managed to inject some humor into his situation I loved the Wilson soccer ball made into a companion Toward the end he showed deep despair over his loss of it It s incredible how he managed to survive on that raft he made He seemed like more of an urban guy than some rugged survivalist Losing his girlfriend to another man was a sad reality but if he survived a hostile environment for 4 years he d survive this too,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565873/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,True to life,A very well crafted film There were absolutely no shortcuts taken in the plot something I admire greatly Every response was true to the characters The acting was superb The crash was one of the most frightening scenes I have ever seen Someone I talked to who hadn t seen the film said he heard that scene dragged on I replied that I too had wanted it to end but not because it was dragging but because it was truly horrifying maybe that s what they meant Great filmmaking,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566020/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2007,SuperMan Get's Marooned!,As much as I love Tom Hanks I don t like it when a movie expects me to suspend belief to the point of absurdity as this film does Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland a FedEx super employee you know the type as always portrayed in movies who s plane crashes in a storm leaving him marooned on a deserted island What makes this film so absurd is that Chuck Noland seems to possess near expert survival skills He knows the proper wood to use to try and start a fire he knows how to make rope and he manages to salvage everything else he needs to survive from the FedEx packages that float to his island from the crashed plane He can t catch fish so he finds a dress with netting on it to use as a fishing net He can t open his coconuts so of course he finds someones birthday gift ice skates He manages to fix his own impacted tooth and he has somehow acquired the knowledge to build the perfect raft But he can t fight through the vicious current and the unrelenting incoming tide What he needs is a sail for his raft BINGO a piece of plastic in the form of a sail no less floats up onto his island as well and he manages to get out to sea with the beloved volley ball he befriended and mourns when it floats away forever Thats the other absurdity of the film he seems to have gone crazy after 3 years on the island and somehow gets cured out of thin air He of course loses his girlfriend who is now married to another guy When he goes to visit her after being rescued she calls him the love of her life and claims she knew he was alive all along which makes about as much sense as the rest of this movie because nothing says you are the love of my life like marrying another guy It s just my opinion but it would have been much more true to life if old Chuck had ended up not knowing how to do anything to survive like most normal people and had just starved to death like most normal people would have,0.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1600931/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2001,Good film - could have been a masterpiece,I agree with the general consensus that the first two thirds of this film are brilliant and the final third is somewhat anticlimatic and disappointing The plane crash scene was unforgettable very realistic and heart stopping And of course all the scenes with Hanks on the island and then struggling to get off it really were outstanding and showed what a brilliant actor Hanks is and what a great director Zemeckis can be One of the main problems in the final third is the music too much of it and too syrupy I remember there were two scenes practically back to back with the same melodramatic distracting music These scenes probably would have been perfect without any music Note that there was no music during the crash or the time on the island My rating for this film is therefore For the first two thirds 10 10 For the final third 5 10,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566019/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2003,One of Tom's bad movies - not worth watching!,Spoilers ahead What s the point of this movie A guy survives a plane crash and is cast away on a remote island for a couple of years Guess what the ending is He s rescued Surprise Surprise it s another Hollywood classic what did you expect That s the movie in a nutshell It starts promising actually however the characters are so shallow in this movie it hurts And what is this ending all about I don t know and I am not going to watch it another time to find out,4.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566254/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2001,Yay!!,I enjoyed the learning how my life would change after many years without being known or heard of That s why im hoping i don t get hung up in a situation like in this movie I enjoyed the acting and that crash scene The island scene was pretty comical in many parts 8 10,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565855/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2001,Not incredible but really hard not to like,Simply put this is a pretty fun movie to watch My main complaint is that I knew the whole story beforehand from watching the trailers on television SPOILERS START These trailers showed 1 Hanks saying goodbye to his wife 2 Hanks ending up on the island 3 Hanks on the raft trying to escape and 4 Hanks arriving back with his wife SPOILERS END Hanks is the one who makes this film happen because of his incredibly realistic and moving portrayal of a man living on a deserted island for years we are drawn into it His humor keeps us interested and the obstacles he overcomes gives us a sense of awe Overall this is not a candidate for movie of the year but it is an above average film that I would recommend to everyone,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566021/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2001,Hanks' performance completely saves what could have been another boring survival flick,At it s heart Cast Away is simply a survival picture telling the tale of a man s isolation and lonliness for over four years on a desolate island lacking any large amount of food or even wildlife in the tropics So lonely in fact Chuck Nolan Hanks spends some time speaking to a volley ball for half of the movie and even crying for it s loss This could have been a hilarious situation something for a Saturday Night Live parody of the Survivor TV series but Hanks is so convincing and human in his performance he doesn t hold anything back You can t help be sad for the poor volleyball s named Wilson fate when really you the audience are sad for Hanks losing his sanity while adrift in a wood raft the director Robert Zemeckis sure has a good way of manipulating the audience There are also many special effects in Cast Away that one wouldn t notice just take for granted as part of the filmming there are many SFX scenes in Cast Away but none of them are used for eye candy like many MANY other films today You just can t help but root for Hanks throughout the entire movie so he can get off that stinking island Also the bulk of the film when Nolan is on the island after the plane crash which is easily the best scene of last year 2000 will totally immerse you into his isolation thanks in part to no cutting back to what s going on back where his girlfriend is waiting for him so many movies have been ruined in part to this The Perfect Storm a great example Instead the characters tell him what happened later on And somehow there is little to no dialogue in the survival bulk of this movie but it never gets boring NEVER Zemeckis should have taken a hint while making What Lies Beneath in between Cast Away Not that Cast Away is perfect The film loses steam when Nolan returns home but there are still some great scenes ahead but once again I am not bought on Helen Hunt in the role of Nolan s motivation for going on and trying to get off the island there is a short scene involving him hanging himself Just like in Pay it Forward she s not too convincing and is best suited for Richard Gere chick flicks like Dr T and The Women And no the trailer didn t reveal much about the film You see Cast Away isn t about plot it s about damn good acting 9 out of 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566002/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2002,A good movie,I saw it at a theatre when it first came out and rented it again last week It is not a great movie just a good movie Tom Hanks plays his role well as he usually does It is worth watching a couple of times but not worth buying and taking up valuable space in your video collection,5.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566076/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,"Long review - idea, type, flaws, pace, acting, links",Typical person from the modern economic society who is involved too much at his highly paid job that he forgets important values such as love caring and happiness This guy Chuck Noland Tom Hanks gets traped on a lonely island and he is slowly becoming insane After the rescue team finds him and bring him back to his normal life Chuck looks throgh life with a different perspective This movie is more or less from the silent movie type and its logical to be selected in this category because of the lonelyness of the island there s no one u can talk to There is a conversation between Chuck Noland and his imaginary friend made from soccer ball but this is more like a moment which emphasizes on the culmination in his conscious mind where the human nature cannot resist the complete loneliness and slowly starts to hallucinate things that he could communicate with I dont get the idea why this movie promotes specific delivery servieces brand where the character is working at There should be a fake named company and the movie director can empasice on the firm s wealth by showing that the company is very big and important with highly paid positions In my opinion actions and ideas of the film are presented to us in a boring way and with a slow manner There might be involved an idea about the slow passing time on a lonely island but for me the whole movie is with slow pace and the film lenght is too long for passing the idea of the movie Acting was ok It showed enough actions and emotions for the viewer to get the meaning of the film It looks to me that the director had in mind this movie to connect with ideas and consepts from Daniel Defoe s book Robinson Crusoe However for me there is a long way still to be walked till they reach Defoe s classic,5.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8583033/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2005,What could be worse than Tom Hanks on an island by himself for two hours?,This movie is the definition of Tom Hanks cheesiness Mr Hanks plays a stranded Federal Express worker who gets trapped on an island and from there the fun never stops Tom Hanks insults my intelligence and I hope the intelligence of all of the other people who see him as he is a man who is willing to do anything to get that third nod from the Academy Nothing would establish himself better as one of the greatest actors of all time than a third Oscar Is it me or is it impossible for old Tommy H to have a movie where he doesn t try to jerk our tears I see Tom Hanks as he is He is a phony and nothing could be worse than spending my money on watching Tom Hanks on a TV for two hours,2.0,2.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1026526/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,Brilliant,This movie is proof that Robert Zemeckis is a great writer brilliantly crafted and written so that the people who watch the movie is moved it is a sad story but also encouraging and it brought good influence the people that they shouldn t give up over any hardships because we don t know what the tide could bring Tom Hanks as usual also brilliant he can look desperate and strong willed at the same time His scene with wilson at the raft is very moving though wilson is only a volleyball LOL Overall Great Movie a Must See,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5487719/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2001,This is it?,I was sorely disappointed by this hyped up and overrated film that promised to be something enjoyable So much was left out in an attempt to squeeze a promising storyline into a few hours I can t fathom a man being lost for 4 years and so easily integrating himself into society Hey guys I m back I was disappointed by the ending Although it left the audience with something to think about I thought it was cheesy and underdramatized I m afraid to say that Tom Hanks is losing his touch,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565741/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2000,Best film since The Insider,I read some really bad reviews before I had the opportunity to see the film myself This is not only a good story that makes you think about the way you live your life at the moment but also takes its time to develop real characters and has btw the most realistic airplane crash I ve ever seen nobody s talking your ears off not much dialogue when you re alone on an island you only get the actor s physical reaction expressing his inner state of mind and Tom Hanks is just doing a terrific job No other movie this year except The Insider and perhaps Gladiator had me leaving the theater still thinking about what I had just seen,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565680/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2001,"I don't get it (the wings, I mean)",Spoiler alert just in case I think I may have missed something in the way of symbolism for the ending but then again I see a lot of other people who liked it wonder about the ending too Misc Thoughts First we start out with about a two minute commercial for FedEx Not bad in and of itself since apparently it eventually has something to do with the plot And I may have missed it Dad said it was there but I would have appreciated a line with when we were supposed to be for example December 18 1995 or along those lines You only realize that the beginning isn t the present day when you see the older CNN logo and the dead crewman s gravestone end with 1995 Seeing Chuck and Kelly at the end sparked more emotion than I ve had for a movie in a long time Also Silvestri is great he did Back to the Future after all but how does music in a small fraction of a 2 15 movie amount to an Oscar nomination I m confused Finally That 2 15 did fly by I could not get myself to leave the theater What I did not understand was the whole wings thing So this lady in Texas makes a LOT of sculptures with this design Point When Chuck first picked up the package I thought the wings meant rush delivery or overnight air or something a FedEx mark of some sort When he didn t open it I wondered What is significant about this package He had no qualms about a Dissolution of Marriage paper Holding on to that package to me made absolutely no sense Why did this have to be delivered What was so sacred What about it made him paint that design on his sail Why did it save his life I m sure I m missing something but I certainly am unsure of what 7 5 10 because the ending specifically the last five minutes sucked and I d like an explanation about the wings Too many unanswered questions and ambiguities I don t get it I just don t get it,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565856/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,this might be the one.......,Cast Away is excellent Tom Hanks performance is the best of the year no music no effects no fancy anything for about an hour and a half just Tom Hanks performing in front of the camera He not only performs but he shines and entertains and inspires His performance might be genius While I give most of the credit of Cast Away to Tom Hanks the photography was also good The conclusion was somewhat awkward and unfocused unlike the rest of the film but still very interesting This is one film I encourage everyone to see NOW A great achievement by Hanks once again THE BEST FILM OF 2000 CAST AWAY 1 2,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565474/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2001,A movie that left you on the edge of your seat.,Cast Away was a movie that you really liked or really didn t I liked it because it was very realistic especially for a movie about such a strange situation Tom Hanks did his normal good job and I even liked the ending even though many didn t I m glad they made the audience think about what he was going to do rather than spoil it for us 8 5 out of 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565794/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2007,Almost there.,When I first saw this film I thought the execution was amazing from a great filmmaker in Robert Zemickis However once Hanks gets to the island it falls flat after 1 hour You can only be on an island that long I told my date at the time they should have introduced ghosts monsters weird hatches etc Well 4 years later they made LOST Lost is what Castaway could have been Instead of a documentary they could have made a very entertaining cast away movie Nonetheless Zemickis and Hanks I know both wanted a mature look at a very well used topic They partially succeeded I guess Good film but could have been so much better 7 10 LOST TV SHOW 10 10,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1676772/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2001,Tom Hanks' show,This one can be considered as Tom Hanks one man show He excelled in conveying his emotions through his eyes expressions and able to capture the audience in almost one hour where he was stranded alone at the island The ending might be too long and can be trim a bit But then what I like about the ending is because the reality of it Tom Hanks should be awarded for his work in this movie His performance is top notch and he deserve an Oscar,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565853/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2002,how time flies!,Basic boy loves girl boy goes to work and doesn t return for some time story Tom Hanks plays it as only he can but believing in what he does is difficult To the viewer not having an update as to the time he has been on the island just a note along the bottom of the screen one is left wondering how he is managing but as he doesn t seem to lose any weight you feel he s only been there a matter of a few weeks Plus as he like things to be precise and seems to be a person who investigates and references things he is remarkably stupid on some basic survival techniques Overly long and the end leaves you wondering what now,4.0,0.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566189/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2015,A wonderful film about abandonment and moving on,I first watched this film as a rental shortly after my son was born My ex was well onto her way towards leaving for good and she still hasn t explained why at least not with any grip on reality Without giving away any spoilers this movie is a wonderful parallel to the simple fact that in life somethings things happen which are completely beyond our control We can kick ourselves silly trying to figure out what we might have done better but when it comes right down to it the answer sometimes comes up Nothing Chuck Nolan finds himself in the same situation faces additional setbacks yet somehow manages to survive His road back to life was as long as mine He made it I made it Perseverance is wonderful even though it s initially painful as hell Cast Away does a wonderful job paralleling the severe emotional journey of abandonment survival recovery and the eventual re awakenings of life all men go through when they re abandoned by their spouses through no fault of their own The term cathartic is a huge understatement,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158800/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2003,Worst Piece of Hollywood Crap,This is by far the WORST film I have ever seen I have to admit it went from bad to worse I nearly shut the film off once Hanks character got blood on a soccer ball and then named it Wilson From that point on I was just so lucky to experience Hanks talking to and having quite emotional arguments with Wilson interesting This was just a lame movie It took everything I had to finish watching it and when I was done my eyes hurt from rolling them so much I can t believe Hanks still has a career after this horrible film,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566253/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,very good; could have been truly great,Very good movie possibly the best I ve seen this year The first 3 4 of the movie are first rate the ending was a little too obvious They sort of hit the audience over the head a few times where subtlety would have served them better Tom Hanks is incredible in this Zemeckis is good but he has to watch himself sometimes he gets a little too cute like he did in the running scenes in Forrest Gump,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565922/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2001,"Amazing, Unforgettable Film",Some of the comments here are pretty ignorant I found this film to be a powerful experience and I am grateful for the message I suppose the consensus is split though I seem to find more positive comments Some say the film is predictable and nothing happens Uhh what would you prefer For pirates to take over the island Tom Hanks who is extraordinary by the way is fighting to survive and that seems fitting enough for me Nothing is more moving terrifying or thought provoking You must put some thought into this film to get something out and it appears some were reluctant to do so Entertainment value is not what Cast Away is about I think it s one of the finest human dramas ever made and I ll never forget it The Hanks Wilson relationship is touching beyond all odds and despite a minor stumble during the conclusion the movie retains its power And I like the ending,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565747/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2002,A good love story,I was shocked again by those stupid moviegoers Cast Away is a love story It just echoes a century old theme is there a one love made for you in the world and will you find your other half in your life time The Chinese fables have an interesting character old moon man Every new baby is born the old moon man ties an invisible thread at his toe and he ties the other end at the toe of his true love Eventually the invisible thread will bring them two together They ll live happily after forever The parcel was the invisible thread in the movie Tom survived plan crash isolation in an island for 4 years drifting in a pile of woods in the deep ocean His motivation might appear to come from the picture of his wife But the real force at work is the power of invisible thread the parcel with logo of wings It s a love story like the Sleepless in Seattle from a different angle,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566108/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2000,Tom Hanks yet again proves why he is Mr.Mainstream.,If you are a die hard movie addict watch 4 new movies a week you will dislike this movie like I did This year produced many great original and or invative movies The Cell Traffic Almost Famous and The Tao Of Steve and many decent mainstream movies X Men The Grinch and Meet The parents Let s get back to the point just because a Tom Hanks John Travolta or Nick Cage is in a movie does it mean it will be good I feel the best way to judge a movie is by who is in the supporting roles This movie casts Helen Hunt who herself has made good As good as it gets and not so good Sexual Healing but also cult favorites Trancers 1 2 3 A reliable choice but I am sick of seeing this woman this year she was in 1 Dr T and the Women 2 Pay It Forward and 3 What Women Want all released in the last quarter of the year We saw so little of her since As Good As it gets and then it seems she took every role that came to her The rest of the cast really do not have any drawing power So the whole movie rests on Tom s back Yes he can carry a movie But can he carry it to the awards any more I think not Tom did a DeNiro by changing his weight As many others have eg Vincent D Onofrio for full metal jacket Which is hard to do and losing to look like he did in the movie is much harder then gaining I give him that But in all respects this movie was MADE to make cry and not think In my opinion a good movie should have you thinking about it after the lights come on As much as I was pulling for this movie I found it hard to like I hope Tom hooks up and makes a dramatic career change and play a brutal and sadistic killer in gory detail So he can take on more challenging roles after shattering his Mr Mainsteam Title But if you only go to the cinema once or twice a year this is the movie for you After all my beef en I still think this movie will get a couple of nods for the oscars because they needs tha mainsteam people ta watch,1.0,3.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565725/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2002,"I thought it missed, despite Tom Hanks",I was sure that I d like this picture because it had a Robinson Crusoe feel to it and because I love Tom Hanks Sad to say it didn t do much for me Part of the reason has already been said by others but in addition to those comments the last third of the movie being not very engaging the other characters being too flat etc I had a bigger problem There were two major actions for which I didn t understand the motivation more later and POSSIBLE SPOILER I felt gypped by having 4 years cut out of the middle I was really getting involved with the character his frustrations the coping methods he was discovering etc and then he is replaced by a bearded stranger who can do anything preceded by the words four years later His coming to terms with his aloneness in battling the semi hostile elements was the best part of the film So why did the director fast forward the film to hurry to an unsatisfactory conclusion But my big objection was that two pivotal actions were never explained Why did he leave one package unopened how did he choose that particular one and how did it save his life I m not normally obtuse but I could only guess at the reason I would have appreciated a little more of a hint The other enigma was the ending There is a verbal exchange between Tom and the person to whose house he has just left the package and they have this brief verbal exchange delivered like lines from King Lear full of portent Was that supposed to be a metaphor for something I didn t get This movie left a lot to be desired and explained,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566083/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2000,if you haven't seen it...,I would stop reading reviews and just go see this movie Go The less you know the better are you still here Good then you must ve seen it Then you ll probably agree that Tom Hanks did a great job I think that you ll agree that all the Tom Hanks scenes on the island made the movie what it was but then he makes it back And that s where the movie becomes questionable I liked some things and others I really disliked and for me it almost made it a thumbs down Endings can make or break a film and many people will say the ending works and you ll love this movie But I think my expectations were too high and I was displeased with the ending But the more I think about the movie especially the scenes with Tom getting off the island and music coming back into the movie it s still a good movie and worth seeing,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565536/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2001,A Squirmer,I can not even begin to imagine the reason for the popularity of this movie It was incredibly boring Neither the characters nor the plot held my interest What a waste of a deserted island The one highlight was Tom Hanks creation of his soccer ball god and his subsequent dealings with it The cliche of the crossroads in the final scene was the final straw I was ready to leave,2.0,2.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565860/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2001,Disappointed...,I expected the main character to experience more revelations while stranded Lacking this the film was somewhat shallow My wife called it a Tom Hanks movie That is a movie capitalizing on Tom Hanks popularity rather than on its own merits And though I am a Tom Hanks fan I would have to agree,5.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565645/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2001,Bravo!,CastAway is as strong and deep in storyline as any movie I can remember Its gripping happy sad and really not long enough Near to the last scene not going to spoil it in discussion should have expanded more It is really hard to sit through the film and not feel teary eyed Tom Hanks has really established himself as a phenom actor Definitely gonna be one of my DVD must owns,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565713/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2002,As real as it gets,What a splash in the face This movie was amazingly put together and Tom Hanks delivered a performance like no other He was nominated for Best Actor for his role in this movie At first Castaway takes you down an easy going slope of normalcy and everyday life that we easily take for granted After that it s pure survival that becomes so astonishingly gripping It makes you sad and it may even make you cry Zemeckis and Hanks made another great movie together since Forrest Gump Don t miss out on this movie especially if your a Tom Hanks fan The cons I had a few minor ones Like how big was the island I also didn t like how this movie ended but that is for you to decide My rating 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566112/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2019,The movie had everything!,Sometimes I get the feeling that there are interminable movies in the late 90s not only in one specific genre but in all of them Robert Zemeckis the director of Back to the future series made another masterpiece along with Tom Hanks and in my opinion this movie was somehow more interesting than Forrest Gump in which these two were cooperating together again Cast away definitely engrossed the audience attention for being so unique The brief story might not sound fascinating but the story of men facing unknown is always interesting if it is followed by great actors and a rich screenplay and in this case particularly it happened It s a story of a FedEx executive who s in a plane crash and he strives to survive in an island with no population It demonstrates how modern people are so vulnerable to the nature and how we take for granted simple things like our easy access to food or electricity In general everything related to the movie was marvelous and I didn t get bored not even for a second They did a great job in making an average ordinary story into an incredible movie I highly recommend it,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5174145/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2001,It's God who has been cast away,I found it incredible that someone stuck on a deserted island for four years not once is shown in prayer or seeking help from a higher power As far as the movie is concerned the spiritual dimension does not even exist The man can not rise above himself all he can do is talk to his alter ego a volleyball I guess the movie just reflects where society is today at least a large segment of it,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566034/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2003,Your time would be better spent in a coma!,I checked my watch every two minutes beginning about 10 minutes after the plane crash This movie was a criminal waste of my time The plane crash was genuinely scary but after that nothing drew me in I was so detached from the character that I only wanted him to commit suicide so that the movie would end,1.0,14.0,52.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566221/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2001,Boring and Disappointing,Good performance from Hanks but the movie itself is not worth much The only few interesting parts are partly shown in the trailer why do they always have to do that It could have been much better especially in the last 45 minutes And why do we have to see a fed ex add every 30 seconds we know he s a damn employee commercial bulls t it gets annoying,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565663/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2001,"Great acting, boring movie",This is really sad and disappointing seeing Tom Hanks in a badly scripted and directed movie The idea was good but it turned out to be a 2 hours FedEx commercial with no story The time gap is horrible even a kid could think of something better than displaying 4 years later At least it deserves the Oscar for best commercial advertising,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565622/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2001,The movie was far deeper than I expected,I m not sure why this movie has such a low rating on IMDB 7 5 as I write this The movie is far better than that easily one of my all time favorites Granted I like Tom Hanks and most of his bad movies are better than a lot of people s best But what I liked the most about the movie was the simple imagery particularly the angel wings and the closing shot That last shot might have seemed heavyhanded to some but I thought it was near perfect And I really liked how the story was told how they let four years go by and how what happened during those four years became important to the end That was fairly deft storytelling The imagery and the storytelling added up to a story that was far more than just a 21st century rewrite of Robinson Crusoe It s a movie I continue to think about two weeks after seeing it on video That s a sign of something Lots of people have commented on Tom Hanks acting I ll just say he remains one of my favorite actors,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565960/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,I fell soooo cheated.....,First of all let me register my agreement with nearly all of those who wrote before me in that Tom Hanks should and probably will win an Oscar for his performance here That aside I feel very cheated in that the movie completely failed to show the viewer what they want to see the transformation of Chuck Nolan over 4 years on an island The issue in this movie is not will he get off the island for the trailers and previews and press releases have all told us that he spends four years there before being rescued Okay now that we know that the real issue then becomes how does he transform himself over the course of those four years How does he grapple with desparation depression loneliness sickness weather hope fear spirituality the list goes on and on Certainly the movie need not go into every intrinsic detaila bout his life but the audience I think wants to SEE how he transforms himself not just be told Four Years Later That is lame All in all even Hanks stellar performance cannot save this film Too many questions too many plot holes too many huhs Thumbs down from me,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565481/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2001,"Tom was good, the movie was so-so",First of all seeing 10458 5 commercials for this movie completely gave away the ending HE GETS OFF THE ISLAND Where is the suspense Yeah that s what I thought There was NONE Maybe that s why I didn t like it very much Tom Hanks was very good though I must admit It was a very demanding role and he performed it very well and I would not be surprised if Mr Hanks walked away with another Oscar this year His wonderful performance almost made up for a less than exciting movie,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565742/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2000,As flat as the screen you read from,Rarely do I write a review about a film I see but I found it necessary to warn viewers of a film that is this repulsive and disastrous The first 20 minutes of the film are a big commercial for FedEx as you have seen in the trailer Then in a I must admit exciting sequence his FedEx plane goes down in the Atlantic Ocean Now the film gets REALLY dull We see Tom Hanks play Survivor s Richard Hatch with thankfully more clothes on for a full hour where he talks to Wilson enter the advertisement his new friend VOLLEYBALL Then you can brace yourself for the last grueling 23 minutes and come out of the theater feeling like you just survived a plane crash yourself In conclusion basically Hollywood screwed up The film is as flat as a news broadcast If you want to see it purely for Tom Hanks extraordinary acting good luck Be Warned Seeing films without a plot can be hazardous,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565542/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2001,Great performance by Hanks,Cast Away is a decent film about the survivor of a plane crash Tom Hanks proves his acting ability once more in a distinguished career as he has over an hour of screen time by himself with no actor to play off of and no musical score in the background Such a feat is nearly impossible to pull off without strong acting abilities The film is a little long but the crash scene is very hauntingly real and the performance by Hanks is worth seeing,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565590/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2001,"Not much substance here, but Tom Hanks fans will (sadly) love it.",Good Points About the only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was overall well made Robert Zemeckis makes a good movie any way you slice it and no one can debate Tom Hanks acting prowess The rest of the cast did well also Bad Points But there it ends There s nothing in Cast Away that hasn t been done already You ve got your typical stranded on a desert island theme coupled with the trying to return to a life after years of being out in left field somewhere idea and it just makes for a rehash of old plot devices And I m sorry but ANYONE in their right mind would have ripped open that package in record time in case anything it held could aid in survival instead of keeping it intact so that it could be later delivered you know on the off chance you DON T starve to death with a burst of pride for a job well done GIVE ME A BREAK I swear every time Hollywood uses some idiotic plot device just to do something tear jerking the heart of creativity dies a little more Tom didn t seem to have a problem ripping open the rest of them now did he A REAL Fed Ex man would have kept them all Sh yeah and pigs might fly outta my butt Bottom Line Unless you re a Tom Hanks fanatic don t waste your time And if you are broaden your horizons for pity s sake Watch something else This movie is just another excuse for rich people to get richer,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566061/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2002,An okay movie,I adore Tom Hanks but had been told this movie was not up to snuff Well I rented it anyway I thoroughly enjoyed the plane crash sequence I had to play that over several times The genius of the set and direction in that sequence was wonderful to behold I felt like I was in that crash too How he could hold his breath that long was a little far fetched but still it was amazing The part where he is on the island is okay I expected a little more something but was disappointed in the end The scene when he meets back up with Helen Hunt is totally contrived I didn t like that but the ending was good One could imagine which road he would take and what he would find,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566125/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2000,A ho-hum disappointment,This is probably just a matter of expectations but I found Cast Away disappointing The opening 20 minutes are so action packed they take your breath away Once on the island though things slow to a crawl Tom s character is such a slow learner and not particularly clever You find yourself wanting to give him advice The physical effect of years on the island are totally unbelievable He suffers numerous wounds but looks buff and unscarred after four years Huh Once he leaves the island you hope things will pick up but they actually get worse There s too much wasted time and too much that is pointless And I haven t heard one person who liked the ending,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565548/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2004,An Unconventional Piece of Mainstream,Though this movie belongs to the department of Hollywood mainstream it can boast a couple of devices that distinguish it from productions normally spawned by this machine and at the same time taking into account these devices quite daring nature render its tremendous box office a bit puzzling The first one of them is of course that uncompromising with no breaks regular dialogue or music island sequence which shows a quite memorable encounter of the hero with the benign indifference of the world This part of the film especially the detailed description of the first days on the island highlighting how important our every step or action can and probably should be reminds me of 1956 Robert Bresson s A Man Escaped that contains a meticulous report of an escape endeavour undertaken by a French prisoner during WW2 In his usual merciless manner not only Bresson manages in his movie to render extremely important the main character s every single action and movement He practically makes the audience fulfill them along with him and thus creates tension beyond conceivable providing us with an actually physical notion of what it takes here to succeed F Truffaut called Bresson s movie one of the most accomplished attempts at creating a real time out of an imaginary one Similarly Mr Zemeckis in his one doesn t take the path of least resistance and instead of just delivering a sympathetic character and emotionally involving situations makes us literally spend some time being encircled by the beautifully ruthless ocean and conjuring a spark out of damp wood by the way the French lieutenant s whispered recounting of his actions somehow corresponds to the dialogues with Wilson And when the man escaped there comes the second device which I guess has surprised if not disappointed those viewers who had been expecting a more conventional structure And which evokes another allusion this time to the similar structural device used in A Hitchcock Vertigo In his masterpiece Hitchcock suddenly reveals the secret somewhat forty minutes before the actual ending and thus elegantly shifts the emphasis He eliminates the mystery as a driving engine but significantly amplifies for the viewer the dramatic effect of the heroine s final metamorphosis Here the escape from the island doesn t triumphantly round off the film either but opens the third and in a sense most dramatic part of it in which the protagonist goes back to the world that didn t get frozen when he had left it And this part leads to the resolution that might seem not entirely satisfactory to some viewers but in fact makes a perfect ending for this movie Which does not probably avoid all clich s of conventional mainstream but at least gives it a good try And at the end of the day manages to provide the audience with a fresh in some ways bold and in many ways touching contents,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566280/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2018,A new take on the Robinson Crusoe tale,Robert Zemeckis has directed a new take on the Robinson Crusoe saga with a man marooned on an island with nothing more than his perseverance and patience This may be an adventure film on the surface but there are underlying themes of loneliness loss and isolation Of course there are some stupendous scenes this being CGI obsessed in a good way Zemeckis The plane crash is a highlight and different from what we have seen in other films and the island scenes with the waves are amazing As mentioned above Hanks is so good you cannot picture anyone else in his role and his collaboration with the director keeps on flourishing they also made the critically lauded Forrest Gump Do not miss Castaway for anything,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4347226/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2006,What went wrong?,What exactly went horribly awry in this film Was it the hideously inappropriate corporate product placement Was it the studious solemnity of Tom Hank s performance and the resulting uncomfortable laughter at dental procedures and love for volleyball The sheer obviousness of the film s attempts to grab at our heartstrings Was the ending much admired in France The whole caboodle looked great on paper I am sure Robinson Crusoe Rip van Winkle Tom Hanks Somewhere in committee were the makings of something that looked fine yet in its execution went terribly wrong No discredit to Broyles or Hanks but the rest is left at as an exercise for film students and fans excellent fodder for what the heck happened with this Like a fine wine corked,3.0,0.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1453112/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2001,Could have been so much more,The choices made by the director of this film baffled me There were so many powerful scenes that were just skipped over and not shown The whole four years later title card just seemed to rob the audience of a much needed part of the story The story felt disconnected Scenes that stunned me because they were NOT there POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING Tom being rescued They do not show his first encounter with humanity after four years Where is the shock of his rescuers at seeing him Where is Tom s stunned disbelieving eyes that he has finally been saved You get another title card that says four weeks later and boom he s on a private jet all shaved and clean and dressed Back on the island they could have shown Tom staring at his reflection in the water and seeing how he has changed they could have shown him going mad they could have shown him trying to kill himself out of loneliness Basically they just show him surviving and yelling at a volleyball There was not enough exploration of his situation and of it s effect on his soul Then to top it all off when he comes back to civilization he does not really seem that changed at all He needed to have an astonishing EPIPHANY to make the island time more meaningful,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565493/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,Hanks Rescues Cast Away,There are some spoilers so be warned To use the words of Adam Sandler in a memorable Saturday Night Live sketch Who are the ad wizards who came up with this one If you ve seen a commercial or a trailer for Cast Away you basically know everything that happens including the ending This ass backwards marketing campaign almost ruined what could have been an incredibly suspenseful and absorbing film but Cast Away is still to be appreciated for the tremendous performance of Tom Hanks Hanks plays Chuck Noland a FedEx manager who is so devoted to his job that he spends Christmas not with his fiancee Kelly Helen Hunt but on a cargo plane flying over the South Pacific The plane crashes and Chuck washes up on a deserted island as the sole survivor The scenes on the island are fascinating because director Robert Zemeckis and writer William Broyles never cheat the premise This is not Swiss Family Robinson with an elaborate treehouse and monkey butlers Chuck has only his ingenuity and the contents of a few washed up FedEx packages to rely on To further create the feeling of isolation Zemeckis includes very little music and the only dialogue is between Chuck and Wilson a volleyball found in one of the packages Wilson in fact deserves a place as one of the most memorable inanimate objects in film history alongside Rosebud the sled the Red Ryder BB gun from A Christmas Story and Keanu Reeves Tom Hanks is basically asked to carry the film by himself since if the audience doesn t care about Chuck they won t care about the movie The key to the performance is that Hanks takes it completely seriously when he is trying to start a fire you can see the intensity and desperation in his eyes as he rubs the sticks together When he finally gets a flame going he dances in joy and sings an endearingly off key version of Light My Fire by the Doors The audience identifies with Chuck as an average if very smart Joe It is no secret that Hanks is a talented actor but his performance in Cast Away is a step beyond anything that he has done before he may well win his third Oscar for the role The scenes on the island are so good in fact that the final act of the film is anti climactic I won t spoil the ending even though the studio did it themselves but Zemeckis gets a little too arty for his own good Though the point of the final scene seems to be that life goes on there should still be come kind of finality to the movie Since the ending is common knowledge Cast Away becomes more like a James Bond movie you know that Bond is going to win in the end it s just a matter of how he does it Hanks and Zemeckis do such a good job of building suspense however it s a shame to see the film reduced to a formula 7 10,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565559/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2006,That Volleyball Deserved a Freaking Oscar!!,We all know who Tom Hanks is but what about the volleyball Simply an amazing performance by a truly underrated performer Really what a performance Anyway the movie is quite alright I wont call it a masterpiece because it isn t and I wont call it a 2 1 2 hour FedEx commercial either It is a wonderful film of the more artsy side of things The silence used in the film really adds to the movie in a way that it becomes such a part of the feel that without it the viewer does not get that same feeling There is an awful lot of time to think in this movie but that is the point time is the only benefit being stranded alone on a desert island can offer To some the film may come off as being boring and too long but the rest will understand and begin to understand the plight of the character played by Hanks It has an all too realistic theme to it as well really a good movie,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1375599/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2001,Amazing!,From its musical score directing special effects location shooting and the impressive acting ability of Tom Hanks to keep one mesmorized by his solo performance This movie is a WINNER To those who thought it was boring and stupid how he talked to a volleyball you just dont get the concept of isolationism I WEPT with Chuck Noland when HE wept over Wilson It would have been a little more believable if maybe he was trapped for only 2 years instead of 4 but regardless This movie was GREAT it also contained the most realistic terrifying airplane crash I ve ever seen reinforced my fear of flying which is why I dont,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565931/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2000,Boring & Trite,I am not playing devil s advocate but I cannot in good conscience read all of the hyperbolic praise for this movie without making a dissenting comment First Tom Hanks Tom Hanks is not an actor He is a star perhaps a superstar and a comforting presence much like Harrison Ford I am not an actor and yet I could have easily done as good a job portraying Forrest Gump as Hanks did Tom Hanks is appealing in every film in which he appears I acknowledge However I find myself suffering from a Hanks allergy This is certainly my loss but I find Hanks too cloying to endure Jimmy Stewart frequently portrayed the same sort of character as Hanks but Jimmy Stewart had more than one facial expression Tom Hanks unfortunately comes from the Clint Eastwood John Wayne Harrison Ford school of acting which means no acting is required at all but only looking into the camera and quoting your lines with virtually the same emphasis on every word Of course I know that these stars have more talent than that but not much more Second Robert Zemeckis Has he really directed a good film since Back to the Future That film had a few surprises but Cast Away had none Was anybody really surprised how it ended Was there a single element in the middle which surprised Indeed if you took out the plane crash and the admittedly humorous roleplaying with the volleyball was there anything about the film which even involved Helen Hunt was well Helen Hunt If you are a Helen Hunt fan then you were probably pleased If you find her plain and uninteresting as I do although my father finds her hot then she added nothing to the movie I have seen worse movies this year but not many I hope that this review persuades a few people to spend their money on more worthy efforts Before Night Fall for example and to reconsider the near veneration that likeable though not particularly talented Tom Hanks inexplicably recieves,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565463/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,A Mixed Bag,A good idea but not taken far enough The plot is painfully predictable once we realise he s eventually going to be saved The most interesting developments were those on the island A stranded movie would have been more interesting The rest of the movie serve as cheap white bread that sandwiches a good piece of meat The whole project smells of uncertainty and indecision,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565533/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2000,The ending,I m surprised how many people did not like the ending I thought it was perfect When he sees the Gold Wings on the back of Lari White s pickup you could almost see the life coming back into Tom Hanks I do admit I don t understand why he didn t open up her package on the island I liked the film as a whole and wish we could have seen the transformation during the four years,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565966/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,A shameless FedEx Commercial with a great advertisement for Wilson sporting goods thrown in!,I am outraged at watching this horrible sell out movie that serves the purpose of making money and promoting FedEx as a saintly company It starts out watching the efficent delivery of a package Then Tom Hanks giving speeches about packages not even being a minute late and FedEx can not be like the postal service Hell the movie makes it painfully obvious he cares more about FedEx then his girl Then the FedEx plane crashes He is stranded and FedEx packages float to shore and save him On the way he makes friends with a wilson volleyball and the sell out director even goes low enough to name the ball wilson so you can be reminded what brand the freaking ball is Then he gets back on a FedEx plane FedEx people give speeches about him Then after breaking up his girl he goes to deliver a FedEx package This delivery of the package that saved his life leads him to another romantic interest just in the nick of time What am I saying FedEx is god This movie warped my fragile little mind I can t wait until all movies songs and book are about companies,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565557/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,Paradoxical and Beautiful Filmmaking,As I left the theater after seeing Cast Away I had a strange mixture of emotion in my mind Perhaps this was due to the disappointing quasi Hollywood ending that followed the terrible yet surreal ordeal of a man who grasps at hope of escape from the island he has been physically imprisoned on after a plane crash But I have a feeling that Robert Zemeckis an accomplished and innovative director inserts this incredulity for a purpose And the more I consider it this weakness complements its powerful central segment in which actor Tom Hanks grapples with the forces of Nature Upon his return to civilization he finds that his former life dissipated and thus the audience s hollowness resulting from the film s frail ending analogously parallels the protagonist s tumultuous emotions and uncertainty about how to proceed I recommend Cast Away because it is a wonderful film in many respects these achievements far outweigh any regrets about its finale The lavish photography of Tom Hank s solitary struggle against his island prison and the beautiful yet harsh Pacific Ocean brings a humanitarian spirituality to the film This brought me an appreciation for the seemingly petty elements of civilization that we frequently see and ignore in a manner quite similar to American Beauty in my opinion The hidden element of film of sound really contributes to Cast Away by pounding each and every wave that hits the protagonist s weak little raft deep into the audience s mind expressing the brute power of the ocean wonderfully And of course the darkly humorous acting of Tom Hanks plays the key role seeking to mask his desperation by introducing Wilson the volleyball a character that he converses with freely Enjoyable and intriguing Cast Away has been quite possibly the best Hollywood film of the year in my opinion,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565503/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,"good film, should have been set in the 60s",My only real complaint about Cast Away is that it is virtually impossible to get lost on a tropical island WITH a life raft since rafts nearly universally I think in this modern day have emergency transmitters EPRBs or something like that that can be picked up by satellite and your location gets sent to the coast guard The jets radio black out is also rather implausible The lack of infection from a major injury in topical bacteria infested waters is also at least extremely lucky One of the things I liked abou it is that its sort of just a story of a guy going through an amazing experience just s slice of life not major upheaval and resolution and etc etc an amazing slice of life due to the circumstances but just a guy somehow managing to get thorugh it Could have been you or me That in addtion to the excellent direction on location etc gives it a very realistic feel I think Philadelphia is still Hank s best work but Cast Away is good,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565612/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2001,Psychologically Fascinating,This film delves into the psychological transformations of a modern American man forced into cave man island solitude for 4 years The portrayal of his coping mechanisms and the development of eccentricities is quite evocative and understandable Don t we all act a little odd at times when we are alone His re emergence the trailer gives that away is realistically portrayed in a way that invites reflection rather than complacency I liked the ending 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565730/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2005,Long; excellent,I have never met anyone who enjoyed Cast Away as much as me I think it is a masterpiece one of the best films of the past decade but I admit you d be hard pressed to find many people especially among those who know much more about film than myself who agree The first time I saw it I thought it was enjoyable but rather long I saw it again years later and I found the movie truly powerful His transformation and perseverance Wilson everything that happens on the island is believable and well paced More importantly the images when he comes back to Memphis bottled water the lighter I know Zemeckis kind of hits you over the head with it but for me it worked I think Tom Hanks is a truly remarkable actor for all the crappy You ve Got Mail movies he s made when I watch Cast Away or Forest Gump I have difficulty imagining him as anyone else His performance is great This movie is great For me like most great movies it was even better the second time If you have seen it once I wholeheartedly suggest a second viewing,10.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1235582/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2012,"OK, but not really in depth",I heard a lot about this movie and I m really a fan of the whole cast away from civilization type of movies The beginning of the movie was a bit slow but the airplane crash got me excited The first moments on the island were really good and just as I was thinking the movie was starting to get good they skipped a few years Why the hell would I want to be a few years skipped I d like to go in depth on this whole survival thing and hoped that this movie was going to give me that though luck The biggest problem is yet to come as when the guy returns home he almost acts like nothing happened I m sorry but is this based on a real story Because when I only imagine staying on an island that long I wouldn t give a damn about the whole society thing and just go crazy and enjoy the life that I m lucky to have back The characters emotions are also lacking no extreme joy sadness anger or going crazy in the head type of thing when he is finally back again which for me makes it a little unbelievable Still giving this movie a 6 since it overall wasn t bad,6.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2577802/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2002,Too Long!,The movie was too long The middle third was pretty dull Were there no animals or creatures on the island to make for some action Thinking back it does give one a message Appreciate life and do not keep putting the most important things off Live each day to the fullest etc MAY BE A SPOILER BELOW BEWARE I thought the end was rather depressing I do not know of a better one though How can one satisfactorily end a movie such as this That is the question,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566094/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2000,Awesome movie!,Just like the feather in the movie Forrest Gump is representative of the thin thread that binds us all together in the movie Cast Away the director once again takes us on a journey about the binding story of humanity The movie works under the premise that everything happens for a reason therefore we must strive to breathe every day because as Tom Hanks character in the movie says Tomorrow the sun will rise You never know what the tide will bring This movie simply mesmerised me I highly recommend it for anyone that is looking for an uplifting well acted as well as action packed movie,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566143/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2003,The ending,This is a great great movie but like many the ending for me was unsatisfying The entire point of a movie is not having to think about the next actions of the protagonist its about thinking about why they made the choices they made ALthough i like what the director has done with the choices cross roads scene i think for Chuck to make a choice and for the audience to see that it was the right choice would have been a better ending Hanksy and Huntsy give excellent performances and i cannot reccomend this movie highly enough although by saying that i have reccomended this film highly enough and now ive lost my audience ps im training to become a journalist i hope my clarity improves,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566243/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2001,A sabbathic experience,I saw it hours before I wrote this lines and I m still feeling exhausted as I cried for about 2 3 of the picture It s a cleansing sabbathic and religious experience watching this movie Not because it mentions the word God or other divine entity note the funeral but it has faith and the character believes in itself even when he thinks he no longer exists as a human Beginning with a crossroad somewhere in the middle of an American desert instantly reminder of North by Northwest the movie starts within a minute in a frantic pace of a FedEx box traveling physically and with the camera from America to Russia in another well remembered voyeur voyage by Zemeckis Frantic or not we soon discover the meaning of TIME and SPACE in this multiple paced well placed cameras showing the exact spots of what Time and Space are supposed to stand in the castaway s life Zemeckis twisting and turning views in this movie are sometimes experiencing what the character does other times before and after him and we enjoy more viewing this movie as a voyeur didn t Hitchcock teach us a lesson about the art of cinema rather than what s going to happen in the plot which is a bit secondary Then there are the boxes The Pandora boxes only this time what s inside them loses power for what they are and steps in another dimension of their usefulness They act as tools and sometimes as characters to solve the problems of one s Cast Away They expand time the volleyball ball and produce space the blades of the ice rollerskate Finally the blood Lots of it Not like a sign of death but incredibly as a flux of life that the castaway uses to generate his feelings Wilson or Son of Will or to survive the blood spill when he s making fire and thus returning to the religious thoughts in the start of the comment he must need to sacrifice his body in order to re gain spiritual meaning about being alive Note detail he only eats after a long time drinking coconut MILK Crossroads are exactly where this post modern urban castaway stands in the beginning of the movie regarding his multiple choices Career marriage workplace home to name a few Eventually he ll get to make one in a limit situation the girlfriend s watch opposed to the lifeguard waistcoat It s a nice ellipse when he ends up in the place that was only known by the viewer in the beginning having to choose a course in the vast desert And this time he really chooses P S I hope Tom Hanks will deservedly be the first man to win three awards for leading role in the history of Oscars,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565712/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2003,Kubrickian,Spoilers The one thing this film has in common with most Kubrick films is that it gets better the more you watch it The reason is that only after repeated viewings will you be able to fully appreciate its elegance I wasn t very impressed when I first saw this film I though it was a dull story with an unsatisfying ending I was actually disappointed that it wasn t more stylized and superficially dramatic I shouldn t have been Even though there isn t a strong narrative in the segments that bookend the film they re always interesting to watch because they are warm and honest There is also a strange disparity in the way the middle segment of the film is structured It creates the impression that a lot of time has passed but doesn t waste any time in the process Very clever and economical Cast Away doesn t use any cheap plot devices or try to entertain the audience in a traditional way It is simple and straightforward but in the best possible way Those are two things that are very hard to combine I think this is a film that will age well,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566251/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2001,Could've been GREAT...but..,What a disappointment and waste Tom Hanks aka Modern Man stuck on an island with no food water or communications Its obvious that he will somehow fend for himself and salvage all the bare necessities required This film shows just that and ONLY that It did not portray the more humane and psychological side of the situation that is How and what does a man FEEL when alone on an island Hanks displayed little if not no signs of fear despair or disillusion during the initial stages of his strand He did not break down and was not torn by internal conflicts of loss hope and reality Sadly the producers had to use a volleyball Wilson to elicit such emotions from him The next thing you know its 4 years later and Hanks has become an expert spear fisherman And after being exiled from society for 4 years we re supposed to believe he could adapt again in 4 weeks C mon Although the film did try to hint at his ineptness and awkwardness more reserved sleeps on the floor sense of loss over unfinished food it never really does hit the correct emotional note No oomph His re unification with Helen Hunt was a tad too dry Little emotions were shown from them as if both sides were suppressing bottled up feelings though Hunt seems more likely to be the culprit Overall a film with some beautiful visuals and a great plane crash scene There were many chances for the film makers to capitalise on for more powerful scenes but I guess they just didn t know how Survival Skills 101 seems like a more apt title Perhaps Wilson s final scene was its only saving grace,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565743/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2000,Cast Away all other movies and see this ...,This movie is great There s no other way to put it Tom Hanks does a great job as the man who must learn to survive against nature and against his own weakness This movie shows that man needs three things for survival food shelter and companionship The musical score was only in existence when Hanks was in civilization This brings to the audience the sense of being there alone Often times music enhances the viewing experience but in the case of Cast Away the lack of music enhances the experience There is a good deal of comic relief as portrayed by the volleyball Wilson as he is titled becomes one of the audience s favorite characters and should have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor in a Role by the Golden Globes It s a great movie to see with friends and family but there are some questionable scenes for younger kids I would advise seeing it first before you take your ten year old son or daughter to see it don t make the same mistake most parents made with Saving Private Ryan Helen Hunt s character was not one we learned to love and most people will be apathetic towards her She s not one of the main characters only a main influence Hence the end of her paragraph Does Hanks deserve an award for his role and portrayal of the man who is cast aside by nature Yes Hanks does a great job in this movie and no other could have done it as well Do I think he ll win No Going up against the other actors in his category is a hard battle and Crowe was better in Gladiator than Hanks was in Cast Away,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566008/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2001,Tom Hanks wasting time alone in a boring situation- how boring,I think the director was trying to show the audience how boring years of solitary life on a deserted island can be He was very successful This was the most boring movie I had ever seen next to the Blair Witch Project and The Dresser I distinctly remember one scene where he found a cave for shelter when a sudden storm hit He lay exhausted with his newly found flashlight left on It wasn t enough to know that the batteries would be dead by the time he woke they must have wasted a whole minute seemed like five showing him sleep with the flashlight on slowly dimming near the end It s about as boring as watching liver slide down the wall and about as much fun,1.0,3.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565889/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,"Weeks later, still thinking",Unlike most modern movies this does not spoon feed the audience its symbolisms and meanings This is something that needs to be thought over I am looking forward to seeing it again to iron out the details Without being too repetitive yes the plane crash is excellent and very realistic And the ending is deceptively simple It feels like it leaves you hanging but in reality leaves everything wide open for interpretation Just like Tom Hank s character is faced with a myriad of possibilities both on and off the island so is the viewer at the conclusion of this film slight spoiler ahead The only comment I have to add seems to have been missed by every other reviewer or else they do not consider it important Remember the card that is read on the island it is something like The most beautiful thing in the world is the world itself Given the situation on the island the whale encounter and a few other minor details I think that this comment sums up the movie a movement away from materialism and the stress of everyday life and onto something more meaningful,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565521/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2001,High drama: compulsory viewing!,This is a very well made intense experience and for a lot of it s running time basically a one actor film though the volleyball Wilson provides staunch support Tom Hanks performamce is stunning entirely believable The movie begins slowly but then comes the crash which leaves Hanks stranded and even though I was expecting it when it came it was terrifying it was also brilliantly filmed as was the movie all the way through There were some gripping and drenching sequences especailly the scene where Hanks jerks out a bad tooth with the blade of an ice skate Some other highlights besides Hanks performance included Wilson who injected just that little more into the movie The downside was probably the ending drifting into some romantic scenes between Hanks and Helen Hunt and a very unfinished final scene That said the romantic scenes I just mentioned were very moving once you ve been drenched from your strength by three quarters of the film then you re drenched from your emotions by the last quarter The feeling of loneliness on the island where Hanks is stranded is acute At 2 and a half hours long this is a very draining movie to watch but very worth while Go and see it whenever you can,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565740/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2002,Stark soundtrack,Much has been made of a few elements of this movie the importance of the volleyball the extended period in which Tom Hanks is the sole character except for his schizophrenic conversations with Wilson the package he returns at the end However what struck me most about this film was the score or more accurately the lack of it There are some standard pieces during the beginning segment Elvis tunes Russian symphonic choral pieces Christmas songs but otherwise there s no incidental music for about the first 1 1 2 hours of the movie and no music at all during the extended island sequence The first real appearance of the score is when Chuck leaves the island and reaches the open sea Even more remarkable is that the score stops during large portions of the credits for just a recording of the pounding surf In short this movie is almost as short on score as Shindler s List was on color Good movie and one that dares to break with some of Hollywood s most sacred conventions Zemekis is a rebel,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566201/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2001,2 words describe this movie: Tom Hanks,Another outstanding performance by the greatest actor of our day He takes a movie that would have not been much of a story and totally makes it a masterpiece I give Zemekis a bit of the credit but lets see him do the same with say George Clooney or some other mediocre actor out there Helen Hunt didn t really add too much to the movie I thought she had better chemistry with Hanks as a photo than she did in the scenes together or was that done on purpose It did bother me that the movie was a 2 1 2 hour commercial for Fedex but I suppose it could have been worse I actually enjoyed the dig that was made at the expense of the US Postal Service While there may be some that feel that the movie is weak in parts they would say that Hanks saves the day and keeps this ship from sinking I suppose if at all possible I would have cast Meg Ryan instead of Helen Hunt but then it s too much like You ve Got Mail Sleepless but in reality it might be a bit closer to Joe vs the Volcano Bottom line Tom Hanks steals the show and makes a good film an excellent one,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565915/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2001,Eerie kind of movie ..,The major feeling I got throughout this movie was one of loneliness which is quite understandable and obvious I suppose It s a human nature verse adverse circumstances type of movie not for fans of action and violence I have to say that I thought it was pretty good It had a realistic feel throughout the film but the down sides for me were the ridiculously explicit brand advertisements that went on Fed ex etc even on a remote island and the fact that you only ever see a beach on the island along with a cave what about the other side There may have been a five star holiday resort and Tom didn t even know it Worth a look but spoiled by the ludicrous advertising 6 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566000/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2001,The longest and the most boring advertising I've ever seen.,I wonder how much FedEx and Wilson paid for their tickets The crash scene is the only one worths seeing Moscow episodes are absolute shameless trash Watching Forrest Gump will give you the same amount of Mr Hanks but much more pleasure even if you do it for the 10th time in a row Pure waste of time and money,5.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565850/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2003,what about?,You know you wonder about certain things sometimes like what to buy What to wear Where to go for vacation But who would of thought that this would happen A fedex employee would be stuck on an island forced to live with himself and of all these choices he must choose between life and death Do you see where this is going Robinson Curuso was a real man who was shipwreched and in many of the same situations as our good friend Mr Tom Hanks found himself as a character involved in If you are reading this thinking I hated this film you should know that I really did enjoy it I felt it was a great job by Tom Hanks to be going solo on screen with no one around but himself The greatest asset one has is themself He did a great job in making us feel like Wilson was a real life character and might as well have won best supporting actor for his role in the film One should be advised that this is a long movie with alot of solo acting done by Tom Hanks But does anybody really know it is a Robert Zemeckis film The same man who did Back to the Future and Forrest Gump just to name a few I look forward to even more Robert Zemeckis films,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566229/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2001,Bad ending ruined this movie,This movie had the potential to be a truly great film however I felt the ending was so bad that it completely ruined the film for me It was clear to me neither the director nor the writer knew what they wanted to do with the protagonist when he gets home Despite the fact that plot revelation coming Chuck makes it home this film seems almost completely void of hope and happiness The audience not even rewarded with the recipient receiving the package Much of this film is amazing The plane crash is incredible and watching Chuck struggle to stay alive is incredible as well Tom Hanks once again reminds everyone in Hollywood that he is at the top of his profession It probably would have been better ending with Chuck Hanks being rescued rather than him standing at some a literal and metaphoric crossroads It just rang hollow to me and absolutely made the film completely average In my opinion this is a film that is just screaming out to be rented Don t waste 8 when you can rent it in a few months for 4 or less,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565664/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,"Good, but Disappointing",What saves this film is good acting There is no real plot very little dialog and the story depends entirely on our ability to believe Hanks s character I ve heard and read a lot about the ending being disappointing but little as to why The reason has to do with the fact that they telegraph the ending near the beginning when Hanks decides not to open a particular FedEx package because of the hand drawn design on the outside That in itself for me was extremely hard to swallow A man or woman fighting for survival will use ANY means and so many of the other packages virtually every one of them had something he could use And so I ask myself why are we left to wonder at the end what was in the package Has the screenwriter no sense of irony Are we supposed to believe that a pair of wings drawn on a package represent some sort of guardian angel metaphor Thin VERY thin It it weren t for Hanks and yes Hunt whose smallish part was just as brilliant as Hanks s bringing sheer brute strength acting skills so this film it would have little to recommend it The fact that I was disappointed by an ending they revealed so early in the film is why I couldn t give it a high rating Filmmaking after all is about story telling not just about acting The story suffered and so by extension so did the movie In summary I found it overall to be emotionally unsatisfying TRegner,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565535/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2000,Best Picture of 2000,By far this is the best film of 2000 Tom Hanks ranks up there with the classic actors of yesteryear Just when you thought he could not top his last film Tom does it again This time Tom pretty much has the entire film on his shoulders This thought provoking film is incredible it makes you feel as though you are alone on the island you only have the knowledge in your head to survive and a will or reason to live Cast Away is a bit lengthy but you never realize it Also the movie is filmed beautifully in both Russia and the Fiji Islands I would like to see the survivors on Survivor the tv show live out a life like what is portrayed in this movie This is true survivorship Not even the Swiss Family Robinson or Gilligan s Island had it this rough This is a must see movie for anyone,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565879/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2001,Just Alright.,I was very excited to see this movie I cursed people at BlockBuster for getting the last copy and I harassed the clerks there by phone and in person I expected an amazing movie one which would leave me satisfied and content And while I didn t hate this movie I was left very disappointed and not at all content This movie was a Tom Hanks movie And I don t mean he was the leading man I mean if you don t like Tom Hanks my boyfriend doesn t don t see this movie Tom Hanks is an amazing actor and he shows it in this film A very many scenes took place without dialogue and he carries it off by displaying his feelings in facial expression and body language This part of the film impressed me greatly However the plotline once Hanks is saved from the island really left something to be desired Without giving too much away I will say that the story seemed to become very tense and not at all what most of the viewers I ve spoken to wanted from it A movie of this magnitude should carry with it a great ending An ending which makes the whole of the movie make sense and injects the whole project with meaning and resolve Instead I felt the ending to this was weak I kept saying to myself Don t fade to black don t fade to black It faded to black I just think it could have been done better,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565940/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2001,And best supporting role goes to...,It s a bit hard to know where to start with this film what to expect when the film gets rolling It s about a guy stranded on a desert island You re not expecting therefore a lot of action such as Crouching Tiger or deep meaningful conversations on deep and meaningful things As far as the acting goes Tom Hanks is very good portraying the time is money Fed Ex man who finds his whole life literally crashing down The island was clever and very beautiful The story was a bit long though There were points when you thought ah yes another 5 minutes and we ll be out and then an added 15 is shown with the ending being slightly to clich As for the others Helen Hunt is good as the wife who lost her husband and especially for Wilson the volleyball Astounding screen presence delivers lines with pinpoint accuracy and does his own stunts definitely a supporting role nomination If you want to see a film of a man sitting on the island or you are a big fan of Tom Hanks this film is worth seeing Don t expect a lot of high drama and action though after all there is a limit to the amount of stunts you can do with a volleyball,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565769/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,Shed a tear for a vollyball...,Cast Away is not a fast paced movie Rather it is a picture blessed with delicate forms of pristine scenery and stunning environments all which invite the camera to slowly creep through an array of long extended takes In this sense the film invites the audience to revel in simple beauty even when cast away to a remote island in the middle of nowhere in a desperate quest for survival Yet the survival presented by the movie is not one reminiscent of Golding s Lord of the Flies It is a different brand of individual exploration in which a brilliantly prepared Hanks guides the audience on a dramatic journey from the high ground of establishment to absolute desolation and back up again with several surprises on the way Again this is a rather slow paced movie But it absolutely hinges on the acting prowess of Hanks who will keep you glued to the screen as he illustrates a transcendence back to primal nature struggling to adapt at the most basic level of existence In what is essentially a one man performance Hanks with the obvious help of Zemekis brilliant direction and Burgess elegant cinematography creates an uncanny relationship with a lush tropical island You will undoubtedly forget nor be able to refute the powerful metaphoric similarities to the glaring realities of modern life that exist on this island Not only do they prove to be dramatic but charming and hilarious as well Overall I should admit that no other group of filmmakers and actors could have made me so emotionally attached a volleyball But this film did hands down See it and find out what I mean for yourself 9 9 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565489/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,Another confusing ending for Zemeckis (probable spoilers)!,Just had the opportunity to see Cast Away with my wife She liked it and I wanted to like it but the ending completely baffled me but then again most Zemeckis films wind up baffling me somehow The character Tom Hanks played Chuck Noland was quite believable and most certainly well acted The scenes where he s by himself on the island were quite intriguing in the fact that he carried an entire hour of the movie alone with no one to interact with except Wilson of course Kelly portrayed by the usually uplifting Helen Hunt was a very drab and even somewhat unnecessary character Obviously as the love interest she was needed but when Chuck got back to civilization she might as well have been dead herself The scenes with the two of them after he returns just seemed superfluous to the story But this all brings me to the ending where Chuck is on the back roads of Texas delivering his final package to an angel of sorts First of all don t get me started on the package The moviemakers could have at least let us SEE what was in the box but noooo Anyways I didn t quite get the ending What were Chuck s thoughts at that moment Obviously he s reached a crossroads but from where And to where I honestly felt stranded on an island when I walked out of that film The ending did NOT satisfy and in fact I just didn t get it,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566144/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2002,Why not only Tom Hanks needs somebody else on that island,The film is really the Tom Hanks show He s alone on that island he s a survivor He resists over 4 years on that desert island I don t think anybody except Patrick De Gayardon could make it and the film has no plot no dialogues and it s terribly boring for the public hearing only splash splash for more or less 1 hour What about two survivors on that island Well maybe Tom Hanks would have not been nominated to Academy Awards but maybe we could have heard at least a complete phrase in that empty hour The audience needed dialogues not only Tom Hanks on the desert island,2.0,1.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566171/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,mildly entertaining,Once again the hype is better than the film The movie did keep my interest but I thought it was a little slow I enjoyed watching how he survived the island and the emotions that went with it but that was the best part of the movie I felt that once he got back the movie fell apart Way too shallow there and not very realistic And how many times can a guy say he is sorry about stuff that isn t his fault The ending was way too pat and dry,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565466/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,Best Movie of the Year!,I just came back from Cast Away at the theater I was shocked out of my mind What I thought could have been an interesting diversion at the movies turned out to be a powerful emotional hilarious and fun holiday movie The simple story about a man s adventures stranded on a desert island becomes an incredible drama that makes you feel for its characters Oscars all around Best Movie of the Year,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565579/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,"A fascinating failure, less than the sum of its parts.",If ever a movie was less than the sum of its parts this is it This feels like three separate films within a movie and as the trailer makes it clear that the Tom Hanks character gets off the island I don t think I m giving anything away to say that this trio consists of pre Island on the Island and post Island The first segment is the best with Hanks giving a charming and relaxed performance as a Fedex employee on the job in Moscow and at home in the States with friends The plane crash that ends this preface to the story is brilliantly done The middle segment is itself divided once again by a Four Years Later flash forward where we see the formerly chubby and clean shaven Mr Hanks now svelte and hirsute and with his island companion Mr Wilson There s a memorable scene in a cave that rivals Marathon Man in its depiction of the horrors of tooth pain and rudimentary dentistry But the final segment just doesn t pack the emotional wallop it s supposed to and the casting of Helen Hunt perhaps the most over exposed over used and over rated of American actresses doesn t help Ironically for a movie whose central theme is time it is time itself that ultimately seems to defeat this film That is two hours is not sufficient or wasn t with this approach anyway to do justice to the beginning middle and end of this particular story As a result the ending feels a little tacked on All in all a movie I m glad I saw but ultimately a disappointment given its pedigree,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565528/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2001,Great film. Pity about the ending though ...,I can t help but feel impressed that a film that spends most of its time just watching a man do things on an island can be so enjoyable Without a doubt this can be attributed to Tom Hanks himself who has the power to draw attention to himself and appear interesting even without the aid of dialogue and director Robert Zemeckis who s excellent direction really pays off Alas this is not the perfect film Zemeckis should have trusted Hanks abilities and have made his time on the island the primary focus of the movie rather than simply make it the 2nd act of a 3 act play Spoilers The beginning is pretty much standard but I guess we have to start somewhere The plane crash is quite a well done piece of film making and of course the time on the island is superb Unfortunately just as Hanks seems to be getting the grasp of surving on the island we fast forward 4 years to see him preparing an escape Ok I can accept that but then after being rescued instead of the film ending like we would all expect it to we re treated to yet another 30 mins or so of finishing up stuff from the beginning Really what irks me the most is not really that they continued on after he was rescued but rather that they did it in such a boring and obvious way We hardly get a glimpse of seeing Hanks re adapting to life in civilisation again he was marooned for 4 years afterall and of course the whole relationship thing with Helen Hunt is given as much time as the film makers can wring out of it However even the bad bits don t come close to putting a dampener on the overall majesty of the film I d strongly recommend it but if you re not to fussed about seeing a film right through then it might pay to walk out just as Hanks gets rescued 4 out of 5 stars,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565726/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2001,a 2 1/2 hour promo for FedEx,A survival story of an average guy stranded on a deserted island Tom Hanks is the perfect actor to play this part and the audience is only too happy to spend an hour with him alone on an island cracking coconuts and making fire I was impressed with how the screenwriter avoided the cliches so common in survival stories for instance when Hanks crashes at sea during a storm he doesn t simply wake up the next morning washed ashore on the beach Instead during the middle of the night and the storm he has to crawl on top of a coral reef The story should probably have ended with Hank s rescue because the audience s interest runs aground once he makes his way back to civilization The resolution with Helen Hunt his former fiancee is overlong fitful and unsatisfying Worst of all the ending where Hanks delivers the FedEx package he refused to open in his 4 years on the island was downright absurd Newsflash to Hanks there might have been food in that package The big winner for this movie has to be Federal Express Next time I send a Wilson volleyball to Russia you can be sure I ll use their service,5.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565715/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2001,A great film,Robert Zemeckis Cast Away is one of the best films I ve seen for a long time Tom Hanks gives an excellent performance as Chuck Noland a Federal Express worker who leaves Memphis for a short time to go overseas on business Before leaving he tells his girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt I ll be right back What happens next is extraordinary filmmaking Chuck s plane crashes and Chuck is the sole survivor finding himself cast ashore on a deserted island These scenes are the greatest in the film for we see Hanks trying to adjust to island life and having as his only companion a volleyball which he calls Wilson There are a few funny scenes in Cast Away I laughed at the scenes in which the Federal Express boxes were cast ashore which were full of rollerskates videotapes and of course the volleyball But the main point of Cast Away is the drama of trying to adjust to life both on the island and when he gets back home Whatever you do just see this film at least once,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565852/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2001,Outstanding.,The difficulty of carrying an entire movie alone must be tremendous Yet Tom Hanks succeeds in Cast Away This modern high tech retelling of the man on desert island tale is outstanding in every way Wonderful acting excellent direction and despite its simplicity an engaging story Also some interesting themes about fast paced modern life Pretty much everything has already been said about this movie but I want to recommend seeing this one on DVD There are many many extras that add insight to the film For example in Robert Zemeckis alternate audio track he tells you that Fed Ex paid nothing to be put into this film but that it had been a part of the story line from day one because it fit so well with the way they wanted the Chuck Noland character to be I found that reassuring after hearing so many friends said the movie was a Fed Ex commercial Anyway go for the DVD version if you have a good surround sound system you will really be able to appreciate the excellent sound effects which are another big part of carrying this film,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565997/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2000,"Not that great of a movie, worth one watch",Not that bad of a movie After the initial crash and about one half hour of being stranded it became a very dry movie The sappy ending didn t do that much for me either I think that the plot of the movie could have been better and they could have done a great deal more with it Special effects and everything were excellent however which makes it worth one watch,4.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565484/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2002,"Finally it's here, a two-and-a-half hour FedEx Commercial",I personally hold the opinion that Tom Hanks is an over rated actor I must admit that I haven t seen the Road to Perdition it s not even out in Australia yet a performance that apparently may change my mind He has put in one truly great performance in his career that being Philadelphia his other major triumph was Forrest Gump which was only really a good performance in a great movie I personally liked him better in his earlier roles such as Joe versus the Volcano and the Burbs back before he d developed as an unmistakable presence in a film The success of this film depended almost entirely on how the audience responded to Hanks According to the poll I just voted in the response was nothing short of remarkable Not just that it made so much money but also that no one seemed to notice that Wilson the volleyball seemed to have more of a personality than did Hanks character OK That one is a blatent lie but I had to use it It s all the more remarkable if one considers that the entire film is one big commercial for Federal Express A kind of cross between The Postman and Robinson Crusoe They spend the first 20 minutes or so telling us how reliable the service is Then we learn that the mail is so securely bound as to not become redundant and useless when it falls out of a plane into salt water and floats there for a few days The real clincher is the film s final scene when Hanks character actually delivers a package that he has been saving over the four years that he has been stranded on a desert island for Federal Express Not even we can deliver this film from mediocrity,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566187/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2011,This film is simply wonderful...,Robert Zemeckis s film Castaway is one of my all time favorite films and he can probably thank Tom Hanks for it as well The story follows a man by the name of Chuck Noland who works for FedEX and upon his delivery around Christmas he gets wrapped up in an unfortunate plane crash Some how he survives this crash which is probably the only strange thing I found about this film Anyway Chuck is washed ashore on a strange island kilometers from any other continent and is left to fend for himself Personally this is my favorite part of the film as well as we watch Chuck experiment and use as many resources he can to survive the tormenting 4 years he has been on the island for The only thing that s keeping him from dying is his lovely fianc e and a wonderful volleyball friend known as Wilson I don t like to make fun of Wilson or Tom Hanks s role to speak to just a volleyball because it kept him from going insane So I really loved Wilson hehe Anyway he finally gets off this island returns to main land and sad stuff starts happening You can t hate this movie and if you do then you re missing out on a lot or you just don t understand the film on an emotional level 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2417560/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2000,An amazing film experience...,I just saw this film on its opening day and I must say that this film struck me in a way very few films have Cast Away is remarkable for its power to make you think about isolation away from everything you have Isolation from your loved ones human contact and even the everyday things we all unknowingly take for granted Tom Hanks is brilliant as Chuck Noland a man so obsessed with not wasting time that ironically his whole life is passing him by Chuck is a troubleshooter for FedEx who has to check his schedule before he can even schedule family events or a date with his fiancee Kelly Frears a sweet affecting Helen Hunt While on a Christmas Eve emergency trip to Malaysia to save a FedEx operation Chuck s small plane crashes and leaves him stranded on an island in the South Pacific where his only companionship is a volleyball that washed ashore Chuck s emotional and physical journey begins on that small island Tom Hanks turns in one of his best performances ever Cast Away is a film that makes you feel nothing but gratitude for your life It is a film that will break your heart It was so emotionally effecting for me It is a beautiful film,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565492/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2001,A New Stage In Film Making (Small spoiler included),When I heard that half the film is Tom Hanks staring left and right not saying a word I was somewhat sceptical But what I discovered was not only a film with 3 4 of it devoted to a speechless Hanks but also a new stage in film making all together I m not only talking about the silence and the reliance on facial expression for a large part of the film to convey Hanks s emotions in crucial scenes things like that have been done before the best example I can think of being Das Boot and its focus on the desolation of silence within a crippled submarine and the focus on the faces of the sailors to help the audience understand the situation as it stood but I m also referring to the filmming in two halves In the beginning the audience encounters a plump and jolly upperclass Hanks He s focussed confident and exudes an air of upper class ease He then is stranded on the island and still seems quite out of place He may be wearing tattered clothing and trying his hardest to become Robinson Crusoe but it still seems that he is nothing more than a man torn away from the world he once trusted But after the movie s split when Hanks is reintroduced to us as a much thinner and naturally experiences man the audience encounters a completely new situation No longer is this the overweight executive that we knew from before he instead has become a full fledged survivor unlike anyone on that syndicated island that captured the hearts of America during the summer We then see this new man put back into the world he once was part of and now he doesn t seem to fit in here The audience is almost as uneasy seeing castaway Tom back in suburbia as they were when executive Tom found himself on the island It is amazing to have seen Tom Hanks completely transform his entire body and persona within a movie This being said I can t think of any other film where this happens so naturally Hanks is a master Zemeckis is fantastic and the film is great,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565469/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2001,The title is 2 words.,I didn t catch it until I looked at the poster after I saw the film The director Dr Z is a genius for giving a bizarre quasi sequel to Forrest Gump Tom Hanks as Gump meets all these people through out history with little effort and takes part in the entire U S experience Chuck Noland is a man that has to do with everyone 6 degrees wise with everyone in the world he s with FedEx Then is not connected with another human soul His wonderful kaleidescope of people and places take place on a microcosim of himself In the time he is away the things like Strife Surviving War friends Wilson Bubba and redemption Jenny Kelly happen as can be seen on Nolan s appearance Dr Z has always shown us stories of infinite contact and communication of the human spirit whether through time space etc and now the human spirit of isolation Surviving one s self is ultimate to the human experience One who is Cast Away is banished or forced not into nothing but onto oneself for better or worse This is what this Movie is at Go Dr Z P S Wilson can also be seen as stife since friends and family are like blood and so is Wilson if you get down to it Who else do you bleed for,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565678/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2001,FedEx: The Movie.,I rarely find myself going so far as to comment on a film here yet after seeing the rave reviews this film has been getting I found I could not help myself What people see in this movie I am not really sure Perhaps it is just the casting of Hanks and Hunt or some bit of hype which has built up From the start one of the most annoying things was the MASSIVE product placement of FexEx through out the movie Half of the movie was basically a giant advertisement for FedEx You could see logos everywhere The scene when Hank returns and is waiting to see Hunt and looks out the window to the parking lot to see her in a fit with about 20 FexEx planes strangely in the background was especially bad And one knows since FexEx most surely paid a lot of money to get their name and logo everywhere and anywhere that not a single harsh word or should I say harsh even perhaps not even a Realistic word would be said against them As for the rest of the film it seems the whole film is basically given away in the title Cast Away It is almost as if someone came up with the title and then proposed they make a film about it and some how found some way to Cast him away and bring him back all nice and neat and pretty The period of time which Hank spends on the island is basically meaningless and while he does struggle and learn in the end nothing has really changed He finally makes it back home and some how returns back to normal life quite quickly with little readjustment if one was on a stranded island for 4 years coming home would be one hell of a bizarre proposition The love interest seems to be included very much for the sake of simply having one or at least giving Hanks something to DO when he gets back with out which there would be nothing to show us So the film tries to give us the passion but showing how much they still love each other yet god forbid they make an immoral movie where a woman runs away from her family to be with a previous lover So they attempt to show us that the desire is still there but desire is grounded by practicality and so life moves on now that sounds pretty dull to me In any case there were a few scenes on the island I thought were interesting yet over all I hardly feel this movie deserves the reviews it has gotten,3.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565654/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2001,Not as fun as......,When you think of being stranded stuck on a tropical island what do you think of Of course Gilligan We are forever stuck with the hilarious memories of Gilligan and the gang from childhood if not even today with the eternal reruns If you were lucky you may even remember the time the gang got off the island and returned to civilization The rescue was hilarious Gilligan tried to make a barbeque on the raft The fire and smoke attracted a boat and Wham they re saved After returning home none could properly adjust back to their normal lives personal social and career Perhaps that s my bias with Cast Away this movie is totally stuck on Tom Hanks the survivor than Chuck the person I know Hanks did a supurb job acting Robert Z did a great job directing the supporting cast did a supurb job supporting blah blah blah But what credibility and imagination did this movie feature What insight and introspective to the human psyche I d like to make one up but find myself scratching my head thinking well at least he survived and he ll keep breathing or whatever he said Gee what a shocker why don t Helen Hunt marry an alcoholic and then we ll see what keep breathing really means I mean she lives in a nice flat with a chance to get a doctorate that s not keep breathing it s I m happily married to YOUR dentist Dealing with adversity is one thing acting as if it s just an obstacle is another If I found out MY girlfriend married another person I d go nuts even if everyone in the entire world thought I was gone I d cry and destroy my 4X4 But Hanks gave a subverted performance that just displayed a wow you kept my car in great shape can I have it back Totally cool totally cold I rated this movie a 5 With ANY actor besides Hanks it would ve gotten a 5 Leo Cuba Gooding Jr Woody Harrleson etc but with Hanks we all gave it a 7 right Admit it you went to see it for Hanks You said it was great cause of Hanks You recommended it to friends cause of Hanks hanks could do no wrong and you would feel no wrong,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565772/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2002,quite disappointing,MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS I had high hopes for this movie but it did not live up to my expectations for a number of reasons Firstly this movie starts off in a quite confusing manner we are briefly introduced to characters that we don t see again for 3 HOURS We think they are relevant when actually they are not Secondly the plane crash scene annoyed me also The plane suddenly takes a dive for no reason it was not hit by lightning or anything Just before it crashes we can see from the cockpit window that the plane is diving at quite a steep angle Into the sea In a storm At night How could anyone survive Beats me Not to mention the fact that when Tom Hanks is in the water it is crystal clear not pitch black and he doesn t even have a scratch on his body from the impact These may seem like petty things but it is not hard to make scenes relatively realistic The fact that it is only a film does not mean this should be an excuse to insult the viewer When Hanks returns to his girlfriend after being rescued she does not ask him a single question about his ordeal come on you think your man is dead and 4 years later he returns and you don t even ask him how he coped or anything Finally that busniness with the unopened package Why did he not open it Why did it save his life What was in it Why did they not tell us what was in it These were my main problems with the film It wasn t all bad Wilson the volleyball was actually my favourite character No offence Tom,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566199/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2023,This Is the WORST movie of ALL TIME,If I could give Castaway a half star I would Oh Castaway where do we even begin Perhaps with the immediate realization that director Robert Zemeckis expected audiences to sit through a whopping two and a half hours only to witness the most cliched of endings Tom Hanks character not ending up with his wife It s as if the filmmakers decided to troll their audience with a painfully prolonged bait and switch One might argue that such an outcome adds depth and realism but after enduring such a lengthy movie many might feel cheated The film s premise while simple had potential However it s hard to ignore just how exaggerated and bloated the entire affair feels Instead of a gripping survival story viewers are forced to watch endless scenes of Hanks character Chuck Noland struggling with mundane tasks And while survival can indeed be about mastering the mundane the film makes it feel less like a fight for life and more like a tedious DIY tutorial And then there s Wilson Oh Wilson A volleyball that becomes Chuck s companion on the island This would have been a clever way to showcase the depths of human desperation for connection but instead it descends into parody Every time Hanks has a heart to heart with the inanimate ball it s hard not to chuckle at the absurdity The movie expects us to be moved by the loss of a volleyball It s hard to decide which is more ludicrous Chuck mourning the loss of Wilson at sea or the audience being expected to do the same The climax when Chuck returns to civilization is both overblown and utterly underwhelming It s all grand gestures and dramatic music but the emotional depth of these reunions is shallow at best And the cherry on top After all those years of pining Chuck s wife has moved on I guess she didn t have a volleyball to keep her company In sum Castaway feels like an elaborate joke played on the audience It s long winded repetitive and ultimately unrewarding It takes the viewer on a marathon of tedium and at the finish line there s no prize just a deflated volleyball,1.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9379828/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2001,Great Movie,I went to see Cast Away after an awful day and work and it kept me focused on the movie plot for the entire time The whole crash scene was lengthy but seemed authentic and I was already rooting for Hanks to get away from the plane engine and into the raft safely Making fire is at least as hard as it looked on film and I teach firebuilding to Girl Scout leaders The ending was also good not just the woman left at home waiting and doing nothing until his return Tom Hanks s acting was great and this is what Survivor should really be like,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565738/?ref_=tt_urv

9 April 2001,Hollywood moviemaking at its best,I love it when Hollywood proves me wrong Here I am a huge proponent of independent cinema as the last bastion of quality filmmaking left in America But I have to admit it is such a good feeling to walk out of a multiplex after seeing a Hollywood movie that is finely crafted by intelligent professionals with production value afforded by the financial support of a major studio and yet so full of truth and love By any standards Hollywood or Indie Cast Away is a smart movie that is courageous enough to challenge its audience I can t imagine how difficult it must have been to pitch this idea to a studio executive Exec Lemme get this straight for the whole second act of this picture we only get to watch one actor How are we gonna get dialogue out of that Writer That s the point you see There won t be any dialogue This is a movie about the loneliest guy on earth Exec Are you kidding me The average Joe Moviegoer won t go near a picture that doesn t have any dialogue in it Writer Um yeah Did I mention that we also don t want there to be any music while he s on the island I m of the opinion that the only way this movie could have been greenlit is if the greatest actor in the world was attached to star And indeed he was While there are many great actors in the world none of them have the same Everyman affection the Nice Guy appeal or the Movie Star clout as Mr Tom Hanks He s the only actor in the world who could carry a film like this by himself And it is such a joy to watch his mind work through challenge after challenge after challenge on the island Watching this movie just makes you feel good As much as I say it challenges the audience it is also dramatically satisfying and thematically reassuring We are presented with a story of man vs nature reminiscent of romantic classics such as Robinson Crusoe And by watching his struggles and witnessing the difficult lessons he learns upon his homecoming the movie delivers one of those universal truths that we never get tired of hearing This is Hollywood moviemaking at its best Grade A,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565886/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2001,Wrung Out...,Whew What a film I just got back from seeing Cast Away and I m not quite able to put into words what I m feeling right now Suffice it to say that it was probably the most uniquely engaging film experience I have ever had at the movies I never thought that a film with such a scarcity of dialogue through the central portion of the film could provoke such an emotional response from me but this film pays off in buckets When Tom Hanks character felt pain I felt it When he experienced jubilation I was right there with him Additionally the absence of a soundtrack score through a lot of the film enhances the experience that the main character goes through and this minimalist approach forces the audience to focus on the bare essentials just as he does There seemed to be 3 distinct movements to the film and the final movement I think might have been the most poignant all due to the previous sections of the film Without giving anything away just know that when the final scene fades you feel a subtle elation that things turned out the way they did Also the scene in the airplane earlier in the film treats you as if you re a passenger Hanks character never really knows what is happening or why it is happening only that something is horribly wrong Again no music on the soundtrack no additional dramatic flair just a harrowing experience of the sort that I continue to fear whenever I have to fly somewhere On reflection this scene probably wasn t good for me and I hope I conveniently forget it This film did not evoke too many tears for me during the actual duration of it although it had some very real moments that I can t forget but what it did do was leave me sorting out the details long after it was over If a movie can do that it was more than worth the price of a ticket This one does and is,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565563/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2007,This movie is misunderstood,Cast Away is probably the most misunderstood movie of the last seven years It has been called a FedEx commercial boring overlong poorly written with a terrible ending All of this misses the point First the movie was not sponsored by FedEx in any way Zemeckis has stated this from the beginning FedEx is not the main thrust of the movie anyway It is merely the means whereby we come to see Chuck s transformation from time obsessed employee to a deep introspective thinker who is more emotionally mature than before his time on the island Additionally the schtick about the package being delivered at all costs is wrong He wasn t delivering the package to its intended destination he was returning it to sender Also the claims that the movie is poorly written are off base Part of the reason there is little dialogue is that Chuck has been alone for a long time and has developed the ability to convey meaning and communication with very subtle changes in expression The main complaint about the ending is that Chuck simply stands in the middle of the crossroads with a stupid expression on his face and doesn t do anything or go anywhere nor even know where he is going This is not the case If you notice at the beginning when he picks up the package and first sees the angel wings there is a sign over the entrance to the farm that says Dick and Bettina When he returns it to sender later check out the sign Dick s name is gone he s either died or been kicked to the curb After he drops off the package and Bettina gives him directions he is at first clueless about her identity he is still thinking about what to do He then sees the wings on the back of her pickup truck and through the enigmatic Mona Lisa smile on his face remembers that Dick s name is missing from the sign I just KNOW he follows her down that road to begin a new life after Kelly The boring tag simply comes from people used to movies like True Lies and The Bourne Supremacy where there are practically no stretches of more than two minutes without some action sequence Watch Cast Away again and you ll notice the little things Hanks does to communicate his feelings and emotional scars His eyes are especially good Why did I give this film only a 7 Well it s because the other characters in the film are just cardboard cutouts meant to further the story around Hands None of them are memorable except maybe Lari White in tight blue jeans almost worth the price of admission herself,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1602525/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2001,Wasted,I was hoping that this would be less than Hollywood as it s usual sentimental However the title is Cast Away rather than Castaway thus indicating a sentimental ending before the movie begins There were efforts made to explore the psychology of aloneness and hopelessness of the desert island outcast But it pulled back to the superficial fire hunting physical sickness imaginary friend Thankfully it all felt real enough and it showed plenty of determination and despair but it failed to really get into the traumatised mind of someone is that position I was hoping that 1 Reality prevails and our protagonist dies he could have just dived off one of those cliffs once his hanging test had failed and in the event that the does get rescued 2 That he goes through that sort of transformation so aptly portrayed by Jeff Bridges in Fearless No such luck A reasonable film but one easily forgotten,5.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565707/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2001,Even with all the movie's flaws...(Spoiler),I still enjoyed it I only saw trailers for the movie when I bought the DVD I m glad I didn t see them beforehand But according to Roger Ebert s review it s the way the director Zemeckis wanted it A few flaws include The forced third act when Chuck Noland Hanks returns Helen Hunt is a good actress but her character is reduced to almost a cameo appearance I noticed that there is so much product placement in the movie that it s listed in the plot keywords section I wonder if FedEx chipped in any money towards production As mentioned before seeing the ad campaign for the film on the DVD too many details were given away I still give it 7 10 stars,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566048/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,Too many questions left unanswered,This movie left too many questions unanswered and was entirely too slow in many places After his leg was injured so badly on the coral how did it heal He was shown bandaging it up and no mention was ever made of it again When he was being rescued by the steamer there were several shots of him on the raft Absolutely nothing else was on the raft however many scenes later he is shown leaving a FedEx package on the front porch of a farm house Where did the package come from suddenly How did whatever was in the package save his life while he was on the island and what did that have to do with the plot of the movie nothing that I could see I expected much more from a Tom Hanks movie,5.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566132/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,Tom scores again!!!,Well Tom Hanks does it again He turns in a splendid performance that may very well earn him another Oscar I m not sold on that the film is Oscar worthy but worse performances and films have won before Expect his popularity to help him to another victory Following the outstanding plane crash sequence which my wife leaned over to say Wow Zemekis and crew do a great job Tom as Chuck Noland flounders through the beginnings of abandonment and provides with a laugh here and there One minute I m ready to scream out Use the belt the next I m giggling at his cave scribble Even his physical transformation was amazing and I wish I had never seen the trailer for this gave away too much information It s during this sequence Four years later that Hanks reaches that performance excellence which is similar to Philadelphia Absolutely great Lastly the film really hit the home run ball when it didn t try to spoonfeed me an ending Just like Tom s character we are struggling to know how to feel The comments I ve read say that the writer didn t know how to end the film and they felt slighted by the ending I disagree and get the ending So in closing continue to breathe and see what the tide brings in,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565511/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2001,Watch it at home,This was by far the best FedEx commercial I have ever seen As for its merits as a movie it didn t fare as well Though it did seem to be one endless FedEx advertisement Cast Away is not a bad movie but is far from a great one Tom Hanks gives a decent performance as a luckless FedEx employee stranded on a deserted island but his performance lacks any strong distinguishing characteristics that have become synonymous with Hanks roles i e Forrest Gump Saving Private Ryan The most entertaining character in the film is a volleyball named Wilson who Hanks talks to and eventually befriends I thought the imaginary friend concept and how Hanks dealt with it was very interesting and made the audience wonder how they would deal with such intense desolation The island scenes throughout the body are visually stunning but the beginning and end of the film were a big let down Wait for it to hit the video store,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565797/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2001,Unusual and good film,A break from the tradition of formula driven Hollywood movies makes this an interesting and thought provoking film The first 20 minutes or so gets a little sickening at times with the obvious product placement it feels a bit like an overly long Corporate advert for FEDEX However this does not detract from the overall quality of the film and as the audience has come to expect over the years Tom Hanks is excellent I would definitely recommend this film,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565862/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2015,My favorite movie!,I absolutely love this movie The photography is amazing and Tom Hanks hits the ball out of the park with his role as Chuck Noland The sadness that Noland feels upon learning that Kelly has married another man is passed along to every audience member by Hank s great portrayal of Noland unfortunately making the Chris Noth character Lovett the most hated character in the movie The movie is an adventure and a love story even though the love story takes place for the most part without the presence of the woman he loves While there is hope for a Chuck Noland future with Bettina I found it difficult to forget about the obvious love of his life Kelly Helen Hunt,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3324581/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2002,A Wise Film,Cast Away is an interesting film in the first place for a lot of reasons One being the ever so famous Tom Hanks as the star 2nd being Robert Zemeckis as the director 3rd for having an intriguing plot that makes one wonder what really is the fuss behind a Fed Ex guy stranded on a deserted island due to a plane crash I really enjoyed watching this movie It s indeed a worthwhile experience Cast Away is a film with wisdom It shows a lot of metaphors sometimes with humor to the truths we go through in life and the one thing that it points out couldn t be more clearer to me by the time I finished watching the film This film made me appreciate what life has to offer for me and eventually taught me more reasons why we shouldn t give up in life Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis s 2nd collaboration Forrest Gump being the first one in this film is an excellent idea They re both geniuses in their fields The rest of the cast and crew of Cast Away also did an excellent job Definitely a worthy movie to buy in DVD Go watch Cast Away if you still haven t You ll laugh and maybe you ll cry during the sad scenes but most importantly you ll learn,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566186/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2023,The tide brought Cast Away in!,Cast Away is a movie from 2000 directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt It tells the story of a manager at FedEx Chuck Tom Hanks who survives a plane crash into the sea and lands on a desert island where he tries day by day to stay alive hoping to be rescued by someone somehow some day Cast Away is not only a beautifully portrayed fight for survival story but also an exploration of the human feelings connected to that Love and loss hope and desperation loneliness and company sorrow and gratefulness take the central role of the movie as the events play out and the viewer stands by Chuck in his fight for survival To do that the movie doesn t only focus on the story on the island but also takes the time to explore Chuck s everyday life in the time frame before the plane crash as well as the aftermath of the disaster This is done in a chronological order and gives the movie a well identifiable three act kind of structure While the first and last parts do have important roles in the movie the dramatic core of the movie is to be found in the central part where Chuck is alone on the island and no other actor except Tom Hanks appears on screen Here even more than in the rest he carries the whole movie with an excellent one man show performance Time passes and Chuck starts to learn how to get food and shelter on the island kept emotionally alive by the memory of his beloved partner He also starts talking to Wilson an imagined character in the form of a volleyball found among the packages which were carried in the plane before the crash that reached the island as well The relationship with Wilson becomes an important part of his life and a way for Chuck to externalize his thoughts and emotions Later Wilson is dropped into the open sea on Chuck s way to freedom and in the way in which Chuck tries to recover him we have by far the most intense sequence of the movie Here the fact that the viewer is so emotionally connected with this scene even though what we are seeing is a man trying to recover a ball tells you about how good of a job this movie does in taking the viewer into this extremely dramatic journey Chuck opens all the packages that have landed on the island looking for useful items which could help him survive and or look for help except one which is left unopen This symbolizes the hope for him to be back to mainland one day and be able to deliver the package While this plot point is used toward the end of the movie I don t think this symbolism worked particularly well or at least it didn t for me It is carried further with the logo on the package angel wings but this makes it both a bit too obvious and too ambiguous Why that package in particular And what if that package could really save his life Would you really take that chance It feels a bit too stretched The movie is almost 2 and a half hours long and has a quite slow pace Although this gives the movie a kind of everyday life rhythm it does get a bit too slow in some parts where feelings and interactions among the characters especially Chuck and Kelly feel a bit too stretched similarly to the unopened package deal above in a certain way and I wished the movie could have moved on to the next part a bit sooner because the main message was already well delivered The same applies to the setup where a lot of time is taken to get to know Chuck his family his job and his obsession for punctuality Through the dramatic events of the movie it is interesting to observe Chuck s growth and path We meet him as a successful FedEx manager convinced that anything can be done in 87 hours We leave him as a fragile man dealing with existential questions and confronting the viewer with topics like time destiny on one s mission in life on the fact that tomorrow the sun will rise Who knows what the tide could bring Great movie 8 stars,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9248512/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2010,Intelligent and inspiring,A visual journey that leaves you thoroughly satisfied It doesn t take long for you to guess what the plot is from the title but nonetheless the backbone of the film is when he is not Cast Away I love this film if not simply for its clever survivor esquire film scenes but it also delivers a hidden romance story that dwells into what ifs and what is most important in life Even if your not a fan of Survivor and never asked yourself what would happen if you got stuck on a desert island just watch this film to enjoy an enriching performance from Tom Hanks Quite easily the best flick of the year in 2000 yes BETTER than Gladiator Highly recommended 9 stars,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2318451/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2001,"Good, but WAAAY too long!",I ll be one of the first in line to praise Tom Hanks acting abilities but I believe I see a pattern developing here If Tom is in a Robert Zemeckis film it turns out to be TOO LONG Forrest Gump give me an editing machine and I d chop a good hour off that puppy Cast Away same thing Not to say I didn t enjoy the film I did The middle part was just a tad too long for me Wilson should have gotten an nomination from the Academy,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565910/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2001,Overall very satisfied with this movie,Wow what a rush Can you imagine falling from 30 000 feet to the earth The crash scene was really intense and Hank s interpretation of the utter helplessness felt by his character was superb It s amazing how one s mind fixates on something important gold watch and one is willing to risk life and limb to obtain this object It still amazes me how an actor can sacrifice so much while making a film Hanks had to have lost 30 pounds or more to portray the nearly starved crazy Gilligan It was a little depressing towards the end when he gets rescued only to find that well see for yourself Overall a very good movie and I would enjoy seeing it again,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565600/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,Don't take everything so seriously!!,I am very disappointed in the reviews I m reading Mostly everyone is complaining about product placement WHO CARES We live in a materialistic world that is how it works that s how money is made No one is going to wake up one day and say Oh my God I m making movies that feature prominent companies and products How can I live with myself No one is going to just wake up and renounce all possessions Aside from that I just want to say that Wilson is the best thing I ve seen in a long time He made me laugh and I felt he was a very believable character I don t feel so much that he was even product placement because he was transformed into so much more I think it was amazing that they were able to put so much personality and life into a volleyball I nominate Wilson for Best Supporting Actor,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565468/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2001,Boring! *Spoilers*,I went into this movie not expecting much and that s what i got I saw the previews which basically tell the whole story in 60 seconds so nothing in the movie really surprised me Tom Hanks was ok but he wasn t enough to make the movie interesting to me at all The ending was horrible The thing that bothered me the most was that this man was by himself for four or five years He was to the point where he was talking to a volleyball and in no time at all he was readjusted and back into society You would think there would be more psychological damage than that Overall i would not see this movie again and would not recommend it to anyone,4.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566005/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2000,Had potential,but devolved into typical shallow Hollywood fare There were some really lovely genuinely moving moments like when he discovers a fellow passenger who perished in the airplane when he is completely alone on the raft and is crying but they were overshadowed by a lack of commitment to REALLY explore human terror and loneliness They didn t go far enough into the insanity that was only hinted at I found the stuff with the ball wilson annoying if only because it came off as cutesy instead of desperate I had a hard time believing that he was really stuck on the Island for four years and there was little to help alleviate this feeling I was far more focused on the knowledge that Tom Hanks had lost all that weight and was thinking of the newspaper articles I had read The real waste for me is that the filmmakers put their toes in the water at various points in the film which showed that there was the potential for more Robert Zemeckis should be made to take a page from the Steven Soderbergh handbook to see how you can make Hollywood movies with balls,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566149/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2001,Needed A Little More Work,Don t get me wrong Tom Hanks is a marvelous actor and has a very impressive and deserved selection of Academy Awards but I just wasn t really impressed with a couple things in this film Hanks character just wasn t really believable and the script leaves us hanging For one in the script we seem to make a huge jump in the film when Hanks is stranded on the island We jump from the first couple of days that he is there to four years later This leaves a huge gap of time that seems to be forgotten Sure we see Hanks now four years later looking a lot thinner bushy hair and a huge Harley Davidson beard His survival techniques are a little more skilled but that s pretty much it The second thing that needed a little more work was Tom Hanks character He just didn t seem like a man that was stranded on an island He didn t seem like a man that has left his wife behind I must say that I was rather shocked to find a Tom Hanks character unbelievable I thought he was great in the GREEN MILE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was terrific He had one of the greatest acting performances I have ever seen in FORREST GUMP Just about every movie Hanks has done is extraordinary But he just didn t have me believing that he was actually there And lastly the ending and I won t give it away for those who haven t seen the film could have used a little more work as well It just seemed rather tagged on and very short Instead of wasting 15 minutes of film on what I thought to be unnecessary footage of Hanks floating in his raft on the ocean in the storm elaborate on the ending Don t leave us hanging We were on that island with Hanks for about over an hour I walked away from the film with the same feeling that I did when I saw James Cameron s TITANIC And that was that I just couldn t find it believable You know your watching a good movie when you forget that you re watching a movie Bottom line It just needed a little more work 1 2 out of,5.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565591/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2001,Cast Away Is An OK Movie,I went into this one skeptical because the critics liked it With the exception of a very few the movies critics applaud bore me to tears This one was in my opinion a casualty until the crash Hanks and Hunt walk through their lines in the beginning like they are just punching a time clock saying memorised lines There is no passionate chemistry between them In fact they are rather cool to each other not even acting like they like each other really except where it says insert kiss here The movie does take off however when Hanks boards the doomed flight and soars from then on The rest of the movie is suspenseful funny and poignant Hanks is marvellous in his Robinson Caruso role Hunt finally finds her emotions at the end and finally the chemistry between Hanks and Hunt is there for the ending This one fell flat for me in the beginning but soared into the ending with flying colors,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565583/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2001,"Parts were there, but didn't come together",This movie had the potential to be great but it wasn t if you don t want to see a spoiler stop reading otherwise why didn t they SHOW Chuck Noland at the peak with the noose around his neck thinking about jumping then after some conversion with Wilson deciding to test it first I think the movie would ve been much better if it would have actually shown his low point of ultimate desperation rather than just talk about it a couple of times that was the crux of the movie and they skipped it I also would ve have like to have seen Noland do more talking to himself or talking to God or whoever trying to sort out why this happened why was he spared why couldn t he leave why couldn t he be with his girlfriend can he be happy alone who s really in control etc That s what I wanted to see It s still good but not great,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565497/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2000,Perfect movie ruined by Weak Ending (Spoilers),Just got back from seeing CastAway It started out slow and dull not really going anywhere Then Hanks gets stuck on the island and the movie comes to life Every single second spent on the island probably 2 3 of the movie is great I think Wilson should be up for an academy award Seriously though heres why Once Hanks gets off the island the movie starts to go downhill I was hoping for a TRANSITION of how Hanks returns to society But there is absoulutley ZERO transition By the end of the movie the person who has gone through the most change is Wilson Born in a box he lived his life and tragically was lost at sea buy the point I am trying to make is that he CHANGED the most out of anyone and he was a vollyball I am still giving this movie a 7 10 because the middle was so INCREDIBLE I ll end it on a good note by saying this The shot where Tom is looking over the edge of the summit is one of the most beautiful shots I have seen in a hollywood film,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565554/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2007,Horrible movie - You have been warned! - Minor item spoilers.,Then again if you haven t seen it yet don t bother I mean its great if all you need it for is meditation or if you re an insomniac but this is a really bad movie Although I won t reveal any real details about the meaning because I think that you should try and understand it yourself The movie was terrific and simply breathless the whole time I felt awestruck about how the life of one man could be so changed after an experience that Hanks went through This would suggest you are in love with Hanks and how was the movie simply breathless Simple indeed Breathless as in I can t believe I watched this movie instead of I feel people need to be forewarned and yet some people found a hidden meaning that they themselves don t even understand I kept asking When the hell are you going to open those FedEX packages And why wouldn t you leave with the tide going out instead of in I d love to go through an experience like this get paid a hefty salary fart around an island for hours not take the dead guys belt and treat it like a vacation away from the world This movie was simply stupid it was even so really more stupid the second time around watching it on video 7 years later Yes I went opening night to see this much hyped movie only to fall asleep about an hour in and wake up to the ravings of a lunatic when he hurt his hand I guess I d read the plot of the movie incorrectly or perhaps it really is a superb meditation video,2.0,3.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1663485/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2001,Zemeckis and Hanks: a Winning Combination!,In Cast Away director Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks triumph again with a movie which tells a compelling tale about the human condition Obviously the story line is radically different Forrest Gump and has not quite the nostalgic entertainment value In Cast Away Hank plays a man who endures no human contact for four years whereas Forrest Gump in his very eventful life gets the opportunity to interact with a multitude of characters many of them famous However in both films as in many others Hanks portrays a decent and sensitive man and skillfully gains the empathy of all but the most cynical audience members And both films have bittersweet endings perhaps hokey to some but in my opinion endings which nicely underline fundamental truths about the journey of life and its inherent joys despite the adversities encountered along the way I thought that just about the right amount of time was devoted to Chuck s life before and after his stay on the island enough for us to get to know him in the civilized world and enough to show the difficulties and ironically the acute loneliness of his return to that world Although I had some reservations about seeing this film wondering if I could endure an hour and half of watching one character with minimal dialogue overall I was pleasantly surprised Although not a perfect film the scene with Helen Hunt at the end could have been pared down and made a little less melodramatic it succeeds in telling a story a lot of directors and actors would probably be unwilling to risk Well done,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565949/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2001,Good but falls short of Oscar,This movie would have been so much better with some scenes of what Chuck s friend and girlfriend were going through over the four years he was on the island like what their lives were like scenes of the events of her life no spoiler Also once he gets rescued they clean him up too quick one minute he is on death s door the next minute he is the aqua velva man I would have liked to see him in his just rescued Robinson Crusoe look trying to relate to humans again and contrast his wild man look interacting back with civilization,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565808/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2001,Staring Tom Hanks as...Tom Hanks,WARNING SOME MOVIE SPOILERS AND DETAILS ARE CONTAINED WITHIN CUT TO THE CHASE well not in this film In the beginning a lethargic and reality incongruent attempt to propel the emotive elements into viewer consciousness But for director Zemeckis our fodder intellect need not apply to the language used in this film the links in the build up are forcibly coerced and the story line can t really get rolling as every notion is too telegraphed The audience know the disaster is looming but it need not have been so auto cued even for Hollywood s version of Gilligan s Island meets sociological experiment For Helen Hunt a talent of note this certainly is not as good as it gets while Tom seems initially a little lost himself Then the much heralded plane scene so realistic I almost felt sick Unfortunately Tom Hanks is far too close to the front of the plane to have survived but thats show biz On to the next module dimension Tom is cast away on a small island Here we see some cool acting by Tom playing himself of course showing us that even though he can be brilliant in films like The Green Mile he can still be homogenized by an ill conceived dull script Tom takes over the movie by himself really no directorship required There s the usual bits you d expect arrival set up learning of the environment injury defeat craze fight back planning rescue and hey presto he s on a flight to Memphis with tasty refreshments And maybe I m wrong but I thought it was dolphins who loved helping humans lost at sea not whales In the final setting the cast away returns Tom goes round telling those he so callously left behind just how sorry he is that he wasn t there for them I felt a bit squeamish at that point and it was heightened at the moment I saw my girlfriend crying as she uttered he s lost everything Yes he has I empathetically replied Zemeckis seems determined here to paint us each like Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting the empathy role because its not Tom s fault he wasn t there while he was stuck on an island for four and a half years it s not your fault Tom it s not your fault Tom it s not your fault The final tease for me well the first actually was the best the scene was set for the cheese ending and then it had the plug pulled and I loved it To summarize we paid our money and went through the alphabet one more time If this is one of the five best films of the year then the world should stop making them The plane scene is the savior but its not enough Special marks though for casting Vince Martin who is actually famous in Australasia for being a know one and becoming a very successful product pusher Afterwards those around me looked bemused and the guy next to me gave me that look that let me know his girlfriend had been through a rough emotional roller coaster ride too,6.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565883/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2001,Life is too short to live by the clock.,Cast Away was a great movie the emotion of the story of Tom Hanks Chuck rushing through every day life as a FedEx corporate Trainer and stating lines like You live by the Clock is so true We all live by the clock in our fast busy every day lives of juggling careers friends and relationships But life slowed Tom Hanks down in Cast Away it snatched that clock right away from him and landed him on a deserted island to think about what is the importance in life For him it was Kelly Helen Hunt his true love Tom Hanks was superb and his terror and fear ran through me in this movie The cinema photography was so vivid The airplane crash was so real the close up of Tom knocking his tooth out and the huge waves that crashed down on him was so real vivid and placed me right there with him I rated the movie 8 Stars I wanted to give it 10 stars but the ending left me wanting more The beginning and the middle of the movie were excellent and the ending was sweet but so much more could have closed it You won t regret seeing Cast Away I didn t,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565589/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2001,"Pretty film, weak script",Hanks solo role on the island is a great piece of acting and film making despite some annoying minor technical glitches sound out of sync poor colour timing etc The plane crash scene that leads to his arrival on the island is surprisingly gripping as well However the script of this film seems quite weak in places and the post rescue scenes are bordering on unbelievable The happy ending appears as it was tacked on almost as an afterthought And just what was the deal with the whales Wait until it comes out on video or leave after the plane crash,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565724/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2001,Survival on a tropical island teaches survival everywhere.,Fate or chance events removes a Chuck played by Tom Hanks a FedEx employee driven and consumed by the constant advance time from all he knows He is left on a deserted tropical island with almost nothing How can he survive Why should he In the most powerful fade to black ever we are utterly alone with merciless rainy night as our raft heaves in the South Pacific Thus does Chuck begin his journey of self Chuck s value for time fades letting years drift away as he becomes a primitive Chuck clings to his humanity with his remembered love relationship played by Helen Hunt and developing a new friendship with Wilson the volleyball played by Wilson the volleyball Chuck s friendship with Wilson shows the strength of social bonds and his desperate need to have a relationship That social side of humanity is every bit as important to survival as finding water or food Seemingly chance events ignite Chuck s rebirth as a master of the time than once ruled him Time becomes just another tool he uses to go on surviving Don t think of this movie as an island survival movie whose epilogue begins with his rescue You will think the ending is too long and you will miss the point The island portion with its random cruelties of nature is a model of the survival that Chuck and all of us must face He returns to civilization and must choose to go on with the good and bad consequences of what has happened In fact this movie does not end it continues within your own imagination This film makes marvelous use of the absence of music On the island he is without it Elsewhere the most powerful moments are created with silence or with sounds of nature which may only be set up or framed by music The film has wonderful sense of irony in its use of time and its references to time the train conductors pocket watch symbol of the first industrialized need for time accuracy with the photo of his beloved is Chuck s tie back to his previous life Chuck creates an analemma calendar Chuck quotes himself on the importance of time Chuck s journey of self teaches him to accept what he cannot control to shape what he can and like a true survivor to heed small hints sent his way His profound apologies to his FedEx friend and to Hunt s character show his mastery over fate does not excuse him from his humanity He discovers on the island and back in Texas the role of hope in survival The opening and ending of the movie have many details which reward viewing multiple times A Christian perspective Chuck s character would not work so well were he in a living relationship with Christ It is impossible for a Christian to have the same sense of loneliness,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566065/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2001,In a word - Brilliant!!!!,This movie is so good Before going to see it I knew Tom Hanks was a good actor but he is so much more How one man can star in this and still keep you rivited is amazing He deserves his third gong for this The plane crash is incredible and ensures that this will never be shown as an inflight movie,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565844/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2002,Excellent,This film is as ambiguous as life itself and for that reason it does not provide a fascile crowd pleasing Hollywood ending Are there flaws Yes and I have a few quibbles myself But imperfections aside Cast Away is a highly unappreciated film which I enjoyed more than anything else I ve seen in several years As for complaints about the 4 years later break what were the film makers to do Roll cameras daily for close to a year while Hanks shed over fifty pounds Certain restrictions apply All in all Cast Away a pun by the way the character is a castaway who has been Cast Away from his societal identity is a moving and compelling piece of work which gets better with each successive viewing Kudos to Tom Hanks who gives an extraordinary performance and to all involved,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566095/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2001,Acting Tour De Force,In Cast Away Tom Hanks delivers a powerful performance which virtually defines the film a tale of a man literally stripped bare of his societal pretensions Hanks is a premiere performer and his work in this film definitely deserved an academy award Of course the oscars have rarely reflected the best that there is to offer in films Fortunately Tom Hanks is an artist who surely realizes his best reward is in the work he does Comments that the movie is boring depress me Would viewers have preferred to see Daryll Hannah wash up on the island,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565891/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2001,An almost perfect film,This is one of the biggest hits of the year so I m not going to waste time with a description of the plot Let s begin Basically the first twenty minutes are boring then Tom Hanks gets on the plane and the moment the plane begins to experience trouble this film is a technical masterpiece right up until he leaves the island Yes sorry he does get off the island but this shouldn t come as a surprise since the trailer ruined that shock before the film even opened Tom Hanks is washed ashore and the next hour and a half results in one of the most amazing pieces of film making ever Tom Hanks is brilliant in what could have been a one dimensional role Robert Zemeckis directions with another firm hand and above all I got really attached to that damn volleyball so kudos to the film makers on that too But then he gets off the island and it s another twenty thirty minutes until the film finally resolves itself Hanks has to get back to the girl he left waiting for him even though it s been four years played by Helen Hunt Now I like Helen Hunt she s a fine actress but she s terribly overrated If someone could tell me why she won an Oscar for As Good As It Gets I would like to know because every character she ever plays regardless of the film is the Jamie Buchman character from Mad About You She s wasted here with hardly more than a cameo and the film suffers as a result The trailer ruined what could have been a perfect film since there s no surprise that he gets off But the film almost collapses on it s own with a weak opening act and a terrible third This film would have been far better off if the hanks character had been on the plane in the very begginning and the movie ending with him getting off Hell even though 3 4 of the movie was spent on the island the film makers could have shot an extra half hour of stuff slapped it in rather than the weak first and third act because everything on the island is perfect The rest is weak contrived Hollywood tripe All in all a good movie that is great if you fastforward the first twnety minutes and shut it off after he gets off the island Hanks deserved an Oscar hands down And so did that damn volleyball I was impressed with how the film makers managed to surpress any shark attacks since it has become a Hollywood cliche I would love to give this film a 10 10 but due to the first and third acts I can only give it an 8 Still highly recommended but I recommend having the remote in your hand,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566013/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2023,One of the most memorable films of the 2000s,Cast Away is a film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks One of the most surprising aspects of Cast Away is the interpretation of Tom Hanks His performance is extraordinary and his commitment to the role of an isolated man on a desert island conveys authenticity and emotion One of the things I liked most was the narration which focuses on Chuck s struggle for survival but also explores his transformation as an individual Isolation and loneliness force him to confront himself and re evaluate the priorities of life Another element that deserves praise is the soundtrack of Alan Silvestri that helps create an engaging atmosphere In conclusion Cast Away is one of the most memorable films of the 2000s,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9307861/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2018,Made me belly laugh - later I heard that bellies shouldn't laugh at this movie,I remember watching this in the cinema when I was just 20 years old My friend and I found the part where Tom Hanks is talking to Wilson the volleyball pretty funny We even held our bellies in belly laughter it was hysterically funny to us for some reason that I ve forgotten this 18 years later The next evening I was reading the newspaper at my night shift gas station attendant job when I saw an editorial in the Ottawa Sun about the movie The writer was furious about two young men laughing during the movie The Castaway that he wrote a scathing article about the incident and the impudence of the youth and the lack of respect for serious movies I didn t feel particularly scolded I just felt that this man needs to calm down or perhaps get a hemorrhoid removed In fact the friend I brought with me to the cinema was having a hard time at University and the movie was a good way to cheer him up The Ottawa Sun columnist was so upset by the incident that he actually wrote a follow up a few days later Maybe he didn t have a lot of things to write about I imagine that he was thinking this during the movie Those impudent ingrates My society makes entertaining serious movies to shape up these rebellious slovenly backwards youths and they scoff in my face Laughing during the movie During my viewing time no less I am a columnist You will pay two teenagers I ll write one scathing article to fix you right the heck up No not one two really scathing articles Two articles later and you will be so sorry,8.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4245370/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2015,"Realistic film, but not ""Lost'",Believe it or not until last night I had never seen this movie I d seen snippett s of it on The Oscars and other places but I just hadn t seen it I made one attempt about 2 years ago checking the movie out of library but the copy had been grossly damaged Finally though my brother stopped by with his copy and we watched it He s seen it several times My overall impression after watching it was Wow what an amazing story The story of a man who has little time for his very understanding wife who obviously loves him like crazy Who takes off just before Christmas of 1995 on doomed flight that will alter his life forever The scene of the mayhem that ensues in side of the plane was very well done as were the scenes of Hanks character surviving the angry seas Finally he arrives safely to a deserted island Where for the next 1500 days his will to live is put to the test He finds food makes shelter works like a caveman to create fire and basically just learns the art of true survival All the while the only other thing keeping him going is the antique pocket watch given to him by his wife before he boarded the plane Her picture in the watch gives him hope that he ll return to her someday soon After 4 years pass he s still surviving but his mind has drifted into a state of altered reality He s taken to painting a face on a soccer ball with his own blood and nameing it Wilson as it says on the ball Wilson becomes his best friend Finally and quite amazingly near the end of this another piece of the plane washes up on shore and he uses it as a sail for a raft he builds It s actually a credit to Hanks acting when Wilson falls overboard into the ocean and floats away Hanks actually makes us feel his loss for this imaginary friend Upon being rescued and getting home he discovers his wife and friends gave up on his return Se s remarried with children and his friend informs him that they had a funeral and wake for him His now ex wife realizes she shouldn t have listened to her friends family who said she should just let him go Which gives us a slightly hollywood scene of her calling to him chasing after him in the rain as he s driving off They still love each other but the damage is done With the life he knew gone he s now at a complete loss as to what he s supposed to do with it now The ending really doesn t provide a clear cut answer but merely hints at it I can only guess the question to ask by the ending is What would I do if all this happened to me I give ten stars because the movie is simply that engaging moving even a bit suspenseful if you ve never seen it The scenery is breathtaking as well and the whole movie is worth the time to watch END,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3333706/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2000,I thought I was stranded in a deserted movie theater and waited for four years to be rescued by the credits. (Warning: One spoiler in the 3rd paragraph),I was looking forward to seeing this movie and was truly disappointed in its execution It has so much going for it a great premise a fine actor and a gifted director I thought it would be a classic man vs environment story with Tom Hanks struggling to overcome nature with very limited survival skills and equipment Instead it s a sappy very bittersweet with little sweet story of a man suffering to make it back to his life only to discover there is very little left of it to justify the effort I found the vaunted surprise ending be neither surprising nor subtle just the writer s ham fisted attempt to find some way to end my misery The pacing is unbearably slow It is only rescued pardon the pun by Hanks fine performance I did not mind the one complaint I ve heard from others the lack of music and sound effects during the island scenes I thought it added to the feeling of desolation To be fair I m probably one of the few that hated this movie Those who like to watch other people suffer will find plenty to enjoy as the gore factor is unnecessarily high The dentistry by ice skate scene is particularly gruesome People into tearjerkers will find this a good 2 hanky movie I tried very hard unsuccessfully not to laugh at the sobbing woman across the aisle at the end of the movie Luckily she couldn t hear me over her own applause,2.0,1.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565580/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,hank's best role...,since Bachelor Party no actually I m in agreement with pretty much everyone else this was an enjoyable movie not only was I glad that a movie was made around this subject but also for the fact that audiences are into it there are a few intense scenes especially the airplane crashing into the ocean and Chuck trying to retrieve Wilson while pulling his raft in the middle of the ocean along with the Perfect Storm I appreciate the moments in which the main characters attempt the seemingly fool hardy task of defeating the ocean in cast away Chuck ultimately succeeds while Clooney crew failed the lack of a musical score on the island and only focusing on wild sounds was a clever trick by Zemeckis I was a bit disappointed that huge gaps in Chcuk s stay on the island occurred but this wasn t Robinson Crusoe both Hanks Hunt are sickenly appealing but Hanks has the ability to make the viewer identify with his character I constantly found myself asking how I would be able to survive in this situation and I very much doubt I d survive as long as Chuck did anyways this movie is a much better collaboration between Zemeckis hanks than forrest gump which stunk to high heaven,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565488/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2001,Some good moments but ultimately goes nowhere,After the good reception in the US I looked forward to seeing this film when it opened here in Australia In the end I was disappointed The first part of the film builds the character of Chuck Tom Hanks and shows us his relationship with his girlfriend Kelly Helen Hunt I thought that a lot of the dialogue in this section especially in the plane before the crash was poorly timed and delivered and didn t really contribute much to the story The crash scene itself is excellent and the middle section of the movie on the island is enjoyable The use of an imaginary friend to allow dialogue on the island and to show the character trying to cope with the loneliness and avoid madness was novel and effective However I felt it went downhill when he returned to civilisation There were many unanswered questions why try and tow the raft when he had oars If the package was so important to his will to live why leave it unexplored until the end and an unsatisfactory examination of the effect of Chucks return on the relationship between him Kelly and her new husband In all I felt it was a fairly average movie with some missed opportunities and fairly good performance from Tom Hanks I d recommend waiting for it on video,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565695/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2001,I just can say: wow!,Robert Zemeckis did it again He never stops to impress me Man this guy is talented What a great director And what a great film I loved this movie I laughed I cried and I enjoyed the film Certainly one of my favorite movies of the year My second favorite because Erin Brockovich is still my fave But man this film was great Very intelligent with great acting funny stuff and lots of drama I loved Wilson The interaction between Tom Hanks and Wilson was perfect I cried when he got lost I cried a lot And I still can t believe it I cried for a volleyball The ending of the film wasn t bad It was great The wings all the symbolism Everything I rate this film with 10 stars Oh and the music Even though most of the film passed out with no music the moments with music were great I don t know yet who was the composer for this film but he did his best And excellent job What else I don t know what else to say Oh I kept crying even when the film was already finished I was walking with my mom to the car and I was crying One more thing the scene of the airplane crash was great Wicked horrible terrific Arrrggghhh I loved this film One of the years best I hope it gets nominated for the Oscars I guess we ll have to wait and see,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565662/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2001,"Not Hank's Best, But Still A Good Movie",This is a good movie to watch at home on the big screen TV with a DVD That way you can pause it when you have to go to the bathroom The script was good the plot almost totally believable and Tom Hanks did his usual great job of pulling it off The only complaint I had was that the movie was too long and dragged the volleyball bit out a little far when he risked his life to try and save Wilson I think it would have been a little better if they cut down the island time and concentrated a little more about how the character tried to rebuild his life after coming back home Other than that I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely buy the DVD when released,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565818/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2000,Couldn't wait for it to get over...,I m afraid that this movie was a big disappointment for me Maybe because I had such high hopes The most entertaining part of this movie was the first 45 minutes or so leading up to and including the plane wreck The island scenes were necessary to the plot but unnecessarily drawn WAY WAY out And then finally the ending was anti climactic and almost predictable At the theatre I watched this movie the film broke half way through which was a welcome pause to the almost pointless island survival scenes The relationship between the characters played by Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt could have been more deeply explored so that by the end of the movie I could have cared whether they got back together or not I rated this movie a 5 and that s being generous,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566157/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,Some points about the ending,Although the last meeting between Chuck and Kelly was a bit manipulated and manipulative their confrontation was essential for the underlying theme of the story the film s title is Cast Away not castaway And this part of the plot does have psychological truth for anyone who has suffered a traumatic life altering loss or change despite how overused the term is there is a strong hunger for closure This is a very satisfying film for its acting direction and camera work and for its ability to largely escape the usual degrading interference of Hollywood,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565478/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2004,the nature oriented film,i do like this film very much because it does concentrate mainly on the expected and natural acts that people do in the emergent situations they are put in For example Tom Hanks in the film didn t have any tool to burn fire so he insisted on using two pieces of wood and touching them strongly together in order to make fire which at the end had happened after a very big effort of him This shows us how simple we might find things which in real had gone a long way of improvement before reaching their last figure and appeal At the same time i do also like this film very much because it takes into consideration the human feelings and relations like when Tom Hanks lost William you can notice how bad and lonely he felt as if William was a real personal What i like also in this film is how Tom Hanks has insisted on getting out of his problem which is staying on the island by preparing for making a boat and taking into consideration all the troubles he might face and putting a timing for all what he is doing All of this shows how human creativity and intelligence can be used in any situation either a known one before or un unexpected and unknown one,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566284/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,"Long & slow, but most important, thought provoking.",The movie seems longer than it actually is because there s not a lot of action Other than the crash scene the movie was slow and even tempoed After the movie while everyone else was complaining about what a yawner the film was I was thinking about the events that had taken place The most important quote of the film I think what when Chuck Noland told Wilson Don t commit the sin of turning your back on time Although long I d recommend this movie to anyone who s at a turning point in their life or someone who questions their place in this world This movie generated some good questions in my mind,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565510/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2000,I now know how boring it is to be stranded!,This movie was OKAY it could have been better This movie is at least 2 1 2 hrs long and I experienced many of the same things that Tom Hank s character experienced such as extreme boredom and frustration This movie did not pull at my heart strings I was just so happy when the credits FINALLY rolled I thought the relationship between the 2 main characters was weak and unfulling at the end Overall the point of this movie was corny and short lived,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565779/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2001,Alone!!!!,I love Tom Hank movies but this one was not at all one of his best It had the making a very good film but so much went wrong The location was great I sat in the chair telling him what to do And he did some of things I said He did a very kind thing for fellow employee I have to say that made me cry THIS MAY BE A SPOILER IF SO PLEASE DO NOT READ The only thing that really upset me was him talking to Wilson I think they went a little too much with that Maybe it was just me After watching the survivalist type shows on TV it becomes somewhat boring I really do wish Rita Wilson his real wife would have been in it That would have made the movie much better They make a wonderful couple Maybe that s another reason to name the Thank You Tricia,3.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565675/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2004,The real message of the movie is NOT about being stranded on an island,If you haven t seen the movie don t read this discussion because my discussion might give a hint to the ending of the movie The real message is you shouln t treat your professional life more importantly than you personal life When Tom Hanks was having a joyous dinner with his girlfriend family and close friends he was interrupted by a telephone call from his company He was told he had to leave and travel half way around the world to fix a problem for his company Next thing he knows Tom Hanks was stranded by himself on a island He couldn t leave the island for years When Tom Hanks finally got back to the real world the love of his life Helen Hunt has already married to another man Ironically Helen Hunts was married to a dentist and Tom Hanks had to remove a bad tooth when he was on that island I was so touched by the scene when Tom Hanks went to Helen Hunt s house for the first time after Hanks came back from the island They had soooo much love between them But so much has changed since the last time they saw each other when they were having that dinner when that phone call came and when they exchanged Christmas presents in that car just before they said good bye Helen Hunts has already married to another man and they already have a baby They still love each other so much And they know they were meant to be husband and wife But they know that they couldn t turn back the clock Remember the scene when they remove the baby seat from the car The message of the movie is your love ones are more important and precious than your job and career I was so emotionally touched by the last 15 minutes of the movie I almost cried,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566289/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,"Sadly, not all can appreciate this movie...",I saw Cast Away for the 2nd time tonight and I was amazed at what I had missed the first time Everything made me love it even more than I did before Unfortunately not everyone in the theater shared my sentiment Several left with only 15 minutes to go and one idiot even yelled how much the movie sucked To ignorant people like these I suppose Wilson was just a volleyball not an object to represent Chuck s rational side and will power survive on the island His drifting away signaled that Chuck no longer needed him he had fought on and now he was to be rescued Many griped that Chuck should have opened the winged package Why Here was his FedEx instincts at work and his commitment to never turn his back on time Who cares what was inside Anyway I could go on forever about all the symbolism in this movie but I ll give that a rest Everything in Cast Away was superb the acting the script the awesome cinematography and of course Bob Zemeckis s wonderful direction Tom Hanks should at least be nominated for Best Actor but I doubt he ll get it In any case his brilliant work really carried the movie when there wasn t much verbal communication Well if you re reading this and have seen the movie I hope you can relate to what I am saying If you haven t seen it then definitely go but only if you can appreciate this movie for its depth and presentation of the relentlessness of the human spirit Otherwise you are likely to be disappointed,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565522/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2001,Superb,Hats off to you Tom in a film where for long periods its a one man show you really put the audience on that desert island and made them think what it really would be like to be stranded Even if you don t like Tom Hanks just watch the first 30 minutes with the colume up fairly high I promise you ll experience one of the most jaw dropping moments in cinema When will Hanks ever make a bad film since Bonfire of the Vanities of course,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566057/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2002,Dont waste the time.,This movie is a joke Tom Hanks is a tremendous actor but sadly this movie falls short even with his help Although it proves my theory that if someone filmed him utilizing the facilities of a McDonalds someone would nominate the movie for an award If you havent the wits to stand up when drowing in a foot of water the things he does in this movie might seem pretty entertaining To the rest of us we all sat there wondering when he was going to get around to trying the things he did and why he didnt try others Most importantly we are just wondering who is doing what with and laughing while doing it with the money we wasted on this pathetic joke of a film,1.0,4.0,25.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566214/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2001,Cast Away 1/3 of this film!,Don t get me wrong I love Tom Hanks I love Robert Zemekis The production values are outstanding however you could take the ice skate axe Chuck Noland put together to the celluloid on this film for my money The overlong island sequences had me counting the ceiling tiles in the theater There was little character development here just a means to show how clever Noland was in using the elements from the Fed Ex packages Helen Hunt s natural acting style even though her performance was brief made this film worth watching,4.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565593/?ref_=tt_urv

Come back to your basics people!,Too many hypercritical U S Americans here I guess Not that I m not a critical movie watcher but I wouldn t say that this movie was bad at all The end was a bit of a let down but the rest of the movie was ok Almost like a message to fingerpoint how good people have it in their civilizations I would even claim some people sometimes deserve to experience what happened to Chuck Noland Even including me sometimes I tend to imagine myself into the role of the characters often That makes me thankful for what I got This movie shows how hard survival would be without any equipment but just some improvised stuff The scene where he lost his friend Watson was making me sob though it actually was only a volleyball but this movie shows very well that and how such things can become important and closed into the heart,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566268/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2004,One of my favorite movies,When I first viewed Cast Away I was not entirely impressed However watching it just a second time allowed me to appreciate it much more Tom Hanks did an impressive and unbelievable job being the sole focus of the movie for nearly 2 hours as a marooned FedEx worker on an uninhabited island Aside from this I have been able to connect with the underlying theme of the movie with Hanks character having to struggle with not only survival but solidarity as he fought to get off the island to return to a woman already gone Everything from the soundtrack to the authenticity the makers of this movie were able to achieve were just perfect Highly recommended from me,10.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0945194/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2000,"Hanks, Zemeckis deliver again",Once again my favorite actor Tom Hanks delivered the goods His stunning performance and transformation in this movie should garner him his third Oscar The fact that I began to care for a volleyball named Wilson is a clear indicator of Hanks ability as an actor I gave this movie a ten because of Hanks performance how they shot the plane crash a beautiful score and Robert Zemeckis ability to make a two and a half hour film fly by It is up there with Forrest Gump as one of my favorites,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565802/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2001,What's the point of cliff-notes trailers???,Why oh why did they give the whole movie away in the trailers and TV commercials What could possibly have been the point To get us to see it I didn t need that I was going to see it after viewing the first trailer months ago you know the one where he lands on the island and yells Hello anybody and then it fades to black That s all I needed I was hooked right there Yeah Tom Hanks was great Yeah it was a good story so what My whole experience of this movie was a big let down because I knew what was going to happen I m sure others who say they didn t really enjoy the movie are feeling the disappointment stemming from this knowledge as well The only thing I didn t know for sure was what was going to happen after he got back to civilization but I had a pretty good idea and I was right which was another disappointment Predictability kills a movie for me I don t want to know what s going to happen before I see it and I certainly don t want the whole movie laid out for me in the trailer as this one was ridiculous I still can t believe it If you ve seen all the trailers for this movie as I did there was really no reason to see the movie in the theatre because you ve already seen it in condensed form Of course by just seeing the trailers you don t get the full range and impact of emotion and the subtle nuances that drive the plot forward and of course you miss the cinematography that makes the movie great to look at as well as the remarkable physical transformation of Tom Hanks character but if you want to know what this movie is all about and I do mean all about then the trailers are all you need I kept waiting for something to happen some twist in the plot Maybe he would come back and be unable to re acclimate himself to civilization or something anything But from the moment he came back the movie sank into dismal predictability heart wrenching yes but predictable just the same This seems to be a nasty trend in trailers lately Perhaps the rationale is the more they show in the trailer the more will come to see the movie Faulty logic if you ask me Once you have the fish on the hook you don t keep throwing bait at it,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565575/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2001,Biggest Disappointment Of the Year,When I saw the trailer for this highly HYPED movie I was in awe I knew that with the Direction of Robert Zemeckis and the acting abilities of Hanks and Hunt this movie could not have any flaws That was my first mistake SPOILER ALERT Then I went to see the movie That was my second mistake The idea for the film was great A man on the verge of getting married gets stranded on an island for 4 years a little too long and returns home to find out that his fiance is married with kids This film was predictable and nerve racking In a crucial part in the film Hanks and Hunt meet but they have NOTHING to say Did the writers of this film fall asleep during this part of the film or did they just think that the audiences would flock to see this film regardless of how the writing is Well they were right They hooked me in and fooled me to believing that Cast Away was a good film I guess that you should never assume that the words Zemeckis or Hanks or Hunt don t mean great movie afterall,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565641/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2000,"Great movie, with a BIG ""but..."" *Spoilers*",This movie was one of the best I have seen this year without a doubt There was a major problem with it however and that was the last half hour From the time he got onto the island I was enthralled I couldn t take my eyes off the screen and it was simply beautiful His developing friendship with a volleyball named Wilson was brilliant and I loved how he coped and adapted to his surroundings the tooth scene was a real cringer Now as the typical Hollywood market would suggest he will of course make it off the island and the great escape was also astonishing especially when he lost Wilson When the big tanker pulled up beside him then it immediately cut to a scene with him in an airplane clean shaven with the words Four weeks later a voice inside my head was shouting Wait a minute I desperately wanted to see what happened during those four weeks After four years on an island how does he react to the first human contact How does he respond to a warm meal An ice cube A toilet WHAT HAPPENS Instead it decides to focus on his relationship with Helen Hunt typical Academy Award fluff which I really couldn t care less about A local movie critic describes it best when he says that it was a fat juicy steak surrounded by bland pudding I really should have left after seeing Four weeks later because in my mind that is where the movie should have ended Overall I give it 3 5 out of 4 stars Other than the last part a beautiful picture,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565498/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2001,Excellent acting by Hanks (as usual) and a moving story....,It takes a heck of a strong screenplay and a great actor to hold a viewers interest in watching how a man struggles to maintain his sanity while being cast away alone on a small island for years I was moved by the story and Hanks plays the part beautifully perhaps as well as or better than any other of his acting peers My only disappointment came with the very end,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565674/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2001,Another gem from Hanks!,I came out of the theater wondering how Mr Hanks could have condensed so much emotion and depth into what potentially seemed an empty movie I think it s his best work since Dragnet People compare his everyman style to the great Jimmy Stewart and rightly so Whenever I saw Hanks working his magic for example in the charming scenes with the volleyball you could see the mantle of America s Actor being passed from Stewart to Hanks I have nt seen that kind of chemistry between an actor and non speaking prop since Hanks previous triumph Turner and Hooch The direction captured the isolation of Hanks and his surroundings whilst keeping an understated feel Definitely Zemeckis best job since Death Becomes Her and Forrest Gump My one gripe being that the most memorable part of the movie was the crash sequence I had hoped that the director could have matured and not rely on special effect action sequences to carry his movies And the dialogue was adequate too I could nt decide between this and Boyles Jnr s other standout Entrapment There was support from Hunt and Noth I thought that their acting on the periphery provided the necessary distance that enhanced Hanks realistic portrayal of solitude The same effect that Tawney Kitaen and Adrian Zmed had on Hanks in Bachelor Party The far off co acting in both films provided the chance for Hanks to shine in his solo star role amongst the driftwood The ending when we find Hanks back in civilization I felt did nt keep with the tone and pace of the film Although we are now used to the heart warming rousing finales of Hanks movies who could forget the close out of Splash I would have preferred to have seen Hanks see out the film still on the island with the volleyball In closing I would rate Cast Away quite well against the other stranded on an island movies I have seen Hanks project deals with the issues of alienation and survival whilst not losing sight of the potential of fate that can rescue people from isolation and put them back into a more favorable position Similar to what 1 million did for Richard Hatch after the Survivor TV series And not to point all the credit to Hanks seen in the box office returns for Cast Away I do hope that his co star in Big Jared Rushton received a few points after showing Hanks the potential for a lost in the wilderness vehicle after he starred in a not too dissimilar picture A Cry In The Wilderness A twerp cinema rating of four,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565582/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2001,"Story was frustrating , dragged on a little too much",I first saw Cast Away last Wednesday Nov 21 and I expected due to its reward winning reputation that I would be pleasantly entertained and forfilled by this film After completing the movie I thought to myself Was it really that good spoiler Cast Away surprised me a little The acting was questionable in some scenes and the special effects did not seem to par due to some of the unimpressive CGI effects during the plane crash I didn t find some of the scenes to be too interesting either Let s face it Tom Hanks talking to a volleyball is not exciting Neither is him wondering around an island getting injured once and a while and then finally finding some dumb and unbelievable method to find his way to sea and become rescued The ending had its moments and was a twist that relieved the strain off my eyes from staring at a beach and water for an hour and fifteen minutes I took the ending as a positive part of the movie and felt it forfilled my expectations End of spoiler In the end this movie on the whole can be seen as boring I would not recommend this be shown to anyone with a short attention span it might be bad for your health Although I do have strong disgust for this film I won t treat it that poorly it has its ups and downs mostly downs Rating 6 0 10,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566064/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2002,Cast Away,Tom Hanks has yet again starred in one of the year s best films After a little film about the AIDS virus called Philadelphia Mr Hanks has been on a terrific film streak Well his new film Cast Away is another terrific eye opener about a FedEX troubleshooter Hanks who gets stranded on an island for four years after his plane crashed into the middle of the South Pacific Chuck s last words to his fianc e Kelly were I ll be right back A perfect touch to the film that tells you of things to come Chuck now must survive on his own both physically and emotionally without human contact and everyday devices that we all take for granted The first hour or so after the crash has pretty much no dialogue until Noland finds a package wash ashore The package contains a Wilson volleyball Well after Chuck cuts his hand in pain he picks up the ball and throws it It turns out the blood stain on the ball shaped into a perfect face Alot has been said about how stupid and unrealistic that a man would actually talk with a volleyball with a face on it for four years Well I ll tell you something picture yourself on a deserted island Got it Now here s the catch YOU RE ALL ALONE You got absolutely no contact with anybody and all you got is a volleyball with a face on it I don t know about you but I d go insane without anybody or anything to talk with Wilson was symbolic to the other part of himself He needed to talk to somebody or for that matter something about the things he s learned in life ideas feelings fears jokes stories and memories It s normal human behavior We need some sort of a social life It s impossible not to express your feelings with something so he vented with Wilson Let s also remember that he had a relationship with Wilson for four years That is a very long time The Wilson idea is very realistic and a perfect touch to the film Well after four years on the island Chuck goes through many changes his appearance and more importantly he has become much wiser Chuck also managed to completely conquer the four of the basic human needs food shelter water and clothing The film is about the human spirit and how strong it can become in difficult situations Cast Away is probably one of Robert Zemeckis Forrest Gump What Lies Beneath Back to the Future trilogy greatest achievements since Who Framed Roger Rabbit Robert Zemeckis is one of the most innovative and outstanding young directors and is definitely the future for directors and everyone should keep their eye on him along with M Night Shyamalan and David Fincher This is definitely one of the best films of the year and will leave you breathless For those who thought Gladiator was the best film of the year this means you the Academy what I ask is why Sure Gladiator was a great film and I liked it alot but Cast Away has a moral as did Requiem for a Dream which I personally thought was the best film of the year and will teach you to respect the things we take for granted like fire clothing a place to live etc So I believe that the Academy only gives the picture that was most popular the Oscar and that is quite sad Go see the film and learn to respect the things we take for granted 1 2 out of 9 10,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566127/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2002,The intangibles make the film and Hanks' performance,POSSIBLE SPOILERS We are becoming increasingly hard pressed to find a better actor in Hollywood today than Tom Hanks Every movie of his is an event and a must see as was this one When this film debuted around Christmas 2000 I wondered if this film would hold up to the Hanks tradition of late He makes good choices of films to appear in and doesn t half anything from Philadelphia through Forrest Gump through Saving Private Ryan through this year s Road to Perdition This movie would not be the movie it is in my mind without Tom Hanks and his solo performance And let s face it that s what it is I can t think of any other role where one actor was asked to hold for screen by himself for scene after scene after scene like he did in this film What s remarkable about the situation is that he did it so well and in my opinion was robbed of the Best Actor award for 2000 by Russell Crowe s good but less demanding performance in Gladiator The movie begins in Russia where Chuck Noland Hanks is working He is a FedEx shipping supervisor whose life is ruled by in a word time The clock is his enemy his boss his friend when necessary and remains ever present in his life He is about to propose to his girlfriend Kelly Frears Helen Hunt back home in Memphis TN Before New Year s he finds out that he has to go on short notice to Malaysia much to the displeasure of Kelly He gives her the ring before he leaves without much fanfare and leaves for the plane On the way in a frighteningly scary and seemingly real plane crash Chuck becomes the only survivor of an awful accident and becomes marooned on a small unoccupied island There his personal odyssey begins At this point the film becomes something else It doesn t dissolve into typical Hollywood melodramatics and awful lamenting instead he struggles to survive through body and mind at once staringly longingly into Kelly s face through a small now broken clock family heirloom containing her picture and at another instance using his will to find food and survive with Kelly s face driving him As time passes and it becomes clear that almost nobody knows this island exists you can only imagine his man s internal musings about what life becomes isolation heartbreak beauty struggle and so on Being able to identify with Chuck Noland and be riveted by his predicament is to thoroughly enjoy the film for those bored by an utter lack of dialogue for more than half the film will be disappointed and I personally know many people who fall into the latter category Noland s character is not the type to expound on his feelings and at film s end he hasn t changed drastically but it is quite enough to feel for him as I certainly did Robert Zemeckis s direction is chock full of subtlety and the better the film is for it because scene after scene of over the top craziness good or bad for the characters doesn t fit the mood of the film and Alan Silvestri s hauntingly spare score for that matter Themes abound throughout such as the repetitive feelings about time and its absence on the island Some say the ending is disappointing but I disagree it makes perfect sense for the film s tone Overall see this for Hanks and his downright towering performance and also intangibles of Chuck Noland s thoughts Empathy is a huge bonus for the enjoyment of this film 8 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565621/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2010,Wonderful simply wonderful,after watching this movie once again after having watched this movie nearly a decade ago i was deeply moved by the whole plot and symbolism Few aspects that really caught my attention Wilson love the package Wilson was one of the core aspects to this film Spend enough time talking to a ball and eventually it becomes family Though i personally feel that having Wilson in the picture really was one of the only ways for tom hanks to have a conversation in the movie Nevertheless Wilson brought a whole new dynamic to the screen play Nothing more to add but to say the scene where he lost Wilson in the sea was so amazing yet sad to the extent of losing someone close to you His love for her was obviously strong and touching When reunited the two no longer had the space to be together anymore The reality of the situation is yet again so sad A woman who lost the love of her life has moved on while the man had survived the almost impossible Both are positive scenarios yet when the two unite again you actually feel worse for the lady i felt mixed emotions watching them two unite again As for the package that Tom did not open to me that package represented hope So long as the package is not opened there would still be hope or at the very least purpose the package symbolizes the unknown we all know that the contents of that package may very well useful to someone surviving on an island But to leave the package unopened means that there is at least a last resort To open the package meant discarding hope to ever leave the island In the end at the crossroads the lady in the truck yet again represented hope and whether or not Tom followed that lady or took another road that is up to interpretation To me he did not follow the lady because the lady represented the package Instead of opening the small package i think he would rather embrace the bigger package which is life that is full of uncertainty much like venturing into the sea when he was stuck on the island This movie is great seriously,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2330467/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2015,Why Survive? For self and for the eternal motivator -- love!,The central story Tom Hanks character surviving a plane crash being the sole survivor and spending four agonizing years surviving on an uninhabited island is well done After watching the film 3 o4 4 times some detail jumped out at me that I hadn t previously noticed or just wasn t paying enough attention There are two women overshadowing Hanks spiritual physical journey There is Kelly the love of his life who becomes a lost love with the passage of time Then there is Bettina first merely a symbol the orange wings on the one FedEx parcel that Hanks decides to hang on to in case he gets rescued Before his ill fated air trip the sign on the Texas Ranch says Tony and Bettina Over the passage of time Tony and Bettina who we do not see or know have become uncoupled just as Hanks character and Kelly are uncoupling because of separation Hanks is sustained by the pocket watch mounted photo of Kelly and to a lesser extent by the presence of the Bettina parcel Near the end of the film when he is back on the mainland he has to come to terms with the loss of Kelly while simultaneously if not knowingly opening himself to finding new love with Bettina Love lost love found An interesting juxtaposition This is as stated a more cameo part of the overall story but one which should not be lost sight of for what can motivate a man to survive against all odds is the possibility of finding new love to replace the one lost,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3270133/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2001,"Great Hanks performance, but...",You ve read the synopses you know what the movie is about Let s get to the meat skip if you wish no spoilers Tom Hanks did a fantastic job of creating a believable character His acting was perfect for the role Up until his eventual rescue the film is excellent Sure we could have seen more of his decline into more primitive processes and it would have added to the movie The roundabout way his suicide attempt is introduced in the movie is effective The crash is harrowing His discoveries on the island are phenomenal His transformation into the lean thousand yard stare almost hopeless primate is wonderful he seems almost neanderthal in his reaction to the porta potty piece in the water loved it The movie after the rescue missed its mark Hanks discussion with his friend on the private plane had neither the stilted quality one might expect from someone whose sole partner for 4 years was a punctured volleyball nor did it have the possibly clamouring quality of someone who is finally around a lost friend I could expect either but instead we are treated to a rather bland characterisation In fact all of the interactions with others save the rather emotional monologue to the same friend later have this detached quality that TO ME seems inappropriate somehow This is almost painfully true in his interaction with his long lost sweetie played by Helen Hunt My problem is I can t seem to be able to imagine any real people when placed in the same situation who would act the way that both of them act Even the last chance part towards the end didn t have that emotion that one would expect in the situation Anyway I enjoyed the film but am still mildly disappointed with the points above I will still however probably buy it when it comes out on DVD Go figure,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565598/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2001,a man that lived by the clock takes a break,The story line was great and the ads were terrific I ve enjoyed nearly every film made by Tom Hanks He is an excellent actor but I was displeased with this film Hanks still did a fabulous acting job and if as one of the other commentors stated he would be nominated for an award he still deserves it This 2 1 2 hour movie could have been cut to 1 1 2 and still carry the same story line The reason that I scored this film low is that the second part of the film is so long and leaves you hanging and finally bored I actually yawned wondering if there was anything else to the movie besides him being stranded on the island There are scenes that show his progression but what about his family friends FedEx and the Federal Government It didn t even show the flight central or whatever they call them losing the plane from the radar and conducting the notifications They did a great job showing the transition from being Mr Busy to Mr Twiddle My Thumbs but there was a lot left out that would naturally be happening that could have had the audiance reacting or wanting to react to the scenes after the crash I think adding those other angles or viewpoints would have taken this film from being OK to great,4.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565799/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2000,Tom Hanks Does It Again,Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks have teamed up again to bring us a thoroughly entertaining new film in Cast Away While Cast Away does not bring us the magic that Forrest Gump did but in all honesty what really could it does however show us the incredible range of actor Tom Hanks It is hard to believe that this extraordinary actor got his start in such TV shows as Bosom Buddies Hanks in Cast Away spends much of the film alone so very little dialog is used except in moments of frustration and brief insanity where he talks to his new best friend Wilson Hanks must rely on his actions to convey his emotions and he does this beautifully In scene after scene he had me believing feeling for what he was going through Even in scenes that could have been ridiculous i e risking his own well being for a volley ball Hanks made me see the importance of saving this ball and pulled at the heart strings when he was unable to do so The movie itself falls short of a classic with an unsatisfying ending and a wasted Helen Hunt as the girlfriend he left behind but the real heart of this movie is Hanks and his fight to stay alive and that alone was worth every penny,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565479/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2001,This is an excellent film!,In my opinion this was actually a film rather than a movie I liked it anyway To me a film is a movie where we are supposed to think about things A movie is simply meant to entertain In this film we are taken into the world of Chuck Noland a FedEx employee We learn that he is his job Time is his enemy He loves his girlfriend Kelly but to be together they must compare planners Then his world changes drastically He attempts to do things in his usual manner very quickly Time teaches him patience We don t learn about Chuck through dialog as much as we do through the lens There are scenes in the movie where we feel what the characters in the movie must be feeling simply by seeing endless ocean and endless prairie We also see the might of nature in stunning storm tossed seas and powerful winds If you are patient Chuck will tell you why he survived and then you will learn if he will survive If I say anything more it would spoil it for you This movie is 2 and a half hours long but it doesn t feel like a long movie I honestly didn t notice the time passing I do recommend this movie whether you expect a movie to challenge your thinking or are someone that likes to be entertained If you are like me you are probably both,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565634/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2001,Interesting Movie,This movie has many different points which can relate to normal people The way Tom Hanks acted in it is remarkable He depicted exactly how someone would respond to the environment alone I too would have probably started talking to myself and making up friends The one thing I don t understand about this movie is how it ended Tom Hanks was just standing in the middle of the road staring off into nowhere Other than that it was a decent movie I think Tom Hanks deserves an Academy Award nomination for this role,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565629/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2001,No Oscars for this one,I cannot understand why people are touting Hanks for an Oscar for this movie Does not approach Forrest Gump or Philadelphia in any way shape form or fashion Just a boring movie about a man on an island making conversation with a soccer ball Tom was lost in this movie only it was not on an island Movie was too vague and left you hanging at the end If you were not paying close attention at the start you would not have even known that the name of the ranch had been changed by the time Hanks got there to deliver the package,5.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565668/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2001,Few dialogue make it unique,Perhaps the aspect of this film that mostly impressed me is constituted by the few dialogues and the great silence that make this film unique It s well directed well performed and I think it has a good score too It isn t certainly a masterpiece but a good film It tells about the story of a castaway who manage to come back only four years later His girlfriend is married and he has to re start life Certainly Tom Hanks was more worthy of getting oscar than Russel Crowe,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565983/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2001,Great movie! Another amazing performance by Hanks.,I really enjoyed this movie I am glad that when hanks washes up on the deserted island they didn t load it up with all sorts of idiotic scenarios like pirates or savage natives or predators and such It is just Hanks trying to survive the best he can all alone He had plenty of time for soul searching to see what drives you to fight to stay alive It makes you wonder how you would have done it if you were in his shoes The ending was different also from what you might expect Its not all tidy happy ever after ending which I liked The reuniting of Hanks and Hunt at the end is very intense and touching that definitely tugs at you emotionally,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565865/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2001,It could have been better.,Hanks is such a wonderful actor The storyline is interesting Sadly the final product is less than the sum of it s parts A few fewer Hollywood cliches would have held my interest longer,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565687/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2001,"I enjoyed this movie, and so did my squeeze",When I first saw the advertisements for this movie I had no interest in seeing it I thought Tom Hanks ego would do to this movie what Alan Alda did to MASH RUIN IT I was wrong and I was swept up in the film There is a love story to make the girls cry and enough cool stuff especially the plane crash to keep the guys from looking at their watches Besides I heard Hannibal was not that good,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565815/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,Just Excellent,This is just a good movie Good pace perfect focus on characters perfect photography It is really interesting to notice that viewer reviews are VERY different from each other and focus on different aspects of the movie Clearly this movie contains MUCH more that it appears I did not like the Fed Ex commercial though Conclusion see it and possibly see it again,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565633/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2000,How many endings does one movie need?,Zemeckis and Broyles deserve credit for a truly original version of a tired concept Robinson Crusoe Gilligan s Island Survivor etc The middle greater part of the film set on the island is extremely watchable never boring and often moving Tom Hanks is so acceptable to all of us as a sort of everyman one can t help but fully identify with this character in these circumstances Also I have to mention the plane crash is the most unsettling and I assume realistic I ve ever seen The one problem with the movie and I think it actually fatally mars the whole thing is the ridiculous ending s meant to spin some sort of sentimental closure I counted 5 possible endings and the thing kept going for 15 more minutes I think the studio was probably afraid of ending on an uncertain note so they just kept adding on until they reached the level of maudlin sentimentality they felt appropriate In actuality uncertainty would have perfectly matched the tone of Hanks character at that point in the film,5.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565524/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,There is no justice...,There is no justice in Hollywood if this film doesn t receive academy award noms for actor director and picture to say the least If you want to see a film that will make you think this is the film for you I was spellbound by it and think I left the theater with something from this movie A better understanding of the morals of life,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565635/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2000,"""This is a great catch, not to be thrown back""",In the past years Tom Hanks has been one of the greatest American actors ever First Philadelphia then Forrest Gump Toy Story Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile Now 11 months later Tom Hanks is in top form once again in which could be his fourth Academy award nomination for best actor and hopefully a best picture nod Those who are thinking Cast Away is just a one man Gilligan s Island are badly mistaken No coconut phones no wooden branch radios this my friends is the real deal Poor Tom Hanks trying to survive on this island in the middle of nowhere You owe yourself to see Cast Away,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565846/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2001,"Not perfect, but wonderful",I saw Cast Away last night and must say that I was very impressed The fact that I am a fan of Tom Hanks probably helped me enjoy the film because I doubt anyone who does not like Tom Hanks would enjoy Cast Away being the fact that he is almost the entire film Cast Away is far from a perfect film as there are some minor and a few major holes in the story and sadly the script is not always up to scratch To be honest I was a little surprised that the film has so many flaws given the fact that the Australian media have been so full of praise In my opinion however Tom Hanks carries the film beyond these flaws and script letdowns and while Helen Hunt is not given much to do she is wonderful in the small screen time she has The first 25 30 minutes of the film is essentially fairly dull however it has a certain edge to it created by the viewer already knowing what is install for Hank s character The plane crash is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen on film I was actually not looking forward to the plane crash footage because I figured it would be nothing more than something the audience would have to endure before the real story begun However it was so good that I actually felt myself tensing up which really say s something about the footage because I rarely respond like that to anything on screen The cast away part of the story is equally brilliant because it could so easily have been unbearably boring I think many reviewers on this website are correct in their disliking of the way in which it cuts to four years later as it does feel as if Zemeckis took the easy way out in this respect My only other complaint about the cast away part of the story is Hank s escape off the island which did seem a little rushed in execution and generally not as dramatic with the exception of one moment but I won t completely spoil it as the events that had taken place before However this part of the film is by in large incredible and a work of pure genius from both Zemeckis but particularly Hanks Finally many reviewers here have complained about the last part of the film many suggesting that it went on too long However I did not find myself bored or restless during the last part of the film because I was generally interested in finding out what happens to Hank s character as he tries to re enter society My complaint about the last part has more to do with the script lulls because the film does not answer some of the bigger questions regarding this transition However like all of the weaker spots in the film Hanks carries the audience past them and it is his presence that makes this one of the best films since American Beauty released around the same time last year I truly hope that Hanks gets his third Oscar for his role in this film because quite simply I have not seen a better performance in any film over the last 12 months,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565717/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2001,Better than I thought,Sometimes I think Tom Hanks gets nominated for too many awards so I was very skeptical of a long film about a Robinson Crusoe type film Sometimes it s nice to be surprised The direction was unconventional by focussing on his island stay rather than flashing back all the time and Hanks gives what must be one of his best performances making a very credible loner interacting with a volleyball You come out with an invigoration of the human spirit determined to have a fulfilled life whether we ever do is another issue,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565686/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2001,Think of people and things that you can't live without....,I watched the movie one night while my sister was busy preparing her graduation admission exam in another room After it was over it really took me a while to regain myself and then I came up to my sister and hugged her closely and tightly Thank God We re here with each other And Xixi her name you know I love you Probably nobody can truly present how a man would behave when being cast away But I think Tom Hanks did a good job in this movie in both unimaginable and imaginable scenes What actually is this story about the basic needs of mankind the value of life itself the courage to survive despair hope and love the only salvation the beauty of our everyday life that should not be neglected how to define misfortune and fortune Points for us to ponder and many things for us to be grateful And to say to do to love to experience to live our life to the fullest,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565694/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2000,disappointment/suprised/could have been so much better.,There were so many scenes in this film that dropped the ball Scenes that could have been dramatic Instead they went nowhere For instance as Hanks waded through the water cutting his feet on coral Blood was everywhere yet no sharks And why not switch back to what was happening at home People were leaving during the film and NOT COMING BACK This is no slam against Tom Hanks for he is truly gifted But the script clearly had problems Several scenes could have brought gasps from the audience brought suspense drama to the film instead the man beside me started snoring Too many set ups without going anywhere This was the very first time that I was disappointed with a Tom Hanks film In the cave a skeleton would have worked Maybe during the crash Hanks could have been saved by the captain then when Hanks was safe in the raft the captain could have been washed overboard and drown in the high seas Of course this is just my opinion but I was just so disappointed in this film I thought the ending could have been more dramatic and Hunt could have brought up the ring that Hanks had given her before he left She could have gone back to Hanks or maybe her husband could have loved Hunt so much that he actually sacrificed his own happiness so Hunt would be happy with the love of her life Oh well Sorry Such talented people involved yet I went away disappointed I don t think I was the only one,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565813/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,A fairly poor movie overall,I was very disappointed after seeing this movie The story not being original see the book Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe I expected much more from the playwright than was offered I could honestly say that I haven t learned anything from this film that I hadn t already known Even the moments that were intended to be dramatic and thought provoking were usually long and cliche as for the adventure side of the movie apart from a scene or two at the beginning the adventure and the thrill are missing almost completely Far from being a suspenseful thriller the movie leaves viewers wanting for more most of the time and eschews improvisation and the potential for action In short if you ve read Robinson Crusoe or even if you are a little familiar with the story then don t waste your time on this movie It really isn t worth your time and Tom Hanks s acting cannot make up for the lame scenario,3.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565477/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2000,A classic case of interesting story turned commercial,Riding on the coattails of Survivor comes the movie Cast Away I had the same complaints with Cast Away as I did with Survivor Everyone wants to see a person sent to the naked edges of the Earth and observe the actions instinctive animalistic etc There needs to be more motivation than just survival In Cast Away Tom Hanks is stranded in the South Pacific which doesn t happen until well into the 30 minute mark a signature Zemekis move of not getting to the point The story if we disregard all that has happened prior to this is still interesting as hell Man against Nature in its raw est form Still Tom Hanks did a pretty good job It s not as good of a movie as I had hoped for but it s not without it s charm 6 of 10,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565487/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2001,Cast yourself away and SEE THIS MOVIE!!!,I m sure that the grapevine has reached all of you with good and bad about this movie Instead of explaining the plot of this fantastic film which are available and excellently articulated in prior reviews I will explain how I never really left the theater that day I was looking forward to this film ever since it s trailer in The Grinch While I was sitting in the theater I was hypnotically transported to the island with our hero I was there making hatchets out of ice skates I was there bawling my eyes out when Wilson passed on I commend both Hanks and Zemeckis for their ability to entrance the audience I had begun to actually believe that the volleyball was really talking with Hanks character At first the idea was silly to me but within minutes I could almost hear Wilson talking Mentally I never left the theater Sure Chuck Noland was cast away but so was the audience When I physically left the theater I felt distant I felt like one person instead of a member of society I believe that s what Zemeckis and Hanks wanted you to feel The entire film was about realizing yourself It worked I look at this film not as a drama but more as a fantasy that every human being should wish upon themselves This movie was indeed a saga It was like a trilogy in one movie There will be no sequel There will be no prequel It s done The movie opened and closed stepping to the top of cinema history,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565894/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2001,An introspective look at the thematic implications of Cast Away.,I am feeling well melancholy isn t perhaps the right word but close Pensive Contemplative I have been in this state for nearly 5 days now and this is my homage to that feeling this is my way of capturing it harnessing it As thoughts flood into my head I desperately try to write them down as quickly as possible but surely some will get washed away with the tide I have just returned from a movie that has altered or re affirmed my view of life and the world It is my second time seeing Cast Away and I am undoubtably changed Not so much changed but perhaps intensely more aware of what is important in life All my days equalling 22 years to this point have told me one day I would become but as I m growing to learn you never finish becoming as you learn more and more about life and the world you try things on for size and see how they fit you It doesn t end nobody taps you on the head with a magic wand one day and says ok you have become now go and live It is the living that fuels the becoming That said there are definitely defining times or moments when one feels themselves becoming faster or closer to who they think they are This was one such time for me watching Tom Hanks live out on screen my dream I really battle with the idea of who I am One day I think I know the next it has changed without warning Identity is so difficult because you can t have an objective opinion about yourself yet only you know yourself well enough to determine your own identity This leads one to the conclusion that perhaps though moulded by our nurture it is indeed our nature that is already planned out for us which we reveal piece by piece with each successive leg of experience and experiences in life One think I know for sure is I am meant for a simple life Not simple in that I am a simple person for I am one of the most complex people I know of but simple as in that is what I crave long for and have grown up to appreciate Despite my sometime wild dreams of wealth and prosperity down deep I realize the wealth I seek is wealth of life the marrow the experience and prosperity in making a difference on the world I touch The movie Cast Away has stirred something inside of me I need to remind myself of more often the value of simplicity the necessity to re evaluate what is really important and how much our antibiotic commercialistic technology driven society brainwashes us into thinking that if we buy into it we ll fill a void that can truly only be filled by God and self knowledge that comes from truly living This kind of living is one virtually unknown to our North American society but it is one based on need and necessity and not greed and desire And when it comes down to it truly all we need to live is faith sustenance purpose and above all else love When we stand at the cross roads of life there are many paths we could take and only one we will As Frost suggests I shall embark on the one least travelled My life awaits me along the path not at the end While you may think I haven t told you anything about the movie this is everything the movie has purged from me and so maybe I ve told you more than a plot summary could ever do If you want an opinion form your own by seeing it and experiencing it It may cause you to re evaluate your self and your life Remember the depth of the movie is only as deep as you allow it to penetrate and it s strength comes from understanding that it s Cast Away and not Castaway I know what I have to do now I gotta keep on breathing because the sun will rise in the morning and you never know what the tide will bring Tom Hanks in Cast Away,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565596/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,Very Engaging,CastAway was gripping from start to finish I was very drawn into the story and I really cared about what was to become of Tom Hanks character Hanks by the way was brilliant yet again and showed his fantastic talent even in a film with limited dialogue and interaction with other characters The film direction and cinematography were also outstanding and the plane crash sequence was well very intense to say the least Overall it was a very good movie with an engaging and engrossing story superb acting and a great message to end the film Check it out it s worth it,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565617/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2001,Incredible!,I thought Cast Away was simply incredible What I liked most about this movie was the way it handled the situation and its cinematography First I believe if someone were to be stranded there situation would be played out similar to Chuck s No pirates natives snakes buddies abundant food supplies and other plot devices every other movie of this genre uses It is a man alone on a small island left to himself and a volleyball Hanks played this part so convincingly I felt as if his character was always just teetering on the edge of insanity Myself and others I saw this movie with felt real sorrow when Chuck loses Wilson I felt this movie had a very strong ending I believe it ended at the right point We see how Chuck adjusts but what he decides to do with his life is left up the the viewers imagination I also believed the cinematography was spectacular Granted anything filmed in the South Pacific will look beautiful the filming in this movie captures the feeling of being on the tiny island with Chuck Four stars,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565655/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2019,Must watch,It is a nod to Tom Hanks talent that for the majority of Cast Away the only other object or thing in the movie is a volleyball I m sure there will be wags who will glibly compare Cast Away to the likes of Gilligan s Island and Survivor but in tone approach and overall accomplishment this atypical Robinson Crusoe tale bears a strong resemblance to one of director Robert Zemeckis earlier efforts Contact No Cast Away isn t about space or messages from another planet but at its core neither was Contact Both films ask the same crucial existential question one that Shakespeare pondered for years taking all things into account what does it mean to be human How do we cope with loss hopelessness and isolation and still find the courage to face the next day The love and dream of a dead father sustained Jodie Foster s character in Contact For Tom Hanks Chuck Noland in Cast Away it is the promise offered by the smile of his equally absent and equally beloved wife to be A magical experience,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5195344/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2001,"A bright, shiny package with nothing inside.",There is nothing below the shiny surface of this movie what did Hanks character really cast away He finds no perspective on his life or situation other than a similarity to tidal vicissitudes He discovers no spirituality of any kind not even when he buries the man who saved his life He relates to a ball better than he ever did to his girlfriend or to her memory what does that teach him Nothing that we can see The strengths he is forced to find in his solitude are a mystery to us besides making fire it s therefore a mystery as to how well or how badly these all important basic strengths translate to his real life or to his new self So again I ask what was cast away what was found His bland relationship with Hunt s character That s it Seems he should ve discovered cast away a lot more on that island therefore returned home a richer man Are we ever asked what is really hidden in every man s heart underlying civilization Or what use or meaning there is in a single solitary life Oddly no I found the film sadly strangely void A deserted island is so fertile as a dramatic device yet it simply framed a film that itself felt deserted,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565774/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2001,Excellent production and splendid settings. Good performance.,The story line was not hard to follow and was very interesting but it is very hard to stuff any more since it was already 3 hours long The viewer s imagination was needed to fill in the rest of the sage This film was very hard to work on the outdoor sets The realities of island living are brutal and difficult to portray Much of the hardships were left out of the film Anyone who watched Gilligan s Island would have thought otherwise Tom Hanks carried the film on his back and did much better than expected I agree with most other comments about desiring to see more scenes about Chuck Nolans integration back into society I expected more makeup work to display a variety of skin diseases rashes infections and at least a skin peeling sunburn The island scenes captured his injuries well and helped the audience with much of the painful side of the experience especially the bad tooth scene in the cave The film needed more pain It was too sterile after the rescue,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565810/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2001,Tom's the Bomb!,Tom Hanks was able to carry the movie with no other actors for much of the movie This is a difficult task to pull off so well because actors generally rely on each other for drama It is hard for one actor to hold the audience attention for such a long time without resorting to overly broad strokes Hanks was able to hold the audience attention without giving way to self consciousness He has proven himself to be a versatile actor with a lot of range This performance must be seen,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565841/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2001,So many people missed the point of this film,I ve seen Cast Away nine times and I m still noticing bits of new information here and there Some of the people who missed the point of this film did so because they have basic details wrong I wish I had the space to write an in depth review but instead I ll just concentrate on one specific area of contention the ending and add my general opinion as to why this movie has been so widely misunderstood and misinterpreted SPOILER ALERT READ ON ONLY IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM First of all Noland is not smiling at the end of the picture although he may be intentionally mimicking Wilson s half smile He is clearly facing in Bettina s direction but it is not clear that he is going to follow her The point is that he knows that he could follow her if he wanted to he is back to the place where he has choices about life again In the ice in my glass speech he says his low point on the island is about having power over nothing At the end of the film he has regained that personal power to go in whatever direction he chooses to follow Bettina or not The mere opportunity to make the decision is the resolution more important than the specific decision itself That is a psychologically sophisticated ending much more satisfying than the typical Hollywood alternative If he had jumped in the truck and driven after her I would have thrown something at the screen it just wouldn t have fit Also although he thought that Kelly was the woman with him on the island giving him the strength to go on during the four isolated years it is equally true that Bettina was with him on the island she was present with him through her art and his reproductions of her art even though he had never met her Bettina is a good match for Chuck for whatever reason she s grown comfortable with being isolated from modern life too she s living out in the middle of nowhere she s driving an antique truck in a culture that judges you by the trendiness of the car you drive she does not recognize him even though he s an international media celebrity the story of his rescue was thoroughly covered in all those newspapers and magazines on Kelly s dining room table Noland thought Kelly was his reason for living and he lost her but Bettina was his reason for living too in some ways more directly responsible for his survival and salvation escape and there is still a chance that he could have her a fairly good chance from the way she flirted with him and just wait till she hears the story about how her art saved his life I could go on and that s about the ending alone I think that the real problem with people s mixed response to this picture is that you do have to care about Tom Hanks to appreciate this performance I think he is a great actor and more than just a movie star but who says that the two can t be one and the same I care about every character he plays well we won t mention Sherman McCoy and the whole point of my moviegoing is to enter into a story about characters I can care about But that is a sign of my age and my identity as a student of human nature Most of us reading this board know that the modern movie going audience isn t interested in caring about characters anymore They don t care about Hanks Noland any other character or maybe even themselves for that matter In fact watching bad things happen to characters no one cares about drives most movies these days The vast majority of commercial hits are made for people who can only be entertained by laughing at people doing stupid things for the price of a movie ticket they get a chance to feel superior to somebody laughing at people being killed maimed or otherwise physically harmed how sick is that pat sentimental mush at the level of romance novels or true confession magazines stuff blowing up sexual display and innuendo How could those people hope to get anything out of Cast Away or any other serious picture They have no frame of reference no experience of reflecting on the meaning of life The other group of people who hate this film are the too cool for film school cynics who use their art as a distancing tool to keep from feeling uncool emotions like empathy tenderness and transcendence I don t even have space to go into how much I pity those people for they also have trouble entering into the real meaning of life and their art is therefore destined to be empty only appealing to others who have adopted the same cynical worldview I do love Tom Hanks I ll admit that I adore him admire him and respect him I love his intelligence his discipline his integrity his dedication to his craft his interest in history his liberal politics his happy marriage no small feat in this world and the fact that he shares my vocation as a student of human nature Also he is lovely to look at even with a Buddha belly a scraggly beard or wild man s hair those lips those eyes and he plays the full range of his expressive speaking voice like Yo Yo Ma on the cello Some of his critics think that those of us who love him are reading into his work a subtlety of emotion that isn t really there and or overlooking his over the top moments because of personal devotion to him I only know that I feel bonded to all the people who reacted to the depth of his performance in the same way that I did Whether we react to him out of our feelings for him or out of his acting ability is almost irrelevant how can who he is be separated from the art he creates This is what it means to be an icon a national treasure and all the other superlatives we use to describe him His own self is the only canvas on which any actor can paint he uses his personality his access to his own emotional history even the aura of decency that keeps us from accepting him as a bad guy he uses all of this to create these unforgettable roles and in return we care about the characters he portrays and the stories he tells In my opinion he should have about five Oscars by now look at Apollo 13 again look at Saving Private Ryan imagine them without Hanks imagine any other actor who ever lived trying to do what he did in Cast Away how many people would pay to watch Russell Crowe rub two sticks together especially if he were robbed of the superficial elements of his physical attractiveness As some other reviewer said it shouldn t matter how many Oscars you already have if you give the best performance of the year most physically challenging most emotionally authentic most essential to the artistic success of your film you ought to be the winner Hanks can easily do without that third Oscar for now But one of these days he will get it and with it the proof that he is the finest actor of my lifetime Let Russell have his make up Oscar Tom was robbed as surely as Ralph Fiennes was robbed for Schindler s List But in 25 years we ll still be watching Schindler s List and we ll still be watching Cast Away while The Fugitive will lie on some forgotten celluloid heap and Gladiator will have become as laughable as the Ten Commandments So although I m disappointed I can wait because Hanks will be turning in fine nuanced performances and making memorable emotionally resonant films for another 20 years long after Crowe has been supplanted by the next alpha male on the block Unsolicited advice for Russell Crowe get over yourself put your Oscar in a box send it to Tom Hanks and shut up And anyone who thinks Gladiator was a great film needs to arrange an immediate screening of Spartacus I ll stop short of saying that Cast Away is a great film like many others on this board I think I could have made or edited a better movie both a tighter movie with respect to the set up and a more complete movie with an expanded development of his descent into despair and resignation on the island It s too obvious that they shot a lot of other island footage that is left out but I guess Zemekis was right to be concerned about length since people have been complaining about that as for me it was 2 23 well spent and I dream of a three hour director s cut I would have also made the ending longer expanding the resolution between Noland and Frears But while Cast Away may not be a brilliant picture Tom Hanks definitely gives a brilliant performance It is the kind of acting that makes people think re evaluate come to a new understanding of the world It is the kind of performance that changes people s lives It changed mine I am still stunned that Hanks was overlooked on Oscar night I heard the Best Actor race was tight and the voting very close I guess too many of the Academy voters fit my description above cluelessly shallow or smugly cynical The rest of us love Hanks love his acting and loved Cast Away I think I ll go see it

6 April 2020,Perfect,Let me first say that I am a huge Tom Hanks fan and see most of his films I LOVED Cast Away and it s one of my favorites The photography and story and most of all Mr Hank s performance make this an outstanding film For an actor to play scenes with only himself and Wilson is just great Robert Zemeckis is an incredible filmmaker and I just loved this,10.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5614341/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2001,Survivor on big screen....,Oh boy are survivor fans happy Whoever came up with the idea of making this movie hit the target The portrail of a Russian FedEx facility is rather funny yet amazingly idiotic Shnella Shnella my workers hurry up in german But anyways who cares see the movie for yourself it s a lot better than reading someone s comment By the way DVD will include footage of the rescue of the volleyball that was used in the movie Apparently it wondered off in the ocean and has been spotted by the Coast Guard and successfuly rescued Have fun watching that on DVD,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565907/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2001,The Travail of love,When I viewed this movie it was so excruciating to view the movie for the second time Tom Hanks gave a sterling performance that won a million hearts He had reached to the heart of the masses that is the beauty of his histrionics We know that pain has no language therefore it cannot be expressed but Tom Hanks gave a terminology to his pain without uttering a word in it His countenance spoke even the words of his heart He had really left an indelible mark in us no doubt in it The director really had an audacity to handle this delicate subject and the ending was too hard to bear In every moment of the movie we were able to feel Tom Hanks emotions which is so captivating I always wondered what Love is I was told that love is sharing caring and sacrifice which I always accepted but after viewing this movie I understood that love is a journey not a destination with needs lot of faith and endurance Tom Hanks may have not won his third Academy award but he deserves a standing ovation which merits every one s approbation,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565989/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2001,I loved this movie! If you have an open mind and a couple hours I think it's a must see.,I went into this movie not knowing what to expect I had actually read a bad review and wasn t planning to see it at all Maybe the bad review is what set me up to be pleasantly surprised I can probably name on less than ten fingers the movies I actually wanted to see more than once when I first viewed them This is the third movie I ever rented and then immediately rewound and watched again I thought it was that good I had to have more And by the third time I was anticipating the dialog and I really got a kick out of it About the ending I thought it was perfect Some might think it falls short but I love to see things that are open to possibilities I feel this is a must see for anyone who enjoys a diversion I certainly do feel the need to get away from time to time And after what this guy goes through the line at the market definitely doesn t seem so bad,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565982/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2001,better than expected.,Initially I thought a film almost entirely acted out by one person would be boring I was wrong On top of Hanks now regular encapsulating performance the direction is perfect even managing to make a scene where Hanks tries to start a fire by rubbing sticks together enthralling His gradual slip into insanity matched by his friendship with a volleyball is not only believable but also touching The fantastic photography and the Directors awareness to overlook the tempting schmalz of a typically American ending are the finishing points which create an overall perfect film which will no doubt go down as a modern day classic and deservedly so And now I m off to get a cherry coke,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565999/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2001,Good effort.,This movie portrays the typical stranded on a deserted island storyline I give this movie credit for the following reasons 1 Realism while no movie can truly portray an accurate depiction of real life this movie makes an honorable attempt A truly believable story overall but believable in the same way that The Old Man and the Sea is believable it is so dull that it might actually happen 2 Creativity I give this movie a higher rating because of the writers producers creativity in making everyone s favorite piece of sporting equipment Mr Wilson an integral part of the plot Unlike the Old Man and the Sea I mentioned earlier the leather bound counterpart to the protagonist works much more effectively than a large decaying fish While the fish is treated more as an object to be worshiped the volleyball is treated more as a companion and makes for much better dialouge Overall a good movie Very respectable performance by Tom Hanks who incidentally lost a decent amount of weight for his part Also this movie is yet another example of his ever expanding variety of roles and how his characters continue to evolve and mature,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566039/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2002,He missed the simplist way of making a fire.,I found Cast Away enjoyable and thought provoking But it bothered me that this intelligent and resourceful man missed a simple way to make a fire He had a flashlight a Maglite which provided short lived protection from darkness with its symbolic security of civilization Eventually the batteries die and has to work very hard making a fire to feel civilized again But if he had removed the front of the flashlight he could have used it as a lens to concentrate the sun s light and easily have made a flame The glass cover to his pocket watch and the wrist watch could probably also have served Since their curves are not as great as the flashlight it would have taken a little longer,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566185/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2002,Pleasantly surprised,Warning spoilers below I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie though admittedly my expectations may have been fairly low Nonetheless I felt that the movie was deeper and more meaningful than the typical Hollywood fare while being plenty entertaining giving audiences a chance to get a good look at Tom Hanks at his best I was expecting a re hash of Survivor modus such as a bunch of shots of Tom Hanks eating bugs followed by a smarmy reunion with his cute blonde wife in a neatly contrived finale at the end Instead I was surprised by the complex themes examining the contrast between typical modern life of abundance and a scant life spent in solitude The pace of the movie was slow and contemplative especially by Hollywood standards without being boring This sparse set gave Hanks room to give a very personal and entertaining performance and gave audiences time to digest the deceptively complex themes The ending was satisfyingly uncompromising The opening scenes show Chuck Hanks character enforcing somewhat exaggerated yet realistic capitalistic regimens on simpler foreign cultures by training them to sort FedEx packages and measuring their competence down to the second But before long Chuck finds himself stranded on a small island with nothing to do where the smallest unit of time is a day During what becomes a multi year period of isolation Chuck and the audience are able to reflect on what is simplest and most important in life And Chuck learns the important lesson that life is so precious that it is probably worth living even if it seems unlivable and that anything can happen both good and bad Chuck s eventual personal transition that leads to his return to the modern world is reminiscent of Buddhism s Concept of Emptiness wherein you must truly have nothing before you can gain enlightenment Chuck s perspective on the modern world after his ordeal should cause the audience to reflect upon their own position in the same world and ask themselves how they would react if they lost things that they currently deem essential,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566176/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2002,This movie was long...so long,Ok guys Even though T H is a reasonably good actor this movie focussed too much on him and his stupid ball and made the whole thing pretty one sided And it lasted 2 1 2 hours and the most exciting thing was when the ball fell in the water and TH had to save it Grasping for friends a bit too much And Fedex To summarise main characters Tom Hanks his ball and lots of Fedex packages Enough said A Big Fat 5 5 10,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566115/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2002,Another Hanks masterpiece,SPOILERS SPOILERS Spoilers ahead Personally I don t get all the negativity surrounding this film I think its mostly an anti Hanks contingent Hanks is quite simply one of the greatest actors out there No this is not his greatest film but I still put it in a category of being a great film The Fed Ex thing is a little annoying but its better to use a real company rather than Ye olde delivery service to bring some realism to the movie I ve only ever seen the movie in Japan so I ve always seen it with Japanese subtitles and the fact that there are no subtitles appearing on screen for long periods of time give testimony to how powerful the movie is despite no real dialogue for about a quarter of the movie Chuck Noland goes through a real transformation during his time away We see him at the beginning being a company man who can t relate to his colleague on a personal level and who brings a beeper to Christmas dinner By the end he totally opens up to his colleague and looks willing to settle into rural life with the woman at the end He is also willing to give up the woman he loves the old Chuck wouldn t have done that There is no way that this movie is about how shallow women are as one reviewer said I admit that 4 years is a little soon to fall in love remarry and have a child but anyone who has lost someone they loved would probably support her for doing this The last scene is very strong Chuck only had one road ahead of him at the beginning but now he has a choice I think most of us would like to be him standing at that intersection having a choice And to those who felt Wilson had more character than Chuck really just don t get it so its not worth informing you of the significance of that Simply put a great film that really shows us what a materialistic world we have become and shows us what can happen when we are given a choice in life Highly recommended For the record it is not 3 hours long as most people have stated,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566200/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2015,Spoiler,A lot of people don t understand the ending They think it a sad one but it s actually a very happy one Chuck is at the crossroad deciding where he should head The angel girl pulls up and they talk They are noticeably attracted to each other She leaves and he notices the angel wings on the back of her truck and he ponders He walks out unto the crossroad facing one direction then turns to the other direction and then the other and then he turns in the direction from which she came and the wind is blowing toward him Once again the tide came in and brought her to him as the tide brought him the sail He turns his head in her direction and a smile of realization comes to his face And they lived happily ever after and Kelly was jealous as all get out,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3318020/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2003,Awesome,I think that Cast Away is the best acting that i have ever seen Tom Hanks do i loved it It was a stretch from the norm and yet it was realistic to me as well although i wasn t too satisfied with Helen Hunt as his love interest i think that a better choice could have been made perhaps Meg Ryan they have always been the perfect fictional movie couple,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566252/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2020,"Great movie, terrible trailer",Although the movie was excellent the trailer ruined the experience I actually thought about requesting a refund I m not going to give away any spoilers because I practice what I preach but the trailer gives away a major plot point It has to do with the amount of time Chuck is on the Island I m not the first one to complain You can read what Zemekis said about the trailer controversy on this site What the F does he care He still made his millions regardless These marketers who make the trailers should really think about their spineless decisions and catering to the status quo,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5649545/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2012,Classic Tom Hanks film!,I watched the DVD which has been sitting around for years just so i would have something to do for a few hours but came out amazed Many people misunderstand the whole movie saying it didn t have enough action or the four years with Tom Hanks on the island was too long I myself think that the entire movie was well balanced and well done The movie showed extremely well how you would try to survive on an island by yourself It showed the challenge of hunting your food creating fire so you could cook you food and mainly STAYING SANE The one thing that kept Tom Hanks character sane or at least some what sane he does talk to a vollyball is Helen Hunt s character but we never really got to know her because later Hanks finds out when he gets back that being with her again is not possible Sort of ironic Many people thought the ending was horrible but i think it shows well the many choices that Hanks had to face By putting him in the middle of the intersection he must go one way and that direction may change his life The woman that came and told him what there was each direction was not a replacement for Helen Hunt but merely another choice and kind of a guide by telling him what each road lead to And anyways she is better looking if he does end up with her so good for him In conclusion this movie was very risky because of the lack of dialogue and action after all he is on an island for four years by himself but Tom Hanks was able the pull it off and give and excellent performance I could not have chosen a better movie to watch when i need something to do You can find this video for probably not that much money these days I recommend strongly,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2581505/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2012,Moving Drama,Cast Away shows that a person s life and dreams can all change in an instant Not only does Robert Zemeckis show the affects death has on close individuals but also he shows the affects it can have on the world or in this case a company Zemeckis portrays a message in this film that if a person does not keep up with the world the world will pass them up with out any thought Cast Away is a film which captures the audience with a story of love and nonstop adventure It puts the audience in a place which can only be imagined This is a very well acted film because even after having only one person on the screen for over an hour and still it has the attention of the viewers I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone who is interested because even though it has heartbreak it leaves us with a chance of hope,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2588556/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2012,Poignant and moving drama,Castaway was moving and powerful Although Hanks relationship with Helen Hunt should have been developed a little more as the relationship between those two was vital to the story and could have enhanced the empathy of the viewer for the situation he later finds himself in However Helen Hunt doesn t really turn in a spectacular performance here the only roll I really liked her in was in As Good As it Gets and it may be for the best that she doesn t get a tremendous amount of screen time even considering the length of the movie This film I think further cements Tom Hanks in the roll of the Jimmy Stewart of our time he is again cast in an everyman role in which he so excels The main character is an intelligent interesting straightforward good honest unassuming person that I found easy to like and to sympathize with This movie is not filled with fireworks and if you don t like movies that take their time and move at a steady pace rather than racing from crisis to crisis you might not be that enthused This really is more a drama than an action movie I do like movies that allow me to get to know the characters involved and I did quite enjoy it I have recommended it to friends,9.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2588043/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2014,"Chuck Noland, an employee for FedEx, is sent on a business trip that resulted in a plane crash",Cast Away does an incredible job using cinematography to convey a message Film makers using extreme long shots to show distance and the enormity of the island Close shots are also used to make you feel secluded They are used to make you feel like there is nothing else around except for Chuck and you as you are watching it The directors did a create job with just casting one actor Tom Hanks and using him without dialogs to portray everything that was going on There were incredible aerial shots of Chuck standing on top of a large cliff that is over the island and ocean to show how massive that the island itself is and how high up that Chuck is Panning shots were also used very well to make a specific area of land or body of water to seem longer or bigger than it actually is Symbolism played a big role in Cast Away It created multiple ideas in an audience s mind of how the movie could go The use of natural lighting made the overall film quality better If you love wondrous slightly intense dramas then Cast Away is for you It does not keep you on the edge of your seat but it keeps your mind always thinking ahead about how this story could possibly end out If you enjoy just a little romance and not an extreme amount you would also enjoy this movie This movie is for all types of people It is not over dramatic and girl like It is for both guys and girls If you like feeling a part of a setting this movie will give you that exact feel If you love adventurous movie shots such as views from a top of cliffs and underwater then this is a movie you will come out of wanting to watch over and over,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3099721/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2000,"Less action than expected, but a great story...",Cast Away is an interesting story that forces us to think There are many great shots and nicely crafted scenes in Cast Away but what I think distinguishes it from most movies today is its willingness to show us a story rather than tell us what we should think and feel Although I would have liked to hear more of Hanks own thought process we re forced to look inward and see how Hanks character parallels our life Following the movie we are forced to reflect how we would act if we were on the Island what we would do if our only true love was lost for years only to reappear and how relationships lived inside our heads are often perfect but rarely play out in reality These all happen here and Zemekis wisely enough doesn t show us how they should be resolved but simply what happens to Hanks character and how an everyday man copes with extraordinary circumstances both on and off a deserted island,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565572/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2001,Could it really be Tom Hanks?,Could this sad excuse for a movie really star Tom Hanks AND win awards I m confused The plane crash scene has some great special effects If I just gave away too much of the plot watch the trailer again but other than that this was a terrible movie Mr Hanks has been great in other roles but playing the part of a man on a deserted island for several years is not only unrealistic but just downright stupid This is a disturbing trend for movies if the only thing required to be nominated for lots of awards is a big name actor a camera and a volleyball what is the world coming to,3.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566025/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,"Gripping, Excellent, yet Confusing",This movie was fantastic Great special effects and each island scene couldn t have been better The plane crash scene was edge of your seat directing Bob Zemeckis can make a movie very well However you are left with a bittersweet taste at the end as to whether or not SPOILER HERE Chuck gets the girl or not Zemeckis kind of leaves the audience hanging here which provides you with a kind of Huh thought in your head as you walk out of the theater Many of Zemeckis films leave you with a lack of catharsis at the end of the film such as Back to the Future III Otherwise the film was excellent However the trailer is misleading and hints that Chuck and his girl live happily ever after Anyway you should see this movie and decide for yourself what you think happened Enjoy,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565632/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2001,One of The Best Movies and Script I´ve ever seen!!!,At the beginning of the movie I thought the picture was just going to be another version of Daniel Defoe s book Robinson Crusoe but let me tell you that with Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in the cast you can feel the movie When you see Tom Hanks trying to make fire you notice how we sometimes do not appreciate life as we should they have to take things away from us to really learn that we only live once Something amazing and that you will probably notice is how Tom Hanks really workout to be able to film the second part of the movie something similar when he did Philadelphia with Denzel Washington I truly recommend this movie when I was sitting at the theatre I wanted the story to never end maybe because I was wishing the end was different but I guess that s what makes this movie one of the best Rubens RAPL,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565660/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2000,What was in the Fedex box?,Tom Hanks once again proves his superior acting abilities as he holds the audience s attention for the movies entire length From Moscow to the remote pacific island the audience was engulfed with truly powerful settings and human emotions The only question that was left in the audience s mind was What was in the Fedex box I believe that the ending would have been better served with a bit more finality However I feel it was a bit too open I would have liked more of a climatic ending But with that said my congratulations to Mr Hanks for another wonderful and refreshing movie going experience,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565550/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2001,A soggy Robinson Crusoe with a touch of Unrequited Love,Perhaps it s a generational thing after all my moviegoing history dates to childhood in the 30s so my perspective may be a little warped But with all due respect to the talented Mr Hanks this is a Robinson Crusoe for the new century that just doesn t work High tech yes SFX yes But soggy soooo soggy And that dash of Unrequited Love is a tease that just doesn t work either even when it involves the talented Ms Hunt Too bad,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565789/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2001,"Watchable, yet incredibly flawed",First off I will agree with anyone who says the performance by Tom Hanks And most any other actor or actress in this movie was quite astounding However I feel this movie s problems are What Lies Beneath To steal the title from Zemeckis other film this year Usually I am the last person to say a movie is boring oftentimes my favorite movies are those with a 3 hour running time At times however this movie to be blunt is BORING The reason for this is because all the island scenes are strung together one after another if the movie were to show one or two island scenes and then a scene of what was going on back home Say his friends and families reactions to the crash or his funeral and so on the pacing wouldn t have suffered so greatly Second on this island he has food water shelter and so on So why is he unhappy Easy No human contact This is where Wilson the volleyball s role was so pivotal Yet everyone in the auditorium including myself could not stop laughing The movie failed on all counts to show Mr Hanks character s grief I kept drawing parallels between the last 45 minutes of this film and David Croenberg s The Dead Zone Both feature a character who has been removed from society for a number of years and then is thrown back in only to find that everything has changed The movie could ve succeeded here It could ve shown in detail what had changed it could ve further allowed Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt to show off their acting chops it could ve shown how the characters dealt with these changes it could ve been a better movie In 1998 s The Thin Red Line Terrence Malick proved to be quite a visionary director by showing silence and serenity and how it can get to a person This probably would ve made him the better director for Cast Away Alas we ll never know All in all this isn t a bad movie so much as it is a disappointment It s nice that Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis can make exceptionally good movies it s just a shame this isn t one of them,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565661/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2001,Disappointing,I am sorry to say especially with all the hype thrown at this film that I did not like this film Mainly the problem is the film tried to go somewhere but left me hanging on where Most of the actions Hanks takes on the island the film doesnt fill us in on what he is trying to accomplish and by the time you figure it out he is on to his next action At the beginning they could have had him talk to himself filling us in on what he s trying to do It does get a little better when he talks to Wilson They just didn t fill in enough for the viewer they left too much up to the viewer to figure out And the ending once again just leaves the viewer in the middle of nowhere trying to figure it out All in all disappointing,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565597/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2000,This movie was not as good as it could have been . . .,I went into Cast Away with expectations I would see a decent movie And I did But I did not see a great movie I am a big fan of Hanks Hunt Zemeckis and Broyles and they all could have done more Hanks and Hunt did as well as they could with below average scripting and direction I was disappointed the movie did not really deal with Hanks mental strain and scarring that no doubt would accompany living alone for 1500 days talking to a volleyball and I was also disappointed with the movie s nonchalance of simply reinserting Hanks back into society after his 1500 days alone I think there were some psychological gems missing in the movie that would have made it great Also Hunt s southern belle accent fades in and out from scene to scene annoying,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565502/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2000,Entertaining but not Oscar material,I was entertained by this movie Tom Hanks was able to hold my interest through his 50 minute monologue The crash scene had me in as much of a fetal position as I could muster in my seat I do not believe that this is Oscar material though as compared to some of Hanks previous works It is no Philadelphia or Forrest Gump,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565494/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2000,What a challenging film,Very good film and very surprising that Hollywood chose to challenge the viewer so much This is definitely a film that makes you think it sure doesn t present everything up front for the lowest common denominator movie goer as most films do I was amazed in reading the comments on this Db that nobody pointed out how much Hanks character s experience on the island mirrored the centuries of experience of ancient man in the Pacific The learning to create fire the way to get fresh water eventual speech notice how long on the island Hanks doesn t speak only when some of his most basic needs have been met does he move up Maslow s hierarchy and the creation of his own idol god in Wilson His own life depending upon fate and the whim of the tides The story is that of the evolution of man Moreover take his time on the island and compare it to what he had before he got on that plane Juxtapose the two and I think the movie makes a strong comment on how far we ve come standing on the shoulders of millions of years of evolution We ve forgotten how we got here and the movie attempts to remind us We re so far into self actualization that we d all be lost if all our stuff was taken away The love story that continues long after the film ends which is left up to us to create could be the greatest present this film offers Helen Hunt s character isn t developed because the viewer isn t supposed to grow too attached to her We are meant to dwell on what may be down the road for Hanks and White All that and the commentary on God or fate whatever you believe versus random occurrence Is there any measure of control exerted by us in our own lives is there a guiding force or is it all the natural whim of the universe This movie really let s you begin to ponder all of this but doesn t force you to think just one way I like movies like that,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565515/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,Longer than it has to be,This movie is great in almost every aspect starting from the courage to make such movie with a significant risk if that it might fail it s such an authentic experience and the fact that they didn t have to do any of the crazy stuff like Wild animals of any sort sharks snakes or whatever comes in mind and they just proved that surviving the thirst and hunger alone is tough enough but the main problem here that really drove me off that this movie is way longer that it s supposed to be they could ve cut 30 mins of unnecessary extended scenes at some point while this movie is still great it got me to sleep in a few scenes due to the nothingness,5.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4536907/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2000,"Thoughtful, brilliant, and original film--a must-see",I saw the Austin premiere of Cast Away yesterday and have been haunted by it since It is a profoundly moving film about one ordinary man s struggle for survival not just of the body but of the heart and mind at the hands of an indifferent Fate It is alternately funny unnerving gruesome beautiful and poignant and at all times believable I cannot recall another picture from a major studio this spare in terms of script and style it is a daring and refreshing movie Tom Hanks as Chuck makes the story compelling carrying more than an hour of the picture by himself with little dialogue and no soundtrack besides wind waves and rain The film can be enjoyed purely for the entertainment value of watching Chuck become lost and find his back to civilisation no spoilers here folks or it can be explored for many layers of meaning about relationships about destiny about ingenuity about inspiration and about our basic humanity The movie is not heavy handed with its message you take from it what you put into it and the audience is expected to work at it a bit Even the title is multi faceted but don t be daunted See this movie see it many times as I plan to do,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565790/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2001,Disappointing,If the makers of Castaway were trying to convey how boring it is to be stranded on a deserted island they did a fabulous job The pace of this movie is mind numbingly slow and the characters were undeveloped All we learn about the protagonist in the beginning which is just one long Fed Ex plug is that he s obsessed with his job and time more time was spent developing his relationship with a volleyball than the love of his life Helen Hunt,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565588/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2000,"It's not a movie about merely surviving, but really living.",This movie isn t called Castaway as in someone who s lost on a desert isle it s Cast Away as in something that has been discarded with time Chuck Noland never wanted to commit the sin of turning his back on time when in fact time turns its back on him This isn t a movie about merely surviving a four year imprisonment on a deserted island but about whether that survival is worth it It doesn t take long for Chuck to figure out if he can survive or not but it takes him the entire four years to decide that that is not enough Chuck Noland s life is taken away from him twice Both times he has to rebuild and discover a new reason to live He learns through these ordeals that it is alright to turn your back on time but to never let the moment pass you by,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566151/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2000,Disappointing,I was looking forward to an inspiring plot and a unique role for Hanks but this movie was disappointing Though the film was over two hours in length I couldn t help but feel that a lot of content had fallen gracelessly to the cutting room floor Time as a concept seemed to flip flop senselessly particularly when Hanks first few compelling and frightening weeks on the island abruptly end and we are informed with an awkward subtext that four years has transpired leaving Hanks lean mean and slightly demented Some scenes with his co star Wilson were touching Others were contrived And Hanks pathetic throaty cries as Wilson metaphorically drifts away reminded me more of his character in The Money Pit than anything else It was hard to take him seriously And I won t even mention the silliness of Hanks cetacean buddy who seemed to magically appear when he was needed most Finally there is Helen Hunt who seems to be the flavor of the moment in Hollywood but in this film she is poorly cast Her performance lacked the true grief desperation and elation her character should have demonstrated Overall this movie was disappointing I expected a more riveting performance from Hanks but the film s editors and writers should accept a greater share of blame for the oft contrived shallowness of what should have been the best film of the year See it but wait for the video,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565998/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2000,A real waste,This movie had the potential to be truly great A great cast great special effects and an original plot were all in place Unfortunatley the execution and the details were poor and it seemed as if the script was written in a rush without any thought Tom Hanks character finds himself on a deserted island after a plane crash From then on he acts as a man with no brain Upon finding numerous FedEx packages washed up on shore he stacks them up and opens them days later including one that he NEVER opens Upon finding a flashlight he sets it down while on and promptly falls asleep letting the batteries burn out Left with a small rubber raft he takes it out into the obviously huge waves puctures the raft and his leg in the process He does manage to produce fire but is then seen four years later eating raw fish I guess the fire thing got old huh After being on the island FOUR YEARS he gets the idea to BUILD A BOAT Only four years to think of that Intertwined in all this is an ongoing conversation with a freaking VOLLEYBALL He finally builds the boat and gets out into the open sea He loses the volleyball and weeps uncontrollably and then decides to throw away his oars and lay there and give up Funny how the volleyball is everything but those oars don t mean a whole lot Miraculously he is found and the movie grinds to an end By the end I was so frustrated I wished he had died,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565483/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2000,95% of the movie is superb,An honest journey into a man s fight for survival demonstrating how life without the material world is barely even life for modern day civilisation Examining solitude in a way perhaps never before explored in such a popular medium Over an hour of the movie is speech free putting focus on to both Tom Hanks and Robert Zemekis to deliver and they really do deliver The 5 I was less than impressed with constituted the ending shallow rushed and unlikely potential spoiler below Four years in desperate solitude would have changed his personality dramatically and that provided a great opportunity for a consistently excellent ending yet the final cut of the ending doesn t quite deliver You re left thinking that the ending belonged to an entirely different movie The beginning and middle section however are easily worthy of oscars and worth many times the money spent at the theatre,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565480/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2000,One of Best this Year,Everyone I saw this with our group and the rest of the theater was enthralled This isn t a movie that spoon feeds all its meaning to you you have to pay attention and think Hanks s does an amazing portrayal from shock to determination to escape to frustration desolation fear through despair a kind of reversion to primitive nature and bare grip on the edge of sanity from isolation The movie really explores issues of humanity community and human need without preaching it It s why I liked Saving Private Ryan better than The Thin Red Line Ryan had every bit as much to say about war and its effects but let you figure it out I would have to disagree with some comments such as that Hanks should have had time to enjoy the natural wonders not when mere survival is your full time every waking minute job and nature can easily be the enemy Also Hanks does explore as much as is physically possible you see everything he can see from that summit and there is only one beach I think the intensity comes from the whole movie except first few minutes being entirely from his vantage point I would not have wanted to see what was going on back home I also can t imagine why there ever would have been any other human on this volcanic outcropping hundreds of miles from nowhere so I m not sure what good a skeleton in the cave would have done SPOILER REBUTTAL AND COMMENT It was not the view of any in our group that he replaced Hunt with the redhead He was at the last looking down a different road the one toward California The ending didn t feel satisfying but I can t say it was unsatisfactory Hunt was ambivalent about commitment at the beginning and still ambivalent at the end She was consistent in that way Hanks was in a way still adrift only knowing that the sun will rise tomorrow,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565530/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2000,"My spiritual connection with the movie, and my recommendations.",I thought Cast away was an incredible movie The kind of movie that leaves you numb and motionless in your seat The team of Robert Zemeckis as director and Tom Hanks as star once again touched me in the same way that Forrest Gump with its epic style cinematography did before The story of a man who is cast away from a life of convenience to a life of extreme conditions that test his will to survive When I was watching the film I kept questioning myself questioning my capabilities if I were thrown into the same situation Would I fight to stay alive or just give up I certainly wouldn t have relied on a volleyball but it was a nice touch and this is a nice movie I ll give it 4 s a definate don t miss,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565566/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2000,WOW,When I first heard that Cast Away was about some guy who was stuck on an island for four years I thought Yah that s sounds REAL exciting sarcastic Then I started to think Well Tom hanks is in it how bad could it be So I went to see it and I was totally blown away You know you ve seen a great movie when you can t stop thinking about it for weeks after you ve left the theater I still get tears in my eyes thinking about Chuck s will to survive in Cast Away I can not even begin to fathom four years on an island ALONE I mean this guy s only companion for four whole years is a volleyball I think I d forget how to speak English after that long there but Chuck never loses his will to survive and makes do with what he has His memories of Kelly keep him alive and like he says afterward he just kept on breathing kept on living SPOILERS ALERT Three particularly striking moments in the movie were when he lost Wilson when he said that he had lost Kelly when the plane crashed then he had to lose her all over again when he was saved and third when he made fire HE felt like the greatest man alive and perhaps he was at the moment or for the next four years Chuck loved his volleyball it was his buddy he talked to it he argued with it discussed with it and then mourned over his losing it Although he seems to lose so much in the movie he has gained a much deeper understanding of himself and is in better touch with his soul and spirit He has endured just about as much as anyone can and lives though it The audience obviously finds itself wanting Chuck and Kelly to get back together and we weep with Chuck when we realize that it cannot happen Who else is still wondering what became of the Christmas present presumably an engagement ring that Chuck gave to Kelly the last time he saw her just before he got on the plane I think that his time on the island could have been a little more drawn out and his relationship with Kelly more developed but all in all this was one of the most touching films I have ever seen Forrest Gump is first on that list I have so much admiration for Tom Hanks You not only leave his movies thinking for weeks about the plot but thinking about his characters admiring them dreaming about them relating to them loving them I would so much love to be an actress like that and I have yet to find a female actor that I can look up to in that way Acting is what I love to do most and I will strive to do it in the fashion that Tom Hanks does If I ever make it to the big screen even for a second I pray that it is beside Tom Hanks THANK YOU TOM HANKS,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565574/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2000,One of the best thought provoking movies I have seen!!,It was without a doubt one of the best I have seen in a long time It sure is a good idea that maybe Hollywood continue making real human stories So sick and tired of violence and dumb space and other stupid plots Never visited this site before and not sure why I have to fill in four lines to say a movie is great but here they are 5 lines,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565573/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2001,A single man trapped on a Island where his adventure begins,A SUPERBLY AMAZING FILM Extrodinairely breath taking you can t take your eyes off this movie even if you tried it s that FANTASTIQUE With it s mix of eye popping scenes and unbelivable performance by the very gifted Tom Hanks this movie will rank in my top ten for a very long time,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565716/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,"Slightly shallow, but a good ride.",This is a GREAT film Being that the majority of films of 2000 were not that great this is a shoe in for multiple Oscar nominations Tom Hanks gives a great performance really making us feel as though we re there with him as though our fates are entwined with his His ability for acting shines in this role The greater part of the movie rests in mostly silence as we watch Hanks character Chuck struggling to live on the tiny island which has become his prison What s interesting about this is that it rips away all the advances and advantages we as a human race have gained leaving Chuck to learn all over again how to survive Rarely have I been actually hurt when I ve seen a character on screen experience pain One scene in particular which makes the audience cry out is when Chuck loses Walter I doubt there was one person in the theater that wasn t hurt wasn t hoping against hope that Hanks would get him back and was almost in tears when he didn t Granted the plot of this film is not complex and does not require much thought but that s not a bad thing Tom Hanks acting ability turns what could have been a mediocre role into one of depth making the viewer sympathise with every hardship he must endure One thing I ve heard many times over is how bad the ending is Why Because it s not happily ever after It is NOT a warm and cozy ending it s not made to make us feel good inside It s realistic And to those who scoff and Hanks sadness you ve failed to really FEEL his character Put yourself in his shoes How would you feel Want a funny movie See Dude Where s My Car Want a movie with a happy ending See Gladiator Want an emotional movie to envelop you and truly tie your feelings into knots See this one You will not be disappointed,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565637/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2001,Definitely worth it!,I thought this was a great film Tom Hanks was brilliant I liked the way the director brought in an element of comedy in a film which was really quite serious Before I saw the film I was told that it wasn t great but I always believe in giving films a chance and I m glad I did with this one The only fault I found with it was that the ending was a bit dragged out I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who doesn t mind sitting for 2hrs 20mins,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565679/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2001,It only seemed like four years.,Tom Hanks is a consummate professional who will go to whatever extreme necessary to be his character His only flaw in this film is picking the script Is it possible to sustain audience involvement for 60 minutes of one person on a deserted island no people no animals not even snakes lizards and bugs Four years is a long time to watch a movie,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565585/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,"I loved it ,I was a little disappointed on how it ended",I liked it it was very good It showed you never know when something can happen and totally change your life Tom Hanks did a super job I was a little disappointed on how it ended however it was a good movie and I would absolutely recommend it,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565607/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2001,Does he get the girl?,I don t know if he gets the girl or not at the end but contrary to someone else s earlier posting Hanks most certainly at least pursues the opportunity with Lari White character at the end The earlier poster wrote He was at the last looking down a different road the one toward California SPOILER ALERT That is incorrect Hanks stepped out from his jeep into the middle of the intersection He looked forward then to the left and right and finally turned back around and faced up in the direction of his jeep which is the direction toward the woman s ranch His hint of a smile combined with other factors mentioned by other commenters clearly implies that Hanks goes back to pursue this new opportunity When you couple that with the last words of the previous scene where Hanks talks about how his will to live changed with the port a potty shell which washed up on the beach and that life is about seeing what washes up next it becomes clear to me that Lari White becomes Hanks s next opportunity which washes up on the beach As far as I m concerned this is a great ending I can t stand Helen Hunt and the only reason I was able to go see this otherwise outstanding film was the foreknowledge that Hunt occupies very few minutes on the screen,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565608/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2001,Left a bad taste in my mouth,It would have been an ok I would have enjoyed it more had it not been for all that FedEx product placement It was by far the worst I have ever seen It made me so upset I almost left the theatre We shouldn t have to pay for a film with that much advertising Secondly the theatrical trailer showed the whole dang film beginning middle and unfortunately the end And my last bitter comment was the four years later that came up I felt robbed when that came on screen What happened I wanted to see his interaction once he is rescued Oh well guess it s not my movie,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565613/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2001,It's about DIVORCE,A remarkable film truly inspired and amazingly executed This is no teenager movie You have to be wise enough to appreciate life love and loss in short you must have LIVED to understand it Most of the viewing crowd young and old hasn t the wisdom and will not understand even 10 of this movie all they can get out of it is the superficial If you didn t understand The Green Mile in all of it s deliciously complicated splendor you will fail to undertstand Cast Away yes I mean Cast Away not Castaway But for those of you who have gone through the pain of IMMEASURABLE LOSS you WILL understand I said it s about divorce because that is the journey of loss I related to Some of the more obvious symbology that alludes to this thesis are the divorce certificate in the FedEx box his job leads to a divorce the dead pilot s family picture there is no wife in the photo the island represents his despair and loneliness at being cast away by his wife but at the same time the island is a sanctuary which allows him to experience and reveal his true self Further the island lonliness and separation feeds protects and cares for him over time so he can grow strong to meet the challenge of the waves change journey Finally the raft represents the promise of a new life the volleyball the old self the paddles represent letting go and accepting God Fate reality and the whale is the confidence that there is a spirit guide guardian angel watching over us all we have to do is listen The movie is beautifully made and has a beautiful message SURVIVING LOSS Whether that loss is the loss of a loved one because of divorce or through physical death this movie is about surviving the greatests depths of despair and surviving our inner psychological worlds not our physical worlds Those of you who have will know what I mean John,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565631/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2001,Missed Opportunities,DANGER SPOILERS AHEAD It is well known that Tom Hanks took 6 months off to lose the weight needed to make the 4 years later transition One would think during that time somebody could have contemplated a better resolution Anybody Someone wrote here before me the lack of transition between the rescue and the return to the real world was a disappointment I agree There seems to be a hole in the story that is circumvented by 4 weeks later Those 4 weeks could have been alot more intriguing than the 3rd act we re given DANGER SPOILERS AHEAD For instance I wanted to see Hanks being rescued He wakes up to a ship and then he s on a plane 4 weeks later It would have been alot more interesting to explore his view from nothingness to everything during this time There would be press junkets and a book deal somewhere in the making Instead he returns to his job at Fed Ex and we get a tacked on ending to resolve a nowhere relationship It would have been more satisfying for Hanks to return to the Island possibly with the family of the Fed Ex worker he buried Zemeckis was overflowing with ideas for Forrest Gump Here it is like he runs out of gas Be forewarned if you are sensitive to a fidgety audience wait for the video There is about an hour of near silence that can be deafening in a theater I can t dismiss the film as a whole The plane crash is amazing and the central part of Hanks on the Island is the saving grace Very thought provoking What would you do if you just survived an impossible situation only to find that that was the easy part Great premise great acting poor follow thru Too bad somebody didn t step forward and go the final mile 7 out of 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565640/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2001,Catchy Title,I have always loved Tom Hanks movies This is one movie that I was disappointed with There simply was not enough action in the movie to retain my interest and I caught myself dozing off a couple of times during the boring parts I felt this could have been a much better movie if there had been more action taking place while he was stranded on the island and it would have made the movie much more interesting,5.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565667/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2001,Tom Hanks carried this movie!!!,Tom Hanks carried this movie I am not going to give you the run down of the plot or the script lets just say that they re rather poor But the acting on all levels were I thought rather excellent There was about an hour and a half of no background music just Tom hanks acting So it was going it was going to be him that makes or breaks the movie and he succeeded,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565693/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2001,Superb Film - Shameful Ending...SPOILERS AHEAD,Not knowing if I could endure Tom Hanks on a desert island for an hour or so I decided to take the plunge and go see this movie and what a film Right from the start I was intrigued how the film was going to pan out waiting for that all exciting plane crash which I d heard so much about and boy how that didn t dissapoint It was terrifying So much so that I found myself willing it to crash to get it over with but for 10mins we were subjected to a horrifying rollercoaster of a flight with the end result seeming to take a lifetime to come and when it did it wasn t over In the sea with just a liferaft Hanks life was still in danger and when night finally turned into morning I breathed easy again The island was beautiful and this must have some of the best filming sequences I have ever seen in a movie Even though there is only one person on screen for the majority of the film and virtually no music I did not find myself for one minute being bored or losing my concentration it was fabulous but then things started to go wrong The screen went black for no reason and the words Four years later appeared on the screen what Just as we were settling in to see how he would cope we skipped forward four years and had to endure a bravado escape plot which quite frankly should have happened three years earlier Putting that aside though I went with the flow until he was found that is Ok we knew he would have to get back and he did but when he did and Helen Hunt decided not to take him back even without seeing him THAT S WHEN THE FILM SHOULD HAVE ENDED In the lounge of FedEx headquarters NOT half an hour later We had to endure an extra three or four tacky schmultzee scenes which had no place or need in this film and in my opinion turned this film from a superb piece of cinema history to a absolute sham and cop out Thank god though they didn t get back together in a tear jerking reunion Apart from all this though I m awarding this film 8 10 for sheer guts and innovation And no I do not think Tom Hanks deserves an oscar for this,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565696/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2001,Thought Provoking,I don t know what you ve heard but most of the critics are raving while many ordinary folks seem to be rather disappointed I read one review by a member of the public who was moaning about a poor script god only knows what he was expecting when it s a story about a guy stuck for years on his own on an island Anyway to state the obvious and provide some perspective this is not a special effects movie but the scenery is impressive and the cinematography is quite often excellent The script is of course thin but the small amount of character interaction is largely convincing and you can relate to the two main characters To sum up this movie is trying to make you think and sympathise if you just sit and stare at the screen with brain disengaged you will either fall asleep or just get incredibly bored The film wasn t exactly what i had expected but the more i thought about it afterwards the more i realised how good a film it was In terms of making you step back and assess your life this film is almost as good as It s a Wonderful Life it s just a shame that the effect wears off,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565709/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2006,cast away by Dadou and Thomas!,We liked Cast Away because it s an adventure film Chuck Noland succeeded to change his way of life The story is interesting because we saw a man facing his loneliness Tom Hanks perfectly plays the part of the adventurer Some scenes are funny and others are a little disgusting He is so lonely that he speaks to Wilson a volleyball ball We loved the moment when he discovers fire We don t see time passing during the film We advise this film to those who like adventure films Nice Film,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1340996/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2001,nothing more than a boring commercial,Let me start with the positive stuff about this movie The music is like in Forrest Gump absolutely great and always fits to the scenes But that s about it The main bad thing is that this movie had the chance of being good But not one of the things that could have been interesting was brought up At first we have a guy who finds himself on an island But just after he finds out how to survive physically we read 4 years later as a subtitle His whole psychological development is presented with the fact that he talks to a volleyball named I won t take part in the product placement that p me off during the whole movie I mean we got a guy with no one to talk to 4 years with no courts or people judging his actions that s stuff you can make a great movie out of something which also challenges the actor instead of just having him lose 50 pounds Ok we will not see what he did during this 4 years the story carries on He now decides that 4 years are enough and that he wants to go back And then there s another situation that could have been interesting but he also finds back into real life after 4 days or a similar period I have no problem with his decision to go on with his life without his wife but his period of inner struggle is so short in this movie so that you can not appreciate his decission as much as it deserves Besides all this imagine the movie would have had all that stuff Could you the have enjoyed it Not me as long as half of the time I can always read Fed E on the screen This is something so sad as Tom Hanks should have enough money to act in movies with less product placement and a bigger stress on the story I guess I just expected way too much of a director actor couple that once made an awesome movie named Forrest Gump,4.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565773/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2001,"Hey, I really liked it.",I was fairly skeptical that a movie containing a lengthy portion about a guy by himself on an island could hold a viewer s interest But wow it really worked I was fascinated by all the things that Tom Hanks character was doing Also I found myself tempted to talk to the screen to give the guy ideas A couple of people who I talked to after the movie said that only Tom Hanks could have pulled off that role Yeah I think so too Tom Hanks did a great job I think that Tom Hanks might receive a nomination for Best Actor wow once again for his role in this film,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565727/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2001,"Gripping, moving, eye-opening",This film made me understand how art was invented how man discovered the usefullness of tools why man gives such immense mythical sense to the symbols he invents Cast away on a desert island alone in the most absolute meaning of the word no other animate creature accept fish ever comes across Hanks path during his stay on the island jet flying hard working Hanks is reduced to the state of primitive man There is nothing around him which can help him survive His landing on the island is his DAY ZERO However fate first comes to his rescue when he is unsuccessfully trying to break the hard shell of a coconut with a piece of what appears to be volcanic rock The rock splinters but what remains in his hand is a piece of rock which has a sharp edge a knife From then on he can split open his coconuts with ease It seems that coconut and fishes are the only things Hanks eats on the island Hanks seems to be extremely scrupuolous in his profession He only opens the packages which drift into the island with him after a few days not at once In one of them he finds a volleyball for which he cannot figure out any use Sometime later Hanks angrily hits this volleyball with his hand full of blood after he cuts himself while trying to get some fire burning The red hand shaped stain on the ball appears to Hanks as if it were a face and so it becomes his friend and companion on the island Wilson The attachment Hanks develops to this symbol will be very evident later on in the film I believe that there are just good films and bad films nothing else This is a good film Hanks has reached another dimension in his acting and really I doubt whether there is any other actor around nowadays who can so easily adapt himself to such varied roles as being a simpleton in Forrest Gump an astronaut in Apollo 13 and a modern day Robinson Crusoe in this film Marvellous Well what can I say I think this comment is long enough as it is GO SEE THE MOVIE,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565729/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2001,Didn't know if I liked it or not as I walked out,Then as I was driving home and thinking about the movie a little more I realized that this movie unlike any other movie I had ever seen kept me glued to my seat without having a disaster around every corner The two movies to which I got dragged this past year ended up being the two best movies I saw Gladiator was great with Maximus s fall from glory and rise to victory once more and then I went to see Castaway Castaway managed to keep my intention without the tenseness of a movie such as Jaws It was so refreshing to sit back and enjoy a great movie without disaster after disaster Chuck walks through the water on the rocks with blood gushing from his leg no shark attack He stands on the edge of the rock cliff no slip of the toe to send him over He sails out to sea once more on his makeshift raft he s still laying on that raft when he gets rescued Yes a movie can be refreshing exciting and riveting without all those movie disasters we ve all come to expect Two thumbs up to Hanks and Zemeckis for a wonderfully made film I would pay 10 to see it again,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565734/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2001,hope is in the box,I liked the movie Tom had my undivided attention for 145 minutes and I am a critic of the Survivor concept I think the movie is so popular because everyone can relate to the isolation loss confusion and despair that life can offer Tom had to decide what to do at year 3 when he was at the pinnacle and when he saw Helen Hunt after 5 years away He had to find a way to move on even though it was as difficult as living on the island I realize there were many rational questions Why wouldn t he open a box after 4 1 2 years of looking at it How could he survive without a good supply of fresh water How could he make it on a raft even though the island is only 25 miles north of Nada in Fiji They did actually have to stop filming several times to let boats pass I think it is a testament of the human spirit and a great movie,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565752/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2001,could a good movie kill us?,first of all i have to advise that my english writing is not fluent as i would like in the second place i think that loneliness as well as fear of living are concepts not easy to be filmed well nobody says that CAST AWAY is a masterpiece but also i ve seen that nobody made a proper objection in this list i m afraid that there was superficiality of arguments and too much criticism by the people who stuck on things such as the marketing plane of fedex or the actors role in this movie i struggled rather a lot in my life and i still feel completely alone there isn t a family a friend a job a work or a religion that could calm or satisfy me this feeling doesn t leave me a second in life and i think also that doesn t exist a remedy to this never it will be the final ppp of tom hanks could be a plausible answer to who understand what i have affirmed before you can t fight it so why don t you accept it in addition this film got all the faults of hollywood industry s films a budget too big many commercials in it and so on but it gives a strong really strong sensation that never let me quiet during the film feeling of angst this artificial and commercial film can give me the same sensation i had during the worse moments in my life so that i feel worried for two reasons mainly the first is how long establishment could manipulate feeling and emotions and secondly what they would to achieve spectators especially young people are gonna be more and more disillusioned of this kind of stories and that is a pity really i say that is a pity because this side of industry is gonna kill every part of good feeling or mood inside us anyway i appreciated this film more than it was expected 7 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565767/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2001,Blows me Away,i cannot help but agree that the first 2 3 of the movie is particularly moving without much of the usual cliches the plane crash and thereafter is so realistic that i was actually scared like by a horror movie The scenes on the island were without music or effects and it is SO RIGHT to portray it that way I could almost feel Chuck s solitude I actually cried a little when Chuck lost Wilson at sea something i don t usually do these days at the movies Unfortunately the whole part when he went back to Memphis was done all wrong How i wished it was better,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565766/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2001,A better end for a perfect movie!,I went to the movies yesterday evening to build my own point of view about this movie I had already heard 3 or 4 different opinions about it disliking ones and the best movie I ve ever seen ones as well Facing all that I went there and checked it up with my own eyes Zemeckis and Hanks proved once more the amazing acting they can construct together Tom was perfect as usual but with an important plus he was acting perfectly without interacting I believe he had to double his talent if we consider a talent like that can be doubled what I personally doubt about to act without interacting at least with another human being I watched the movie understanding that the main message it wanted to pass was about a man s behavior on the total loneliness fighting for keeping himself alive even though he had no reason to breath It showed me how strong a human being can be and for how long we are probably able to stand being lonely without going crazy The need Chuck reveals creating Mr Wilson proves that a normal human being has to have someone by his side especially in the difficult times and when it is about making an important decision I kept asking myself what would kill me first thirsty hunger or loneliness For thirsty Chuck had coconuts and rain for hunger Chuck had fish and for loneliness Chuck had nothing except himself with a bloody face a teddy bear a children sleeps with replaced by a friendly bloody face volleyball that helped him out as long as he had to keep himself alive on the island Why do children like so much their teddy bears Because they can feel protected and with company when their are lonely in bad at night Wilson was one of the factors to keep Chuck alive such as water and fish Spoiler alert The movie would have been perfect for me if it could have ended up differently I went back home imagining what end I would like this movies to have for it to be perfect but I could not figure what kind of end it would be Did anybody think about anything I just know that it was not the one I ve seen at the movies with Tom Hanks in the middle of the road looking at the truck of a strange woman that happened to be the owner of the package he chose to be the one he had to keep intact while he was lost That end made me so sad I really wanted to see a better end for such an amazing movie But afterwards the movie s end did not jeopardize the majesty of the entire story and the magnitude of Hanks acting I could feel my emotions coming out by watching Chuck s strength Until yesterday I was sure about my wish for Geoffrey Rush winning the Oscar Quills but I have to admit now I believe Tom Hanks deserves the Oscar more than ever Today I have my own opinion about Cast away a very good movie with a perfect performance by Tom Hanks but with an end I still have to create in my own mind to make it one of the bests I have ever seen in my whole life,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565786/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2006,Tom Hanks does it again,As it seems with most of Tom Hanks movies he is reaching for a role that will get him an Oscar or nomination he never takes any roles that don t stand a chance at winning the Oscars though there are some humorous parts in the movie it is nothing that was Oscar worthy The story isn t written that well and tom hanks acting isn t on par with many other actors at this time such as Clive Owen Other than this that the rest of the cast doesn t do nearly as good of a job as selling the role they should be able to Of course it also seems that they tied on a major company such as FedEx which although pays for some of the movie it kind of sells out the story,4.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1356684/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2001,There's not much to eat on one island.,The last time we were treated to the Tom Hanks State of the Union speech was at the 2001 Golden Globe Awards ceremony You knew something was up when he accepted Best Actor without the usual tears streaming or welling up on his face Tom Hanks is getting used to this Hanks is a brilliant actor and luckily for him a movie has been made that stages his abilities yet once again Cast Away is a refreshing adventure movie set in the Pacific where else when it comes to major routes via FedEx Yes there is a plane crash Hanks character Noland survives the crash without injuries and manages to stay afloat in his rubber dinghy until dry lands arrives I am not giving away much considering most of the spoilers are left to the theatrical trailer Director Robert Zemeckis is successful at reminding us in this world of technology and plentiful relationships that we really can be alone on this planet Hanks evolves his character with typical mastery He uses restraint when necessary and builds suspense as we wonder How would I react in a situation like that Hanks answers all of these questions depending on little dialogue while on the island In a cinematic impossibility Zemeckis forms the key element to this film that would have suffered without it a relationship with Wilson a volleyball that washes also ashore The relationship between Hanks and the Volleyball works The film might have been boring with unrealistic conversations talking to oneself serving no purpose except to inform the audience Here Hanks serves up a memorable performance engaging Wilson and continually validates the drama that unfolds on the island At either end of the island adventure exists the real world and Hanks tether to his rat in a maze existence His love interest with Helen Hunt is weak it seems and we are left to wonder how strong their relationship is given the circumstances Zemeckis forms a series of events where Hanks s courier work stands in the way of any serious love interest not the plug FedEx was looking for I m sure Unfortunately there is not a lot of time to evolve any of the other characters and for this reason this film is not robust enough to be an Oscar winner for Best Picture What is effective is the feeling of isolation on the island Zemeckis is artful in his use of sweeping panoramic movements with the camera Few movies have come close in also stranding the audience Finally the scenes back in civilisation pale in comparison to the ordeal on the island I wish Zemeckis had shortenened the ending dramatically for a more powerful transition in plot The final ten minutes were disappointing as Zemeckis attempts an epilogue rather amateurishly The crash of the airplane is breathtaking Hanks deserves another Oscar on his mantle The movie is extremely entertaining despite shortcomings with development of non essential staff The morale of this story should be Make every departure a meaningful one You never know what will happen on your next business trip overseas That swiss army knife is not just decorative either 7 5 10,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565823/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2006,A FedEx Commercial,The movie was very good but I couldn t help but be very bothered by the obvious FedEx commercials with which the entire movie is packed Two scenes were particularly disturbing a in the beginning when Chuck trains the Russian staff on the corporate values of FedEx b well surpassed by the final scene when he delivers the FedEx parcel after all pathetic They must have paid a fortune for the movie and in the credits no FedEx to be seen Thus mark 3 out of 10 Otherwise it would have been a higher mark They could have gone for a fictitious parcel delivery firm and they just about might have made it for an Oscar It s also surprising of Zemeckis to have allowed this I remain quite puzzled A pity thought,3.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1264406/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2001,Good Effort,A brief scan over the premise of this movie brings of concern Can one man really be entertaining for all that time How interesting can four years on an island be However I was pleasently surprised but not overly Tom Hanks manages to keep your attention his subtle but significant characted journey is absorbing The various tasks he must carry out to stay alive are interesting perhaps only academically and not dramtically A sense of humour prods the story along The direction for me is what saves the movie however Instead of the bright colours of a dream like island we see shades pastels Infact the island is rather grim Time is used wonderfully from the fast paced world to the timelessness and lonelyness are expertly portrayed Silence black screens both forgotten devices are used to great effect here Even the four years later although perhaps cliche perhaps a little lazy gives the feeling of nothingness that helps us to feel his isolation Although a little too long perhaps not a master piece this film has a great deal to offer in its details Daring in superfical minimalism and deeply considered beneath the surface this film will be enjoyed by those who like to work hard with their viewing,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565812/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2002,Hanks at his best!,Judging from other comments already posted Cast Away has touched as many people as it has left others mildly indifferent I watched it in the cosiness of my living room on a pretty smart digital wide screen TV and found it riveting It is a bit long and disjointed and the least that could be said is that the transitions between consecutive periods in the movie are too abrupt I guess this can happen when one tries to cover several years in a two and a half hour piece but the lack of smooth transitions destroys the rhythm of the movie So why did I find it riveting First and foremost Tom Hanks makes an outstanding Robinson Crusoe Credible from the first minute to the last he adds to a great acting performance the physical prowess of changing body shapes One minute a chubby over fed executive the next a survivor close to starvation The credibility of his acting brings out one of the main messages of the movie Corporate America and the pseudo comfort it creates but which comfort does Chuck Noland enjoy when travelling from continent to continent in the back of a FedEx aircraft mainly serves the purpose of alienating human beings by destroying their relationship to nature Ok some of you will find this statement far fetched and Chuck Noland certainly did not crash his plane to enjoy a return to nature However I took the contrast between a life in the fast lane and the painstakingly slow pace of survival as a reminder that we should not rely on appearances too much it doesn t always matter if things happen a few minutes too late Beyond the thought provoking aspects of the movie I enjoyed some superb photography and scenery as well as a good plane crash scene What I wasn t impressed with too many FedEx signs around but then this is corporate America and Hollywood,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566091/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2001,All that you can't leave behind,I saw Tom Hanks sell me this movie for the second time this previous saturday evening When you watch a man cast away every major component of his life one by one clothes body fat human contact comfort the pressure of time a portion of sanity and then see whats left behind The first act plane crash is phenomenal You will NEVER take your shoes off in an airplane again or be without a Leatherman tool When Chuck first lands on the island i was made to feel like the island itself is a creature a being a thing that imprisons it KEEPS you On the horizon you COULD be free but you CAN T GET there And you watch Chuck Chuck is REAL And so are His frustrations his pain his discomfort his joy in triumph When he makes fire I shouted with him I too find myself wanting to get back to Kelly to hear a human voice to be warm at night to not be thirsty anymore Chuck s numerous transformations make me feel like i went through them with him During the second act after four years has passed it felt like chuck had crawled into a cave and what was left was all that he couldn t leave behind or throw away Just surviving Staying alive Then one day the tide brings in his way off In this film you will watch a man CHANGE Tom Hanks makes me believe in a character like never before in a film I BELIEVE him I BELIEVE he has thrown overboard every thing that was of no use to him in order to survive in order to LIVE WhatEVER it takes to live was what i thought about as i left the theater and to ENJOY your life and enjoy every LITTLE thing Ice Sheets A cup of HOT coffee Human touch MUSIC What if i couldn t listen to music for 4 years A kiss from a woman again 4 years Savoring every last good thing in my life In the word s of U2 this film challenged me to in my own life throw overboard the worthless junk that will hinder me and keep all that i can t leave behind and enjoy Go see it wait And then see it again By the way and this is seen in the previews When Chuck says at the beginning of the film We live or we die by The Clock he has a pager with a clock a digital watch clocks in the warehouse etc and at the end notice he wears no watch,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565858/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2006,What about a sequel?,Am I the only one who thinks this film is absolutely primed for a SEQUEL The end was left wide open to move in several directions What I d like to see in the opening sequence is Helen Hunt s husband watching them through the bedroom window as they were re uniting in the rain and from that point are some perfectly delicious possibilities I wonder if Zemekis and Hanks have even talked about it Helen and Tom realize they can t do without Tom can t establish a relationship with the woman in the pickup truck Helen can t go on with her current husband and so on When this movie concluded I was left with a watering mouth for more JCS,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1398239/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2023,The script is an overlooked gem,Everyone knows about Tom Hanks Zemeckis s string of huge successes Wilson the Volleyball the beautiful scenery etc But what stands out to me about Cast Away after 20 years is William Broyles s script You re thinking wait there s almost no words for much of the film Right but when you dig into the script and pay attention to it and to the plot what you find is a surprisingly profound examination of the concept of time in modern vs Pre modern society You can view the whole movie as a man s transformation through great pain into a life that is a rejection of the every second matters mania that drives global businesses while also making time spent with loved ones even friends fleeting and fragmented Broyles gave us a big clue with his title for the script Cast Away Where did that title come from Why isn t it Castaway the normal spelling for someone stranded on an island I pondered over this for years and finally realized that it s from the famous passage from Ecclesiastes 3 in the Judeo Christian scriptures i e For everything there is a season or Turn Turn Turn by The Byrds same thing Verse 6 A time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away And there you have it Cast Away is at its core a meditation on time Those who find the film boring completely miss the point,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8899018/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2001,movie was great! tom hanks was great as usual.,The movie was great and enjoyable Tom Hanks did a great job as usual Just didnt like the ending didnt really follow through from some stuff that started at beginning and ending sort of left you up in the air Could be a sequel,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565946/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2001,"Wonderful movie, terrible ending",This is a great film but falls flat in the ending The first problem I have with any movie with Tim Hanks in it anymore is that I cannot forget that it is Tom Hanks I am watching Fortunately Tom Hanks is such a good actor that I find myself watching him as if he were actually in the situation the movie puts him in So in Saving Private Ryan for me its more like watching Tom Hanks actually being in WWII having to lead a squad of men to save a Pvt Ryan And in this movie it was like watching what happens to Tom Hanks when he is stranded on an island in the middle of the Pacific ocean Anyhow his acting is superb here which is fortunate since a huge middle portion is almost exclusively of him on the island How he deals with existing on the island was fascinating to watch And the device of having him befriend a volleyball was a great idea The depiction of the plane crash was one of the best I ve seen of that kind of catastrophe I was very impressed with the way the events in the interior of the plane were shown It made me feel like that is what it truly would be like if that happened The ending unfortunately nearly ruins the movie for me Spoiler warning When Chuck finally escapes and returns home he finds his former fiance is now married with children Quite believable so far so good She initially can t deal with even meeting him which is also understandable given how much her world has just been turned upside down with his return In fact the movie does well in the ending up to and during his visit to her house at night You remain on edge somewhat because they are uncomfortable and awkward with each other They wind up in her garage where she gives him the keys to the Jeep they had when they were previously together He pulls out of the driveway begins to leave and at that point the movie blows it big time She rushes out into the rain calling after him and he somehow hears her backs up and they embrace and kiss etc Yes their love never died but circumstances force them apart This struck me as so Hollywood so pandering to the audience as to be almost sickening A far better and more likely outcome would be that they never get over the awkward uncomfortable feeling between each other and he drives off with both of them silently accepting what they have been dealt The film could have even shown each character her in the garage him driving away in the Jeep break down in tears But it ruins it that they connect The situation is a tragedy and should be shown as tragic The audience can tell well enough if they still have feelings for one another I can t say how the movie should have concluded but the last scenes with him at a crossroads in Texas wondering where to go next weren t convincing either The ending definitely needs a lot of rethinking End of spoilers Overall I am glad I saw this movie and would recommend it Just be aware that it breaks down in the end But everything prior to that still makes it worth seeing 7 10,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565954/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2020,Hello Anybody,I saw this movie today again and I feel this is a fresh movie When Chuck Noland says Hello anybody at that time I was really weird more than him I think castaway is not only a servable movie If anybody says this is an only servable movie that would be an insult for this movie In this movie human physical and emotional express batter way in this movie Tom Hanks is a workaholic and he loves his work very much Castaway directed by Robert Zemeckis is a 2001 film starring Tom Hanks Hanks stars as Chuck Noland during the family Christmas dinner Chuck is summoned to resolve a work problem in Malaysia FedEx delivery man whose life is headed in the right direction at a time his plane crashes and he is stranded on an island He must adapt to his new life on the island to survive to overcome many obstacles Castaway explores three different journeys physical and imaginative The physical journey in Castaway is Chuck s struggle to survive the entire movie His determination and faith serve to call optimism within the responder and it gives them hope that Chuck will continue to survive until he gets off the island The impact time has on his life is also evident when he is admonishing FedEx employees He states We live or we die by the clock Never allow ourselves to commit the sin of losing track of time He says the same thing to the volleyball Wilson when he is planning their escape off the island The context of when he says it changes the meaning of this recovery The first time it is said he is passionately trying to get workers to be more efficient and the recovery is a color The second time Chuck makes this remark death is a serious option Although the timing of his escape is important to him time is not what is driving him anymore instead of his desire to get back to Kelly The volleyball Wilson becomes Chuck s only companion on the island Wilson is Chuck s need for companionship personified Hanks proves here again what an effective actor he is never straining for an effect I liked every scene on the island and wanted more of them Castaway is one of those classic movies that everyone must see The plot is uncommon and it was very interesting I say that every element of the film was perfect The acting is very good although there are only two real sources of acting in this film Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt There is also a good deal of comedy in the film and it is done very well This is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch Although if you are not a fan of Tom Hanks then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island So I hope you watch the film I love this film I hope that you enjoy it I give it 10,10.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6102171/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,What was that spray?,I liked the movie It was thoughtful and adventurous It was done in a real time basis that many people can relate to these days how we get caught up in things like work time management etc Question for movie buffs what was spraying Chuck while he was on the wood raft The first time it happened was at night when he saw the whale It happens twice more during the day once when Wilson disappears and once when the ship passes But it doesn t show what s causing it Is it just normal ocean spray or is the whale back Was the whale helping Chuck if it was the whale I think they should ve revealed that fact more it could ve been a cool touch,9.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1493471/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2001,"Terrific, very deep.",Now I m not picking on anyone but for those who thought that this movie was shallow obviously didn t understand it From begginning to end this movie was almost perfect Every part of it held a metaphorical meaning to it I loved it Tom Hanks plays a Fed Ex employee who falls victim to a plane crash and is stranded on a nearby island He is the only survivor and if forced to create a second home on this small island Because the plane was a Fed Ex one many packages are washed up to shore about 15 He opens them and uses each to his advantage In the midst of all this panic he finds the time to befriend a volley ball he calls Wilson This ball doubles as his alter ego and is the only thing keeping him from going insane I never liked Tom Hanks as an actor until this movie I thought he did a superb job in this role and that was one of the best parts SPOILER His girlfriend getting married was a given because you can t expect her to stay alone hoping for his return And although he is sad of this it is implied at the end that he will make a new life with this kind hearted country women who Saved his life END OF SPOILER I really thought that this movie had everything it could have No more no less,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565980/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2001,"Overall I enjoyed it, but.. *Possible Spoiler*",Possible Spoiler if you don t know the basic plot line from the ads This movie was amazing in many ways with the dramatic Tom Hanks weight loss being an obvious stand out The scenes on the island were awesome and the behind the scenes footage on the DVD was interesting especially the negotiations with the native Fijian inhabitants I had heard that there was minimal dialogue and soundtrack throughout much of the movie which I thought worked very well with Tom Hanks remaining on my list of actors with under rated ability The bad The movie dragged too long in the post island scenes for my taste and I didn t feel like we got enough back in the final scene after going through the uncomfortable reunion with his girlfriend Also I listened to the commentary track in a few instances hoping for insight into why they wrote scenes the way they did and was disappointed with repetitive discussion of camera angles and techniques instead My opinion but I don t like how it could be seen that Tom is ready to drive away with her at the end and then appears sullen that she needs to go back to her life Worth watching but I don t know about repeated viewing,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0565990/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2006,Excellent film about acceptance and loss,Great film with great performances The setup and delivery of his relationship and the effect his plane crash has on him and his friends life s is well done and how the island is viewed by Noland is very well handled as it comes across that he hates the island for trapping him there but grateful that it s the thing allowing him to stay alive His escape to sea on his raft and as he looks back on the island the films score marries with he imagery perfectly and of course Wilson an Oscar worthy performance from a prop and luckily the producers didn t go with initial idea of casting Paul Walker in the role of Wilson they even had a large costume of a volleyball made up,10.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1524853/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2001,It Took Guts !!!,Tom Hanks did a splendid job in this film It took guts to do all that was required from the start to the finish from gaining all that weight and then letting it fall off as the film progressed to being basically the sole character having the entire film rest upon his shoulders from his performance That had to be quite a burden But He pulled it off and did a gutsy job and it was quite an experience to go through it all with him After all WE WERE WITH HIM ON THAT ISLAND We learned lessons right along with him and his character s dedication to his job held him together and gave him something to hold onto after all he DID deliver that package that he held onto for all those years Now THAT S dedication I loved the film watched it 3 times and I d watch it again,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566032/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2001,What's the point?,Originally I passed on this film fearing the 2 1 2 hr length Now that I have seen it my main question is What was the point the director was trying to make Philosophical regarding Hank s concept of time SPOILER as a FedEx manager he fights it as a castaway he endures it as a returning survivor he must accept it s passing Survival skills In that case not enough was shown Romance Hank s relationship w Hunt was shown very briefly in the beginning The ending ran the risk of making too much of them and personally I did not really care Also C MON SPOILER An unopened package for 4 years Who bankrolled this flick FedEx Plus maybe I missed something but what was the point of SPOILER the package delivered in Russia I wish the director had decided what direction he wanted this film to go in and stuck to it,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0566078/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2023,Castaway: stuck on an island an stuck in time,Tom Hanks portrays Chuck a Fedex businessman with a hectic schedule and lofty ambitions Although it is a really emotive film it moves more slowly than a sloth on steroids Chuck Nolan is in Moscow trying to quickly spread Fedex s magic as a harried businessman with a full schedule After an incredible plane accident compared to the rest of the film he joins a flight home He is imprisoned on an island The pace of the film is incredibly slow with one scene taking two minutes when ten seconds would have sufficed to achieve the same effect This film could have reached the top 5 with a different director bye bye Robert Zemeckis The FedEx logo was seen in almost every shot throughout the 2 hours and 23 minutes of the FedEx advertisement A Many of the scenes consist solely of Chuck s locket or a random FedEx parcel with an upset Chuck There is no drama just one big issue being stranded on an island The movie becomes even more agonisingly slow as a result What occurs after that according to the ambiguous ending As there is no tension it is hardly a cliffhanger rather it is more like the movie ran out of money before it could finish He is alone and gradually becoming insane which is one of the film s most compelling emotional elements Everyone is moved when he befriends a volleyball named Wilson this is perhaps the only reason I would see it again The only real improvements to the film come from Wilson and the plane accident JusticeForWilson Overall this film should be condemned to remain in the 2000s if my children wanted to watch it I would disown them The survival action genre has been ruined by this film which makes Bear Grylls look like a girl scout Go ahead and watch it if you want but be prepared for your popcorn to vanish before the action begins My suggestion Burn everything keep the next generation from it,1.0,0.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9071912/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2007,Movie Review,This movie is about a man who gets stranded on a deserted island This character is named Chuck played by Tom Hanks Chuck works at FedEx flying from country to country making sure that packages get to their destination in the shortest amount of time possible A couple of days before Christmas he was forced to go on a business trip As everyone knows that it is always when things are going well that they are bound to go wrong sooner rather than later Right before he boards the plane he proposes to his girlfriend Kelly who is played by Helen Hunt It is on that flight that things go bad The plane gets trapped in a storm and the pilots are not able to communicate to others through the radio Somehow after the plane crashing into the ocean Chuck miraculously survives Unfortunately the pilots were not as lucky Eventually while floating on the plane s emergency raft Chuck wakes up to realize that he is on a deserted island in complete loneliness He then makes a very strong effort to stay alive using every survival skill known to him He gathers all of the FedEx packages that are washed up onto the beach At first he plans to keep all of them closed until somebody showed up Later in the movie he realizes that he might never be found So he opens up all of the packages except for one and in one of those packages was his new friend Wilson brand volleyball that he named Wilson This movie does an excellent job with the picture and sound The writers and editors do a great job in making this movie interesting since it is all about one man stuck on an island Tom Hanks does a tremendous job playing the role of Chuck It is especially challenging to play this part since there is barely any dialogue Because of this the writers and editors has to emphasize other aspects For example the sound of nature took the biggest role in this movie There was not one second where you could not hear the sound of the waves crashing into the sand In this movie Chuck grew as a person and fought for his life every single day What kept him motivated was his fianc e Kelly One of the most brilliant aspects of this movie was Wilson The volleyball that kept him company kept him motivated and eventually became his best friend Apart from adding more to that story Wilson also helped bring in more dialogue into the movie In the end of the movie there is an interesting romantic twist that you would have never imagined This is all explains why this movie is one of the best movies ever made,10.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1767168/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2012,Deepest film ever from a Taoist perspective (SPOILERS),It is all all about shedding the ego Chuck has a HUGE ego Not in the sense that he is a jerk or selfish but in the Buddhist way definition of ego he think he can control everything ego and lives totally in time ego and puts his job first because it creates a sense of order ego and so on He puts more stock in giving Kelly a ring at the car than staying behind to be with her for the holidays because to the Ego a ring is more important than the relationship Ego loves symbols and form more than what is behind them However the universe endlessly tests his ego by showing him that he is actually powerless Which he cannot accept First he is in Russia and he gets the clock that he sent himself and it took many days to get there and shows him he is out of control But he makes that everyone else s problem and even steals a kids bicycle to speed up the package delivery he is willing to do anything to regain control rather than accept any powerlessness Then his friends wife is dying and he again can t accept his own powerlessness and suggests a doctor to fix this thing Which of course he can t It s death Since Kelly knows what he loves best she gives him a watch because time is the only thing he finds valuable ego And then the plane goes down On the island he is endlessly shown how powerless he is and again wont accept it He cant make fire he cant eat his tooth is decayed But he wont accept it he keeps trying to overcome it with reason He still is collecting packages Finally he cant even kill himself correctly At this point is his first glimpse at a higher self because later when he tells the story to his friend he say that when he realized that he couldn t even kill himself a warm feeling came over him and stayed with him This is his first moment of enlightenment a forced realization that he is totally powerless and thus a moment of forced alignment with something higher Then it takes four more years of ego battering before he has let go of ego enough internally to be able to just float where the winds take you as Lao tze says literally as a sail comes in But when he gets home his dormant ego flares up again as it tries to control the uncontrollable he still hasn t totally learned So he tries to get Kelly back instead of accepting the situation thus he is still on the island in his head which is a metaphor for separateness No man is an island The island IS Ego itself in the third act every time his ego flares up and he is trying to control things again there is a clock in the background he is still stuck in time Again his ego is pummeled and he must accept his own powerlessness And then finally BOOM it really all comes at once he lets go He accepts his own total powerlessness totally and gets in a car and gets to a crossroads having no idea for once in his life where he is going At which point his angel arrives His angel tests him one last time She tells him that to the right is Flagstaff but back the way she is going is a whole lot of nothing In the end he looks back toward nothingness the direction she is going and we know he is going to choose the road to nothingness instead of the known destination of Flagstaff because he has released his ego accepted powerlessness He is now capable of drifting powerlessly toward nothingness which is really not nothing at all it is an alignment with the Universe Especially so because the cute girl with the wings lives in that direction and they may fall in love One last great thing here When he went to her ranch to leave the package She has removed the Name Dick from Dick and Bettina and this now it only says Bettina From a symbolic perspective the Dick male organ ego has been removed which represent man and power and only the feminine power is left the return of the feminine power is associated in Joseph Campbell as mans realignment with God Bettina which in Hebrew means God s Promise And finally he stand on a cross crossroads resurrected Wow Moral of the story To shed the ego totally accept your powerlessness You will be tested again and again till you genuinely do this When the ego is shed then the true self the one aligned with the Universe and God Can emerge and take you where you need to go as you are now part of the whole,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2668228/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2005,Movie stinks,I felt like I cast away my money on the ticket Very little happened on the Island Tom Hanks was probably more interested in getting to his next feature film instead of doing a quality job of acting in this film This is a problem with top tier actors Too many films to star in and not enough time to spend doing a quality job in all of them The producer thinks that having Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in a film is going to get people into the theater no matter what quality film is produced The funny thing is that both actors are A list actors This film lacks originality creativity and is boring This is more of a drama than an action film Tom Hanks is great in Saving Private Ryan and Forest Gump If you read this review try checking those out,1.0,1.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1118676/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2005,Castaway merits a closer look...,Like a Shakespearean play the different layers of the story cannot be taken in from a one time viewing of Castaway I was looking for a specific film example of some of the Hero Quest plot points from Joseph Voggler and picked up this movie for a second viewing I ended up watching it again with my five year old son When Wilson floated away my son began to cry Then I began to cry Damn my kid got it and I had missed it My son understood how real an imaginary friend is because he was still a child Hanks has a rebirth on the island and is stripped down to an infantile state He becomes a child once again His entire re evolution is fascinating I have watched it at least 8 times since and pick up little pieces that I had not caught before Like a Shakespearean play there are layers to this one Just because the film isn t obvious does not make it slow It s amazing what we expect from movies I expect a story This is a story of becoming a human being and learning to live a genuine life I love it and still tear up Give it a second viewing Look at the symbolism gestures and expressed emotions Pay attention to the details like the birthday card Almost a perfect story Some people simply won t get it I think even the main character Nolan at the beginning of the film would be too deadened to understand it It is only through his tragedy that he becomes a true observer of the gift that life is That might even be one of the layers Bravo,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1046776/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2016,Very well done,Possible Spoilers Castaway is a movie about loneliness discovery and figuring out what is truly important in life A FedEx employee that works too much ends up having life changing experience when his plane goes down on business trip The main character of this film is Chuck Noland Tom Hanks and he spends most of the movie by himself on a deserted island Because he worked all the time he didn t get to spend much time with the women he loved Kelly Helen Hunt This ends up being one of the main driving forces for Chuck while he is fighting for his survival Chuck has to dig deep from within and conjure up every survival instinct he can think of to stay alive Being stranded alone on island can show you what you re really made of albeit he got lucky he was traveling with FedEx packages that washed up with him After spending years on this island the number one driving force for Chuck was his love Kelly He wanted to get back to her so badly and that s what kept him fighting The sounds in this movie are so wonderful They make you feel like you are in the mist of whatever is on the screen You really get the sense once the plane starts to go down While Chuck is on the inflatable raft you almost feel you are right there with him getting hammered by waves and the raging storm When he gets washed up on the island you get the feeling of emptiness All you hear are the sounds of the sand beneath his feet and the waves crashing in on the shore When he yells and you can hear the hollow of the lonely island you really get the sense of sheer aloneness They way this movie is cut together works perfectly The scenes move seamlessly from one to the next Even when there are time jump scenes the editing team does a great job making it work My favorite editing decision made was that of the rescue scene I won t give it away but you ll know it when you see it Overall I think this film was very well done They did a great job telling their story while keeping things interesting I believe the story they were trying to tell was that you have to dig deep and fight for the ones you love Just like in Cinderella Man even when he thinks he can t do it anymore he thinks of his family and it gives him the necessary drive to keep going This is similar to the determination that Chuck gets when he thinks of Kelly Even though this movie takes place primarily with one actor I think the team that worked on this did a great job and in my opinion it was very well done,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3460406/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2016,Cast Away review,Cast Away The critically acclaimed movie Cast Away is a test to one man s psychological and physical will to live It stars Academy Award winner Tom Hanks and that is about it Oh and his buddy Wilson a volleyball Robert Zemeckis is the director who was also the lead man in Forest Gump Hanks and Zemeckis really work well together in this survival flick Cast Away accurately describes man s will to survive even when times become desperate Tom Hanks plays and average man named Chuck Noland who is a supervisor for the corporate shipping business FedEx His girlfriend is Kelly Frears played by Helen Hunt The filmed is based in 1995 where Chuck and Kelly live in Memphis The beginning of the film has him struggling with the daily duties of his FedEx job where is placed in Russia among other places He seems to be a normal man in which he is slightly overweight and has a terrible tooth problem Chuck wishes to marry the love of his life Kelly but business absence has halted the proposal One Christmas day 1995 Chuck gets an unexpected business call in which he has to travel on a plane again Chuck and Kelly exchange gifts in their car before he boards the trip Kelly gives Chuck a compass with a picture of her inside of it This plays an important role later in the plot Like the title of the film implies the plane has some technical difficulties and ends up crashing into the Pacific A water raft ends up saving his life and to his amazement he suffers little injuries Isolated In the middle of the Pacific Chuck floats to the nearest island he stumbles upon His survival skills are immediately tested He has to learn how to hunt how to make fire and how to stay sane Chuck uses some of the FedEx deliveries to help him cope and survive Some of those things are video tapes ice skates a dress a mysterious unopened box and his famous companion a volleyball with a face named Wilson Moreover the island is a tropical one with sand layering the outside And tropical trees and some animals fill the deserted island There is small mountains with rocks and trees covering them Other than some lizards and bugs the island is largely uninhabited as far as we can see Chuck continues to improve on his survival skills while constantly thinking of Kelly and the people at home He talks to a volleyball with a face to give him company He eventually learns how to start a fire Tom Hanks does a great job of showing the frustration his character displays after failing many times He also learns how to hunt and fish on the little island which also takes time In the middle of the movie Chuck appears on the screen with a large beard and long hair We learn that the movie fast forwarded 4 years without any of us seeing what happened in that time While I won t spoil anything Chuck attempts to take his life out to the unpredictable sea desperate to see the world again Of course the rest of the movie will be up to you to see For me Cast Away is a great film to see about resilience will power perseverance you name it But any movie could show those traits How good does Cast Away do though I think it does pretty well It shows how desperate Chuck was when he was starting the fire and how hard it was to take his life venturing out to the sea He even talks to a volleyball in which he pretends the volleyball says stuff back to him But the perseverance the film attempts to show is when he was so lonely for so long The writers make some of the scenes uninspiring like when was hunting and fishing but also very unique when Chuck was talking to Wilson A lot of the movie could be viewed as boring but it is definitely not uneventful Everything that happens in the film means something in the climax and ending The beginning is meh I think it accurately portrays the struggles of his job but how it is nothing compared to what will happen later The initial landing on the island is very interesting I was quite curious as to what an average Joe would do in those desperate measures Tom Hanks is especially well in this role Hanks shows the curiosity and panic of someone with those unlucky circumstances He masters the role of being by himself virtually the whole plot That role would make or break the film and Tom Hanks definitely made it It was an Oscar worthy performance by Hanks There were not a lot of negatives in Cast Away I think the story would not even be as close to as good as it was if it were not for the great performance of Tom Hanks The dialogue between Wilson and Chuck would have been pushed if it was anybody but Hanks He drove the movie forward in bleak scenes and took control over the movie The writers did a fine job of showing the perseverance and willpower it took to try to survive on the island The movie was dependent on Hanks performance and he killed it While the film is Tom Hanks dependent Cast Away is a unique journey through the eyes of a desperate man s will to survive That is why I give it an 8 10,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3564338/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2016,Cast Away plot and theme,Cast Away was released in 2000 Some are the main characters are Chuck Noland Tom Hanks Kelly Frears Helen Hunt and Ramon Paul Sanchez This film mainly revolves around the main character Chuck who gets stranded on an island after his plane crashes into the ocean This film shows how he tries to survive on this island and try to get himself rescued The film shows how hard it can truly be to try to survive and the emotional toll it would have one someone Of course you have to watch the film to figure out whether Chuck survives this situation or not The theme of Cast Away is pretty straight forward It is one that shows human survival when we are forced to try and survive or die This theme focuses on the idea of the struggle for human dignity Chuck is put in a position of disadvantage and dealt a bad hand when he gets stranded on the island He is fighting against tremendous odds for his survival There are also several other films that have a similar theme to Cast Away s theme 127 Hours is one film that has a similar theme to Cast Away s theme The main character gets dealt a bad hand when getting stuck in the canyons with his arm crushed and stuck His is at a disadvantage and fighting against tremendous odds for his survival just like Chuck was in Cast Away There are a couple of film techniques that have relevance to the film s theme One technique is lighting There is a darker lighting during most of the movie which helps show the significance of the theme If the lighting was bright during the whole film then it would be harder to portray the significance of this theme Sunny and bright usually means happiness You wouldn t want the audience to feel OK and happy during the movie you want them to feel sad nervous anxiety fearful at times This way the audience can have a feeling of being there and have a sense of reality of what is going on in the film and about the theme The second technique is camera angle The camera angles changes from the viewer seeing Chuck and his surroundings to seeing what Chuck is seeing like they are looking through his eyes Interchanging between these camera angles really gets the audience in tune with Chuck and what he is possibly feeling Getting the audience involved like this really helps get the theme of this movie across to the viewers This makes the theme very straight forward A theme of survival against all odds is a great theme that most audience members enjoy and it works great for Cast Away,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3595012/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2017,"Music and Sounds effect our emotions - Review includes a ""spoiler""",Review includes a spoiler The filmmakers of the film Cast Away illustrated a plethora of different sound effects throughout the film Some examples of these sound effects are the noises of the waves the rain the thunders the wind the horns of the ships the crackling of the wood the coconut droppings even the removal of other sounds you would expect to hear on an island music and much more The film Cast Away is about loneliness relationships and hope sound effects are used to demonstrate these effects In the film Cast Away Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland is FedEx executive that is very punctual and almost neurotic about time This behavior is displayed at the beginning of the movie while he is Russia He returns to his girlfriend Helen Hunt as Kelly Frears in Memphis Tennessee He shows up at her place of employment and greets her in the copier room glad to see each other they hug and kiss She says You are home I love that you are home and they begin to dance Chuck and Kelly then attend a Christmas dinner party that is cut short Kelly gives Chuck a family heirloom pocket watch with his favorite picture of her in it as a gift for Christmas Before he leaves he gives her an engagement ring she says I m scared He walks away saying I ll be right back These scenes are used to illustrate to the viewers how much Kelly and Chuck love each other and how much Chuck has to lose He has successful career girlfriend friends and family While flying over the Pacific Ocean the plane goes through a thunderstorm and crashes into the sea Chuck the lone survivor was saved by an inflatable raft He drifted away from the flames of the crash into the dark sea MUSIC He wakes in the morning to find himself alone and on a deserted island While on the island Chuck uses his primal instincts to survive He had to find shelter food water and even companionship The companion was a volleyball he called Wilson but it was a companion The lack of music background noise helped to reinforce seclusion of the island Chuck was stranded on There are several times in the film that off screen or invisible sounds were used and effectively employed to enlarge the boundaries of the visual frame or to create the mood and atmosphere One example of off screen or invisible sound was during the coconut dropping scenes It wasn t until something fell out of the tree right in front of him that realizes it was coconut The sad truth was he is alone and had just been hearing coconuts fall I believe these sounds along with the others helped in aiding the authenticity of the island environment and the feelings of loneliness and fear felt by Chuck I believe without the sound effects throughout the movie it would have been significantly different The pocket watch gave Chuck hope while he was there for four years Like we stated earlier he is very neurotic about time Chuck used hash marks on the wall to track time which ultimately saved him from the island Yes he was faced with and had to overcome demands of physical and emotional strength but without know the time and when the waves would change he would have never been able to get through the tides After his escape from the island Chuck is floating in the Ocean and experiences another thunderstorm when he wakes up he discovers he has lost his companion Wilson The somber music that played will bring tears your eyes Chuck has lost everything that was something to him from the last four years Once Chuck returned home he discovered the Kelly had moved on and was married ironically to his oral surgeon and she had a child with him After a dramatic re connection and what seems to be a start to rekindling their romance Chuck realizes he has lost her all over again once again it is raining and storming You hear what seems to be the same somber music that was being played when he lost Wilson If I were Chuck I would steer clear from all storms he seems to lose everything during them During a monologue scene Chuck explains to his friend Nick Searcy as Stan I ve got to keep breathing Because tomorrow the sun will rise Who knows what the tide could bring Again the lack of sound in this scene connected you to the emotions being felt by Chuck While on the island there was one only package he had not opened it had angel wings drawn on it In the closing scene of the film Chuck delivers on a sunny bright day this package in Texas The package is being returned to the sender he knocks on the door and no one answers so walks around sees a sculpture of the same angel wings in the yard No one is home so Chuck props it on the screen and leaves a note which reads This package saved my life Chuck leaves and stops at a crossroad to look at a map and a friendly pretty lady about his age stops and says You look lost She gets out of her car and she explains to him where all the roads and intersections lead he thanks her and then she drives away Chuck notices the same angel wings are painted on the back of her truck He looks down at his map and then walks to the center of the crossroads and uplifting music begins to play as the camera focuses on his face and he smiles Music and lack of music play an important part of this film and is used appropriately The music changes and puts you in the emotions of the Chuck and reinforces the loneliness and hope throughout the movie This is by far one of my all time favorites,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3696203/?ref_=tt_urv
