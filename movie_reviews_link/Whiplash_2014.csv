2 March 2018,Whiplash is a modern day masterpiece.,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4078668/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2015,This is review #572....so is there really any need to say more?!,Whiplash is a terrific film no doubt about that Normally I d spend several paragraphs talking about how great it is except that I am the 572nd review and many people have already gone on and on about what a terrific film it is so what can I add It s the 40th highest rated film on IMDb after all J K Simmons clearly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor because although he was no the star of the film he dominated every moment he was on the screen Was he a likable guy No way but he was mesmerizing Kudos also for the young actor in the lead and everyone else with this film It s among the best films of the year and one that impressed me so much because it did not have a complicated script of mega million dollar special effects it just had terrific acting writing and direction See this film and see how a quality film is crafted Nuff said,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3279715/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2014,An important hardened lesson in resilience and when to stop measuring up to your mentor. Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.,Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd pleasing intensity On the surface it s a gritty story about a brutal student mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries Underneath it s a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing As a result it s the best film I ve seen in years and I say that without hesitation This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts If writer director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist then he has achieved it Miles Teller who s been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now stars as Andrew Neyman a 19 year old aspiring jazz drummer who s pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher played by the ferocious J K Simmons like we ve never seen him before Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker They re urgently looking for the next Parker in search of perfection But with that comes a great irony The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters Even so Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself you get a feel for what he s looking for and when someone s wrong even if you don t know why Simmons is as good as they say he is He s a force of nature with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White But it s not a one note performance Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness insecurity approachability and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he s known for in other roles with Jason Reitman exec producer here Even though he s an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say he s still somewhat endearing and enigmatic much like R Lee Ermey s drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it s a crime or an ends justifying the means factor of life It s not just a music film but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we re not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew s psyche than legitimate coaching techniques What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing What is objectively great in art When is it good enough and why It toes a fascinating line That s why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it s so instinctive Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat Teller s performance as Andrew is terrific one to match Simmons Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived It s the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew s head however It s a long road to the top but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals It does appear to be very anti positive reinforcement but perhaps it s merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring Whiplash is refreshing to see we all know we wouldn t be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it s cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he ll go His frustration regrets fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he s pushed further and further The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography It s thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements There s a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere but it s so rich in emotion psychological tension and personal subtext It neither rushes nor drags on paper nor on screen It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days nagging you like Fletcher over your shoulder Maybe it ll continue to linger for weeks I hope so too especially for Oscar voters It seems that J K Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point However Whiplash isn t just a best of year film nor best of decade It approaches best of all time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics fulfilling aspirations resilience of the soul and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor I ll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator 10 10 Best film of the decade Read more The Awards Circuit http www awardscircuit

26 October 2014,Just My Tempo,Greetings again from the darkness The pursuit of greatness is not always pretty No matter if your dream is athletics dancing music or some other you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine You will likely have a mentor teacher or coach whose job is to cultivate your skills while pushing you to new limits This film questions whether the best approach is intimidation or society s current preferred method of nurturing Miles Teller plays Andrew a first year student at an elite Manhattan music conservatory Andrew dreams of being a great jazz drummer in the vein of Buddy Rich When offered a rare shot at the top ensemble Andrew quickly discovers the conductor is a breed unlike anything he has ever encountered The best movie comparison I can offer for JK Simmons portrayal of Terence Fletcher is R Lee Ermey s Drill Instructor in Full Metal Jacket This is no Mr Holland s Opus Fletcher bullies intimidates humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians and especially young Andrew to reach for greater heights Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie with Fletcher s mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller albeit with tremendous music We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life and even take on some of Fletcher s less desirable traits Andrew s diner break up with his girlfriend Melissa Benoist is much shorter but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network At a small dinner party Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad Paul Reiser and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends Writer Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate The open ended approach is brilliant though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides What price greatness Is comeuppance a reward Are mentors cruel to be kind For the past few years I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller The Spectacular Now is the next John Cusack Perhaps that bar is too low Teller just gets better with each film His relentless energy draws us in and we find ourselves in his corner even though this time he s not the greatest guy himself Still as strong as Teller is the film is owned by JK Simmons Most think of him as the dad in Juno or the ever present insurance spokesman on TV but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in Oz Even that doesn t prepare us for Simmons powerhouse performance just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians You should see this one for Simmons performance Or see it for the up and coming Teller Enjoy the terrific music especially Duke Ellington s Caravan See it for the talking points about teachers society and personal greatness See it for any or all these reasons just don t tell director Damien Chazelle good job,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3111845/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2014,Intense,This movie was far better than the trailer made it look JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend From the moment he appears he demands the screen literately There s a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going and makes it all about what he wants which sets the tone for the entire movie One of the best antagonist I ve seen at the movies Miles Teller plays the protagonist A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that I ve been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandom It does not matter whether you are into jazz or not this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure weather it be at college or on the playing field I kid you not watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs and just when you think the ride is over we go for a second time around Excellence,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3109389/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,"""I'm exhausted!""",I felt like I had a workout after watching this Something that I think everyone thought after watching it It s intense You ll tap your foot You ll be happy and sad for Andrew And when he s not making you laugh you ll be scared of Fletcher And you ll never feel the runtime J K Simmons is one of my favorite actors Whenever someone asks me why I tell them Watch Spider Man Then watch Whiplash,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8473887/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2014,"Tension, tension, tension!",After seeing Damien Chazelle s Whiplash a film the young up and coming director wished to do for some time now being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project I was glad and relieved mainly because I have seen the short film which was pretty incredible I believe that among the most telling facts about a film s fortunes and qualities is the ability to broaden it s public but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences Or with other words a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions but also craft soul dedication and wits Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses but the people behind it have in abundance as well The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman who has the drive the ambition to succeed and to be great which is fine as long as it doesn t derail your personal life A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way Blind ambition is the thing that can describe our anti hero of sorts Terrence Fletcher a k a the brilliant J K Simmons who has a thing for mindeffin his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression But he does it for a reason for the sole purpose of finding the next big even great thing in jazz and in music as a whole The next prodigy the next Yardbird Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost if not being pushed to the very limit And boy does J K Simmons nails it Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons Their respective acts are full of purpose full of tension and ultimately terrific Expect some awards going in the way of Whiplash and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist that s how good he is in it And in his own words What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it As I said the best movies are those that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences not those who can connect to a massive number of people who are representatives of only one specific audience type And Chazelle has achieved just that with Whiplash a precise tension building film full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now My grade 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3113089/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2017,Blistering,Nominated for five Oscars and winning three editing sound and Best Supporting Actor with nominations for screenplay and Best picture Whiplash is positively blistering with a darker and more realistic view on aspirations and done in a way that s tense and inspirational Visually Whiplash looks great with grittily atmospheric photography with plenty of beautiful gripping shots like close ups of the drum playing and some of the tightest cleverest and most audacious editing of any film that year The sound is also thrilling in its intense authenticity and really add to the impact of the pulse racing Jazz soundtrack There is in particular unbelievable drum playing that serves as a fond reminder of iconic drum players of the classic Jazz Age the final drum solo is long but exhilaratingly played and a huge part of why the ending sends up a storm as much as it does The script is sharp and cutting sometimes uncompromising and at other points patient The story is not new but makes a point of aspirations and talent having its dark and less glamorous side competitiveness and that there are always obstacles including dictatorial bullies While not quite as extreme in life as shown here situations and people like seen in the film exist The story is at its most successful in its tension between Andrew and Fletcher which is thrilling and nail biting and Andrew s very relatable and inspiring drive and passion and much of it is very taut and rarely laborious in pace Damian Chazelle directs with a clear love for film and the jazz style and passion for the subject Whiplash has great performances all round The secondary cast do much with little and Miles Teller more than holds his own in a telling lead performance This is JK Simmons film however proving that his Oscar win was one of that year s most deserved wins He doesn t just dominate the film with his ruthless manner as a terrifyingly dictatorial character but actually IS essentially the film one s terrified of him but also understands his point of view Whiplash could have been slightly better this said Most of the supporting cast especially Andrew s family the film at least tries to say why the romance was rushed and dropped in that it didn t mean anything to him like his playing of music did are severely underwritten and underused The car crash scene and the aftermath also feels out of kilter and even the most committed musician wouldn t be in the right function to do what happens after that scene Otherwise this is a blisteringly great film with a huge amount to recommend 9 10 Bethany Cox,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3640829/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,A strive for perfection.,Music teacher Terrence Fletcher spots something in raw but talented young drummer Andy Niemann desperate to get to the top Andy makes several sacrifices to strive for greatness I can t always give one hundred percent attention to a film sometimes my mind can wander here though I was glued for the full run time This film is absolutely phenomenal a relatively low budget movie but one with an incredible story and some phenomenal acting How can a film be equal parts subtle and brash I can t explain why or how but this film has an incredibly rich content there is so much going on beneath the surface The characters incredibly rich rounded and thoroughly believable I must start by commenting on Fletcher he s fascinating irascible angry but deep smart demanding and passionate JK Simmons won an Oscar for this performance and deservedly so he is breathtaking here it is acting to savour The film is as much about Fletcher as it is about Niemann a total contrast where Fletcher is hard brash and tough Niemann is a little naive meak cute but loaded with talent it s Fletcher s outrageous demand for perfection from him that s the key Damien Chazelle nailed it here the script is pretty near perfect Oscar nominated it should have won it I am blown away by this incredible film 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8781688/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2014,A pair of outstanding performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons embody Damien Chazelle's piece of perfection...,When it comes to cinema there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles that can break through in the most proficient way Last year I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand Inside Llewyn Davis from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF This year I ve seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle s highly intense psychological drama Whiplash An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level As small and utterly different as I m about to compare I haven t felt this uneasy with a film s tension since Paul Greengrass Captain Phillips coincidentally also was a NYFF title Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them Stars Miles Teller and J K Simmons are absolutely astonishing featuring two of the year s very best turns Chazelle s film tells the story of Andrew Teller a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr Fletcher Simmons Walking out of the screening I fully knew though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year that Miles Teller would be my Oscar Isaac this year A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor but unfortunately will be passed over show after show Teller is submerged in a way that we haven t seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in Rabbit Hole and then helming The Spectacular Now with complete ease and intensity I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in Whiplash There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce F Murray Abraham in Amadeus as crazy as that sounds I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here It makes the future of film a lot more bright knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks Everything you ve heard about J K Simmons is true and then some A fully fleshed out supporting role Chazelle doesn t write Fletcher as a caricature He s a deeply acute individual full of passion and acrimony Chazelle doesn t keep Simmons at a 10 he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy hatred and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar winning Inglourious Basterds a role that found much heat on the awards circuit The world all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons A Supporting Actor nominations maybe even a win seems all but assured and deserved Looking back at the veteran actor s career that included memorable roles in Juno Burn After Reading and Up in the Air a role like this could not have come at a better time Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman s Men Women Children writers directors casting agents and producers will be pounding on the actor s door You can t credit Whiplash without citing the words and control by writer director Damien Chazelle An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort unfortunately have not seen his debut Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench that channels a young Bennett Miller Vigorous self assured and innovative Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make He takes inspiration from his own life his love of film and music and other places I m sure we don t know about and molds them into a gritty layered experience conditioned with rich characters all realized through the writer s story It s one of the best scripts of the year Whiplash features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014 An ending that will bring tears to your eyes dual performances that will have you applaud and an experience that you surely will not forget Drumming has never felt like such a personality It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try If you love music appreciate education and dare to be better than your current state you will find something very real to latch onto Hold on and hold on tight Whiplash is being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and will be released October 10 in limited release and then expanding after A must see for all movie lovers,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3094159/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,Astonishing performance,This is a very unique movie even u are not into jazz but still can drew u into the atmosphere of it without moving your eyes My eyes were dry after seeing this movie Miles and Jk portray it flawless Jk remind me of ex employer will use your weakness background against you if anything go wrong Director done very well using camera angle to capture the face of the actor to create the tension in it Have to admit I hate Fletcher brutal teaching but most of the music icons were pushing to their limit practice to perfectly everyday so he is not entirely wrong also just my fantasy it will be great if this movie can use 120fps technology to capture the facial expressions of two lead actors,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5232271/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2015,A Portrait of the Artist as a Crazy Young Man,I work with a guy who studied music in school and had friends who went the music conservatory route and according to him Whiplash is authentic To which I say Oh my God Because this film is a nightmare Miles Teller gives an under appreciated performance as a drummer following his passion who is lucky enough if lucky is the right word to be chosen by a psycho jazz teacher J K Simmons to join his class What follows is a battle of wills as Simmons tries to grind his students to stumps of their former selves while Teller proves that he won t be so easily dominated Whiplash goes in a very dark direction and completely defies expectations which is what I liked most about it I was expecting a kind of Devil Wears Prada set in a music school where the eager pupil first wants to give up then rises to the challenge earns the respect of a tough teacher but ultimately decides his worth doesn t depend on proving himself to anybody But that is most decidedly NOT the direction this film goes instead turning into a contest to see how much crazier and more obsessed one maestro can be over another Simmons shouts and blusters his way through a one note role He s good in context of what he s asked to do but it s the kind of showy performance that wins Oscars not a subtle and complex characterization Teller is the heart and soul of the film and he s tremendous The film is like watching a car accident in slow motion and being unable to do anything to prevent it and just as unable to look away Winner of three Academy Awards Supporting Actor for Simmons Film Editing and Sound Mixing and nominated for two others including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay Grade A,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207397/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2015,Wow just wow. Easily one of the greatest films of the year,There is so many excellent great things to say about this film To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher Miles Teller an actor who I ve only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew The performance are outstanding and that s just the tip of the iceberg My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it s own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film it s atmosphere is unlike any other as well The idea that this film is one of a kind can t be stressed enough I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity When you watch this film even though it s pace will seem slow to most it s intensity is impossible to miss I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn t have been more intense The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me I don t know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I m talking about I have a good feeling and I m hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one I haven t read anything on this films page and I m sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me I m praying you enjoy this film and experience it s one of a kind intensity just as I did Thanks for reading my review and enjoy,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3157439/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2019,A Psychological Horror Story,In New York a young jazz drummer Miles Teller is enrolled in a prestigious music school His ambitions are tested and manipulated by a sadistic perfectionist music instructor J K Simmons There are occasional moments in the film that seem far fetched and over the top But these are forgiven due to the edgy execution by director writer Damien Chazelle and the acting Teller is very believable as someone whose obsession to succeed overrides his sense of safety This is partly explained in a useful scene at the beginning of an extended family gathering where one upmanship seemed to be the traditional form of communicating However the movie belongs to Simmons who is the epitome of the authority from hell He has rightly won many awards for this performance and he is likely to win more He is so frightening when he is dominating the students that even in the audience there is a sigh of relief felt when he is acting more at ease and human His presence is that strong Whiplash ably presents the question of whether attaining genius is worth the price at least in certain circumstances It also succeeds as a psychological horror movie The Simmons character is likely to be mentioned in the future as one of the movies most memorable villains dbamateurcritic,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4662327/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,"Intense movie, phenomenal J.K. Simmons but unrealistic",This movie should please a wide audience of non musicians I am not a musician but I ve seen movies based on things I know very well and it s always exaggerated and unrealistic and it usually bugs me more than other people I can easily imagine how real musicians may dislike this one The directing and acting are great although J K Simmons steals the whole show as are cinematography and sound However the whole premise is wildly unrealistic and the moral of the story to be great you need to be pushed beyond your limits is a tired trope that has often been done in a better way than here On a personal note I hate bullies with a passion and there can never be a but it s for a good reason excuse for bullying,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4637290/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2022,The Conflict is Better than any Superhero Movie,The story of a jazz drummer who is pushed to the brink by sadistic music conductor As a drummer myself I found the depiction of the art the the elements of the band room very accurate with the exception of the crazy conductor mine was quite nice by contrast What makes this film so excellent is the character driven storytelling I watched this the same weekend as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness MOM and I was far more captivated by the conflict between the characters of Whiplash than I was of MOM Whiplash featured incredible twists and turns that kept me glued to the screen This is an underrated gem that deserves more praise,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8194705/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2015,"Great music, but the plot angers me",This film tells the story of a young drummer who us accepted into the most prestigious music school in New York The teacher there is very strict even abusive physically and psychologically The story then tells how the enmeshed relationship between the two evolve The music in Whiplash is great It s like going to a jazz concert especially the finale performance at the end For the plot itself however I did not like it at all The teacher is very abusive and dies everything he could to stir up rivalry and hatred among his students The worst thing is that the film gives him time to justify his abuse Abuse is not right and the film allows abusers to give twisted reasons to justify something wrong That really angers me Coupled with the fact that his students keep on receiving the abuse it evoked a lot of anger in me,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3161446/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2015,Beat a path to the cinema to see this,Whiplash is simply astonishing Miles Teller plays Andrew a gifted and highly ambitious drummer in his first year at an elite New York music academy There his talents are spotted by Fletcher J K Simmons an equally ambitious coach and mentor who is always looking for the next big thing but has never found it However there is a very thin line between being an ambitious coach and a terrifying bully and Fletcher constantly crosses that line sometimes inflicting a terrible impact on his young students In an almost uniformly male environment love interest is served from the cinema concessionary stand by Nicole the charming Melissa Benoist who the shy and uncertain Andrew finally plucks up the courage to ask out on a high point in his emotional roller coaster Spot the female featuring Melissa Benoist The school for prot g s theme has perhaps been trodden before by movies like Alan Parker s Fame and some of the emotional and creative jostling of elite musicians has appeared in films such as 2012 s A Late Quartet But none of these deliver the degree of passion and intensity metered out in Damien Chazelle s movie Miles Teller Divergent is superbly credible as the aspiring jazz drummer Andrew and it is almost unbelievable that he was not a professional drummer turned actor for this film In fact the more accomplished jazz drummer very different to rock drumming apparently is Nate Lang who plays Carl his key competitor for the percussion 1 role The two were apparently locked away in a drumming boot camp for 2 months prior to the movie being filmed But the starring role in the film goes to J K Simmons probably best known in the supporting role of J Jonah Jameson the cranky editor of the Daily Bugle in the Spiderman films and a number of other Marvel spin offs Simmons is quite simply astonishing channelling the sort of Oscar winning performance of Louis Gossett Jnr An Officer and a Gentleman into his vicious drill sergeant style performance He has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor role for both Golden Globe and BAFTA awards and I would fully expect him to feature in the Oscar shortlist when they are announced on January 15th Personally speaking he will be the one I will be cheering for in the awards themselves Cinematography by Sharone Meir is outstanding with every drop of blood sweat and tears glistening on forehead and cymbal The editing by Tom Cross is also extremely tight winding up the tension during key encounters The combination of the two together with Chazelle s tight script effectively spears the audience in the gut The feature is based on Chazelle s short film of the same name and on this basis he is a name to watch for the future Gut wrenching and enthralling this film will spit you out the other end feeling emotionally drained This is simply a film you MUST see Let me drum it into you again GO SEE THIS FILM If you liked this review please see others at bob the movie man com and sign up to receive future posts Thanks,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3160514/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2015,Intense But The Hype And Awards Possibly Work Against It,Do you know who I am asks the film s protagonist as the audience are introduced to him Yeah you re that Nazi dude who enjoys raping all the new arrivals at the Oswald State penitentiary Yes JK Simmons is back playing an Oscar winning role which isn t all that different from the role OZ fans know him for It s nice to see that this years Oscar nominations were heavily in favour of indie cinema It s even nicer to know that this is the film my fellow members of this site was the pick of the crop from 2014 film releases so sat back hoping to get blown away by it So is it any good Yes but I should quickly qualify this by stating it s not really the masterwork some people might claim it to be One criticism THE HURT LOCKER received was that you could easily rework the story as someone who has become addicted to adrenaline Instead of a bomb disposal man you could have the story involve a fireman who takes more and more risks and so it s the same with WHIPLASH How about a brutal drill instructor trying to turn weak civvies in to efficient killing machines That s already been done a hundred times before and so here we ve a reworking of a familiar story in a slightly unfamiliar setting of a music school It s a slightly predictable story and in order for it not to be so predictable there s a few plot turns involving situations that become rather contrived and unlikely to say the least What stops it all falling apart is director Damien Chazelle using all the tools at his disposal involving editing sound mix and cinematography to disguise the flaws in the story telling Certainly many directors nowadays think editing revolves around taking as much cocaine as possible while mutilating any coherent on screen action The editing style of WHIPLASH is some what showy but is genuinely admirable at the same time It s nice to actually watch a film and notice the editing while never being irritated by it WHIPLASH is one of the better films of 2014 but it s probably a film that s easier to admire than to like I did like it but didn t love it and I m not in a great hurray to watch it again,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3209234/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2015,Bitches Whew,If this is already diminishing in my estimation minutes after watching it s because it s about subjects that are dear to me music concentration meaning in life and placement of ourselves in the larger music but it has no insights to impart or none that I have any use for The whole is about ego pummeling away in the effort to be someone in the eyes of others rather than the joy of the craft itself about clinging on to achievement than flowing on the creativity of the moment about perfecting technique than cultivating soul what Spanish musicians know as duende the deep urge that rises from the body and cries to express itself as music Now I m not a fanatic jazzist who thinks the music should be portrayed in this or that original light the film may well be seen after all to be about confused individuals who miss the point a bad teacher But the bad teacher who hammers home a trivial point is the filmmaker We see how this clinging is more or less disastrous for everyone how it derails them from expressing soul It s also what puts them back on the stage But I miss the deeper and softer insight here for which jazz is a model that we should indeed strive to perfect our craft but that s so we can be able to use it freely and without obstruction so that we can pierce through the sheet the notation to the real hum of music that spontaneously unfolds in the room where we play with others become the instrument for music that plays itself The film is in the end as small as what it shows unable to pierce from merely polished technique to wonder or let go of fixation with accomplishment to begin immersion in fulfillment It ends just as it would have to do that It all builds up to a last scene of dueling between master and student for room in the stage that finally perhaps sublimates all the ego and hardship in music that sweeps both In that scene we have a frantic display of ego as determination but is his drum solo great music or merely an elaborate flourish apart from the music that the music has to stop for And this extends in a cinematic way the scene is adroitly edited but is it anything more than a piece of mastered technique mechanical I wrote last year about a film called A Spell to Ward off the Darkness which has a much more spacious swimming of the cinematic eye also incidentally between instruments on a stage but faced the same conundrum soul wasn t there duende This is bar none the most striking limit in expression with a camera since the beginning of cinema one that every great maker strives to push back Many have,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207231/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2014,Bleeding Passion,People may quickly picture Whiplash as the Full Metal Jacket of jazz band there s Fletcher militarily pushing his student Andrew to get his task right The hatred towards the mentor becomes the character s motivation of achieving his orders perfectly and the similarities could end there Although this is a very different context the harsh shout y discipline and sometimes its negative human effects are quite reminiscent But without any grim twists this movie just sticks directly to one s determination of being successful to his job either for the instructor or for himself This is one rough environment that takes you to a relentless study of intense rehearsals and intense discipline until it reaches to the point where their goals lose out of control And just like those sequences Whiplash keeps most of the viewers from their comfort zone and leads them to rewarding results Movies like this specifically relationship between a student and a mean teacher conventionally ends with a heart changing sentiment possibly leading the two to an unexpected life long friendship but Whiplash takes it stone cold hardly showing any sign of friendliness in their bond The only way for the young drummer to gain his own light is to roll with the punches and learn exactly what the band want him to do even if it costs much of what he has in life This is supposed to be an image of inspiration but the film mostly portrays the nightmares of this never give up ambition which transforms the dreamer into a mad man who is few steps away of breaking down Nonetheless this unending pressure brings real impact to what lesson this movie is trying to show The filmmaking is spectacular all in all each of its musical scenes makes for a truly grandeur show but the core here are the ones that is mainly about the drums They are impressively played with relentless intensity while the camera strikingly displays the flowing literal sweat and blood of the drummer indicating his committed exhaustion The performances are the spotlight especially J K Simmons who has done perfect to his character It might have been easy for an overacted performance but Simmons finds the sense of humanity beneath what it s written making Fletcher reasonable to furiously shout at any intolerable flaw of his students Miles Teller also killed it recognizably for the drumming parts but aside of that he convincingly follows through the character s obsession until he turns closer to insanity Whiplash often feels cruel but there is an important reason for that It depicts a serious way of motivation you can feel that in every beat of his terrifyingly breathtaking drum performances this is mostly the reality of being unstoppable to what you are desperately aiming for plus driven by fear and hate But eventually the film makes a clear point why their world of music have to be this bitter Overall it all works by choosing clever directions staging magnificent musical set pieces and remarkable acting from its two leads Even if the story is quite simple its heart tends to overwhelm you,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3107336/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2014,Fantastic,There are multiple reasons why Whiplash comes to the Toronto International Film Festival with palpable anticipation The film was showcased at this year s Sundance Film Festival where it went on to both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize award for best dramatic film Actor Miles Teller was recently named as one of Variety s 10 Actors to Watch and J K Simmons well he s J K freakin Simmons So the gathering audience at the afternoon screening was primed ready and eager for the expected greatness about to be screened Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman a determined 19 year old drummer who is pushed to his emotional limits by his new instructor Terence J K Simmons Terence has a reputation for being the best but mentoring under his tutelage comes at a price Terrence is no Mr Miyagi He is ruthless in his barrage of verbal sewage that attempts to push his students towards the greatness he believes they can achieve Newcomer Andrew is no spared his ire as evidenced in this heated reaction when Andrew can t find Terence s tempo Were you rushing or were you dragging If you deliberately sabotage my band I will gut you like a pig Oh my dear God are you one of those single tear people You are a worthless pancy ass who is now weeping and slobbering all over my drumset like a nine year old girl There is no Wash on Wash off PG ness here Being mean is in Terence s nature And his assault on his young prot g s is sometimes hard to watch Think of Gunnery Sargent Hartman in Full Metal Jacket and imagine the persistent yelling and abuse for an entire film Throughout Andrew remains resilient His goal to become a drummer of future legend has him shun friends and family He s all alone and the uncomfortable Terence bond that he creates is all that he has Audiences will be unsure of where Whiplash is headed Are we headed for a triumphant climax where the drill sergeant esque nature of the instructor pays off in a musical crescendo closing that brings audiences to their feet Or will the pressure and barrage of verbal bullying take effect with a shocking tragedy that spotlights the harassment of our children Be sure this is no Mr Holland s Opus and the hate and evil that Terence employs travels from opening to closing credits without reprieve Writer director Damien Chazelle does a stunning job of keeping us on the edge of our seats wondering when or if a climatic breakdown will occur We watch in awe as Andrew gets pushed and pushes himself until his hands bleed after hours of relentless play We feel as uncomfortable for his situation as we feel trapped in finding a solution to Andrew s goal The concluding act only further exemplifies the events and personalities that took us to the stage and the audience cheered in Andrew s defiance while gasping at his situation The result is a fantastic film that is sure to be considered for Best Picture at next year s Academy Award s It is a rousing crowd pleaser will have audiences clapping with hands they will want washed of Terence s abuse J K Simmons has the role he was meant to play and his character was not only brilliant but could rank as one of the best cinematic villains of all time,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3083298/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2015,music and obsession,J K Simmons has played a number of stern demanding characters during his career But he gets the role of a lifetime in Damien Chazelle s Whiplash He plays the brutal instructor of a college jazz band This man resorts to methods that lapse into abuse In showing these overly aggressive teaching methods the movie poses the question of what is the right thing to do when encouraging students to succeed Brutality is understood to be the only choice when readying cadets for a war zone but when teaching college students how to play jazz Simmons won a well deserved Oscar for his performance Although it was for Best Supporting Actor the movie belongs to him Miles Teller s performance as the student is truly secondary to Simmons His character is one of only a few movie characters in history who made me feel as if I was walking on eggshells,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3295042/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2015,I like to teach the world to play,Good Job are the key words for Whiplash J K Simmons psycho jazz teacher Terence Fletcher recounts a story about Charlie Parker and how doing a good job was not enough to uncover a genius There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job according to Fletcher The trouble is Fletcher would not recognise a genius if it crashed into him head on Simmons creates a monster of a teacher which to be truthful is not unknown in coaching circles in sports and the arts However a good educator he is not something his prestigious school seems not to have noticed Miles Teller plays Andrew Neiman the put upon jazz drummer in the Shaffer Conservatory in New York Eager to impress Fletcher and confounded that nothing he does can satisfy Fletcher Neiman literally is driven to the edge However there is only ever going to be one winner Fletcher does not give an inch J K Simmons won a best supporting actor Oscar for his mean and blustering performance There was very little shade to his performance and even in his subdued moments his character was calculating A man with little ethical core It is left to Teller to bring soul to the film The young student whose zest and passion for learning and improvement is fast fading away as he becomes the victim of intense bullying The film never addresses the bullying by Fletcher There is a sub plot about this later in the movie but notice how the other students just stay quiet and let the abuse unfurl Given that cooperating with each other in music is so important these students hardly talked to each other They were reaaly a dysfunctional band who certainly did not give a shoulder to lean on which came across as unrealistic Surely the students would mutter to each other in the canteen as to how horrible Fletcher was As to the competition which causes Neiman problems as he has trouble getting there Again you would have thought the Conservatory would had provided transport rather than rely on the students to make their own way I did not think the film succeeded The performances were intense but the screenplay had problems because the I never could buy into the band members as functioning students,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3377148/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2015,"Its message is conflicted, but it's still pretty good.",Though my appreciation of this film has somewhat decreased throughout the several times I ve watched it I still think it has a lot to offer In the brutal world Chazelle crafts in this film you need to pay a price for your dreams to come true Chazelle s La La Land has a similar theme Not only do we see the toll Andrew s pursuits of being a great drummer have on him but also on his relationship with those around him given his alienation of some of his family or how he cuts off his contacts with someone who may have gotten in the way of his dream Also even though Fletcher s teaching strategies technically work the film simultaneously acknowledges the downsides to them given what we learn about Sean Casey and how some of Fletcher s students leave his program In spite of the darker bits though the movie also manages to be a lot of fun The jazz concerts are both well shot and edited with the standout being the technically outstanding ending which dropped my jaw when I first watched it back in 2014 Finally J K Simmons does a terrific job in this film He s electrifying when he teaches the band and equally compelling in his quieter scenes with the standout being his conversation with Andrew about Charlie Parker In spite of these strengths though something about the film s message turns me off While I don t think the film champions Fletcher it does imply that the only way to achieve greatness is through being abused You can either roll with the abuse and become famous or give up your dreams While I m not denying some people will require that kind of pressure to improve that isn t the only way someone can become famous I wish the film would ve presented more options to achieve greatness to Andrew but have him choose to stay in Fletcher s program staying in abusive relationships that you recognize as being abusive is normal so this would ve worked just fine As it stood I thought the film s message was conflicted Yes it does acknowledge the flaws to Fletcher s teaching methods but it also acted like Andrew had no other options to pursue his dream and that didn t sit right with me In spite of this however I still like the film quite a bit Its strengths are compelling and engaging enough to carry the film,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3295212/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2018,the film's title sums it up perfectly,Andrew Neiman is an ambitious drummer who doesn t just want to be great but to be one of the greats Despite being only a first year student at Shaffer Conservatory in New York City perceived by many to be the very best music school in the country Andrew is recruited to join the upper level studio band but to prove himself he s going to have to survive a tenacious battle of wits with Terence Fletcher a renowned but unrelenting conductor who uses draconian methods to bring out the very best in his students This intense exhilarating drama from director Damien Chazelle pulls you in right from the start and never lets up with vigorous acting as well as top grade musical numbers on its way to a smashing climax Teller is compelling as the youthful student pushed to his very limits meanwhile Simmons who looks like he d be right at home in Stanley Kubrick s Full Metal Jacket gives a brutal and uncompromising performance as his relentless mentor This is a powerful and provocative film about dedication ambition and obsession,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4107028/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2015,"Powerful--and thin, and the ""jazz"" is handcuffed ""band"" music",Whiplash 2014 Wow the best of this is intense and disturbing and invigorating It s about never never never cutting corners It s about pushing and being your best until you break and then keeping going Who can t get revved up about that The scene is a mythical music school something like Julliard and Berkeley combined intense and serious with an element of jazz built in And the competition expected as it is pushed students beyond their comfort zone to absurd and inspiring degrees The scenes where the music leader teacher and bandleader played by J K Simmons goes apeshit over the bumbling of his students are quite shocking I m an art teacher and I tried it out one day even warning the student I was going to do it and showing the preview to the movie first and it went very badly The student in the movie who anchors the plot is the unknown Miles Teller who is just fine in the role He pushes and struggles and suffers and eventually comes through though with some serious convolutions So on the surface this will thrill and wow most viewers And I liked all of this a lot But the plot is mostly just what I ve described There are two additions to it one dismissible the love life of the student an the other the one socially probing aspect which you ll have to wait to see Excellent and needed But not enough If you love jazz or have played jazz I ve done both in my limited way you might balk at the music here Yes Surprise Because this is all written out band music with jazz inflections Until the last scene which is critical there is no improvisational jazz at all none In fact the music struck me so cold I almost stopped watching I hope you won t have the same problem but it s there I also found the overall plot so narrow I couldn t quite get past its linearity Even the psychology of the two leads is mostly left to rants and bleeding fingers and disgust It s oddly superficial even if it strikes you at first as completely about psychological depth Still it s remarkable in its own way and I totally recommend seeing it The shocks will be wonderfully shocking and the idea of doing your best which is something most of us shamefully avoid is a great reminder,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3261073/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2015,A stunning character study that acts as a white knuckle thriller,Who knew jazz and drumming could be so ripe for heart stopping narrative drive Culminating in one of the more tension riddled finales of recent memories and featuring some of the most brutal ego tearing scripting this side of Full Metal Jacket up and coming filmmaker Damian Chazelle s searing drama is against all odds a drama cume thriller of the highest order Featuring some of last years most outstounding performances from both the ever growing Miles Teller and the always good yet never before so commanding J K Simmons Whiplash will have you constantly on the edge of your seat frequently forgetting to breathe and riveted every step of it s running time due to an all round package that has rightfully become a player and often winner in this awards season It s stunning to consider this is one of Chazelle s first features and for a man perhaps best known for scripting the Elijah Wood thriller Grand Piano this is a sure fire heralding in of a major new filmmaking talent Chazelle handles proceedings like a true professional the editing the pacing the direction of actors and the award calibre scripting is all of he highest order and it s evident throughout that Chazelle is a naturally gifted filmmaker Whiplash truly is an exciting mix of dramatic tension and thrilling interplay between budding musician Andrew and egotistical conductor Terrence Fletcher that sees Chazelle draw out a pair of rivals that will live long in the lore of cinema history Since his arrival on the film scene in films such as Rabbit Hole and more recently The Spectacular Now Miles Teller has threatened to break out at any moment and if The Spectacular Now was not proof enough there is little remaining doubt after this effort that Teller is one of the finest examples of young talent in the industry today Teller s character of Andrew is a multilayered one and one that doesn t necessarily win over our affections completely His a complicated young boy driven to the point of arrogance and not overly warm yet his a figure we want to see succeed if not only to spite the evil incarnate that is J K Simmons s Fletcher A recognisable face over many years of supporting work in Hollywood it s a true joy to see Simmons unleash in a stunning portrayal of a man driven to drive others to the point of no return Whether spouting out some of the most vile abuse possible or talking calmly to potential future musicians that he can use in his band Terrence Fletcher is a force to be reckoned with a tornado of aggression and pent up rage It s one of 2014 s stand out performances and a role that saw Simmons collect a thoroughly deserved Oscar at the Academy Awards it s a win that is wholeheartedly earned and deserved While Whiplash has a few narrative missteps and a handful of questionable scenarios particularly one scene involving a car accident it s not enough to sully a film that you suspect will be living a long life in years to come being studied by start out filmmakers budding actors and lovers of all things good cinema Just don t go showing anyone considering a potential sojourn in a music school as Terrence Fletcher may just be enough to scare them away for good 4 and a half bloodied drum kits out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into www jordanandeddie wordpress com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3191070/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2015,One of the Best of 2014,Whiplash 2014 out of 4 Hard hitting drama plays out much like a thriller as Andrew Miles Teller dreams of becoming a great drummer no matter what the cost is He ends up attending the best music school in the country and it doesn t take long before he s hand picked by Fletcher J K Simmons the best teacher there who will stop at nothing to get the best out of his students WHIPLASH is a film that pretty much came out of nowhere and is leaving a major mark on those who see it I will admit that I hadn t really heard too much about the film but it seems with each passing day there was someone new singing it s praises Well having now seen the movie I m going to join the crowd and tell everyone how wonderful it actually is I think one of the hardest things to do is take a familiar genre teacher student relationship and trying to bring new life to it Director writer Damlen Chazelle manages to do just that because we ve seen this type of film several times before but it s done in such a way here that you can t help but feel you re watching something fresh and original I think one of the biggest reasons it feels fresh is due to the actual subject of a drummer You d expect to see something about singers or guitar players but to set this in the world of a drummer and Jazz music was something that works so well because of the wild frantic style of the jazz score works perfectly well with the work and abuse that the main character forces on himself The scenes of Andrew working his hands to blood are just so flawlessly edited with the score that you can t help but feel every drop of blood that drips from his hands Another major plus is the actual editing which is incredibly fast pace but falls well short of that MTV style that has become so worn out the past two decades Of course the film s highlight is without question the performance of Simmons who is simply wonderful Again we ve seen angry people countless times before and we ve seen caring teachers countless times before What s so memorable about the performance here is how quickly Simmons is able to change emotions from caring to pure rage in the matter of seconds Getting the eyes to tell you what you need to know from a scene is extremely hard but just watch Simmons eyes throughout the picture The rage he shows isn t just mindless screaming and cussing because you can still see a certain emotion and caring in his eyes Teller is also excellent in the role and manages to stand his own against Simmons Both Paul Reiser and Melissa Benoist are also very good in their supporting parts What also makes WHIPLASH so memorable is the fact that it really plays out like a thriller I m not going to ruin anything that happens but we can see the main character falling apart due to the abuse from the teacher and we know something is eventually going to happen to cause havoc The film plays this suspense out as if you re watching a thriller and it really pays off in the final twenty minutes as there are a couple excellent twists The film certainly has everything you want from a movie and it s clearly one of the best of 2014,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3171248/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2021,An uncomcomfortable but brilliant exploration of ambition,Whiplash 2014 Unforgiveably it has taken me a good few years to get around to watching this modern classic but just in case there are any film fans who have not yet done so do make sure you check this one out The film is an intense exploration of drive and ambition it juxtaposes the comfort of mediocrity with the insanity and suffering which comes with the attempt to achieve the extraordinary Miles Teller brilliantly plays the impressionable ingenue who is willing to do anything to succeed as a musician JK Simmons is possibly even more brilliant in the showier role of the mentor that will test his pupil to the absolute limit Clearly inspired by iconic films such as Powell and Pressburger s The Red Shoes and Kubrick s Full Metal Jacket the director Damien Chazelle has Simmons excude menace and testosterone as he attempts to crush and remold his musical recruits and his band literally are recruited watch the film you ll see what I mean The script is witty and caustic and the film s depictions of extreme devotion to craft will make you wince and squirm but if you have the stomach to keep watching you will witness a brilliant character study in which the power struggle between mentor and mentee becomes unexpectedly much less than one sided The film s brilliance aside from some dazzling close up camera work and brilliant acting is that it does not moralise or take sides it shows us something profound something rare something utterly compelling two human beings capacity for self sacrifice and discipline in the pursuit of an ideal And just when you think its characters can t go any further they reveal that they re only just getting started Rating 10 10 a truly mesmerising cinematic treat,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6798925/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2015,"Astounding, intense & damn near perfect!",Wow Just wow A young drummer Andrew Miles Teller enrolls at a prestigious music conservatory Plucked from a rehearsal room he is given the opportunity to play with the studio band under the tutelage of aggressively driven band leader Fletcher J K Simmons a man with a vicious mouth extreme methods and an obsession with driving his students way beyond breaking point in order to achieve their potential and find absolute perfection Perhaps my greatest joy with Whiplash is that just a few weeks ago I was barely aware of its existence and deliberately knew little about it as I took my seat in the screening room There is something very special about being blindsided without expectation and blindsided I was My screening companion and I felt exhausted by the end and were still discussing animatedly it an hour later I knew I was in the presence of greatness within minutes of Whiplash From the opening scenes of Andrew rehearsing and Fletcher observing passing judgment and scything him down with sharpened tongue and looks that slayed it was abundantly clear that writer director Damien Chazelle was on a mission to hammer us repeatedly with verbal blades withering looks and an intensity that other directors would kill to produce There are insufficient superlatives to express the power and effect of Whiplash and Chazelle s achievement At least four times in the course of the screening my heart sank as Chazelle took us towards an alleyway that was predictable and certain to kick a five star experience into another four star notable also ran Each time he turned it around beautifully steadfastly refusing to take the convenient route instead aiming another kick at the tender parts slamming us with the unexpected and leaving us to reel or look on in wide eye admiration His brilliance is in the subtlety the sharp cracks of dialogue that slice through the opposing character s confidence it is in the reactions of the onlookers that we see once and only once never over egging a moment it is in the blood sweat and tears literally that coat the symbols it is in the music the performance and the slam of hand and stick on metal and skin and it is in the accompanying venomous glares that scream more eloquently than a thousand words could ever achieve Until last night I didn t really get jazz After 107 minutes of Whiplash that passed in a heart pounding hair prickling moment I can t get enough If there had been a second screening I d have put myself through the exhaustion again in an instant When the Oscar nominations are revealed tomorrow I doubt if the Academy will honour Whiplash with a Best Film nod but I sincerely hope it is in the mix at least for director and editing As for J K Simmons his nomination and win as Best Supporting Actor are probably as much a certainty as Daniel Day Lewis was for Best Actor in 2013 for Lincoln If Simmons doesn t clean up 90 of the principal awards and see his already superb career take a whole new trajectory after this I ll eat my hat and yours and every one I can find in the village Good Whiplash is damn near perfect and J K Simmons is a major reason for it For those who know J K Simmons as that guy from no longer is he going to be the go to guy for irascible bosses and supporting characters There is an effortlessness to his commanding performance as the teacher his students fear but whose validation they crave Powerful venomous controlling manipulative vindictive Fletcher is at turns both horrible and perhaps a genius J K Simmons utter ownership of the character pokes an electrified finger into every nerve prompting us to hate fear and just maybe respect and admire a man who walks a razor sharp line between obsessive insanity and genius all the time staring his victims in the eye screaming into their face and daring them to take him on On the receiving end of much of his venom is Andrew played with equal measure and control by Teller It is a solid performance that meets Simmons all the way More than that is Teller s performance at the drums that astound He plays with his hands and his fists and his mind and his emotions and every ounce of fluid he can ring out of every available pore in his body At the risk of sounding repetitive wow Just wow I recently reviewed Big Eyes a true story that really didn t warrant a feature length big screen outing Conversely Whiplash is an event I wish I could make a reality so that I could experience it in the flesh repeatedly Chazelle has crafted a film that is pretty much perfect I fear it will receive a limited audience because on paper the premise doesn t blow anyone away Teacher gives student a hard time student struggles to find himself But back in 1994 a little prison movie was released that was badly marketed garnered seven Oscar nominations didn t win a single one and bombed at the box office It was only word of mouth and the DVD release that made the world sit up en masse and notice that The Shawshank Redemption for what it is Perhaps Whiplash will go through a similar experience though I suspect Oscar won t make the same mistake this time around The year is young but Whiplash is the best cinematic outing from it so far See it see it now and prepare for something remarkable To steal a line I ll count you in For more reviews from The

12 June 2015,A Brutal Character,A previous reviewer mention Full Metal Jacket the Kubrick film about the vicious Drill Sergeant who dehumanizes his men but one of those men in particular However in that movie the young Marine probably had no business being where he was Here a young man wants to be a drummer who will be remembered like Gene Krupa or Buddy Rich He has awesome ability which is recognized by Fletcher Academy Award winner J K Simmons His method involves brutalizing and horrifying his charges and humiliating them in front of their peers People know he s the best there is but what a price to pay He justifies his intensity by repeating some incident where another band member threw cymbal at Charlie Parker s head While this is good entertainment if we were to look into the successes of many great performers most of them were never terrorized The drumwork is astounding but all the bleeding is pretty far fetched Ask some drummers you know The final scene is all Hollywood as most reality goes out the window Still if you buy into the possibility that such a psychotic can command these musicians it s very entertaining The drumming is beyond belief although I m sure there were some strategic cuts along the way,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3256850/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2015,Hollywood make-believe garbage at its best.,Having spent most of my entire life in music playing drums and teaching the art I can tell you that there are so many things wrong with this movie it s laughable The absurd over the top face slapping scene in the trailer was enough for me to avoid seeing it But at the urging of a friend a non musician who thought it was great I caved in to my curiosity His taste in movies aside he s still my friend and I was right in my initial judgement Watching the entire movie was a waste I made it half way through and ditched Whiplash is an unadulterated load of crap,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3258786/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2015,Whiplash Just Might Be One Of The Greats,This film does not drag nor rush it was perfectly in line with the tempo and nearly every aspect of the film was flawless I m going to start off praising the electrifying performances because I have never experienced that much tension and fear through the use of dialogue J K Simmons was fantastic taking on a psychotic temper mental music instructor who comes off beyond intimidating and all the more blood curdling Miles Teller delivers a surprising career flipping performance and handles the role perfectly as he is driven to succeed and dedicated to excel at his admission the intensity put into his character is overwhelming The film takes many unexpected twists and turns and overall comes off a very powerful and intriguing experience all thanks to the unique style of direction and striking cinematography The film offers moving characters and hidden life values throughout despite its fairly basic plot you will be surprised with what this film is capable of Whiplash was sharply written and precisely acted No characters were miscast no scenes bored me It s easily one of the best 2014 movies so far and without a doubt an Oscar nomination is well deserved,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3159859/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2015,I really disliked this movie,I didn t enjoy this movie though I don t fault the fine acting Movies successfully pitch an alternate reality when internal consistencies makes the unbelievable believable In the movie The Matrix as in many Sci Fi flicks the director establishes environmental rules and all the characters operate within that framework My objections to Whiplash focus on its extreme examples of behavior which are so extreme as to make them conspicuously inconsistent with the movie s time and place Those extremes strain the credulity of nearly every key player I couldn t take the movie seriously despite its fervent desire to make a case about over the top efforts sacrifices and what some people think it takes to win There was little no back story to convince me any of the characters would either act like that be allowed to act like that or be the recipient of those same actions It s caricature upon caricature The movie s conclusion provided some semblance of redemptive believable cohesion but by then it really was too late and I found the whole setup very contrived,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3210017/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2018,"Rings completely hollow and false, with no redeeming qualities.",As a musician and a drummer I was urged by a couple of different friends to watch this praised movie Aside from a few of the JK Simmons insults which I laughed at there is nothing good about this film as it clearly shows that the filmmaker and the editor know nothing about music or drumming He reduces all of drumming to that s not my tempo thereby dumbing down the entire art form into a click track meanwhile revealing no insight into what it actually means to play the drums or be a musician The film won an Oscar for best editing although throughout the film the drumming that you hear and what you see being played by the unlikeable lead actor do not match and in the finale the overhead shots obviously reveal that it is not the actor but rather a stand in musician Both lead characters are unlikeable and actually ridiculous Everything about the movie rings hollow and worst of all false The most ridiculous thing of all is how poorly and over the top he represents the drumming Jazz drumming largely requires an ease of dexterity not this growling buffoon using baseball bat sized sticks bleeding all over the snare drum while making Rocky faces Did I actually see the ride cymbal sweat Oh my God it was so bad If you fall for this piece of garbage I don t know what to tell you,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4392722/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2015,"It is an intense, powerful, and electrifying work of art",Damien Chazelle s Whiplash represents arguably one of the most exhilarating cinematic endeavors in the music genre in recent memory let alone one by a man making his directorial debut It is a music themed that takes on the daunting task of delivering a feverishly thrilling atmosphere not from the emotional resonance of its music but its bold psychological tone that proceeds its heart rending story By Chazelle s thoughtful direction and the uncompromising performances by actors Miles Teller and J K Simmons this film doesn t just achieves this task it embraces The story here is not one of your battle of the bands tales involving a band or a solo musician shooting for the stars it is a story concerning the complex and thought provoking relationship between a young musician and his mentor And it is one that hits hard in ways that a very few would expect This film follows Andrew Neiman played by Miles Teller an inspired drummer who enrolls in a local music conservatory where he joins a jazz band conducted by the talented but maniacal Terence Fletcher played by J K Simmons Fletcher is most certainly not a kind hearted mentor he is abusive towards his band and holds no bars when splashing his band with an severely ill temper each time one of them makes a mistake Upon joining the band Andrew suffers under Fletcher s mental abuse to pushing him to the limits but at the same time inspires the immersive talent he never knew he had If you think you are in for another cheery and whimsical musical tale think again This film takes the music genre and grips with a dark twist and Damien Chazelle accomplishes this in a way that puts the film on the border of a thriller than a drama The narrative crux of the story is the complex relationship between an ambitious drummer who wants to exercise his talent to the fullest when he arrives to the opportunity and a cold anger fueled conductor who threatens to tear him apart with his mental abuse yet sees an inspiring talent in the young man This all comes down to an exhilarating tale of a young man discovering his hidden talent while enduring a harrowing maltreatment from his mentor that will leave viewers questioning his actions from start to finish At one point Andrew drums with such endurance to where his hands starts bleeding while Fletcher is busy losing his temper and hurling chairs and instruments at his students Throughout the picture the story vigorously questions the actions of this conductor but never answers That alone makes for an astounding and thought provoking aspect of the story The biggest spark in the picture however is the performance by J K Simmons as Fletcher Channeling R Lee Ermey s Drill Sergeant from Full Metal Jacket Simmons doesn t just play the role he swallows it with immense precision that allows his inspiring yet grueling character burst out of the screen with great versatility It is the kind of performance that simply grabs you by the heart and never lets go Miles Teller on the other hand shines like gold through his incredible drumming skills It is a performance that not only allows him to expand his acting chops but to exercise his musical talent as well Whiplash is an intense powerful and electrifying cinematic endeavor with performances that are simply too difficult to ignore and an inspiring direction by Damien Chazelle that makes for an absorbing directorial debut It is an astounding cinematic achievement that makes for a powerful contender on my list for the top ten films of 2014,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3208826/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2015,What a load of.....,This movie was a terrible unrealistic over the top ridiculous waste of time The only redeeming part was the great orchestral jazz but the characters story and well everything really means this movie should not be getting the positive reviews it has Where in the world would anyone be able to get away with treating students like this It s utterly ridiculous cr and I cannot believe this was even given approval be made in these days of human rights and anti bullying What a disgrace In addition we found the story so predictable it was sort of like a REALLY bad Rocky but based on music except Rocky had heart soul and a relatable endearing underdog story All the characters in this were totally unlikeable unrelatable and awful who cares what happens to any of them All in all this is an over hyped horrible sad attempt at movie making and a great opportunity totally missed,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3284438/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2018,One of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching!,The film is probably best enjoyed by musicians or jazz enthusiasts This is an acquired taste There is no denying JK Simmons gave an Oscar winning performance and yes the editing was Oscar worthy as well But for most parts of the film I can t say it was a pleasure watching this I can still enjoy a bad horror B movie but certainly not this I did not agree with Fletcher s teaching methods as it was total abuse This movie should be used as educational material for methods teachers should NOT use It was disgusting to say the least how he treated and spoke to the youngsters In fact so much so it should be considered a crime There was not a single moment of the film I enjoyed On the contrary this horrible movie is one of the most hated films I ve ever seen Why has it been voted one of the best films ever Note I rated the film 1 10 not because it is a badly made movie It s a very well made movie but I just did not enjoy it at all hence the low rating,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4226853/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2015,All that jazz,For all of its widespread critical acclaim and multiple award nominations and wins I found Damien Chazelle s Whiplash to be a rather thin and clich d regurgitation of the tired Driven artist intense student mentor relationship trope with absolutely nothing fresh to say or offer up I believe its reputation is primarily built upon the strong performances of its two leads Miles Teller and J K Simmons Though both characters are paper thin each actor absolutely inhabits them in a way that adds a dimension that isn t on the page Their impressive performances only make me wish that much more that the material were up to their level,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3224174/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2020,An example of its own doctrine,Whiplash the movie is a perfect example of the artistic idea its story seems to be espousing for its entire length that technique counts for everything and heart and soul count for nothing Any professional musician and I am one will tell you that as far as the study of music goes this is wrongheaded and inaccurate in almost every way Yes hard work is necessary and technical skill is important but that s a given in almost any field However the story depicts almost none of the other most important realities of studying and playing music least of all the JOY of doing it But then this film is really not about the desire to be a musician or an artist of any kind It s about wanting to be perceived as being THE GREATEST In other words it s all about ego how one wishes oneself to be described True artists work at their art because it s what they want to do and they get fulfillment from doing it Whether they are great or simply good can be left to others to decide their focus is on following their passion and developing their voices Good teachers can help them find their path But Fletcher the teacher in this movie is well psychotic really There s no other way to describe his delusional artistic philosophy And there s certainly no way to defend his destructive methods His ludicrous tantrums are supposed to have the effect of inspiring growth but never is he shown actually teaching his students anything All he does is inflict emotional psychological and even physical abuse on them The idea that this guy would last more than a week in any educational institution is absurd Yet it feels like the filmmaker is asking the audience to seriously consider that there may be value in this method But then the writing overall is ultra problematic because it is not rooted in any reality the two principal characters may as well be living on another planet Some of the principal plot points don t make any logical sense at all in the final jazz festival sequence why on earth would Fletcher for his big comeback moment on the NY music scene invite a drummer to come play who has not been practicing with the band and then deliberately set him up to crash and burn To get revenge clearly but all it would really do is make Fletcher and the rest of the band whom Fletcher clearly cares not a whit about look bad J K Simmons is a very accomplished actor but there is nothing to his character beyond his psychosis Simmons gives a performance I felt he could have done in his sleep basically his character from The Closer with a humorectomy Miles Teller is OK as the student but his character is not sympathetic because he never seems to be doing music for the right reason i e A love or passion for it He s doing it to prove himself Most people do not become musicians for that reason And just as Fletcher completely negates the heart and soul of playing music in favor of emphasizing pure technique so does Damien Chazelle avoid exploring the heart and soul of his subject concentrating instead on flashy filmmaking technique Admittedly the technical aspects of Whiplash ARE superb the photography editing and film scoring are all done so well that they almost succeed in distracting from the basic hollowness and dishonesty of the story they are servicing Normally I would give more points for such filmmaking finesse but I feel incredibly offended by such a false portrayal of a life work that I have intimate knowledge of I will grant that all the technical fireworks give the story a degree of drama and excitement but so much of it feels artificially earned A massive demonstration of style over substance Whiplash is at its core meaningless and I can t give it any more than 1 point,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5411729/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2016,Full metal jazz,After all this time I ve finally watched this And yes it reminded me of Full metal jacket part one I guess that Mr Chazelle drew his inspiration from Kubrick and boy did he make it right Direction is perfect including editing fantastic performances by two main characters and fine choice of music Beautiful photography also This movie has everything to make it perfect however Mr Chazelle is not Mr Kubrick but may probably be one day If he tries hard enough to develop his own style Do not give up now that you set the bar so high All my compliments to the crew of this movie Truly a gem Highly recommended,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3461207/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,Powerful performances with intense drama,Having heard of the strong praise about Whiplash since around its release in 2014 but not having being overly intrigued by the picture or having much of an interest overall now watching for the first time Can see as to why this film is as praise and held to such high standards From the great performances by both leads Miles Teller and JK Simmons to the overall plot and script to the music to the directing and the way it s scenes were shot to the build up and tone Whiplash is a one of a kind film This film has a relatively short run time littler over 1 hr 40 mins as it does not drag and every minute is quite engaging This film exceeded expectations and am somewhat disappointed as it took this long to finally getting around to watch it Highly recommend even if you are not a fan of jazz music Whiplash is much more than music as it is about a young mans dream of becoming great,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5903778/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2022,Just my tempo,Whiplash was an emotionally absorbing character study Andrew Miles Teller aspires to be a legendary drummer and Fletcher J K Simmons sees potential in Andrew and gives him a chance in his band The sheer amount of tension between student and instructor throughout this movie is hardcore at times but Fletcher is ultimately trying to maximize Andrew s potential as a musician by any means necessary He makes this philosophy clear several times throughout the film This movie also manages to capture the intricate details of advanced music theory as well as depicting the amount of hours and effort it takes to become an exceptional musician,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8335272/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2015,Flawed and Flashy SPOILERS,What a wooden film As a viewer you cannot really get to know any of these characters Nothing great comes from an abusive teacher Hitting student in the face really No It was unclear what JK Simmons character really was after Was it perfection Is the only way to achieve perfection by humiliating students with verbal and physical abuse The drumming was excellent I m a musician and I ve never heard of students bleeding all over their drums It s ridiculous The only thing JK Simmons character cared about was tempo Talk about unidimensional He crucified students only if they couldn t determine his tempo after a few beats What about dynamics What about interacting with the band The script was superficial and lacking People probably like this film because Simmons was an interesting character and the drumming was interesting You d think such a brilliant teacher would be a more impressive jazz pianist another boring scene,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3177937/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2015,Excellent film,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3230663/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2023,It was so intense that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen,Whiplash is a tale that speaks about perseverance a story that presents itself as an innate character study of those passionate personalities around us who crave nothing but perfection in their craft They stop at nothing in their pursuit of excellence even if it costs them a part of the lives or their life in itself We only see the brilliance on stage or on screen often overlooking the involved artists and their countless sacrifices discrediting the slew of sleepless nights ignorant to their misery and their disturbed conscience Damien Chazelle s Whiplash encapsulates all that and some more It pays tribute to all aspiring and established artists alike the film acknowledges and gives recognition to all those individuals who duly deserve their due respect and I admire Chazelle for that What a fantastic film supported by two of the greatest roles ever enacted Both Miles Teller and J K Simmons have done marvellous especially the latter one who was a force to be reckoned with No wonder he had won an academy award for his part he earned it P S I do not have academic knowledge about Music nor do I have any background in playing any of the instruments shown here But I m an avid listener and I tend to admire Music in every form and shape And I have to say that last piece was something special I was speechless,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9265199/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2019,As an amateur musician...,As an amateur musician I really couldn t enjoy this It is not really about jazz let alone music It s a movie about an abusive teacher and an obsessively self destructive student that uses the world of jazz music as a contrivance Because so few people are familiar with the world of music let along jazz the movie is able to use this contrivance to create drama by divorcing itself from any kind of reality under the pretence of insight This wasn t a music movie it s a sports movie ht Adam Neely It takes the tired sports formula and substitutes football for jazz with such a low level of realism the average person would be able to spot its absurdity from a mile away It s terribly cringy if not downright absurd I doubt many people would rave about a movie about an abusive coach and a football player who is obsessed with a very old deceased football player on a team where no one really loves football no one talks about football and no one care about their team mates and no parent cares if the coach is abusing their kids etc But substitute football for jazz and apparently this movie is critically acclaimed Why There are far better films about abuse education obsession But I guess there are very few films about jazz and so this imposter seems insightful to some Trust me Its not This is depraved absurdist fantasy Why 6 10 Because it is stylish Well enough structured It has one good music scene And it seems to connect with audiences So who am I to judge,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4628137/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2016,I Feel So Small,Never thought I d like this movie Really love the drum playing and actually i was hoping that Andrew would play it one more time at the ending instead he played Caravan This movie also has a great plot twist Wow I should learn human character to anticipate what a person like Fletcher would do when he is felt betrayed He s never be really good to you He would revenge Fletcher is like a male version of Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada only severer Can t imagine if someone suddenly throws hard object at me Having watched this movie got me thinking that I haven t done enough for my dreams I feel so small Somehow I feel Andrew is too obsessed You should see how hard he practices everyday to impress Fletcher yet it s never enough for his meticulous ears Luckily it ends happily so there is good price to his every hard work,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3454332/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2020,Quite perfect,There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job Without a doubt Whiplash is one of the best films of the last decade It not only manages to capture a wide range of audience but also to keep them glued to the screen for about an hour and a half From the first few seconds of the film you can actually already feel part of the story Those seconds with the full black screen and the sound of the drums in the backcround are truly unique and I found them to be mesmerizing Chazelle couldn t have found a better opening sequence I believe This is not really a story about success but a story about a young man trying to pursue his dreams while facing tons of obstacles and I think that each and every single one of us could easily identify in this story as we all try to reach our goals one way or another Miles Teller portrays the young drummer Andrew Neiman who is 19 years old and who just started to study at one of the top universities in the country Teller is amazing in this film as he successfully communicated the many emotions his character had to go through in this picture You could actually feel the pain and the exhaustion while he was playing the drums Then there is absolutely no one else who could have portrayed Fletcher better than the great J K Simmons He took everything to the next level Every single scene he was in was truly flawless and so magnificent Everything about him in this particular film was nothing but perfect from his voice style and language to his way of approaching things He absolutely mastered this role and this is why it is one of the best supprting performances I ve ever seen and I dare to say that it might be one of the best supporting performance there ever was Damien Chazelle has proved once more that he is not only gifted and talented but also very skilled Each scene in this picture was so well directed and shot He put so much passion in this film as he does with everything that it made the audience fall in love with Whiplash His perspective of seeing things and storytelling is simply exquisite The cinematography in this film was absolutely beautiful and it made everything so much better The colors told the story on their own and they played a big part in this film Then the score was nothing but perfect It was the right tempo The film would have been so different without this score and this makes me realize how big of an impact the soundtrack had on me I highly recommend this film as it is one of the greatest pictures of the last century It is filled with amazing performances unique direction and storytelling and it will make you feel so many emotions at once You will feel exhausted overwhelmed excited depressed pleased at the end of the picture and this is one of the reasons this film is so great It takes you through everything you wanna feel while watching a film It will satisfy all your needs as a cinephile and not only You don t have to know or understand music jazz to be a fan of it That s why this is a film for everybody so go and watch it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5885852/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2015,A film about bullying.,I cannot believe that this film has received so many good reviews I cannot believe that this film was Oscar nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year Here s IMDb s synopsis of the film A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student s potential This film however is about a bully music teacher who insults assaults slaps degrades and humiliates his students to death Literally This film is realistic only in the sense that it depicts the catastrophic effects bullying can have on people s well being Everything else in the film would simply not happen Other reviewers with music knowledge have explained why such music institutions and teaching practices and methods are implausible nowadays I am a psychologist and I can verify that bullying will not and cannot motivate a person to become greater Peoples potentials are most likely to be crushed as a consequence of bullying Victims of bullying do not easily overcome or harden up to become better human beings Moreover victims of bullying tend to become bullies themselves later on in life So I would claim that this is a film about the making of a bully I am a big fan on violent films and I have felt emotionally exhilarated completely satisfied after watching films like Oldboy and Sympathy for Mr Lady Vengeance Whiplash left me feeling disgusted wondering about what kind of people made it watched it and enjoyed it,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3192011/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2014,"Big Expectations, Rather A Moderate Impression",I had been waiting for this movie for long time as I am a drummer of sorts myself I like music I like drumming films and this one seemed to be a great achievement After all there are all those raving reviews and blazing cheers made to this spectacular piece of cinematography Well yes I have watched it and what I can say It is very over rated Yes both Simmons and Teller seem to give very impressive performances and yes Teller is A Good drummer with neat stroke precise beat gentle swing and delicate accents But then he does not convince as an actor The love story is the biggest disappointment and the greatest weakness of the film It simply passes by leaving me cold and unaffected Was that dubious drumming achievement worth losing a beautiful girl It was not Simmons is surely the crowning top of the production but then he is too sadistic too dry too pedantic or a jazz aficionado he seems more like a drill sergeant than a genial conductor The final solo To long and too drawn out for a satisfying coda Kinda cool but tiresome and yup dragging It is a film for a single watch and quick oblivion,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3135654/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2020,Whiplash!,I feel like Chazelle should take this film and teach a class Whiplash is a perfectly crafted masterpiece It s trim and lean at 107 minutes and not one of them is wasted The tension is artfully done it grabs hold and never lets go from start to finish JK Simmons is remarkable balancing this complex character with incredible skill It really is exceptional how he manages to be so utterly reprehensible Andy then likable and back again Teller s calm muted performance balances perfectly against it This really is a movie that grabs you and doesn t let go There are so many points where the tension is so strong that it takes your breath away This really is a perfect movie not a shot wasted not one misstep An absolute recommend to anyone that hasn t seen it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6133131/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2015,Back to Film School,Right off the bat you ll want to know this isn t a typical Hollywood story The writer must have skipped day one of Screen writing 101 as he forgot to include a likable main character From the first moment the teacher is introduced you ll quickly develop zero sympathy for him Less than zero perhaps He is after all the antagonist So far so good In my ignorant and ill informed opinion the main problem with the movie is the student s character We ve already got a clearly defined villain so how about somebody to root for He seems to start out that way but slowly he morphs into a borderline bad guy as if under the spell of his mentor After a while one s only interest in the student is to hope for him to break free of his psychotic teacher A day after seeing this movie it s hard to believe it was nominated for an Oscar From a technical standpoint it was well made and featured good acting but the story itself was somewhat off putting I m a big fan of J K Simmons but his character was so abrasive I actually started looking forward to the scenes without him Maybe it was the screenwriter s intent to make us feel uncomfortable If so he succeeded Sadly though I can t say my life is any richer having seen this,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3214206/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2015,"A musical thriller. Intense,vicious and cruel. But with damn lot of rhythm in it.",The truth is Andrew I never really had a Charlie Parker But I tried I actually f cking tried Whiplash You could think that this film tells the story of a drummer the movie poster is a bit of a spoiler when it comes to this who has suffered this injury by violently playing his instrument Or he lost control of his car while drumming rhythmically on the steering wheel and crashed into the car driving in front of him You could link the movie title to these assumptions because the arrangements that Andrew Miles Teller has to play in this masterful and highly rhythmic film may result in a neck injury And when it comes to losing that control well then you should go and watch the movie to find out yourself Anyway the film title refers to a song written by the American jazz composer Hank Levy The central theme of the film is about the influence you can have on someone and drive that person to exceed certain inhuman limits of his own ability Now for me you re already a top musician when you know the complete arrangement of Whiplash and Caravan written by Duke Ellington by heart Even if there s a little mistake here and there or you are little bit offbeat eventually I will have a boundless admiration for the musician after completing such a superhuman performance I ve never had such a desire to pull someone through the screen and then smack a huge cymbal against his face as now with the presumably extremely talented music teacher Fletcher brilliantly played by JK Simmons A man who lives for his music and has a huge passion for it It s a bit exaggerated that passion though Exaggerated to such extent that it exceeds the limit of human dignity and by his passion for creating a perfect musician his way of teaching tends to be sadomasochistic A kind of militaristic attitude towards his traumatized and frightened students who are wary of any unexpected outburst A disrespectful howler suitable as drill sergeant in the US Army and first class bully who suddenly swings around music stands slaps his students in the face and throws out a member of his orchestra just because he plays a bit out of tune Afterwards the accused doesn t appear to be the culprit but he s just thrown out of the classroom because he didn t know he wasn t the one playing out of tune A worse stain on the reputation of a professional musician according to Fletcher That s also what Andrew an ordinary American teenager who studies at the Shaffer conservatory and whose only envisioned aim is to be the best jazz drummer ever undergoes The moment he s being asked to join Fletcher s school orchestra which only consists of a select group of musicians it becomes the best day of his life His confidence gets such a boost that he even overcomes his shyness and dares to ask a girl who works at the cinema on a date That it s subsequently leading to a veritable psychological warfare goes beyond his wildest dream Gradually the terror policy of Fletcher drives him to the utmost to meet Fletcher s expectations Even his relationship with Nicole Melissa Benoist is terminated abruptly by him The love for music is displaced by a bloody battle for a wanted spot in the orchestra The obsessional takes the upper hand tending towards self destruction I m not exactly an expert myself when it s about jazz And I ve read reviews where it s suggested that the essence of jazz is completely misrepresented here The idea about jazz in this movie is brought in a grotesque way and looks like a ridiculous caricature The whole history about Charlie Parker and the anecdote Fletcher tells every time apparently isn t exactly true at all Could be but for me the jazz section wasn t of essence in the story It s the emotional and physical brutality that Fletcher uses to bring students to a higher level In this way Fletcher tries to create HIS Charlie Parker The whole movie does follow the rhythm of the used music uplifting rhythmic and intense Only the end was predictable and presented us of course the well known rule that the oppressed kicks the oppressor s ass again Actually I hoped Andrew would put his drumsticks there where the sun doesn t shine at Fletcher The performances of Teller and Simmons are obviously extremely stunning It took me a while before I realized that I ve seen Teller in That awkward moment A movie I wanted to forget about as soon as possible Here however I thought he was brilliant And apparently he s an avid drummer and he did all the drumming himself Hats off and respect But the most brilliant achievement was undoubtedly that of Simmons What a great character sketch with lots of charisma A character that scares you Someone you start to hate thoroughly after a while But in the end I understood a bit what drove him to this behavior He won an Oscar for this role and in my opinion well deserved An energetic musical thriller with a fairly predictable outcome and which is so extremely rhythmic you can t sit still Highly recommended More reviews at opinion as a moviefreak blogspot be,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3197321/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2019,Miles Davis would have hated this movie,This movie is as every one of the actual musicians here has noted completely devoid of the reality and more importantly of the JOY of being a musician The teacher s ludicrous verbal abuse which fluctuates between politically incorrect and downright cruel is so unrealistic and anachronistic in a portrayal of 21st century educational life that I found it unwatchable Simmons character slaps a student repeatedly across the face with no one gasping or saying a word about it which had me rolling my eyes it was like they were saying 1950s movie dialogue about how dames are dumb and can t drive or something I was offended but I also kind of felt sorry for all involved it was so dumb Beyond insulting my sensibilities as a human it also insulted me as a musician an artist No credible teacher of art or music would think such negative extremes produce genius or even fine musicians Discipline is crucial to becoming great but so is flow listening and the creativity the truly exceptional experience when in the zone playing music with other people This film gives zero sense of why anyone would actually want to become Charlie Parker I mean does that mean famous Parker was an innovator a physicist of sound not just some automaton who could play a million notes as fast as possible It s like this movie was made by people who absolutely don t get why Coltrane makes you feel like you re inside the moon and why a Duke Ellington tune can float you away on the river of your own blood flowing in your veins Miles Davis was famous for being able to encourage his bands to elevate their playing I heard Herbie Hancock say that one time when he was blocked on a part Davis just listened and calmly said put a B in the bass And everything flowed No screaming throwing ssh lery but something more masterful a finely tuned artist committed to creating greatness communicating via his mastery of the mysterious infinite language of music and a deep respect for the people helping him create it A wasted opportunity to speak to the madness of wanting to be great to achieve and also a waste of the dynamic and always fun to watch J K Simmons Watch him in his series Counterpart instead in a part that displays all his swagger but also the sweetness and humour he mixes in so well,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4556266/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,"Great performances, but problematic",There s undeniably a great performance by J K Simmons here and this is a film that had me riveted from beginning to end but I shudder at its message The fact is you don t need to be an abusive homophobic racist a hole and drive those you re teaching to the edge of the abyss to elicit greatness There are plenty of examples in the world of sports that bear that out e g John Wooden Bill Walsh Joe Torre and Steve Kerr That s been my experience in other realms as well like teaching and the workplace and I m sure that in the world of music it s the same The damage caused to kids by this kind of person a hard a wannabe who is really nothing more than a bully is incalculable and the film doesn t do justice to that aspect The fact that this kid Miles Teller gets redemption is wonderful that Simmons s character does is not in fact it s more than a little disturbing The abuser gets to explain himself show that he s really not such a bad guy and in the end triumph How much better would this have been had the kid found a genuine connection to music or his path in life after getting out of that abusive relationship and we had seen the teacher living in ignominy Also since when is jazz about ratcheting up speed to the point of bleeding all over the instrument Great performances here but a seriously flawed script especially in its second half when it could have done something meaningful,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8568686/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2021,Very intense,The movie is about an inspiring drummer who tries his utmost to impress the top instructor in his school After showing him his determination and dedication to his art he gets promoted to be the head drummer in his orchestra but the teachers ruthless methods and constant search for perfection takes his toll The movie is original and very intense from beginning to end The drumming from Miles Teller is superb but it s J K Simmons nasty methods that is impressive The storyline is quite basic and it seemed really short for some unknown reason but it s very entertaining and it got the recognition that it deserved If you re not into drumming or jazz music the relationship between the teacher and student is worth a watch because it shows how far a person will go to achieve perfection Very enjoyable,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7162066/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2021,Whip Crack Away!,I could really appreciate the artistic passion and musicality of this film although just watching what Neiman goes through made me pretty tense The idea of the film is great sort of like a very extreme Glee or Fame but I think that it is actually a bit too extreme Their are times where I feel that Fletcher should have seen what he was doing and laid off a bit His behaviour was so abhorrent even without these moments that his teaching practices should have been called in to question anyway It would have worked better then because that is where it became unbelievable in my eyes I m sure that there are many teachers of a similar ilk out there but I m not convinced that they would ever get away with that abuse for so long A tamer version could work really well and might actually resemble an episode of Glee or Fame but I don t think it would need to be dumber down too much and could really get the point across without giving the audience anxiety on Neiman s behalf The actors all do a very good job J K Simmons is the obvious stand out performer but Miles Teller puts in a lot of hard work too I like the lighting of the film I think the darkness references the hard times for Neiman and the Jazz music is just superb It s an odd one because in some weird way I did enjoy it but it was hard to digest at the same time,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6738788/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2023,"Intense movie about music, incredible editing and well paced story.",Whiplash is first of all a movie about what you are willing to sacrifice in order to be the next big musical sensation Professor Fletcher is a music director in one of the best conservatories of the USA and he always pushes his students beyond their limits because he is seeking for the next big talent and he sees a lot of potential in Andrew This young 19 years old guy squeezes himself to the point where becoming the most talented drummer becomes his only obsession He will throw away everything else The film is very intense and scenes that could be dull and boring are so interesting thanks to the incredible fast paced editing with quick cuts and camera movements The music is always synchronized with the images creating an amazing harmony The dialogues are so intense Miles Teller and J K Simmons were in perfect symbiosis and they pulled out an incredible performance There is such a harsh and bitter development regarding the student teacher relationship The audience can hardly catch a breath and I think that in this case it is a positive element because it highlights the intensity of the musical performances and all the hardship that the musicians need to endure during classes However at times the character of Fletcher was too much I would prefer that in some sequences he was toned down just a bit As a music lover I genuinely appreciated this Damien Chazelle work He is clearly very talented when it comes to movies that have to do with music La La Land is one of my favorite musicals of all time The sound design is well done and this production deserves every single prize that it won For me this is an 8 stars out of 10 and I definitely recommend it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9270653/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2018,A study in bullying and acceptance thereof: drummer's blood,Simmons may have picked up a supporting actor Oscar for this performance and he may have deserved in comparison with the rest of competitors for that award in 2014 but it has to be said that he is a repulsive and manipulative bully and that his character is no example to anybody quite the contrary In fact his eagerness to label others with derogatory and even insulting adjectives quickly becomes difficult to watch If that is what is required for the human being to exceed his limitations be it in music sport art or any other field then this is out and out human rights violation and I would rather live with a bit more mediocrity Tellers tries his best in a difficult part but the very ambiguity at the heart of his character s nature in turns accepting and rejecting Simmons bullying detracts from the spectator s sympathy His search for personal greatness as a drummer at the expense of love and family is a welcome warning to anyone thinking of following that path And then I have a real problem accepting that Charlie Parker was the greatest musician of the 20th Century as the central characters claim and I do not care for the final rendition of Caravan a wonderful piece of music that the two of them Simmons unwillingly at first then encouragingly turn into a near solo drummer show The unremittingly bleak photography and atmosphere the characters apparent failure to learn and become better human beings and the director s emphasis on highlighting meanness and the absence of redemption with his chiaroscuro backgrounds all made for an unpleasant movie experience for me,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4414898/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,Whiplash,A great movie that I really enjoyed watching a great story and a greater message the acting is great from Miles Teller who performed his role perfectly but the best actor in the film was JK Simmons who presented his role in a great way gave an unforgettable performance and deserved an Academy Award for his role in the film And the film s music was wonderful and I enjoyed it very much while watching it the end of the film was wonderful I recommend watching it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6825038/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2019,"Absolutely grotesque, distasteful, disturbing, perverse, sickening.",This film is completely overrated Having seen the other wonderful films from Damien Chazelle La La Land and First Man I thought Wiplash would be also a good one What a mistake what a waste of time and money Is this film trying to prove that without the most absurd pushing abuse and bullying no great artist is possible Absolutely grotesque distasteful disturbing perverse sickening,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5249974/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2015,"Brutal, unrealistic Hollywood garbage",I m giving Whiplash a one star rating to compensate for all the rave reviews it has gotten from people who obviously know nothing about about how music is made and what goes into great performances Almost the whole film is about the relationship between a talented teen drummer played by Miles Teller and a teacher played by JK Simmons who directs jazz in a top music school The JK Simmons role is a sick meld of an evil Nazi from WWII a brutal drill sergeant and a father who is both physically and mentally abusive His head is shaved he wears a black muscle shirt almost continually in the movie he screams at his students uses language that makes George Carlin seem like Mr Rogers throws chairs and finally slaps the Teller character in the face repeatedly I don t think there is a minority group he does not insult repeatedly with just about the worst four letter trash talk imaginable The fact that the acting is impressive can t save this film The script is terrible And it does a disservice to music education in a time when support for the arts is already struggling Worst of all the film misrepresents everything that is real in both music and music education Anyone seeing this film and thinking of going into a music program for the first time would be so turned off The film is about mind rape It is about the worst kind of damage one human can inflict on another in the name of teaching without leaving a great deal of physical damage It has nothing to do with music or creativity or teaching It is Hollywood at its worse There are some abusive musical directors who have way too much power but this fictional character would not last one week in any music school One student would simply turn on an I pad record what goes on then pass it around The teacher would be out of a job and most likely in jail One reviewer called it a steaming pile of excrement Apt words,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3198014/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2020,A modern day masterpiece,Damien Chazelle has proven himself to be one of the best directors right now La La Land is one of the best musicals made but I discovered him through Whiplash which I consider to be a modern day masterpiece Whiplash follows Andrew Neiman a young drummer who enrolls in a class at a music conservatory led by the frightening and abusive Fletcher who stops at nothing to make sure his students are the best they can be I remember how amazed I was after watching this film the first time and after multiple viewings Whiplash became one of my favourite films of all time It s such a simple story but at the same time there are many layers to it After each watch I discovered details I had missed that brought so much development to the characters whether it was something shown through the visuals or subtlety in some dialogues it shows how great of a storyteller Damien Chazelle is I didn t think much of Miles Teller before I saw this film but he shows how great of an actor he I really felt the passion and drive he had to become one of the greatest drummers and the emotional range he gives Neiman is brilliant However the main attraction is J K Simmons in his best performance to date I didn t believe for one second I was watching J K Simmons play Fletcher He fully transformed himself into Fletcher and conveyed the angry abusive and unforgiving nature of Fletcher perfectly allowing each scene to be as intense as possible He fully deserves the Oscar for this movie Chazelle s script is excellent It s bursting with fiery dialogues and creative insults that J K Simmons elevates with his striking performance whilst also fleshing these characters out and helping us get inside their mind and understand what they re going through and why they re doing what they re doing With a runtime of 1 hour 40 minutes Whiplash wastes no time The intensity is consistent throughout leaving us with barely any room to breathe and that s also thanks to the crisp editing by Tom Cross Chazelle directs each scene with utmost confidence and ends the film with one of the most tense and entertaining finales to ever exist Everything about Whiplash is incredible The captivating story the marvellous acting the immaculate editing and confident directing all combine to make one of the greatest films of the 21st Century,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6383567/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2016,"Sound, rapturous, addictive.",Frantic this is Whiplash is amazing how Damien Chazelle shows the obsession of Andrew Neyman Miles Teller no mellhor style Darren Aronofsky the sound mixing in this movie is something great camera angles dry cuts are phenomenal the JK Simmons acting is maginifica It s really cool how the film rehearses develop a more loving relationship with my boyfriend and the father the more he does he focuses on the main drama that not the protagonist that s fantastic Whiplash is a film that has to be seen final scene is something surreal spectacular all of it is amazing in the end you already practically inside the screen you re already hitting on her knees playing together The script is simple because he does not require much Whiplash is amazing,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3512659/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2015,The Consequence of Ambition,Chazelle delicately directs the film to have that sense of crisp and sound one that s quite hard to find nowadays He magically transforms violent and abusive scenes into something extremely watchable without dismissing pity There is never a camera angle that is out of place no wasted detail in its frames This is one film that can teach LES MISERABLES 2012 Director Tom Hooper how to effectively use extreme close ups without having to waste pure emotions and sheer talent WHIPLASH presents a decent yet violent argument that exalts the student and polarizes the discipline This is a story where the teacher simply becomes the tool to the artist s journey to becoming what he really is Or may be not At some point the teacher becomes a separate entity in the learning experience At some point the teacher has ambitions of his own far detached from what his own learners think and dream At some point the teacher finds his learners as his competitors in the race to greatness It s an absurd tragedy though still arguably triumphant on its own What WHIPLASH argues is that beyond learning lies a greater and more painful path to ambition and to get there one does not need anyone but himself It is a story that challenges the collaborative norm in education It is an anti social thesis on refinement and discipline yet it is still something worth looking into It does not give you that moral lesson that you are waiting for Amidst the loud energetic sounds of Andrew s sweaty bloody jazz drum set it whispers to you that the road to glory is made of brimstones from hell,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3170853/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2016,Sadistic movie leaves confused feelings afterwards,I knew from the trailer that the movie wouldn t be a nice movie leaving you with some happiness afterwards However I ve seen most other movies that has come out lately so I had nothing else to watch and gave it a chance I very rarely write reviews and usually just rate the movie however this movie is so sadistic that it needs to be reviewed for other peoples safety First of all I used to be a drummer myself The quality of the drumming and choice of music is fantastic The actors are doing great except that the attention was towards the two main characters the whole movie This gave the feeling that all the other characters were just put there to help show the personality of the two main characters The drummer is an insecure self centered teenager seeking for glory and the mentor is an sadistic bullying psychopathic conductor justifying his methods with that they give result The student struggles getting recognized by the conductor but somehow finds his glory and happy ending I worry about the students future in this fictional world He will probably kill himself in a couple of years as an another student of this conductor did This movie didn t leave me either happy relieved inspired or anything similar If you wish to not feel good afterwards its an excellent movie for you I worry people think bullying people into success is justified if it gives results since people made such positive reviews It saddens me people like and supports movies which glorify bullying I hope this review gives another perspective to the movie since most reviews were very positive,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3413655/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2022,Good cautionary tale about extreme teaching,I first learned about Whiplash in college from my teacher who saw something either educational or inspirational about the film I put off watching the movie until eight years later I think I would hesitate to take inspiration from the film However having seen it I think one might safely draw a lesson from both student and teacher here The lesson I take is there is a problem with the idea of pushing oneself beyond one s limits just as there is a problem with not pushing enough In this day and age the problem is likelier to be students aren t pushed enough however the teacher s extreme actions in this movie is clearly not to be romanticized in the way that it seems it has been by reviews here I would say that this movie isn t about passion so much as it is about ambition The teacher wants to teach ambition focus and drive with the assumption that his extreme teaching methods will eventually sort the wheat from the chaff until he finds his next Charlie Parker who would never get discouraged no matter how many cymbals were thrown at his head It s a thinking model that allows the teacher to think very little or most or all of his students with the justification that his teaching methods would be necessary for that one legendary student that he may never actually meet An example of black and white thinking if there ever is one,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8579854/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2015,A violent harmony of visual and audio,Whiplash as the name suggests packs a serious punch There hasn t been a musical movie or any movie for that matter that gives such intense human relationship The film brings a rich drama performed by engaging actors it is crude in its nature but also possesses classy rhythm Its mix of true to live cinematography and brilliantly pace musical score is edited so well audience can t help to be drawn to its excellent tension Andrew Nieman Milles Teller is a drummer and student in one of the best music schools He s recruited by Terrence Fletcher J K Simmons a well known teacher who s searching for a new musician to join his band Nieman is a very dedicated young man he strives to win Fletcher s approval but little did he know that Fletcher s method of teaching is rather unorthodox The way Fletcher motivates his students is with a lot of profanities overly honest assessment and borderline abusive behavior Lots of stick with barely any carrot The two are embroiled in an odd relationship and both leads perform magnificently Milles Teller represents the youthful ambitious character with hidden aggressive poise Whereas Simmons as Fletcher is brilliantly antagonistic he s a mentor but often time he resembles a manipulative enemy From his body language and yell Simmons is too convincing it could be unnerving at times in the best possible way If he had the opportunity like this in old Spider Man movies as he portrayed the pushy editor they would have been truly amazing Camera work captures the flow meticulously and mostly in close up it often pans back or slowly approaches the scene allowing the audience to have a sense of the setting However when the music hits it goes into high gears Switching back and forth between the plowing of the drum characters subtle expressions or winces down to the blood and sweat The film s editing is wonderfully fitting each frame is also accompanied by a spirited explosion of instruments It s powerful inevitably engrossingly Whiplash is a monster of a movie never skipping a beat Rude brash but stylishly captivating,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3189960/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2015,An Emotional Punch to the Gut,A promising young drummer Miles Teller enrolls at a cut throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor J K Simmons who will stop at nothing to realize a student s potential This film will take people by surprise Few viewers likely care about drumming or jazz music today And they may think this film therefore will have no bearing on them But it is so much more than that an emotional punch to the gut that hits hard Holding this together is the interaction of Miles Teller who seems to be getting less credit than he deserves and J K Simmons who is getting the praise he ought to be So intense and quite the power struggle Some have disliked the film for its message But do they really know what its message is,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3176363/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2023,Cinema Personified: Brilliant Movie,Rating 9 7 Overall one of if not the best movies to show the obsession of an artist that wants to make it to the top stopping at nothing to get there as they are pushed past their mental breaking point to achieve their goal Incredible Direction Very Good to Great Acting Great from Miles Teller Brilliant from J K Simmons Good from the rest of the cast Brilliant Story Brilliant Screenplay Incredible Score Great Cinematography Brilliant use of lighting to establish mood and themes Incredible Editing Pacing is Great to Incredible as it gives it a very artsy feel that slowly builds to a brilliant climax climax is brilliant as it is filled with symbolism till the very last shot as JKs mouth is covered showing his recognition is all that Andrew needed to think he is one of the greats,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9117606/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,Masterpiece,I don t know anything about music but what I do know is that this is one of the best movies of all time J K Simmons commands every single scene he s in when he enters the room I feel genuine fear But the best part is that throughout the movie you can genuinely sympathize with him and understand him and your opinion on him shifts throughout the whole movie A similar thing happens with Miles Teller s character as he tries to achieve greatness stopping at nothing In the end the finale brings everything together in such an incredible way and it is hard to describe how incredible it is This is a must see movie and you don t even need to like jazz to enjoy it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8319373/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2016,Jazz is not pretty,Whiplash is the story of two men One is a young music conservatory student determined to be as good as his idol Buddy Rich on drums So single minded is he in this pursuit that he largely ignores other aspects of a normal well adjusted life including personal relationships The other primary character J K Simmons in a career defining role is the most hard ass music instructor ever He curses cajoles intimidates and physically assaults his students buffered by the philosophy that if he does not they will never achieve greatness Neither lead character will yield and from that premise and tension flows the drama and some incredible jazz music,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3455265/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2015,A Disturbing Film--And a Masterpiece?,On the front end of this review let me note that as a rule I try to never write spoilers and this review certainly will not be that but as the review goes on I will be commenting on where the film goes in a general sense at its conclusion You ve been warned That said Whiplash is one of the more challenging films that I ve written about since I started the practice of writing a review here each time I watch a movie It s hard to put into words how I feel about this film It s disturbing hard to watch and puts its audience through a type of mental stress that eclipses most horror movies or suspense films It s a story that is almost impossible to like and as such it s very hard to say that I liked this film And yet by the same token it was an amazing piece of art The movie is thoroughly well made well produced well acted and well scripted It s essentially a brilliant train wreck of movie it hurts to look but it s nevertheless captivating In that regard the movie is well worth the watch Now let s talk about the plot itself It s no spoiler at all to say that the movie revolves around an abusive student teacher relationship and more to the point it features an abusive college professor who has let authority go to his head that much you can get just from watching the film s trailer The film features a young drummer Miles Teller who has enrolled as a freshman at a well to do music school who then sets out to join the school s studio band We quickly learn that the band leader Terrence Fletcher played by J K Simmons J Jonah Jameson from the Spider Man movies is an egomaniac who likes to scream at students curse profusely and even throw things in the middle of rehearsal Fletcher takes on the young drummer and sets out to motivate him through the most inhumane of mentally abusive instruction conceivable I might note that Simmons earned the 2015 Academy Ward for Best Supporting Actor for this role and that award was well deserved Simmons truly makes the movie which is a strange thing to applaud someone for given that you can t watch this film without coming to hate his character Nevertheless the performance deserves strong praise and its easy to see how and why the Oscar came his way for this movie Still the film is a bizarre amalgam of emotional abuse both of its characters and of its audience at one point my girlfriend wanted to turn the movie off altogether but we made it through and brilliant film making Dr Fletcher becomes every much as devilish as any villain in any horror or suspense film all while the movie makes the viewer empathetic and invested in its characters Now for the slight spoiler which is unavoidable if I m to offer my biggest criticism of the film The big problem with this movie is that its conclusion leaves the audience wondering if Dr Fletcher s instructional tactics were perhaps well founded inasmuch as the film ends with its main character Teller accomplishing a tremendous musical feat that appears to be the product of his being pushed so hard by his tormentor This being the case one cannot watch the film without wondering what the message is supposed to be Is this a movie that is promoting emotional abuse Is it promoting bullying Does the film essentially endorse the bizarre abuse of power that its main antagonist personifies throughout the film While any of these criticisms may be slightly overdone it s nevertheless true that the awkward ending to the film is troubling And yet in spite of all of the above the film nevertheless is powerful if for no other reason than that it leaves such a powerful impression on its audience What exactly is being communicated in this film is sure to be a topic of much discussion but what s for sure is that the movie will captivate you even if that captivation may prove to be uncomfortable That said I wrestled with whether to rate this movie an 8 or a 9 It s extremely well made and powerful yet its also a film that s just hard to enjoy in spite of itself Thus my 8 Still I can see how many will watch this film and immediately label it a classic if not a masterpiece It s great cinema just be prepared to be uneasy during and after the movie Thus my 8 stars,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3228086/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2014,Fantastic,A musical thriller This one s hard to categorize One might say it s the exact opposite of an inspirational teacher movie like Goodbye Mr Chips Miles Teller plays an eager drumming student at a music conservatory He captures the attention of the head honcho of the school s peak band crew J K Simmons A normal person would wish they hadn t because the guy s a total psycho One wrong note or beat and the guy ll be roaring every curse word in the book at you He s a legend though so no one would ever dare stand up to him Teller is not a normal person his dream is to be one of the best of all time so he tries his damnedest to take Simmons rage in stride It s not easy This film is simply gripping Teller is amazingly focused One ought not to disregard his physical performance either While the editing probably helped him survive this he really is going to town on those drums Simmons gives a performance for the ages I wanted to murder this dude As a supporting character the film doesn t get too deeply into what his deal is but the little bits that are shown are fascinating The finale is absolutely outstanding One of the year s best no doubt,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3125464/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2021,"Tense but powerful, brought to life by fantastic performances",Whiplash calls into question how much humanity is worth sacrificing in the pursuit of excellence Jazz drumming is a metaphor for any time you ve ever tried to better yourself and life kept looking you square in the eye and saying not my tempo JK Simmons is outstanding his bi polar performance makes him perfectly detestable while still maintaining the humanity to rationalize his extreme behaviour It may all be an exaggeration of reality but the feelings it portrays are universally relatable,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7032752/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2021,Am I the only one of a few who hated this film?,Whiplash makes for uneasy and disturbing viewing We have a film about a young and talented musician Miles Teller whose desire to reach the top of his potential will be exploited by a sadistic teacher and leader of a college jazz orchestra played by JK Simmons There is no fun in this film at all and I am alarmed by its popularity The film Whiplash cuts its mark from the very expressive title of its namesake but it should really be about the beautiful assembly of an orchestra that will struggle and strive to make great music The film is not like this at all It is solely about exploitation in the hands of a diabolical monster in which he pursues his own egoistical fantasy in a devils desire to achieve perfection In his own way there seems to be no limit of what can be achieved in my mind it is madness It is very sad to have a wonderful story of music to be exploited in this way It is a corrosive abuse to exploit the audience in this style of punk filming The film breaks all channels of continuity without good reason With regard to the films reference to Charlie Parker he was great musician but his life was tragically fused and driven by drugs he died relatively young from his abuse of drug taking and the doctor at the coroner s inquest remarked that he mistakenly thought he was an old man on examining him initially Although there is sharp and brilliant exchange of dialogue coming from the orchestral leader and we might think he is a brilliant teacher of genius mind but the level of exploitation and abuse exceeds to bad taste It is also insulting to expect the audience to believe that a young student would sacrifice a darling romance to lose his girlfriend for the sake of dedicating his music practice to the point of oblivion Hash words for those who loved the film but this is my point of view of an intolerable teacher who belittles the value and benefits of music The film may invigorate for some but not for me if you don t mind Yes although the film electrifies intensity in this manner of fear and highbrow bulling and I do applaud great acting all round it never stops and then seems to end on an easy high notation from a lazy script as if everything was alright in the first place The film would have benefited so much better if the story were treated as a spoof with light humour with the teacher as a crank It is totally unnecessary in its portrayal of exploitation of viciousness I was not having a bad day just experiencing a nightmare from the film that I will never watch again Directed by Damien Chazelle La La Land,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6758995/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2015,'I was there to push people beyond what's expected of them. I believe that's an absolute necessity',Damien Chazelle both wrote and directed WHIPLASH and his film won three Oscars and a lot of fans It is s difficult film to watch on DVD the small screen acts life a loaded rifle timed at your head and blasting your eardrums with both jazz and the raunchiest dialogue around It I basically a two actor show with some incidental and rather meaningless bit parts tossed in to try to offer a bit of emotional resting during this madhouse of a film Andrew Miles Teller is a young and talented drummer attending a prestigious cut throat music academy in New York who comes under the wing of the most respected professor at the school one Fletcher J K Simmons who does not hold back on abuse towards his students The two form an odd relationship as Andrew drams of greatness and Fletcher we finally discover at the end of the film will stop at nothing to realize a student s potential Both actors offer top performance as do the bit part player Paul Reiser as Andrew s father and Melissa Benoist as Nicole Andrew s minor infatuation but the film for the most part is a barrage of gross desultory and demeaning filth that pours out of J K Simmons Shar Pei face and mouth Vicious cruel demeaning he finally gets his due in part because Andrew is talked into reporting Fletcher s behavior when an incident happens with a fellow student The last moments of the film make the first long one note song payoff Fletcher s drive is intrinsically a desire to make his students be the best they can be But oh before that it gets old rather quickly,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3198442/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2016,Must Watch,Whiplash is a beautiful movie that shows perception and expectations of a young drummer and an experienced band teacher who is short tempered and very strict Movie is boring in starting but last half hour was amazing JK Simmons was amazing as a Band teacher and he really deserves that Oscar for best supporting actor in a Supporting Role Other cast was also nice Watch this movie if you want to fulfill your dreams no matter how much hurdles are there in your life My recommendation is that don t watch this movie with higher expectations Overall I give this movie 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3467492/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2015,"Simplistic, Predictable... Well Acted, Good Music",It s not as boring as 50 Shades of Grey but it s just about as simplistic There are two characters plus a couple of others are hinted at with several seconds of screen time I loved the music The acting was good but the roles were not especially nuanced The main problem is that within the first couple of minutes of the film you know Andrew s goal to be an elite drummer Great You also realize that his instructor is complete jerk or worse and is going to challenge Andrew So for the rest of the movie all we have to wonder about is whether he ll end up overcoming the challenge and being a good drummer or whether he ll give up It kept my attention but I would never watch this movie a second time There just wasn t enough substance to it There was no nuance There was nothing more to think about The pseudo philosophical pop psychological discussion in the movie about whether abusive treatment by a teacher is justifiable by the potential for producing greatness are just pathetic and empty There are some shades of side story There s a paper thin character of a girlfriend She only exists to make us believe that Andrew might be giving something up by pursuing his goal but since Andrew isn t likable at all I didn t really care if he ended up with her Anyway the movie wasn t really a 1 star I give it a solid 6 5 but since it s been voted so high here on IMDb I m just trying to bring it down into the realm of reality,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3211606/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2015,An intense and ambitious music story!,Whiplash is definitely Oscar material a story about music conservatory student Andrew Neimann Miles Teller who aspires to be one of the greatest drummers His goals are tested by music instructor Terrance Fletcher J K Simmons who will go at the most intense lengths to realize a student s potential The film picks up speed immediately where Fletcher sees Andrew practicing the drums cynically asking him why he stopped when he walked into the room It then takes you to non stop suspense of Andrew ending up enrolling in Fletcher s band class where he witnesses Fletcher s intense and abusive methods from swearing shouting at students to throwing music stands around of teaching and where he goes through highs and lows to try to meet Fletcher s high standards of becoming the greatest drummer This will make you become engaged to the film s plot as you try to find out if Andrew will ever meet his potential through Fletcher s eyes Damien Chazelle did an outstanding job writing the script and directing the film providing us with an intense and awe inspiring plot and a well acted cast of characters J T Simmons did a spectacular job in his role as Fletcher definitely worthy of his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win and Miles Teller did a great job in his Andrew role ambitious and energetic I enjoyed watching the love hate student teacher relationship between them and also thought the father son relationship between Andrew and his dad Jim Paul Reiser was heartwarming I took music lessons throughout my kid teenage years and this film does take me back to those days of music practicing rhythm and getting the notes in tune I m just glad my teachers weren t as intense or strict as Fletcher was Overall it s one of the best dramas I ve seen and is highly recommended Grade A,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3193443/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2015,Extremely Overrated - all-around horrible,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3200226/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2015,"Fake, fake, fake",My contrary reaction to the phony film WHIPLASH 1 Fake jazz Jazz is the vehicle to tell this story but what we get is not jazz but rather the academic teaching of big band orchestral music emphasizing arrangements and perfecting the technique of one s instrument Same film could have been better scripted about a classical symphony orchestra at a university Jazz is about improvisation and the interplay between musicians as seen in a small group context Big bands as seen here are more evident nowadays at sporting events The only solo was the hero s mediocre drum solo at film s end 2 Fake theme ending Theme of the movie is the importance of motivation rigor to promote excellence in the context of a student and the pitfalls of the martinet In movies for audience manipulation and dramatic purposes a theme is often betrayed at the end most famous case being Alec Guinness s sudden reversal at the climax of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI because an audience expects the damn bridge to be blown up even though his character spent the previous 2 hours with every fiber of his being symbolically building it In WHIPLASH the finale contradicts everything previously in the script not to be even handed but to falsely convey a message that maybe true artistry and achievement stems from the horrible inspiration we ve witnessed Totally bogus and phony 3 Fake characters Given jazz s history the two major characters protagonist and antagonist should have been Black The filmmakers have every right to make them whatever they want perhaps a female teacher and a girl drummer would have been interesting but that also would not have fit the use of jazz as movie s central core My reaction to the whitened up story was the same reaction as I would have to a 50s movie biography of Fats Domino played by Pat Boone whose early career was essentially spurred by the industry and specifically his record label customarily ripping of a Black artist Fats with a white artist Pat singing his songs for a general audience Same crappy approach here 4 Fake gimmicks Many gimmick scenes in WHIPLASH would have been blue penciled and not made it into the final script had this been a TV episode rather than an independent anything goes feature film the writers room would not have permitted them to slip through Most notable is the hero s car accident and arriving late and bloody to unsuccessfully try and perform at the big concert contest when the band s other drummer was perfectly capable of going on in his stead Not merely unbelievable but farcical as directed here Final reel of him conned into appearing with no charts for songs he had never seen or heard before was an asinine gimmick almost as stupid as him returning to suddenly lead the orchestra himself all for fake dramatic purposes And maybe even worse the scene that made me want to leave the screening his blow off of his girl friend telling her his need to practice and succeed would not leave enough time for their relationship to continue That must have looked bad on the page and it didn t play at all on the screen 5 Fake performance I have praised J K Simmons many times and you can read my rave review for him on IMDb for his role in the obscure comedy NEW IN TOWN But his facile surface performance here is just the kind that wins awards it surely did but pales into comparison to many others playing essentially the same role I will merely cite Robert Duvall in THE GREAT SANTINI or Lou Gossett Jr in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN as the most vivid in recent memory I found his playing closer to the psychotic of Humphrey Bogart in THE CAINE MUTINY than to what the role called for 6 Fake icon Buddy Rich is elevated to god like status in WHIPLASH a reactionary and outdated concept that I reject entirely In show biz history I would nominate Rich for iconic status as a jerk not a musical artist In jazz history the logical icon and role model here would be Art Blakey since not only is his importance in modern post WWII jazz secure but more to the point he became the archetypal leader and inspiration to hundreds of musicians who graduated from his band ranging from formative stints for Wayne Shorter and the Marsalis Bros to little known connections with artists as varied as Chick Corea and Chuck Mangione both of whom I saw appear with Blakey s Jazz Messengers in Boston in 1966 Unlike the teacher posited in WHIPLASH as a Dick Cheney like nut Blakey motivated rather than tortured his young acolytes Buddy Rich and his mediocre 60s big bands yielded nothing and as a drummer he was all technique and zero jazz 7 Fake porn Categorically WHIPLASH the title is perhaps the key hint is a type of soft core pornography among other things It s another movie example of the trends in recent years to substitute sadomasochism for traditional sexual porn namely the thousands of horror films about torture and sadism appealing to the audience to alternately identify with and then hiss the sadist as protagonist or more recently the oncoming trend that will be inspired by the success of 50 SHADES OF GREY The movie s domination theme is obvious but the submission aspect is way more subtle masked by the hero s natural rebelliousness Looking beyond him we have a score of submissives his fellow band mates who are humiliated a key element of BDSM cinema throughout the film This as entertainment is the definition of pseudo porn acceptable to the masses because it does not involve money shots and explicit penetration making it soft core rather than hardcore The absence of sex in WHIPLASH is no different than the absence of actual sex in most BDSM exercises 8 Fake setting L A substituting for NYC zero

25 November 2020,The most intense movie experience,It had been far too long since I last saw this film Whiplash was what I considered to be my favourite movie of all time for a long time However recently I have been watching a lot of films and my taste has somewhat changed As such I wasn t sure if this movie would still be at the top of my list Having finished this movie nearly out of breath I think that it is safe to say that Whiplash retains its position as my favourite movie of all time I have always liked movies with high tension and intensity and quite frankly I don t think that there is another movie that captures those two feelings so well This film is easily the most intense movie experience that I have ever had The intensity of the characters keeps you engaged and on edge the whole time The intensity of practising and performing makes you out of breath even though you are only watching And the intensity of trying to achieve perfection makes you wonder how far you d be willing to go yourself In many ways one of the most pivotal moments in the movie is the jazz cafe scene It allows you to breathe for a moment but even more importantly it allows the movie to take a deep breath before unleashing a finale that makes the rest of the movie feel cute That moment in the cafe is crucial as it allows you to reflect on what you have seen and to pause for a moment That final scene becomes as impactful as it is because you have been allowed to understand the complexity of the two main characters The cafe scene could be the best in the film if it weren t for the fact there are so many other even more impactful scenes Although I rarely discuss things like performances I think that with this one it s mandatory I am of course talking about the performance of J K Simmons If this movie isn t intense enough on its own leave it to Simmons to give an unbelievable performance and turn it up a notch A performance that is scary and intense but also emotional and sad The moments where his character lets his guard down are just as good as the moments where he yells some of the most creative insults that I have ever heard at the top of his lungs Ultimately the brilliance of this movie comes down to the fact that I have never seen another film that captures tension and intensity as well as this one I have never seen another film that makes me feel the way that this one does And when you find a film like that it s not surprising that it becomes your favourite one And for me that film is Whiplash,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6309333/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2015,Absolutely incredible,I was expecting a lot from this movie With all the Oscar nominations and positive reviews from audiences and critics alike I had some pretty high standards Who knew that this film was going to blow those standards out of the water This film was absolutely brilliant It s about jazz drumming and its probably one of the most intense films I ve ever seen Go figure Both Miles Teller and J K Simmons delivered incredible performances I don t know how much of Miles Teller s drumming was real but from what I saw it was mostly real and ridiculously impressive at that I really felt like he was the next Buddy Rich at some points J K Simmons outdoes himself here He even beats his performance as J Jonah Jameson from the original Spiderman movies He plays a seriously hardcore jazz teacher who really reminded me of that drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket Every second he s on screen you can t look away Probably a career best for him The music is amazing as well The level of effort that appeared to have gone into the soundtrack is highly respectable The highlight comes at the very end which I won t spoil so watch this film for yourself to find out I cannot recommend this film more Seek it out immediately,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3196900/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2015,Loved it,What an amazing piece of film I loved the acting loved the musics loved the directing I usually just discard music based films they are just boring This takes things to a all new level the way that the music is inserted on the film is just incredible you get captivated by the story you learn to appreciate music and all the effort behind it And the story is very very good Not just an excuse for us to hear the music You really get involved by the very well written storyline and i found no boring moment you really feel engaged during all the movie Give it a try,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3181747/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2015,Simmons is mesmerising,The theme in Whiplash could apply to anything at all in the world almost and I think that s part of what has made the film so popular The movie chooses drumming as the subject for this particular story but showcases it in a way that makes people think wow I wonder if I had someone to push me at insert hobby passion and I was willing to devote my life to it could I be the greatest of all time It s an interesting notion The answer sadly for 99 9 of people would still be no but what s to stop them trying Was the character in the movie ever going to be one of the greatest of all time That s up for the viewer to decide but it doesn t even really matter What matters is that he had both the person to drive him and also the capability to devote himself to it So one way or the other he was going to find out J K Simmons has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category at the the Academy Awards for his role in Whiplash and is almost certainly to win And rightly so He is absolutely perfect in his role with shades of R Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket coming to mind Every scene he is in is captivating to watch We the viewer are actually as nervous as the characters are supposed to be at what his character will say or do to them next A real pleasure to watch The film is far from being simply for music lovers I was surprised how entertaining I actually found the whole thing A lot of the scenes mainly the ones with Simmons were very funny in quite a dark way but also Miles Teller played his role very well and was enjoyable to watch The final scene is absolutely brilliant and tops off the movie perfectly A deserved nominee for Best Picture without a doubt,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3177958/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2015,"It's about Passion, Ambition, and Desperation to achieve one's goal.",Young director Damien Chazelle s second feature about a talented and ambitious young jazz drummer takes us into the cutthroat struggling and hardworking world of top notch jazz musicians The story is linear and simple but offers so much insight into that world The two actors selected to portray the main characters Miles Teller and J K Simmons are perfect they were meant for the roles They get into the shoes of the characters with such ease Even the few scenes with side characters like Andrew s dad girlfriend and fellow drummers are quite interesting The story is mainly about passion ambition and desperation to achieve one s goal It also sheds light on the things one decide to sacrifice in order to achieve their goal Positive reinforcement vs negative criticism which is more effective This is a debate that has been going on for ages The former might work for some while the latter might work for others Ultimately it depends on the individual and his her upbringing everyone responds to different things The story is packed with humour and inspiring moments Simmons dialogues are just fantastic it might seem vulgar to some but they re just hilarious Other than the actual instruments being played no background score is used at all this works quite well for the movie Nothing seems staged everything takes place with such natural ease And all this leads up to a foottappingly mesmerising climax The open ended approach was good And the film s topics beg to be discussed and debated among groups,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3166352/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2015,Would need to like Jazz,If you don t like Jazz then this is not for you As there is loads of Jazz in this and I am not a fan J K Simmons as Fletcher is brilliant as the half man obsessive tyrant and Miles Teller as the lead character matches him in being equally as obsessive in pushing himself to the very limits in a win at all costs mentality to succeed at his chosen profession I have no idea how true to life this would be in the modern age but maybe in the 60s and before But the way they treat the students here would make Sociologists have a nightmare in the management of human behaviour performance The film plot scope is quite light as at the end I thought there wasn t much of a story and not an original story either so you need to love Jazz I am not sure if people could be this obsessive over Jazz Main plus in the film if you don t like Jazz is the performance of the two leads,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3174078/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2015,Obsessive and Vigorous,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202103/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2015,A different kind of review,Firstly the movie is totally captivating It s uncomfortable tension filled and electric Acted exactly right you feel as if you re there in the characters shoes experiencing all of the emotions as if they re a part of you an uncomfortable part of you Filmed exactly right expressions captured with all of their raw emotion I was stunned when I discovered this was a relatively inexpensive Indie made in just 19 days It s a different kind of review because I know that world The world of hard edge power driven maniacal coaches that push to the limit often and mostly without empathy understanding that human greatness will not soar forth from the banal and the good enough effort However the mental and emotional games and the cruelty can be seriously difficult to watch in this movie It s arguable whether hard hitting and demeaning instructors make or break students but there s always that chance that once in a lifetime the extremity of humiliation mind games and emotional battering will meet with the kind of resistance and brilliance that every coach can only dream of A must see movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3193037/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2016,Too bad it was not about Metal instead of Jazz,Seeing the kind of ratings Whiplash got I had high expectations for this movie but at the end I m disappointed I expected much more from this movie Maybe it s because of my natural distaste for Jazz music It s really a genre of music I almost never enjoy In Whiplash you get repetitive parts of songs that I particularly don t like at all And then to have to listen to them over and over again is a bit too much for me On the other hand the acting was good The battle between student Miles Teller and teacher J K Simmons is interesting to watch I can understand that sometimes you have to push somebody to let him reach his best level but in this case it s just bullying So maybe if it was an other genre of music like Metal or so that I would have liked Whiplash But it isn t so to me it s just a movie you watch once and then forget about it,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3475955/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2017,Rocky for the 21st Century,This can only be understood in the light of Rocky winning best picture at the 1976 Academy Awards This is your standard inspirational movie You can almost time to the minute that the girlfriend appears It s a movie aimed at people who are inspired by motivational speeches where every aspect of the speech is predictable But many people like predictability that s the attraction This movie is the predictable inspirational movie with a few alterations The teacher is the enemy and there s some shades of grey sadism And it s about jazz not boxing In many ways it could be a parable of our times Gone is the brawler from the working class instead we have a middle class white person wanting to play jazz a nearly dead art form kept alive by music schools for middle class white people The middle class white person is now achieving heroism Overcoming your background is now an existential experience not a reality In terms of jazz it s a million miles away from the black people who dominated this art form Billie and Ella Charlie Parker Miles Davis Mingus and Monk It s closer to modern classical music gone are the days of Rossini and Puccini writing brilliant music to earn a living instead we have piano competitions Of course if the student was black it wouldn t have a market Well actually the student probably wouldn t be black to begin with Black jazz is dead Long live middle class white people fighting for a shot at perfection Can you imagine Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell in some kind of duel to see who could out do each other on a piano This is the 45th best film of all time according to voters What times we live in This film makes Eddie Murphy in Beverley Hills Cop look like hard realism based on a Pulitzer Prize winning piece of journalism,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3733799/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2016,Fifty shades of gray with drums,Or The Stanford prison experiment with drums There is something disturbing about the overall message of this movie The idea that greatness is justification for abuse and that abuse can somehow inspire students to greatness is just one of messed up ideas that is entertained in this movie Masochist student teacher relationships apparently bring out the best in students and oh yes you are not a serious drummer unless your drums end up splattered in blood and sweat Apart from exploring a messed up form of battered person syndrome and battering our credulity with predictable shock tactics this movie really does not say anything about greatness music or the kind of inspiration which brings the best in human beings As a musical person who has had the privilege of being conducted and taught by great teachers who achieved and inspired great things There is nothing in this movie about what it takes to create and make great music Intense dude seriously intense,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3495946/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2022,"Complex, multilayered, brilliant but not endearing",Every time I watch this film it s different The characters are obnoxious disturbed twisted broken There s multiple threads to the story and depending on your focus it s a different film each time you view But because of this it s one of those films that stands up to repeat viewing a masterpiece,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7951653/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2014,Bursting with energy,At first sight Whiplash seemed to me as another talent movie which features the same clich s no matter it s about music dancing or sports But the great reviews made me really curious about it and I can honestly say that it s nothing like your usual film about music Damien Chazelle s work like every beginner director s is full of raw power and energy Every moment of Whiplash has so much dynamics and tension You wouldn t expect surprising twists from these kind of movies but Whiplash has the quality to show you something unexpected in every minute The director incorporates a few small but clever twist in the narrative and these aren t twists for the twists sake Chazelle is unlike any other young director his work is unbelievably calculated there s not a single unnecessary frame in this picture and he can always capture the essence of the moment or the actors performances And that s a good thing because Whiplash relies hugely on those actors Simmons presence rules every scene he s in he has clever lines but the actor is doing most of the work Miles Teller is a bit shadowed by him but the young actor also does a great job and the chemistry between the two of them is the absolute highlight of this movie And with that Chazelle can achieve that the songs are not just some promotional material but important storytelling devices in the conflict of the main characters The director is also great at capturing emotions through these song Which takes us to my only problem with Whiplash the scenes of the rehearsals or the musical performances are so intense and strong that they make every other scene disappoint you a little That s exactly the case with the storyline of the love interest or the middle part of the runtime Whiplash is not the film of great words act or emotional effects But I think nobody s going to care about that because Chazelle s perfectionist storytelling is going to compensate everybody for that It s not an flaming improvisation it s not a shitty but catchy pop song but it s an artistic symphony It may not be a classic but it s brilliant cinema,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3095923/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,This Movie Makes Me Really Want to Start Getting Into Jazz,The two most dangerous words in the English language are good job Whiplash is an amazing movie Straight up It is about Miles Teller s character who is a drummer in a very good school who has the opportunity to be in this Studio Band taught by J K Simmons Now I know it doesn t sound all that interesting and to be honest it isn t exactly a fast paced film But Whiplash is the type of film that entices you by its use of psychology dialogue and characters Whiplash is a great example of some of the best character development in film I ve seen in awhile Whiplash also definitely has one of my favorite soundtracks of all time The score in this film is absolutely amazing and when I first saw this when I was 14 it really got me to start listening to jazz The music and how it s used in this film is phenomenal The psychological aspect behind it I also find fascinating in how Miles Teller and J K Simmons are combating psychologically through there use of music That ending scene J K Simmons gives an Oscar worthy performance and Miles Teller gives his best performance to date tbh but he s got a lot ahead of him J K Simmons though he really blows it away with a really amazing intense performance He might be the best part of the movie tbh I also kind of agreed with some of his reasoning behind why he was so aggressive but he def took it too far The scenes with J K Simmons ripping Miles Teller apart are so intense and not only really shows how great of actors these two are but also how great the screenwriting was for this film Overall Whiplash is a great film The screenwriting characters acting and the score are all absolutely amazing It s dramatic and very tense and anxiety inducing It was also beautifully filmed There were a few times I was really biting my nails rooting for Miles Teller While also loving the performance J K Simmons was giving But there s no sugar coating it there s really no flaws with this film The performances are Oscar worthy and that ending is one of my favorite endings of all time I highly recommend everyone checks out this film Especially if your a fan of music You ll definitely appreciate jazz and the orchestra more than you already should One of my favorite films of 2014,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8017412/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2015,Tests the Viewer,The performance that Miles Teller gives in Damien Chazelle s new film Whiplash reminded me a lot of Robert De Niro s in Raging Bull They both play tenacious unrelenting characters and do so in a way that can t be forgotten and stays with the viewer long after the movie s over They may be pursuing different things De Niro with boxing and Teller with drumming but they re each after the same goal greatness And that s what this film is all about reaching a goal that is relative to the person trying to achieve it In this case it centers around a guy who never feels understood He s attending the most prestigious music school in the country and is constantly working to be one of the greats Who in his eyes is someone like Buddy Rich Then unexpectedly he s given a chance to prove his chops on the renowned studio band instructed by Terence Fletcher J K Simmons He s soon met with Fletcher s abusive teaching tactics and is continuously tested under pressure The question is can he withstand It tests the psyche of a young man and shows how far a person will go for something they love and want to do for the rest of their life That being said it s a harsh movie The audience is thrown right into the pressure cooker along with Teller and if you re not ready for it it can be unsettling and scary But that s one of the main reasons why I liked it Not only does it test the main character it tests the viewer You also can t deny the masterful performances on display and finesse that the director brings along with them Needless to say this is a must see If I had seen it in 2014 it would ve undoubtedly made my top ten,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3161398/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2016,Music is never a competition.,The main argument of this film is that music is like a sport You have to put yourself to the limit to be a top player And this is not true for music Music is all about feeling and soul and touch audience with the performance not to be able to play at 400 BPM Being a musician is an inner path to lead to a self discover Virtuousness come with the practice and talent but not being assaulted physical and emotionally Music is an art not a competition so is subject to be interpreted in many ways so being a best musician is not matter of math or time clock Jazz is a language not a race Photography and editing are superb in the film that s the only thing I liked,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3449475/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,Whiplash is more painful than whiplash,Much loved movie by IMDB users but I am baffled as to why Much of the dialogue felt like improvisation There are no characters remotely likeable The underlying concept that musicians play better under duress is ridiculous and that the best musicians became that way as a result of being traumatised is absurd I don t think Jimi Hendrix rolled out those licks in a state of mind of high tension,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7473529/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2015,Are you dragging or rushing?,This movie is doing neither The story itself is pretty simple and even lame but somehow it didn t bother me and that is probably due to the fact you can t stay indifferent for any of the characters The actors put down a pretty strong performance there They move you and you start wondering at their motives What drives them And each beat on the drums brings you closer in answering this question without rushing without dragging There is no CGI in this movie and no action but the visuals are still in their own way breath taking The atmosphere brought together with the spotlights and the close ups of the instruments is awesome It makes you want play yourself Sound wise this movie is for a lack of a better word Perfect But do take in account you need to be open to Jazz Well worth the watch nd the listen,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3189405/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,What a fantastic film!,I ended up seeing this only because my son was watching in the other room and I was drawn by the music once I watched 30 sec I was hooked It s all about the interplay between a hard driving perfectionist even sadistic band leader and an ambitious young drummer trying to make his mark in the world of music The actors in the two key roles are top notch they bring out so many emotions as we oscillate from admiration to sympathy to repudiation to outright hatred It s very emotional very tense and in the end one is not quite sure where we re left but it s a superb ride all the way And the music I m not a jazz afficionado but I loved it all The soundtrack is well worth listening to on its own,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8096327/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2014,JK Simmons is the ONLY reason to see this,Whiplash chronicles a jazz drummer s tumultuous relationship with a volatile instructor While this is well acted and shot beautifully Whiplash fails to catapult itself to greatness with bogging down its story with rather wooden supporting characters and a slow as molasses storyline Whiplash tells the story of Andrew a jazz drummer coming into a cutthroat art school and his instructor Terrence Fletcher an off the wall and emotionally abusive instructor The strengths of Whiplash lie solely in the hands of J K Simmons Simmons delivers a tour de force performance turning a fiery rage into something inspiring for our lead Miles Teller Simmons has some truly great scenes spouting off profanity laced rants when trying to bring out the best in Andrew The scenes with Simmons send the film into overdrive making you want to know what happens next However this feeling of excellence on screen quickly turns into boredom as we see Miles Teller try to captivate us the same way his co star did and falters At the end of it all this comes down to talent J K Simmons sets a high bar for his co stars and this actually ends up hurting the film because of his performance Miles Teller seems as if he can t keep up in scenes with Simmons and rather than captivating us with his relentless drumming until his blood hits the sweat filled drum kit it actually ends up feeling as if he is trying too hard to top his co star in regards to intensity This creates for an uneven film one that never truly becomes the masterpiece it wants to be Despite these lesser qualities Whiplash does feature some truly great scenes of Simmons berating his students with some of the best delivered insults this side of Full Metal Jacket Damien Chazelle does showcase his talents lingering on the physical and emotional tolls that the environment takes on Andrew and other students Despite this quality Chazelle fails to connect his characters to his audience But one thing that won t be lost in translation is where these characters are and how competitive it is Quite honestly I feel this worked better as a short film There is simply not enough for audiences to latch on to or enough for them to care about But one thing is for sure J K Simmons is ON FIRE in this film and delivers one of the best performances of his career,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3099010/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2015,How Far Can You Go To Be Perfect?,Damien Chazelle s Whiplash asks How Far Can You Go To Be Perfect The answer lies in you clearly on what you define as perfection In Chazelle s World perfection is ruthless brutal life threatening But despite its hardcore approach Whiplash is a film that s worth watching thanks to its mostly tight screenplay bravura performances Whiplash Synopsis A promising young drummer enrolls at a cutthroat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student s potential Whiplash narrates a frightening tale of a mentor his student The anger ambition between the primary characters is lethal hardcore You watch a monster of a coach behaving inhumanly while the student aims only to achieve goal come what may The thriving journey of both the characters is commendably structured However Chazelle s Screenplay gets slightly monotonous after a point The repeated confrontations get a bit boring especially towards the second hour However Chazelle delivers a highly impressive culmination to the story His Direction is sharp Cinematography Editing are good One of the prime reasons why Whiplash works is because of its performances J K Simmons is electrifying as the fearsome instructor displaying rage power magnificently Miles Teller is unbelievable He takes upon a role that s challenging he translates the part into a career making performance He s extra ordinary Simmons Teller both are Oscar Worthy On the whole despite some flaws in its screenplay Whiplash deserves a watch for its tense proceedings fabulous performances,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158237/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2015,As Over-rated As They Come,Yes the acting by JK Simmons was very good and yes the storyline was compelling regarding greatness and how greatness is found and nurtured or in this case abused The idea is our society is too friendly and politically correct to be able to develop great musicians The interesting concept of the film is that the mentor is as important as the mentee which of course we already knew but the idea was that the mentor must be willing to push the mentee in ways or manners the mentee would not do otherwise Very interesting concept that could yield hours of interesting debate over a bottle of wine and a cigar However the movie does not behave like an Indy film but like a Hollywood picture There is far too much drama The primary character Andrew Nieman bleeds no less than three times during the movie on his trap set Seriously bleeding He gets in a car accident rolls his car over and runs to the recital he was late for while bleeding and unable to control his limbs from the trauma Then there s the complete lack of character development of ANY of the characters in the movie Why is Andrew Nieman so obsessed with music that he breaks up with his girlfriend because he thinks she will eventually get in the way JK Simmons is good but sorry I don t know why he behaves the way he does nor would his style ever be effective or accepted at any college private or public The idea that Charlie Parker became great because he had a symbol thrown at him is extremely trite and irrelevant to greatness Again this is not an accurate representation of the truth The reason we don t have any modern Charlie Parker s is because our society doesn t care about Jazz music any longer in fact it s the butt of many jokes Jazz was played everywhere in Parker s day You could buy a saxophone at JC Penny s for Pete s sake Today you can barely buy a saxophone at a music store The fact of the matter is that people become great in areas that the people care about football basketball baseball and in the arts symphony orchestra Yo Yo Ma is one of the greatest cello players of all time So did he become great because he had some dude yelling profanities in his ear NO How about 50 000 hrs of practice and prospect of getting rich and being adored So much hype and very little substance behind it I m afraid unless of course your used to watching Marvel superhero movies so you ve become abundantly inept at recognizing a good film unless it slapped you in the face Which of course JK Simmons does slap Peter Parker I mean Andrew Nieman,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3194879/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2015,A movie more about pursuit of mastery than drums and music.,I know little about music and less about drumming but this movie is not about the craft it s about the pursuit for mastery or even perfection If you go into it knowing nothing about jazz I m sure your interest will be peaked In this movie you follow Teller s character Andrew and Fletcher the character played by Simmons Both deliver fantastic performances and considering they are both supposed to be practicing a craft on a high level it s very impressive that they manage to do so convincingly The entire movie follows Andrew around and by doing so you understand what kind of life he chose to live and while we don t see anything what we see is sufficient to fill in the rest The girl he dates is only seen in a couple of scenes but you completely understand the relationship and Andrew s thoughts on it from them The same when it comes to his position on friends and family Simmons portrayal of Fletcher is very successful in that he is a beast but you find yourself rooting for him despite it And to end with the ending I am still having a bit of a hard time saying if it s a happy or ending or not but I really did enjoy it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3215380/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2015,Great movie but a bit one dimensional,So I finally watched Whiplash It was really really good J K Simmons was an absolute terror well deserved Oscar win and the music was great as well However I think the film would have benefited if it was a bit longer the story is compelling but it never dwells enough on the pain of the protagonist 107 minutes is a tad bit less if complex emotions are to be shown in the immortal words of J K Simmons it s rushing and not quite my tempo Almost all films this season handled the drama aspect better than Whiplash The Theory of Everything and Foxcatcher both showed the pain and moral dilemma better albeit both being inferior movies to Whiplash At the same time Birdman and The Imitation Game not only showed better drama but in my opinion are better films because it just felt more appealing to a person of my age compared to Whiplash which seems to aim at younger college going audience also it s a bit one dimensional even if that one dimension is excellent I would like to mention the climax was phenomenal it rose a couple of notches in my books even if I have never respected or connected with overtly strict harsh teachers in my life,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3196388/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,Extremely Overrated,100 minutes of torture the movie is not good and its point is to end the new way of raising teenagers by motivating them to replace motivation by torture face slapping and throwing them with chairs The movie main role is stop motivations The movie also co urge teens to stop working in teams to hate the success for others in the same field as they may take your place the movie is the very bad teaches teens that the only way to success is ve energy reverse psychology I believe that the key of sex is by hard work and lots of training not making people hate and try to hurt each other and use torture and make the whole team enemies all afraid to lose his place,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3550086/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2021,Drum roll please,Whiplash sat on my hard drive for a while longer than most There was no real reason for this I was aware that J K Simmons had claimed his Oscar and that the film was well regarded on release Sometimes films have to age like a wine and your palette needs to be ready The continuity announcer this was taken from a terrestrial channel indicated the word bullying and my wife almost exited the room The one failing of watching a film at home you do tend to lose your film buddy much easier than if they re trapped in a cinema seat This is a good film I ve given an 8 So possibly I should be saying excellent But I think 8 is sufficient and good likewise If you like drum solos and you enjoy jazz you will enjoy the soundtrack Miles Teller plays Andrew a budding drummer who come s up against J K Simmons as a sometimes mentor sometimes bully But the latter is subjective Simmons as Fletcher the head of the Shaffer Conservatory of Music seeks the best not just from Andrew but from all of those who play in his jazz bands There are other moments in the film that confirm that Andrew is not Fletcher s only target where perfection is concerned including one moment which forms the foundations for the film s conclusion This is a great two hander with solid support from a cast who are probably better known for the TV work and some smart editing from Tom Cross who also picked up an Oscar Whiplash has its visceral moments but overall it is a worthwhile experience and one that is likely to hold up well as the years pass,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7180265/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2016,An enthralling thrill ride of a movie about jazz.,An enthralling thrill ride of a movie about jazz Yep that s right Andrew Miles Teller is a promising jazz drummer who has ambitions to be the very best Fletcher J K Simmons is the cantankerous exacting conductor whom Andrew needs to impress if he is to fulfil his dream The two leads perform brilliantly Simmons launches into Fletcher s virulent tirades with savage gusto his frightening demeanour and victimisation of the promising pupil creating the initial drama and tension We feel for Andrew as he suffers the verbal and physical abuse meted out by his potential mentor A battle of wills develops with Andrew determined not to simply accept every degradation heaped upon him In the interests of tension and drama it s overdone Whilst immersed in the events taking place before you you may not notice The film is that powerful But afterwards you are likely to think how improbable it all was Scenes between Andrew and both his father and girlfriend feel superfluous interrupting the savage narrative of the battle between Fletcher and Andrew It s this battle that results in events taking a different turn We are made to see both sides There is no goodie or baddie it s the tale of two obsessions in conflict and the ensuing sparks that fly Then we reach the dramatic finale no spoilers here and watch it unfold before us like the drawing back of a taught bowstring wondering where the arrow will fly Excellent gut wrenching roller coaster movie Prepare yourself accordingly,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3463978/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2015,Sheer acting excellence!!!!!,Its every true everyone can t be an actor specially like J K Simmons This movie makes one feel the levels of hardship and mental agony one goes through in the process of achieving perfection At times Simmons scares you with this brutal way of dealing as an instructor Miles Teller is just incredible in replying his feeling when Simmons interrupts in the way of achieving his dreams There are consequences when director makes audiences to feel everyone needs to be extra determined and focused when it comes in making dreams come true Its an absolute journey of movie experience which enthralls you full time and makes you feel everything comes at a cost and their is no shortcut for SUCCESS,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3194499/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2015,"The two harmful words in the English language are ""good job""",Geniuses There are only a handful of them in the universe They live life on a completely different planet than everyone else In the process they make sacrifices that most people wouldn t be willing to make Sacrifices in relationships social interaction in any possibility of living a normal life Whether that s Einstein or Bill Gates or Steve Jobs Mozart Michael Jordan Lennon McCartney etc these people lived a life that wasn t normal In all honesty normal to them like Andrew Neimann and Terrence Fletcher in Whiplash is insufferable and for the weak Andrew Neimann doesn t just want to be a good jazz drummer he wants to be the best His idol is Buddy Rich one of the best jazz drummers in history Andrew doesn t have friends and outside of a short lived relationship doesn t date He finds people who live the average life like his extended family boring and of little interest Drumming is what he lives and dies for He looks at his father and sees what he doesn t want to be a man who wanted to be a writer but let distractions never let him reach his potential Neimann meets his match in Terrence Fletcher played masterfully by JK Simmons Fletcher is an abusive sadistic teacher who pushes his students far beyond the line of appropriateness Andrew sees in Fletcher a little of Rich Rich was known as a temperamental perfection The tension in this movie is thick and gripping Miles Teller to many is the next John Cusack but I see talent in him that is far more promising than even Cusack and I like John Cusack JK Simmons has always been one of my favorite actors This role is far from his appearances as the Yellow M M and the Farmer s spokesperson I m happy he was finally recognized this year for his skills by the Academy The story of decisions and sacrifice have been told before in movies like It s a Wonderful Life but the message here isn t as clear cut or one sided It s very open to interpretation If I have to knock a star off it s some of the actions of Fletcher At times it was like Karate Kid All that Jazz and Full Metal Jacket thrown in a blender A music school in NYC would never let an instructor do what Fletcher did physical abuse Some of the actions were just slightly over the top and unbelievable However I did go to school in the arts and can tell ya there are some perfectionists who demand greatness It s not all laid back and easy going like some posters believe arts programs are Overall this isn t the easiest movie to watch but the way it make you think about how geniuses operate makes it a truly unique cinematic experience,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3210212/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2015,Fails to understand what it means to be a musician,Seems to me the only people who like this movie are people who know nothing about music The film tries to get you to buy into some kind of polished elite fantasy world that supports our belief that success comes at great sacrifice Which it sometimes does but this movie is absolutely ridiculous People become musicians out of LOVE for the art They aren t pushed to achieve greatness by sadistic asshole teachers Also Jazz is far less rigorous and robotic than this movie would have you believe Jazz and Blues have always been about self expression play spontaneity colour contrast emotion Lots of great jazz players are self taught and never even went to music school see Django Reinhardt Many can t even read music This American movie completely fails to understand one of Americas own greatest cultural exports As a Brit I appreciate the irony I can only conclude the writer must be a total dipshit,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3354292/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,"If you don't like Jazz stay away, if you like Jazz definitely stay away !!!",if you have seen black swan then you are going to watch it again but this time the main actor is male and instead of bale this time it is jazz or should say only drums The acting is on the top that is for sure but the plot is sometimes very unrealistic so it is difficult to believe what is going on After time the music becomes annoying I mean really annoying The movie is a musical yes but that does not mean it has to have music all the time sometimes it is too long and drums are not to instrument that you want to listen all the time Anyways for me it was another black swan movie which was a pointless boring movie this movie was way better that black swan but still not a good movie I gave it 2 out of 10 just because of the acting nothing else,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3170041/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2018,Portrait Of A Sadist As An Old Man,This movie was built upon the myth of an abusive encounter that led to the creation of a supreme musician an extension of the idea all artists need to suffered for their art The movie then treats up to a series of disturbing scenes to underpin this idea in the hands of a frustrated university professor trying to find his genius This pathological psychopath is nothing more than a sadist and bully who gets off on torturing and humiliating young vulnerable men The movie is less than convincing as musicians are usually so driven they need to be told to practice less and be persuaded that perfection is unobtainable Not to mention that musical progression occurs naturally in a supportive and collaborative environment Whilst there were convincing performances the movie was an ugly mishmash of conflicting vestigial thoughts The music was good as was the editing but the direction of this soulless material let to little character separation Only near the end did the story try to justify the movies focus on brutality by trying to catch and fire this vile professor from his job at the university Overall this movie left a nasty taste in the mouth with little or no resolution or redemption,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4440285/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,Like my old gym school teacher,The bullying nature of the bandmaster had me reliving those horrible days at school where a gym teacher had much the same approach to bringing out the best in his charges Fifty five years on and I have grudging respect for the tactics of achievement by fear but I still recall him as a rectal aperture who could have used more tender methods J K Simmons plays the rear exit role to perfection totally uncompromising in his almost unattainable standards and a person who would be doing jail time under today s parameters It s a real debate as to whether a genius needs to be pushed or whether their natural talents will emerge from some internal drive My old gym teacher certainly brought out some qualities in me that would still be latent if it hadn t been for the fear and humiliation factor Miles Teller plays a wonderful part as a driven obsessed youth it seems that all of the great musicians excluded everything else from their lives until they became masters After that most of them make up for lost time by piling headlong into booze drugs and women but that wasn t part of this story I enjoyed the pace and tension of the movie all of the parts were well cast and the dinner table scene was a wonderful display of the contrast between hero worship of Football Jocks and the dismissal of musical talent But that s America at least until the musician gets famous I would have given the movie a 10 if it wasn t for the actual music itself Jazz to me is like a cinder caught under a door I m sure they re all magic musicians but I d sooner hear three cats howling on the back fence at night than spend any time listening to this tuneless crap Go ahead and hang me if you can find me it should be easy I ll be at any country rock concert Enjoy the movie in Cmajor7b5 cheers Billc,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164626/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2015,Whiplash indeed is the BEST film of 2014,a perfect 10 my words simply cannot describe how good this film is very powerful and at the same time very moving never thought a drummer would have to suffer so much in order to achieve the greatness there s a sentence that made me feel so right good job actually is the reason why put off people to become great because good job also means mediocre it only means that you just reach a high plateau or just on the foothill instead at top of the mountain the ultimate greatness the year of 2014 was another year that gave us some of the best films and whiplash is right on the top list Simmons had won lot of nominations and awards but i do think the young actor also deserves the highest praise before watched this film i never paid any attention to this young actor but now i d concentrate my focus on this young talent also the writer director and all the supporting actors in this film are great too,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3156652/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2015,A Visceral Explosion of Rhythm and Fury,There is such a myriad of blood sweat tears anxiety screaming and terror in Whiplash that an outsider might mistake it for a horror show instead of a cursory superiorly breathtaking thriller of sorts I m not the kind of critic that uses tired phrases like kept me at the edge of my seat or made me sweat bullets as devices to trickily describe my heart rate but during Whiplash I experienced both sensations not in the same way I did when Ghostface was chasing around Drew Barrymore with psychotic fascination in Scream and not in the same way I did when Marion Crane was getting shower knifed in Psycho Whiplash invents an entirely new kind of thrill one where an aggressive insult is as excruciating as a punch to the face and a drum solo quivers with the same acrimony of a fist fight where no one wins Miles Teller who is already becoming one of Hollywood s many underrated young talents portrays Andrew Neyman an aspiring drummer who has found a place within the halls of a respected music conservatory on the East Coast Though slightly cocky his talent is undeniable he aspires to be the next Buddy Rich and it doesn t seem like all too much of an exaggeration Little does he know that he is about to become the punching bag of Terence Fletcher J K Simmons a sadistic conductor who isn t afraid to hurl verbal and physical assaults on his students in order to achieve a sickened sort of perfection Famously the American Film Institute compiled a series of Top 100 lists its subjects being stars laughs passions quotes and more If they were to start again from scratch in the next decade or so Terence Fletcher would in no doubt find his place as one of the Top 50 Villains Simmons has made himself a kind presence before Juno all those insurance commercials but never again will I be able to look at him without a cautious passing fear As terrifying as Darth Vader or Nurse Ratched Fletcher seems to enjoy inflicting pain onto his students even scarier is the fact that the film never offers any explanation as to why he feels the need to traumatize the impressionable youths around him Most movies would use a dying wife or an abusive childhood as excuses but not with Fletcher He is evil probably not even realizing it Simmons snarls his way through screaming matches with unbridled ferocity but more disconcerting is his ability to radiate cruelty even when his manners are at their very best In Whiplash we re never quite sure if Fletcher s alarming teaching methods will ultimately guide Andrew in the direction of the greatest drummer alive or if they will send him over the edge Teller a brilliant and intuitive actor is aware that Andrew isn t always likable but makes up for it with fierce determination As he practices unbelievable amounts of time to polish a certain section of a particular piece of music blood rips through his hands like a geyser sweat pours down his face like a waterfall But will he give up The lethal rapport between Teller and Simmons is morbid enough to keep us guessing Mention must also be made for Tom Cross magnificent editing The way he pieces together Fletcher s attacks on Andrew are inflamed in peril flickering with rough movement that matches Fletcher s unpredictable mood changes most impressive is the climax which is basically a long extremely intense drum solo which captures every single detail imaginable ensnaring any drip of sweat or instrumental spasm of the performance When the closing credits finally popped up I noticed that in all my leg shaking and shortages of breath I was drenched in sweat Whiplash doesn t allow for a smoke break or a second to get your bearings straight the continuance of high tension makes it the most thrilling film of 2014 Read more reviews at petersonreviews com,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3231017/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2015,Jazz fiction,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164170/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2016,I don't want to be great. I want to be one of the Great.,I like when Hollywood dares to cast a young actor that doesn t fit their standards of beauty The lead worked extremely well with his character and quite frankly I think that s what kept me riveted Adversity fuels him exhaustion is merely an obstacle in his path The actor s nervousness and receptivity is mesmerizing and will entrap you in his world The camera could have pulled a Lars Von Trier standing just behind his shoulder and it would have felt the same While the audience isn t courted so much into caring for the characters the story does bring its emotional content with themes that appeal to everyone The desire to make something out of your life the sacrifices the labour But who knows how it will end It s different for each of us JK Simmons was remarkable and his chemistry with the lead could have been better but it was sufficient It was just enough to hold the movie together Now the bleeding hands were great at first but that quickly wore down Everyone one of us who s ever played an instrument which is everyone knows the hardship isn t in the playing but in the accuracy I get that his main struggle was to keep up the fast beat but as I said the bleeding hands metaphor quickly wore down If it had been a trombone would they have made his lips bleed The fingers of a piano player It was just too much Sweat would have sufficed Ups and downs not the greatest movie I ve seen this year but good Pretty good It s an 8 10 for me would recommend it to a specific crowd only,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3438770/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2015,Mind-Blowing Jazz Music Harmonising with Some of the Most Amazing Acting,Miles Teller being an up and coming actor along with JK Simmons who is a well established underrated actor whose performances have often been spell bounding together have made one of the best movies I ve ever seen in the music genre and I ve seen Inside Llewyn Davis Miles who plays Andrew a young drummer studying at one of the top schools of music shows us his passion in every frame every single time whilst delivering a performance His anger temper rise fall and everything else in between worked so well with the movie that he caught my attention with every single frame passing by As time passes I am sure he will take the industry by storm along with all the other young up and coming actors and actresses Simmons who plays Fletcher delivers a performance worthy of his name Actually I might actually go ahead and say that this is the best I ve ever seen him act He convinces me completely that Fletcher is an insane perfectionist so much so that he can forget that the performers were even human until he gets the beat tempo and rhythm he needs Insanity suited his character and he delivered that in an extraordinary fashion Both the actors showed their passion on screen but I must give props to the director who made the film go at the right pace pushed the actors to show insane amounts of passion and not allow the audience to divert their attention from these captivating performances I love jazz music but don t have much knowledge But whatever I saw in this movie and heard as well made me love it even more Whiplash and Caravan were two genius compositions and they were so amazingly beautiful I actually don t know the right adjectives here to help me show how much I loved the score All the other characters also played their part quite well making this movie one well rounded show of art All in all this is one movie that even the non jazz lovers will love If you want passion on screen you see it delivered in aces,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3157502/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2019,Clawing to the top with blood-stained drumsticks,Tape your fingers now or else those nails will be bitten down to nubs when this is over Equally unbearable and exhilarating Whiplash turns the teacher student relationship right on its head far more Full Metal Jacket than anything inspirational To that end this is the best I ve ever seen from J K Simmons spewing venom as Miles Teller strains under his withering abuse This is psychological thriller against the backdrop of jazz a sentence I never thought I d see myself typing and Simmons is the emotional terrorist you just do not see coming That goes for the whole movie one that I ve never seen anything like There s a wealth to appreciate here from the masterful editing and direction to the music and the hype is absolutely warranted And is it just me or does Not my tempo belong up there with Is it safe as far as chilling lines go,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4816725/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2015,Interesting take on the classic story of getting through by effort,You ve seen this before usually in sports movies where some guy or girl is set to get through some very difficult competition and works their ass off to make it Whiplash is not really about the finishing competition but about the mindset of the person wanting to get there and of the teacher who needs to find a prodigy to validate their own efforts Most of all the film is extraordinary for making the viewers ask themselves if there is a line and when can you consider it crossed in both pupil and teacher Other than that though I felt that the movie was close to mediocre J K Simmons seems to have won the Oscar as recognition for all his acting jobs because I can think of several actors of the top of my head that could have played the same role It wasn t such a difficult role not compared to the one Miles Teller played at least He did all the drumming scenes himself and 40 of the drums in the soundtrack are him playing The ending of course is epic and the training montages are pretty convincing of the will of the music student but the music does not convince me I am not into jazz but I ve scoured the net and it s not either a spectacular style of music and even the musical references are not that accurate Bottom line could be inspiring but I rather appreciated it for the guts to make the viewer consider boundaries for them and others in the teaching process rather than for any spectacular acting or scripting Worth a watch surely,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3326890/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2016,So. Much. Tension. and without guns.,An absolutely riveting movie Terence Fletcher the crazy good J K Simmons and Andrew Neiman Miles Teller were both amazing in this although really Fletcher took the cake His character embodies that fierce and sometimes violent drive in each of us or perhaps some person in our lives that tries to push ourselves to the limit which is what makes this movie so personal as this connects with the audience While on the other hand Andrew represents the dreamer in all of us but is sometimes faced with the limbo between attempting to push harder or to give up This is what makes this movie so engaging The music in the movie coupled with the drumming also adds to the tension in this roller coaster of a movie The finale was also spectacular and epic There s basically nothing to criticize this movie for It elevates the simple idea of diligence and success to a whole new level and engages the audience throughout 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3452973/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2016,Art over humanity,Andrew Miles Teller is a smug young guy who thinks he can become a great drummer Fletcher J K Simmons is an instructor whose eye Andrew catches and who decides to give him a chance Whiplash is not specially original The plot could be your TV movie of the weekend Young guy raises against his weaknesses through mean but great instructor And that is one of the problems with Whiplash as one or twice takes decisions that are basically not very original or interesting and are just there to raise the stakes against Andrew Because of that the movie s greatness depends on the package And here the movie offers a mixed bag That the two principal characters are quite annoying doesn t help Andrew is a spoiled child who thinks too high of himself of Fletcher on the other hand we re supposed to believe that he is bossing and abusing pushing Andrew around but he actually comes out more as an insecure bad mouthed fellow It s not that J K Simmons does a bad job is that his character is supposed to shout and swear a lot And that doesn t make an instructor Or a mean and harsh one The idea of the movie of course is that you have to be pushed or push yourself to become great at art There s once that Andrew asks Fletcher if that is right and Fletcher says yes The movie does it too Because of that the short comings are more easily spotted as the view on the subject is poorly balanced To make a great artist writer drummer painter the artist doesn t have to go through an ordeal or suffer or become aloof and detached For some it may help to be focused For others maybe another option is better But in the end all revolves around Fletcher and Andrew s relationship And here it all becomes a childish game as both become little brats more than once and just shout at each other as if shouting makes your argument better Of course that s the point of the movie But also the point of the movie is that one should belief that this interplay has an effect on both of them And here s where Whiplash fails and the movie just becomes a story about two selfish child men,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3404510/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2015,Edge of your seat intensity,Read my full review here http ericsgoodstuff blogspot com 2015 02 whiplash html Oh man I just saw Whiplash and I am still reeling I can t remember ever having such an electrifying experience watching a movie I swear I wrote that before finding the poster on the left with the word ELECTRIFYING in all caps I was riveted on the edge of my seat strung up with excitement by this thing It ll have you on your toes sometimes shaking with anxiety and other times bursting with anger and then joyously applauding at the end Whiplash indeed Maybe it s because I had a taste for how nasty it was going to get but I was just wiggling with anxiety half anticipating half dreading when the shoe would drop And once it does for the first time you just never know when it s going to hit again JK Simmon s performance is just gnarly and intense He plays a man with a single minded unbending vision create truly great jazz musicians no matter the cost For him this means pushing them to the brink of their own destruction The ends justify the means He makes the tiger mom look like a cuddly kitten At one point he pits three drummers against each other for hours on end He dismisses the rest of the band while the three battle it out one after another and you can see Fletcher is in his element relishing the opportunity to just dig in give in to his rage and make them suffer it out Andrew plays until his hands are bleeding This movie has more sweat and blood stained drum sets then a Tool concert Writer Director Damian Chazelle who just turned 30 reportedly based the movie on his own experience dealing with an overbearing band teacher in high school I did band all through school and even had a teacher that had some mildly similar elements Also did I mention the director completed this movie by the time he was 29 So impressive Fletcher s character is certainly extreme with some complaining that it is unrealistically so but it is brilliantly carried out Yeah we know that life as a jazz student isn t exactly like this so what Keep watch for when he takes off his jacket usually a sign he s doing what he thinks is his most important work Miles Teller s performance of Andrew show s great range as well as his character transitions from a young hopeful pup to a cocky upstart then a broken down hound dog and finally an experienced wolf that although not a master has a couple of lessons under his belt Now that he s been through the first few bumps he s more dedicated then ever The movie really asks two questions What does it really take to achieve greatness And then the follow up is it worth it The final act is exhilarating jump out of your seat kind of stuff I do like jazz especially the type in this movie But I think even if you know nothing and care nothing for jazz the performances the visuals the editing and the resulting energy and dynamics of the final scenes will get anyone going Even as you see the relationship between Andrew and Fletcher change and then change again during an extended musical sequence you never know right till the last moment how it s going to end and what it means And even then the movie still leaves it up to the viewer s interpretation Maybe the answers that you think the movie is giving to those questions says more about you then about the movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3191507/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2017,"A ""Music Movie"" that manages to get everything about music completely wrong.",As a professional musician of 20 years I would like to say a little something about this movie and it s odd message or lack thereof Becoming a great musician takes years and years of hard work and a lot of sacrifice However the real process in real life looks NOTHING like this movie The idea that a mentally unstable psychotically aggressive and perhaps worst of all completely INCONSISTENT teacher mentor like the Fletcher character would be of any actual use to an aspiring musician is pure garbage It might make for great drama but it does not reflect how things work in the real world at all What saddens me is the thought that young aspiring musicians might watch this drivel and think it s an accurate portrayal of what it is to be a great musician and what you have to do to achieve that greatness Or even worse that some aspiring teacher might watch this and be inspired to follow Fletcher s method of teaching by terror because of the results it achieves in the movie In reality Fletcher s method is flawed It will not create a new Charlie Parker It will in fact not create any new great jazz artists at all With a little luck it might produce a few semi useful second row puppets but that s about it And even those guys would likely never get hired since the asshole mentality that has been drilled into them would make them completely impossible to work with,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3685770/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2015,Original and thoroughly entertaining! 8/10,Review I was really looking forward to watching this film because I have been drumming since I was a little boy and I know that jazz drumming is one of the hardest methods to master The movie is about an inspiring drummer who tries his utmost to impress the top instructor in his school After showing him his determination and dedication to his art he gets promoted to be the head drummer in his orchestra but the teachers ruthless methods and constant search for perfection takes his toll The movie is original and entertaining from beginning to end The drumming from Miles Teller is superb but it s J K Simmons nasty methods that impressed me The storyline is quite basic and it seemed really short for some unknown reason but it s very entertaining and I m glad that it got the recognition that it deserved If your not into drumming or jazz music the relationship between the teacher and student is worth a watch because it shows how far a person will go to achieve perfection Enjoyable Round Up This is the first major film from Damien Chazelle who also wrote the strange Grand Piano starring Elijah Wood With such a small budget he really did get the most out of actors which got J K Simmons an Oscar Bafta and Golden Globe for Best Supporting role That just proves that audiences always like a good baddie Anyway Miles Teller who also starred in Divergent 21 and Over and Rabbit Hole hasn t done to bad since he came on the big screen 2010 and he has a major role as Mr Fantastic in the new Fantastic Four franchise J K Simmons has starred in over 100 movies but he s mostly known for playing J Jonah Jameson in the Spiderman movies Anyway I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I hope that more people will get to watch it now that it s on DVD Budget 3million Worldwide Gross 14million I recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about an inspiring drummer who gets pushed to the limit by his ruthless teacher 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3253758/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2015,Best achievement in Sound Editing of the year!,Whiplash is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking and totally unmissable Who thought J K Simmons would have been offered a role eligible for an Oscar win Nobody but that s not the point the movie is mesmerising to its own extent and outweighs the boundaries of sound editing to a unique and powerhouse level With so much pleasure to keep the audience glued to their seats Whiplash is a fascinating tale about a passionate drummer called Andrew played by Miles Teller who s undying dream is to become a musician as a drummer even if he has to go off the deep end by severely injuring himself in practise which he ultimately does when music professor Fletcher abusively doubts his talents It s a careers best for J K Simmons whom delivers a masterful performance as Fletcher as he horribly abuses the students in his music class in order to make them successful and talented musicians but Fletcher is not to be messed with Miles Teller also delivers a mesmerising performance as the young master drummer Andrew whom will stop at nothing and will cross boundaries even with Fletcher to achieve his dream It s one of my favourite movies of the year and of all time and an extraordinary new achievement in filmmaking,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3194610/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,Never stop chasing your dream!,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6447194/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,Too ill-natured and rough for a movie about jazz,Yelling and foul mouthed superiors teachers are still seen here and there but I can hardly imagine them flourish in the field of mild arts I myself have collaborated in several choirs and bands my close relative worked for decades in a theater so I know that artistic people are very thin skinned and soft hearted certainly not ready to tolerate crudity for years even by someone with contacts and talents This sort of person we saw in Terence Fletcher is more fitting to sports or war zone True the dramatics was skillfully created there were several twists paving the way for witty yet odd ending The performances of two protagonists Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman and J K Simmons as Terence Fletcher were thrilling to watch particularly thanks to pace and dynamism but sidelines and background were relatively empty especially regarding Fletcher After all the viewers obtained some information about Neiman s background and life outside music All in all a vigorous drama with multiple strong and opposite feelings present but it is difficult to me to envisage how jazz musicians would experience this movie plot wise And how the people far away from music or hating jazz are willing to watch this to the end at all,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164677/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,My take ....,I found the whole drumming aspect of the film to be quite clear symbolism for the war against breast reduction surgery The cinematic parallels between the intense drumming scenes and surgically removing big bouncy boobies is uncanny and is clearly Chazelle s way of expressing the opinion that he likes big juicy honkers The fact that Chazelle is willing to be brutally honest and not shy away from the subject matter is honestly empowering and I am internally grateful to have seen someone address this in film As Abraham Lincoln once said God gave you big badonky donk boobies why would you want to make them smaller this quote directly captures the message that Chazelle was attempting to convey with this film,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7271332/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2015,Is Greatness Achievable Without Adversity?,That J K Simmons is a versatile character actor is a given Simmons as a kind of second banana comedic foil has elevated just about everything he has been used in this guise for But Simmons is also an exceptional dramatic actor too when given the right part Whiplash gives Simmons the part that should remove any doubt about him being able to bring a character you love to hate to a kind of artistic visceral reality Simply put Whiplash couldn t rise to the rare air the story aspires for without such a performance No man is an island and though the screenplay and the direction by Damien Chazelle is succinct in totally building a great story without anything superfluous This is a movie with a powerful statement about humanity never veering into the maudlin The seriousness of this straightforwardly told story is brilliant and never fails to entertain It s anything but boring no matter if you give a whit about jazz music which is really not central at all It s about the intersection of beliefs self doubt and will to overcome whatever may come finding something held deep and dear Collateral damage is often painful raising questions of social morality which is to say it s complicated just like the real life it portrays Whiplash poses a big question are some of history s greatest men and women destined to be all they become or are they ripe for something that pushes changes them to achieve it If one is a student of history it seems it is very much the combination of certain events placed before a person inherent brilliance not withstanding that molds the final result Along the way many times the great person must reclaim their humanity as the price they ve paid may have stripped them of so much Only by finally espousing internal peace can the person have the combination of immortal like greatness and a well lived life Even fewer achieve this than greatness itself Whiplash intrigues the viewer while being extremely entertaining and moving to ponder this Saving this for last newcomer Miles Teller is not only utterly fantastic in his role of Andrew Neiman the protagonist but is one hell of drummer apparently too He nails the role all around A great movie highly recommended,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3162639/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2023,Toxic culture in music,This movie shows everything about the toxic practice culture in music It s an excellent message about pushing yourself further but not too far Jazz Is all about having fun and I guess the protagonist missed that idea being too caught up with himself In jazz you can only achieve perfection if you do what you enjoy and you show you enjoy it The drive to finding perfection I d expressing your feelings in your own music and expressing it with others slight spoiler ahead and I think it s the ending shows that magnificently It doesn t matter if you hit a wrong note if you play with your feelings that s all that s important and the movie is an excellent portrayal of teachers with the wrong idea of perfection,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8791710/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2023,A Terrific Masterpiece with a Subject Too Many of Us May be Familiar with,J K Simmons gives an unbelievable performance as a terrifying music instructor pushing his students beyond their limits to discover their true potential you will never see this talented actor the same way ever again after watching Whiplash This movie is a maddeningly stressful incredibly intense and psychological study on how a toxic student mentor relationship can have such a profoundly negative impact on a person s mind life and personality Have you ever had a teacher who was extremely harsh and who you dreaded being under the same roof as Who broke through the boundaries or chucked horrible insults right in your face Or who was even an abusive bully and swore loudly in the faces of his students Well the characters and concept of Whiplash were inspired off of writer director Damien Chazelle s own life experience with an intense music teacher Miles Teller takes on the role of a determined young drummer who desperately wants to succeed in music who is accepted into the band of a praised music instructor played by the one J K Simmons whose extremely harsh training methods push the students beyond his limits Damien Chazelle s role in the project although some musicians suggest that his writing isn t realistic enough is absolutely impeccable As said he s been in the similar shoes of the ambitious protagonist he s created so he knows how each scene s camerawork and angles should operate and the precise colour tone that will match the mood story themes and feels Whiplash also features one of the most intense and epic endings of movie history in a lengthy sequence The acting deserves a whole seperate page to discuss in full detail so forgive the specifics that aren t mentioned here but Whiplash isn t just a masterfully constructed drama that constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat It s also a heavily stressful and intense drama blessed with performances that couldn t possibly be more immersive If you ve been this passionate about success in a certain area before you ll be able to completely understand Miles Teller s character You will feel every disappointment every score all of his determination and passion and you ll feel just as under the risk as his character is But most of the weight you feel on your shoulders undeniably comes from Terrence Fletcher one of the greatest antagonists of all time enrolled by J K Simmons He is so damn terrifying and extremely traumatic as the enemy in Whiplash Due to the acting direction intensity and psychology of Whiplash it s easily one of 2014 s rare movie gems If you liked this review check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8882580/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2022,One Of The Best Films Of Its Decade,Essentially a conventional plot but there is so much that sets it apart as one of the best films of its decade The performances the script and the direction are of course essential to its success as is the economic run time But for me what really makes it sing is the way the movie s whole craft but especially the editing and cinematography cast it more as an action film than as something more conventional for the plot s structure Almost everything to do with music in the film is cast with military action overtones and the result is adrenalised breathless and thrilling with a romantic subplot that s also suffused with heart and soul All of this means that when a character falls trips or some other genuine physical incident it leaps off the screen and grabs the viewer with an intense impact that is missing in many genuine action films A question at the film s heart if the relationship between teacher and pupil is bullying abusive or inspirational is left tantalisingly unresolved in the care of the viewer meaning this is a film for heart soul and mind,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8136178/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2015,Electrifying and provocative,If anybody out there has a passion for something don t let anybody else take it away from you or push you to the edge no matter what If you re good at something do it There a lot of people out there who will provoke you endlessly and make your blood boil so do not give them that benefit This film made me believe in that fact once more and took my breath away Anybody with a dream an intention a vision of their future has to see this motion picture event This is not a musical this is not just a movie about drumming DO NOT walk in with that misconception WHIPLASH is a both electrifying and provocative well paced drama that asks what is the true definition of motivation or as the AFI see it What is the line between mentor and monster I urge you to check it out If you re not at the edge of your seat while watching this once in a lifetime masterpiece something is wrong with you,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3193593/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2020,Tremendous Filmmaking,An outstanding piece of filmmaking that keeps you invested from start to finish Phenomenal acting performances By Miles Teller and J K Simmons and expert editing and cinematography all of which contribute to maintaining the intensity of the film A superb soundtrack and sound quality the music is amazing,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6168088/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2015,"Excellent story, excellent music",I loved this movie A tight script with two nasty dueling main characters The teacher student relationship has been explored many times before but in this movie the twist is that both are unpleasant in their own way Both Teller as Andrew the student and Simmons as Fletcher the teacher were very good and Simmons did deserve the Oscar For once I loved that I did not need to pick a side but I could just enjoy the ride and see how these two ambitious arrogant and toxic personalities were going to hurt or help each other Also I do not usually like open endings but in this case I found it very appropriate The music is great as it was expected The photography is also good and the story does not drag along for a single minute as it happens far too often nowadays Highly recommended,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3189431/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2015,"Blood, sweat and jazz",I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3376068/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2015,who knew,Many of us have watched J K Simmons sail through film and television for years And to think all this time he had this kind of ability It reminds me of Melvyn Douglas second banana in dozens and dozens of films playing similar roles and then suddenly becoming one of the greatest actors of our time with Hud and I Never Sang for My Father Miles Teller and Simmons star in Whiplash from 2014 and no surprise to anyone Simmons took home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar He plays Fletcher a sociopathic manipulative instructor in a music conservatory who abuses his students psychologically Teller plays a young man Andrew who wants to be a great percussionist better than any of them including Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker He tolerates the abuse and becomes arrogant with success only to be humiliated by Fletcher It is a deep psychological battle of wills If you haven t seen the film you will not believe the lengths that Andrew goes to in order to be on stage as first drummer There s a nice turn here by Paul Reiser as Andrew s father Having been a musician myself and having been psychologically abused by several teachers I can tell you that this kind of torture is terribly destructive The only survivors are people who are driven and willing to give everything they have to their music at the expense of everything and everybody else Is Andrew one of them You ll have to decide for yourself Great soundtrack powerful acting from Teller and Simmons this low grossing film proved to be a real winner,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3366051/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2015,The Suffering Artist,Unconventional for a Film about Musicians but Not Uncommon for a Sports or Military Movie this is a Unique Take on the Disciplined Disciples of an American Art Form Miles Teller and J K Simmons Play a Student and Teacher Relationship that is the Stuff of Legend but mostly Mythological Methods of Honing Raw Talent into Greatness The Film is Ripe with Overstated but Eloquent Dialog and Snazzy Musical Accompaniment when things finally conclude It is a Rather Rich Display of Impromptu Talent as the Student Drummer has His well Deserved Moment in the Spotlight and makes the most of it The Film s Detractors are want to Point Out that it is a Dehumanizing Display of a Sadistic Fascist Overlord But what makes the Film Work is its Off Toned Setting in the Elite Musical Education School that is on the Surface Less than Believable But what does Surface is the Real Competitive World among Artists and the Sacrifices Needed to Excel The Movie Never displays Verisimilitude concerning the Methods of Cruel Behavior by the Instructor or wants them to be Authentic but more of a Surreal Statement on the Reality It is Hyper Fiction and its Disguise is Evident throughout and Not to be taken Literally It s a Fresh Film Experience that is Thought Provoking Inspiring Conversations and Debate Overall It s Better than just a Good Job,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3229512/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2016,Excellent,I enjoyed this film on many levels Being a drummer myself obviously the subject matter was of great interest to me The acting performances were excellent especially J K Simmons This guy is like a good wine he improves with age I loved him in Juno However Whiplash must be his defining role I was delighted to see this was recognised at the Academy Awards I was very impressed with Miles Teller too He first came to my attention in the film Rabbit Hole An excellent young contemporary actor I would recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in music and enjoys films with a good dose of gritty realism And again look out for J K Simmons in scintillating form Enjoy,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3389062/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2015,Enthralling story,An enthralling story set against the backdrop of a prestigious music school It covers one young man s attempts to reach the top of the musical industry and the band leader who may be his ticket or his nemesis A deeply psychological drama it explores issues like ambition obsession and power Has a few interesting twists too especially towards the end Not perfect some of the twists aren t consistent character wise The final scene overplays the conclusion and is too neat in some ways Despite this it missed having a final word on one or two of the themes leaving these as secondary considerations in favour of a more Hollywoodesque ending Decent performance by Miles Teller in the lead role Superb performance by JK Simmons as Fletcher the band leader He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a performance that is searingly intense and perfect for the character,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3201439/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2022,Drums Along The New York,Two things I don t like drum solos and bullies I m not a jazzer but I ve attended enough pop and rock concerts to know that when the spotlight falls on the drummer it s usually time to head to the gents or the bar And there s a lot of drum solo ing in this movie trust me Then there s the bullying by J K Simmons brutal foul mouthed domineering music teacher Terence Fletcher at the fictitious New York music conservatory where he s putting together this year s prestigious college jazz band I don t like seeing people bullied and have experienced a little of it in my own life and working career The questions this movie posits are whether such bullying is ever justified and how much a musician or by extension any artist has to sacrifice to be the best Here Fletcher rules his class of students by fear frequently resorting to foul mouthed expressions of most of the major bigotries to supposedly goad his charges to going beyond their limits and in so doing become the next Charlie Parker or Louis Armstrong He tells an anecdote about a fellow musician nearly decapitating the young Parker with a flying drum cymbal for not playing in time which he tells us inspired young Bird to come back better and stronger So is artistic bullying justifiable then Nah I still think that any kind of bullying is just an abuse of power by one person over another and can never be condoned Especially if it breaks a victim or two along the way as we learn happened to an earlier Fletcher student years before Miles Teller is the ambitious young drummer slavishly devoted to his drum kit playing Buddy Rich CD s every waking minute until it takes over his life When he starts to date a pretty young non music student played by a pre Supergirl Melissa Benoist the old argument arises as to whether he will put his art before his love life The film ended by pleasantly surprising me on the girl friend front but not on the musical angle There s not much wrong with the acting the leads in particular Simmons is convincing as the tyrannical music teacher while Teller s apparent prowess on the drums is impressive to witness bolstering a credible performance in his role as the driven young man On the technical front there was some sharp editing on the musical numbers and the music itself was fine even if not really recognisable to me It crossed my mind though that for such a freeform style of music this teacher s almost maniacal obsession with tempo and hitting the right notes seemed to contradict the improvisational ethos of jazz I m currently taking piano lessons from a young music teacher I know that even if I magically woke up tomorrow to find it was Groundhog Day I ll never be the next Glenn Gould or Oscar Peterson but I do know that I welcome my tutor s patience and encouragement and would rail against the obsessive rages of a teacher like Mr Fletcher So I found it difficult to credit the truth of both the abhorrent method of teaching and the pupils acceptance of it to the extent that it spoilt my enjoyment of the movie I m pretty certain that Charlie Parker and Louis Armstrong weren t taught like that either,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7839793/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2015,A superb horror-drama and the year's best!,Few might expect an indie drama about a dysfunctional mentor student relationship about jazz drum can be such a thrilling adrenaline drive WHIPLASH which not only proudly joins the elite top 8 in the upcoming Oscar BEST PICTURE nominees but is also counted as a major contender in for a harvest with J K Simmons indisputably has BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR in his bag It is also hard to imagine this is only young director Damien Chazelle s second feature after his less seen debut GUY AND MADELINE ON A PARK BENCH 2009 WHIPLASH is such a full grown piece of gem with the slithering camera movement a plethora of intensive close ups and snappy editing a buzzy audio surrounding and the irresistible jazzy soundtrack it engages us with a daunting study of the pursuit of being the greatest and a spellbinding and unblemished mental orgasm in its fierce solo drum finale Structurally the film is unsparing wrangle of dual dynamism between Andrew Teller a 19 year old initiated into an eminent music school in New York and his instructor Terrence Fletcher Simmons whose method is unapologetically radical he has a firm conviction that there is only one way to elicit a prodigy s true potential which is through high handed pressure and unyielding dismissal good work is the most vicious remark to nip a prospective genius in the bud as the jazz titan Charlie Yardbird Parker if his tutor had not thrown a cymbal to him after a mediocre performance he would not be the short lived legend in the history of music he died in the age of 34 and was a severe dug addict Of course his one sided theory cannot convince all the audience and the truth is his famous Charlie Parker vignette is mistakenly conceived However Andrew is aspiring to become someone like Parker he professes to prefer dying young but being one of the greatest to living a conventional life of longevity so in some extent they have a tacitly consensual sadomasochistic relation which they both need as a pivot for Andrew it is the external incentive he needs to push him to reach raw passion over pure skill and more sinisterly is for Terrence he is no way a selfless tutor to find a talent like Andrew is the ultimate solution to fulfill his own recognition of his entire life he does t have the potentiality but he has the keen eyes to detect one in the final act Chazelle manifestly tears off Terrence s mask of sanctimony lays bare the selfishly motivated intention of retaliation and the final twist is superlatively terrific in one hand they both get what they want but for viewers it is less uplifting than chilling to witness Andrew s transcendence like in a horror fare Andrew has to morphed into a monster in order to fight back another monster if this is the only way to achieve the greatness I will never second to that kind of atrocity and greatness doesn t matter under this circumstance Miles Teller is formidably stunning as Andrew with extra credits given to his prowess as a supposedly talented drummer fully shoulders on Andrew s rite of passage from a squeaker to a full charged powerhouse not just with Terrence where he never flinch but also in the scenes with others in particular during the sparse screen time with his new girlfriend Nicole Benoist Teller s bent as a camera friendly leading material does outstrip his relatively bland looks it is a huge shame that he is not in the talk of Oscar race for this outstanding performance Yet again the MVP is Simmons his Terrence is a more intelligent and malevolent update of R Lee Ermey s Sergeant Hartman in Kubrick s FULL METAL JACKET 1987 9 10 like a kicking time bomb we never know when he will explode even in his kindest moments he is spine chilling to behold from the protection of a screen makes viewers wonder how can those survive in his studio band or even co exist in the same place that is the charisma of such a powerful portrayal no praise is overstated Finally this film jumps to my current No 1 of 2014 and good luck in the Oscars,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3185602/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2016,Way overcooked but hugely entertaining,I ve never quite understood why it s become a pejorative to refer to a movie as manipulative Truth is most of us go to the movies to be manipulated That s kind of the whole point Writer director Damien Chazelle at least on the evidence of this sophomore feature Whiplash is a master manipulator The movie is a sleek machine that works you over and bats you around until the climax incites the audience into the kind of frenzy I haven t seen in an auditorium since Rocky beat Drago It s viscerally thrilling and distressingly hollow Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew as aspiring young jazz drummer studying at a New York conservatory Hopelessly devoted to his craft the kid catches the ear of this school s legendary instructor Terence Fletcher Played by the great J K Simmons as if auditioning for the lead in an R Lee Ermey biopic Fletcher is a bullet headed ball busting martinet an emotionally abusive sadist of almost super villain proportions He recruits Andrew for his competitive Studio Band and then proceeds to humiliate badger and berate his new pupil to the brink of a nervous breakdown It s Fletcher s belief that if Jo Jones hadn t thrown a cymbal at Charlie Parker s head during a gig for which he was ill prepared the wet behind the ears saxophonist never would have buckled down and become Bird Fletcher throws a lot of cymbals and plenty of other stuff too He s had it up to here with a generation raised on participation trophies and he excoriates the words good job Fletcher demands excellence no matter how many obscenities homophobic epithets and pieces of furniture he has to hurl at his students to get the desired result The sheer pleasure of watching J K Simmons in this role should not be understated A key utility player in this past decade s films finally stepping into the spotlight he conducts temper tantrums with mathematical precision at times diabolically lulling the kids into a chummy sense of security before unleashing his splenetic rage Clad in black muscle tees Fletcher is often half glimpsed lurking in the shadows like a B Movie monster If I ve learned anything from Whiplash and the 1980 Fame it s that Performing Arts Schools in New York City are lit like the Corleone family living room Andrew flourishes under his mentor s drill sergeant methodology and the film begins to feel like a sick parody of inspirational teacher movies Desperate never to end up like his schmucky father Paul Reiser perfectly cast the kid callously tosses aside his girlfriend Melissa Benoist and practices all day and night until his hands bleed recurring shots of which Chazelle is a bit overly fond Whiplash subscribes to the notion that artistic greatness requires monastic self abnegation a canard that s ruined many young men s lives and gets taken out behind the woodshed in next week s Listen Up Philip Expanded from a short film that similarly dominated Sundance in 2013 this story has won so many festival awards in one form or another I half expect juries to start inventing new categories in which to give it prizes Whiplash raises a lot of pertinent questions about bullying and self discipline only to sheepishly back away without exploring them in any depth Chazelle s script leans on a couple of eye rolling contrivances and I think it s long past time to retire the de rigueur out of nowhere car accident tossed in at the end of the Second Act to raise the stakes whenever screenwriters can t figure out a way to do so organically Of course nothing else matters if you can wow em with the ending and Whiplash has a doozy Andrew and Fletcher finally square off onstage in a kinetic feverishly prolonged musical crescendo It s a breathtaking sequence with editor Tom Cross syncopated Fosse cuts ramping up the intensity to an almost surreal nearly unbearable pitch Whiplash has the kind of finale that makes you momentarily forget all your reservations about everything that came before No surprise to discover that Damien Chazelle was a musician before he became a filmmaker His real gift is for playing a crowd,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601920/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2016,Artificial Drama,I give a 4 10 because J K Simmons performance and good music Otherwise it s a film that is neither realistic nor credible It is obvious that that has been written and directed by a young director as consistency conspicuous by its absence since the dramatic and exaggerated concept has been put ahead to good sense and tact All the drumming bleeding scenes are misplaced nobody bleeds as a result of playing drums as well as the attitude of students to a teacher who is totally unbearable chairs crashing against the wall insulting and disrespecting them constantly which students replies with an incredible yes sir as if they were in the Army Today i think anyone can t put up with that kind of attitude unless you have a very low self esteem 4 10,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3410265/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2023,Predictable load of rubbish,I ve been avoiding this movie for years because its synopsis sounded like a warning I could imagine almost from scene to scene a really terrible film that I would hate But the tons of raving reviews always bugged me It can t be that bad can it So finally I watched it And it was exactly the load of rubbish I expected it to be I have not hated a movie this much since Into the Wild It s gratuitous predictable dragging on just horrible Horrible as a movie horrible as a message It was not about pushing someone to their boundaries just simply about torture A disgusting person without any humility or compassion who loves to humiliate and hurt those who look up to him for no legitimate excuse and for some reason is allowed to do so without consequences for who knows how long What he s doing has nothing to do with developing talent it s purely evil sadism All in all this is a vile movie with zero redeeming qualities It was a waste of time Whatever you want to teach this is not how it s done A real teacher does not have to resort to demeaning their pupils I just can t stress enough who much I do not recommend this so called movie,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8836640/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2021,Very Steady Film,I d like to start by saying I love Miles Teller I m also a fan of JK Simmons I thought this movie was actually one of the best if not the best performance by Simmons Absolutely electrifying delivery of every scene every piece of dialogue every bodily and facial gesture I think as film viewers we re typically used to several settings and a variety of locations this movie is 70 filmed in the music room I think this is why I only gave the movie an 8 because I m so used to movies where theres 20 50 settings scenes throughout the movie This is not the type of behaviour I want to adopt but unfortunately this is the mainstream mindset and I ve become susceptible to it However I did think because of this circumstance it provided a level of originality and uniqueness It balances itself with all variables considered I m just leaning towards a rating of 8 P S that final 10 minutes absolutely star struck me I really thought there was going to be some civility between the two but then again we see a wicked backstab if you know you know Anyway well done directors and team although I m late to the party nice to get a taste of a new type of genre or idea,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7325385/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,MY FAVORITE FILM OF THE DECADE!,First THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST F ENDINGS IN FILM HISTORY Now thats out of the way I have no remorse nor hesitation in saying that Whiplash is my favorite film of the decade Written and directed by Damien Chazelle the film absolutely demolishes the cliches of musical prodigy genre through an unrelenting plot of psychological violence and sadomasochistic battle of wills With energetic and precise camera work and editing the films themes of awe inspiring jazz and physical breaking points pop out like blood on Andrew s crash cymbal JK Simmons was an absolute marvel rivaling Heath Ledger s Joker as the most compelling and ruthless characters I have ever seen in a picture He is profane uncompromising and intense capturing every scene with jaw dropping bravado Overall given there are no two words in the English language more harmful than GOOD JOB I end my blurb with a 10 over father F 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7904944/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2017,Whiplash will **** you like a pig!,WHIPLASH was directed by Damian Chazelle and stars Miles Teller and Jk Simmons In an attempt to become the next greatest musician Andrew Miles Teller enlists at Shafer Conservatory a New York music school where he is brought into a local band where he meets Terrence Fletcher JK Simmon a music teacher renowned for his peculiar methods who pushes him to the edge of his ability mentality and sanity Oh my god this movie is amazing It s not a simple story of about drumming and some bloke with a pig fetish It s a deep heartfelt story about obsession and commitment and what that can do to a man Miles Teller delivers a career defining performances as Andrew but is greatly overshadowed by JK Simmons Simmons take this movie from good to great and elevates it to amazing Considering this is Chazelle s debut feature it s a god damn amazing first attempt If you ve not seen this literal masterpiece please do yourself a favour and see it This story is not just a simple story about music I hate it when people say that This is a dark story about how obsession can drastically affect your life Chazelle has masterfully wrote this harrowing tale and if is his opener I cannot wait to see his final piece Combine Chazelle s awesome plot and screenplay with a fantastic climax and a brave bold ending and you have a freaking awesome drama that I see debuting a very promising career To say that Captain Pig Fetish was anything less than awesome spectacular and amazing in this movie would be an insult to his wonderful performance He made this movie his personal pig and took it to town Without him I dare say this movie wouldn t be as good as it is and he definitely elevates this movie above everything else Accompanying Simmons is the amazing Miles Teller who plays his role of Andrew expertly and is the perfect protagonist for this movie His more barren emotionless nature really fits in with the themes of this movie and helps sell them to a tee The chemistry between Simmons and Teller is one of the best things in history I adore them in this movie This movie is also technically flawless The cinematography is awesome throughout especially the climax where the camera moves in line with the music I think it s an excellent looking movie and definitely proves that Damian Chazelle has promise Another note is how dark and bleak the colour pallet is for the costumes and sets This might seem like a bad thing but I personally think it works perfectly in line with the themes in the movie I cannot find a major flaw with this movie Granted there isn t really such thing as a flawless movie but I cannot find a major flaw that takes you out of the viewing experience The music is excellent I mean the acting is spectacular Perfectly written spectacularly directed and honestly one of the best dramas made in the past decade Please watch this movie if you haven t it s an amazing movie and you will definitely not be disappointed I d rate it a 10 10 purely for the pig line alone,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3720416/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2021,"Made me love Jazz, and fear J. K. Simmons",If you love full metal jacket you ll love J K Simmons s performance in this film He steals every frame he s in but don t let that overshadow the outstanding work done by the rest of the cast particularly Miles Teller who absolutely sells the theme of how far somebody will push themselves for greatness and the eventual cost of that The editing is fantastic and is probably what creates most of the suspense throughout the film most prominently the ending That ending is a perfect culmination of all of the features I ve talked about This movie left me with a feeling of excitement that I only feel when I ve seen something I loved,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7033660/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2015,"Powerful Drama, but Not Something Worth Recommending",Much has been written about Damien Chazelle s film with its powerful portrayal of a learner educator relationship where the educator Fletcher J K Simmons goes to extreme lengths to establish mastery over his talented drummer learner Andrew Miles Teller In terms of dramatic effect the film communicates extraordinary power through the use of close ups that show Fletcher s intensity which becomes so intense that we might expect that he has some kind of masochistic sexual attraction towards his learner This might be true but the director s attitude towards the material remains frustratingly ambivalent Are we meant to view Fletcher s behavior with a critical eye as an example of what happens when an educator becomes jealous of the talent of his learners and vents his frustration through conscious sadism Or does the director have a kind of perverse attraction towards his central character which helped J K Simmons win an award for his performance Whatever the rights and wrongs of the film s morality I have to say that I found it offensive Perhaps I am allowing too much of myself to permeate this review but as someone involved in training educators of all disciplines I think that the content offers a highly negative representation of educator power and how it can be so readily abused Director Chazelle might defend his film using the famous Hitchcock dictum It s only a moooovie but the fact that it generated so much worldwide publicity attests to its power to generate viewer reaction,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3342977/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2014,One of the best films of the year.,There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job Fletcher J K Simmons Fletcher and his uncompromising ninja teaching methods do not include praise for pupils in Whiplash or in any Marine squad facing a stolid drill instructor This intense drama about a young drummer Andrew Miles Teller who attends a Julliard like music school has the advantage of hyperbole an abusive coach who coaxes performance beyond expectations by verbally and physically pushing his studio band to reach the best they can do Because Teller was already a drummer before he took this part the many shots of him drumming at a furious pace as he pursues Buddy Rich s ghost have a real feel the bloody hands remotely suggesting a Christ like devotion to perfection The sacrifices demanded by Fletcher rise above the trite into a moving commentary on the challenges necessary to become great not just in music but in life itself When the driven Andrew must cut loose his girlfriend because he sees she ll distract him from his goal of becoming the best drummer it is apparent that bloody hands and wounded hearts will be the constant companions in the pursuit of greatness Writer director Damien Chazelle and DP Charone Meir cut frequently to Andrew s blazing bloody drummer hands to show the painful grandeur of excellence We are only too aware that few humans are capable of such extreme passion The core of Whiplash is the conflict between gentle nurturing a popular learning philosophy over the last few decades and the coaching that brooks no weakness never admits greatness and sometimes produces a Charlie Parker Or Max Roach Or Buddy Rich the apparent inspiration of Andrew s ambition The film is dominated by Fletcher s take no prisoners method whereby he pushes to get performances beyond expectations Both Simmons as the musical DI and Teller as the ambitious young musician should get Oscar nominations Whiplash is just that a head turning experience I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody s idea of success Andrew,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3125384/?ref_=tt_urv

Simmons, powerful direction and a tale of inspiration from the world of obsession",A new work of a young director Damien Chazelle s Whiplash is a total blast of sweat from start to finish It gives you a false sense of security as the film begins with a young finely talented student Andrew Neyman Miles Teller plays the drums as he dreams to be the finest drum artist appreciated by others of his new generations Then he comes across with a rather different type of a music instructor who will cause anything to realize a student s potential of music As these two characters conflict on each other most of the film progresses these events with very intense sequences that made my hands dripping with sweat Whiplash can be diverse into a category of a dramatic film relating to the main topic of jazz music and a thriller film that never lets the audience take a deep breath of comfort throughout The film illustrates perfectly of what every student might have feared the worst teacher who considers as enemies towards his her s student who will do literally commit anything to find his or her s potential An instructor Terence Fletcher J K Simons is the exact type of professor that always challenges the student to a hole of death which they can never climb to breathe fresh air While the instructor being very relentless and brutally eager he has a side of appreciation as he peels off layers of the student s potential J K Simons portrayal and performance of this fearful relentless instructor is one to appreciate and gives a courageous and terrifying performance in which we as an audience starts to be violated like as Andrew Neyman In the other hand a hard working inspiring student acted by Miles Teller who has a true dream by heart is the one who meets Terence Fletcher as an instructor and gets horribly treated called with varieties of swearwords and psychologically tormented is so heartbreaking and unbelievably touched He gives a woody and thoughtful performance as he the protagonist gets forced to fall down to a hell and rise up facing a somewhat battle against Terence Fletcher J K Simons It is so riveting of a process of how these personally opposite people clash with each other This film is intense inspiring and hand gripping from start to finish making it a brilliant praiseworthy filmmaker Damien Chazelle one to look forward to and be inspired Also a riveting vehicle for stars J K Simons and Miles Teller ones worth ed to be complemented This film has no sharp or outstanding flaws making this one of the finest pieces of work of that time of period This is definitely one of the best films of 2014 I knew nothing but a confessed drum artist but glad that this film exists to illustrate these stories in an unconventional method,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3688759/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2020,Impossibly good,This is a masterpiece film and it s the first film this Director ever made A complete control of his craft on his first go What an amazing film I m blown away,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5811746/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2015,An intense and mesmerizing masterpiece,Whiplash was the most intense and exhilarating movie experience that i had throughout all of 2014 This movie did not slow down a single bit as it told the gripping and mesmerizing story of a boy striving to be the best jazz drummer in the world with the assistance of one of the most hilarious and memorable characters of the year J K Simmons put in the best performance of his career and the most exciting and exhilarating performance of the year as this very talented and at time frightening jazz instructor As a supporting actor whenever he was on screen i was in awe at just how compelling his character was sometimes you are afraid of him and other times you can t take your eyes off how spectacular he is at what he does Miles Teller also killed it in his performance as the boy who had a single goal in life and blew me away with the level of his talent The back and forth chemistry between these two fantastic actors made for the best highlights of the movie There were hilarious moments scary moments and even emotional moments as the movie explores how their relationship evolves over time in ways that you would not have initially expected This film does a lot to surprise you and gave some of the most memorable moments of the year And just as it starts off strong it finishes even stronger with one of the most intense and inspiring finales in recent years This movie was such a great experience that it is one of the best films of the year with some of the best performances seen in 2014 9 7,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3156705/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2014,Good Job,Andrew Nieman is a shy freshman in the Schaefer Conservatory of Music in New York City He does not have friends as he is always obsessively practicing on his drums He catches the attention of a notoriously hard driving teacher Terence Fletcher Fletcher recruits Andrew to join his studio jazz band There Fletcher pushes Nieman to perfect playing of his instrument with an abrasive instruction style that teeters on military drill sergeant abuse both physically and emotionally Will Andrew make it through or will he snap under the pressure Miles Teller is a young star on the rise He was in three other films this year alone That Awkward Moment Divergent and Two Night Stand He is set to be seen as Mr Fantastic in the reboot of The Fantastic Four next year along with four other films Whiplash proves that he is also a serious actor to reckon with As the drums prodigy Andrew Teller looks like he mastered playing that drum set for real for this difficult role Unlike the piano it is hard to fake playing the drums His passion in playing is palpable from across the screen J K Simmons whom many of us only know as J Jonah Jameson Peter Parker s boss in the Tobey Maguire Spider Man films plays the irascible Mr Fletcher a teacher who is never satisfied with only good enough He plays a hateful character who tended to exceed his boundaries as a mentor but Simmons imbues Fletcher with other layers so we do not only see him as just the villain Be it in his expletive laden tirades or with just one penetrating stare Simmons drips a malevolence we all feel Whiplash features some glorious jazz performances since this is about a jazz band I personally do not like jazz so much but the precision of the playing and the richness of the music is hard to resist The perfectly edited scenes showing the band as they played the most formidable looking sheets of music had the vigor and energy of a sports match That super intense final scene alone will literally keep you at the edge of your seat The audience in the theater where I watched erupted into spontaneous applause when it ended This is certainly not just another Mr Holland s Opus or Music of the Heart Writer and director Damien Chazelle gives us the same basic student teacher drama and beautiful music but presented his story in a most unexpectedly disturbing suspenseful violent and even horrific way,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3107787/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,Absolutely blown away,I was bored one night and thought to myself why not Boy did I enjoy this movie This touched me in a way only Interstellar and Shutter Island have managed to do Absolutely amazing acting script and film making Just an amazing movie Only the 3rd 10 I ve ever given in over 65 movies,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7672767/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2015,This is no way to get the best drummer out of.,Being a musician all my life and seeing this film makes me hate the main character And more the teacher He practices all wrong and he always has accuses The best drummer doesn t made from playing fast that is so stupid The best drummer doesn t made from playing stiff this is even more stupid And the best music teacher surely doesn t made from a tough guy who do not the first thing how to teach you can not push students like that to make great musicians The whole point is to relax and feel the music And swing is about feel the beat You need to master the slow tempo so you can then be more accurate at higher tempo What his film try to communicate about practicing and being the best musician is absurd I stopped half way through the film I just couldn t watch this non sense anymore The main character does also looks very dumb as a person and worst as a musician and I believe not many musicians can relate to that I wish this film deliver the right message about what being the real musician is all about If you get that wrong then everything is wrong,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3225022/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2015,J.K. Simmons deserved his Oscar for his performance in Whiplash,Just watched this on Netflix disc with my mom She was perhaps puzzled by many scenes especially the ending She certainly wasn t in love with J K Simmons pretty sadistic music teacher character Simmons Oscar winning role does show quite the range of emotions concerning his wanting his students showing how much excellence according to him he wants to get from them His recounting the story of Charlie Parker and of a former student who died which he says happened one way but we find out later it was in a much different way does humanize him in a way that one would feel for him And Miles Teller is great as the one student who seems obsessed with this teacher in trying to achieve greatness I also liked his scenes with Paul Reiser as his father The one question one should probably ask is if the ends of the way the movie goes on justify the means that it achieved when it got there So on that note I highly recommend Whiplash,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3231089/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2016,'Whiplash' is A Whip-Smart Entertainer that Doesn't Miss A Beat!,In Whiplash JK Simmons plays Terence Fletcher the tyrannical conductor of a prestigious music conservatory who believes in pushing them to breaking point and beyond in his own insatiable quest to unearth the new Charlie Parker But while imposing impossible standards on everyone it is talented drummer Andrew Neyman Miles Teller who finds himself singled out for the maestro s ferocious attention So when Fletcher tells the promising percussionist to have fun you know he means the opposite Unless your idea of fun is being bullied humiliated and played off against your hapless band mates But Andrew is determined to shed all the blood sweat and tears it takes to become the band s lynch pin What follows is a sadomasochistic battle of wills between teacher and pupil as Fletcher terrorizes torments and humiliates the young recruit pushing him ever harder to see whether he snaps to the rhythm or breaks in two The ensuing film is a tour de force that defies easy stereotyping Shot in 19 days on a shoe string budget Whiplash moves at a whip crack pace that takes its rhythmic cues from drumming Written and directed by Damien Chazelle and partly inspired by his own experiences as a jazz drummer in high school the film offers dark rip snorting fun that inspires a whirlwind of emotions before leaving you on an exhilarated high His script is adept at dropping explosive one liners but it is also fiercely intelligent in the way that it poses questions while also serving up characters who are worth hanging out with His direction meanwhile is pretty much pace perfect in the way that it hits all the right beats yet is savvy enough and confident enough to toss in some curve balls The kinetic editing cuts with finger snapping dexterity making the film pop with a rim shot twang and adding a visual flourish At its racing heart beats a performance of splenetic majesty from JK Simmons as the fearsome Fletcher a despot in F major who conducts the music school like it s the Marine Corps only with harsher language He is a sinewy symphony of physicality his poised fingers waving the drama onward apace his endlessly expressive eyes alert and ablaze and his razor sharp mouth playing the paper cut dialogue like a demonic fiddle Teller is terrific too as the young gun bleeding for his art wholly convincing as the raw talent in whom even the most poisonous taskmaster can hear the distant drums of greatness Damien Chazelles greatest achievement lies in the fact that even when the drama descends into parodist para diddles and melodramatic car crashes there s a splashy impressionist energy which keeps us locked into its insistent rhythm Come the last beat you ll probably be exhausted But you ll also feel entertained inspired and wonderfully alive For all its overripe contrivance you ll leave the cinema with a spring in your step and a thump in your chest The ovation starts here,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3406758/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,The Line,Genius How many have been lost throughout time because they weren t recognized nurtured pushed given the necessary freedom Whiplash asks that question And then the necessary corollary How far is too far There is no way of answering either question because every case is different But through the story in Whiplash we see both ends of the spectrum From the waste of genius unrealized to the pain and loss resulting from genius being mishandled It makes you appreciate genius realized even more And just an opinion while J K Simmons deserved every award he received for his portrayal of Fletcher Miles Teller was absolutely incredible in the role of Andrew The two perfectly complemented each other,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7243728/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,Mr. Fletcher is a BULLY,Although JK Simmons performance it s gold In my opinion he was not teaching nor inspiring his students in the contrary he was intimidating them BULLY them I finished watching the movie not just because I am a Mole s fan but because I was expecting a twist in the story,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4671477/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,Awesome,What did I just witnessed It was hard hitting drama that tears you from inside The movie was just awesome There are no words to express what did I just watched There was tension filled in the movie and you get fully involved in the movie and connect with each character You can t get out of the story till the movie ends that s how much grasping it is The performances by both the leads especially JK Simmons was phenomenal He was fully dived into the character Overall it is a great watch You will surely love every aspect of this movie ie story screenplay acting pacing editing etc etc,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8604530/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2020,The Film that Made me a Cinephile,I remember watching this for the first time back in 2014 and admiring what an absolute masterpiece it was Amazing directing writing editing and acting All of the music in this movie is wonderful and will stay in your head for years Love how Andrew starts off so innocent and reserved but slowly descends into arrogance and narcissism Fletcher is the most thought provoking character in the film and one of the best written antagonists ever I ve noticed how the best villains are always presented as the most evil wretches before they explain themselves and almost make you agree with them this was also done well by Marvel with Thanos Seen plenty of movies but none of them have ever reached the heights of this Greatest film of all time 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6157464/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2015,"Raw, chilling, and intense",The movie is about Music you dive right in no character introduction or setting of any kind just Andrew Neiman Miles Teller and his set of drums Music is the lead Miles Teller and J K Simmons are just supporting at least that s how I saw the film You get to know who Andrew Terrence Fletcher Simmons are along the way but Music is front and center stage Of course the actors are important because their characters give life to the music The drums are once again a noble instrument in the film Having the camera focused on the drummer s perspective is what gives intensity Drumming looks how it should difficult to master It requires motivation dedication and passion Andrew Neiman Teller works really hard to try to achieve greatness The investment the sweat and pain needed for this instrument is tangible Andrew lives and breathes drumming it s in is blood Damien Chazelle achieved greatness delivering a powerful movie in which the drums and music transpire He got the best out of his actors and not only showed but made us feel Whiplash The film depicts this complex thrilling and emotional S M relationship between mentor and student It shows how far it can go when sacrifices are made and limits are not set The cast is beyond brilliant the eager Miles Teller and the impressive J K Simmons impersonate to perfection the student and his teacher Whiplash is raw intense and beautiful I got chills I got uncomfortable angry and pleased If I hadn t already I would understand passion determination and dedication look like watching this film Whiplash is a must see wornoutspines,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3162542/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2018,Utter nonsense,I m halfway through this film and don t think I ve ever seen such a load of utter nonsense As a professional musician myself it couldn t be less realistic in my experience Whilst some of the themes ring true it s otherwise a totally false picture of life at a music conservatoire and the music business and I don t think I can bring myself to even bother watching the rest of it AVOID,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4021605/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2015,Highly overrated,Not really a review but I just wanted to be one of the few in here to state that this movie is actually not so great In fact it s pretty average and this is coming from someone who loves movies nd drums That some people claim this to be the movie of the year is beyond me really The storyline is far from original and brought in a far from original way the acting is o k ish just Simmons though Teller is as weak as ever the little love angle that was put in might as well have been skipped and the story itself with the dictator like teacher who although the school principal said he was being watched can do what he wants is just totally implausible The only good thing was the end scene with the solo and all but just over the speakers with the screen turned off,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3177974/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,what this movie means to me,This 2014 masterpiece by writer and director Damien Chazelle is absolutely extraordinary Playing Andrew we have the amazing Miles Teller Miles really portrays Andrew in an astonishingly accurate way He plays the character brilliantly down to the little face twitches he makes as Andrew from the struggling drumming tempo to the tear down the cheek everything beautifully clicks right into place with Miles s part as Andrew Playing Fletcher we have the astonishing J K Simmons Simmons does an absolutely breathtaking performance of Fletcher From the heartwarming moments to the hardcore teaching methods everything is smoothly and accurately portrayed by J K Simmons himself,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7933850/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2014,Solid performances from the two leads.,This films takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions This film is carried by the two leads Miles Teller is stellar and J K Simmons delivers the best performance of his career as of now I haven t seen director Damien Chazelle s previous works but I ll be keeping an eye out for anything he makes in the future This is story that a lot of people can relate to Andrew Neyman Teller is a talented drummer and is committed to excellence and pursues to be the best of the best His teacher Terence Fletcher Simmons is equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods He leads the top jazz ensemble in the school Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band pushing him to his limits with mental and physical abuse What grabbed me in the film is the similar experience Andrew goes through with my experience with my family and at school I m an art student and as corny as it sounds my parents and teachers would push me to the limit to see if I can achieve greatness So with that being said the film asks many questions just how far are you willing to go to achieve what you aspire to be How bad do you want it And is it worth it The film also asks what is great art Objectively and subjectively All this pondered around my head and the story isn t even convoluted It asks the right questions relating to the film Miles Teller s performance is nothing short of amazing His performance alone matches J K Simmons He works hard to please himself and to please his instructor Fletcher You see him go through so much and he pours his blood sweat and tears to become the best he can be so much so that he puts off his relationship with his girlfriend Nicole Melissa Benoist to focus on his career There are tender moments with Andrew and Fletcher but even more tender moments with his father played by Paul Reiser who has an excellent supporting role In Andrew s eyes he loves his father but ultimately sees him as a failure for not achieving his dreams to become a writer Something he does not want to become I loved his performance in this film almost makes me somewhat optimistic about the new awful sounding Fantastic 4 reboot J K Simmons is great as the intimidating instructor a great all around drill instructor asshole performance He is a bit over the top which was kind of distracting He s so unlikeable in the film and you can t help but wish he gets what he deserves but also at the same time he s endearing in a way when he gets his point across to Andrew on why he s so harsh and so brutal Some pretty far fetched events happen along the way and that to me were the parts of the film that were apparent out of place and almost too good to be true But with that being said the editing is fantastic as is the flow and pacing of the film The performances are stellar as are the drumming sequences Whiplash is tense experience watching a student with a talent go through all this torment is exhilarating and also a bit depressing The film asks the right questions and although it gets a little preachy towards the end it s not in your face The performances alone is worth the admission 8 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3135674/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,"8.3/10 - Smooth, Straight-Forward but Well-Wriiten Dive Into Obsession",Whiplash directed by Damien Chazelle follows the young aspiring jazz drummer Andrew Neiman Miles Teller as he pursues his dream to become one of the greats His obsession fueled by his harsh teacher Fletcher J K Simmons leads him down a dangerous road How far will he go to achieve his goal This film is one of the gateway films that got me into cinema and I always loved it One thing that I felt even more strongly now after several watching experiences throughout the years is how smooth Whiplash manages to be I mean yeah it s jazz it s supposed to be smooth but even so the vibes are just IMMACULATE here The warm lighting the Justin Hurwitz produced soundtrack chef s kiss for that one the perfect editing in synch with everything Probably one of the best editing jobs I ve ever seen Fine fine stuff The psychological aspect of this film is pretty well done Quite straight forward but well written overall The way Fletcher just seizes power whenever he needs it effortlessly and over anyone is so uncomfortable to watch He is the puppet master no the ringmaster lashing his whip on the backs of his band unaware or purposefully ignoring how it might end with a huge crash and broken people J K Simmons really does a fantastic job here I can t say that I have big bugging issues with Whiplash but I will say this this film is a case of being simple yet effective It doesn t draw me in emotionally completely but it is sufficient in that aspect It s not mind blowing but it s a really really solid movie To conclude my short review Whiplash is accessible beautifully shot and edited and totally a vibe Its greatness lies in the smoothness of the music the editing the flow of the plot It s a simple straight forward exploration of obsession that works really well because it s delivered so perfectly I m feeling an 8 3 10 on this one,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8635685/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2014,Well made regardless of accuracy,Being a musician this film resonated with me and provided me with vivid flashbacks of feelings I endured when I was in band competitively trying to get the first chair horn parts in symphonic band The strange thing is I have come across plenty of other individuals who are also musicians that hate this film and I mean HATE this film because they feel this does not accurately showcase the music industry or musical process I suppose it all depends on the experience Of course I was never treated to the extreme measures that Miles Teller character endures from Simmons hardcore ways but let me just say that it doesn t take much to feel the pressure especially when you really want a part But regardless of how realistic the film is or how it makes me feel the film is well made So in my opinion Whiplash is an awesome film Miles Teller is on a crazy streak doing some decent movies and putting in even better performances but Whiplash definitely manifests his greatest effort thus far in his incredibly young career J K Simmons hands in one of his finest roles playing a mentor who taps the spirit of R Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket and throws acting punches when you think the film can t get any better Immediately as the credits began to roll I knew he had the Oscar The movie as a whole put me through a ride My nerves were being toyed with as I watched Miles Teller s character share screen time with J K Simmons The on screen chemistry is their and in full bloom And what puts the whole thing together The grade A soundtrack that acts as the lifeblood,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3136981/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2015,A brilliantly tense movie,Whiplash is a brilliantly tense movie It has a nice 90 s feeling to it The mental and physical battle between the ruthless instructor and the talented young drummer was so well written It reminded me a little bit of Ari Gold Llyod s relationship in Entourage JK simmons s performance as the instructor is very good but a lil overrated I personally think Miles Teller was better as the Drummer because his character had more layers to it Whilst the instructor is straight up unlikeable The drummer skips around from likable to unlikeable throughout the whole movie I also like how it asks the question Where is the line between motivation and abuse It is edited to perfection Not a dull or false moment throughout A Must See 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3204006/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2015,Quiet yet loud,I have to begin by appreciating Miles Teller He is a brilliant actor After watching Two night stand I thought he d be stuck doing rom coms but he does Whiplash and shines J K Simmons is a seasoned actor but plays his part amazingly All the tension and nervous energy that we feel in the movie is brought about mainly by Simmons He s mostly not likable and I like many others did not quite approve of his technique of pushing kids over the edge He should push but should also know when to stop Also I felt like the end dragged a bit although during the long final sequence I was cheering Teller for his drumming slap to Simmons It was definitely a great shot All in all I liked the movie very much and initially because of all the tension I wanted to stop watching but I did not and I am glad It has many golden moments that will make you go whoa There are a few points which required me to suspend my belief like the bleeding hands from drumming but I guess that just made the movie all the more intense A very good movie and although it did not inspire me it surely satisfied me and I will not be surprised if it bags more than a few awards,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3186952/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2015,A Very Interesting Perspective on a Typical Master/Apprentice Story,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3187010/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,A massive step in the right direction for American Films,Constantly we hear about the lack of substance modern entertainment contains This movie defies this generalization Whiplash is excellently constructed beautifully filmed and the actors achieve a rarely reached level of skill which collectively make it worthy of nine stars alone However it is Whiplash s display of the cost of greatness it s insight into the nature of sacrifice and ambition which make it a ten star film J K Simmons role personifies the aspect of human ambition centered around seeking greatness at all costs while Miles Teller shows the struggle of attempting to balance the losses To anyone who wants to see a quality well developed movie with an excellent deep plot watch Whiplash,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3198023/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,Difficult to watch and comprehend,The acting was good it had potential but it was TOO much The teacher pushed the boundaries beyond normality The teacher was abusive manipulative narcissistic and incredibly unhealthy The teacher was toxic position of power to control and scare young students into complete submission and fear through violence and verbal abuse The epitome of toxic I was hoping it would become better towards the end but the ending was not resolute in any way I would not watch this movie again It portrays a toxic and unhealthy version of success and hard work that is violent No one should aim for this or put this kind of behaviour on a pedestal Other reviewers commenting that this is the type of hard work ethic and motivation that people from the millennial generation are lacking or in need of need a serious reality check,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6797036/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2015,Intensely absorbing and energetic with two great performances,Whiplash is only the second movie of 2014 that overly exceeded my expectations first one being Nightcrawler Being neither a fan of jazz music nor finding a much stellar cast in this one I must say I was highly impressed Whiplash is a tightly wound experience that puts forth the intense relationship of a student with his literally brutal mentor Whiplash provides ample scope for deep study of its characters and their psychology Miles Tellers plays Andrew Nieman an aspiring Jazz drummer who is confident and talented One day at his music school the iconic main school band teacher Terrence Fletcher memorably performed by J K Simmons observers Andrew practicing He sees some spark in Andrew but isn t fully convinced of what he is capable of Fortunately for Andrew on another fine day Fletcher storms into their class asking each student to play what he wants and Andrew impresses playing something which he is very good at Flecther brings in Andrew into the main school band as an alternative drummer In order to become the main drummer Andrew has to face the seriously exhaustive and physically draining teaching methodology of Fletcher Fletcher s motive behind all this is to find the next big jazz star in his students for which believes one should defy the limits While Andrew is highly motivated and inspired climbing the ladder of success slowly but is unknowingly degrading his personal life He is unable to keep up with his girlfriend and also ends up with family issues Whiplash tries to portray what we mind end up with trying to achieve perfection in our field The ultimate successful moment is very rewarding but many of the earlier hardships and sacrifices get overshadowed Breaking down the various aspects of the film the thing that stands out is the performances by the two leads Miles Teller driving the enthusiasm and energy into the character of highly motivated drummer is really inspiring While J K Simmon s pitch perfect portrayal of the furiously scary mentor was raw and brutal Even if the character was unforgettable one thing I would like point out is that it would have been better if more light was shed on Flethcer personal life which would have made his character slightly more believable After the acting the terrific music and soundtrack absolutely sucked me into the jazz atmosphere The track Whiplash over which Flecther throws a chair at Miller for not reaching the perfection is mesmerizing Whiplash has made me a fan of jazz music out of nowhere The editing and cinematography is splendid which we can see that in the intense and energetic drumming sequences which will keep you glued to the screen The final drumming sequence in the climax was so exhilarating it gave me goosebumps Director Damien Chazelle who wrote the script himself keeps the screenplay focused on the two main characters The story is quite unpredictable and you can expect some twists here and there I found it hard to believe when I read somewhere that the whole film was shot in 19 days Nothing more to say Excellent To sum it up Whiplash is one movie of 2014 not to be missed 2014 has been really outstanding with films like Boyhood Birdman Nightcrawler etc and now another gem called Whiplash I am thankful for witnessing such quality film making Excellent performances with absorbing story and direction plus the jazz music on top of it made Whiplash a memorable experience which stayed with me for hours after finishing it It is energetically inspiring and heartfelt Don t miss it RATING 4 5 5,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3187392/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2021,"The Pursuit of Greatness is paved with blood, sweat and tears",The Good JK Simmon as teacher from hell Terence Fletcher is a career defining performance here up with J Jonah Jameson Him and Miles Teller have such a rich layered dynamic you can watch this movie over and over again and pick out different aspects of their relationship I love this film s editing which turn these musical sessions into exhilarating pieces More than anything though I love this film s ideas It s not a cut or dry story a lesser film would paint Fletcher as the unambigious bad guy and Andrew as the naive good natured protagonist Not this one Whiplash is an exploration of what it means to be GREAT We often talk about blood sweat and tears but what does that really mean What ends justify what means Are we so obsessed with comfort and making everyone feel okay that we are compromising drive and dedication Obviously the film doesn t cheer on Fletcher as he terrorizes his students But in Andrew s response to this we get a more complicated picture I love that The Bad honestly I would have loved to learn more about Andrew and his relationships but this movie justifies it with a taught tight script and quick editing It wants to get to the point I respect that The Ugly if you re easily offended you might want to sit this one out Seriously But if you can put your personal feelings about some of the language and actions aside and take the movie for what it is you won t be disappointed,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7027202/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2018,Amazing! An instant classic!,Not knowing anything about Damien Chazelle prior to seeing this when it came out allowed me to have very little expectations going into it Boy was I impressed After La La Land it s clear Chazelle is one of the best new directors out there It s hard to imagine that a movie about a competitive Jazz school could be as suspenseful as this Teller is terrific and clearly a skilled drummer in his own right J K Simmons performance is one of the most deserved Academy Award winning performances in a decade I still remember both my brother and I letting out a deep breathe after one particularly tense scene between Simmons and Teller If you have not seen this Jazz masterpiece add it to your WatchList ASAP,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4090853/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,Real depth,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7641029/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2016,Amazing acting; excellent movie overall,What I love about this movie is how it makes you feel exactly what the character s are feeling The acting is exceptional Andrew is a very relatable character even if you don t do music And don t even get me started on how phenomenally good J K Simons is in this he s a freaking master He s my new favorite actor Also Miles Teller impressed me I mean I saw him in Divergent The Spectacular Now and he wasn t bad But damn he was legit in Whiplash And one particular scene literally gave me the chills yall who saw the movie know what I m talking about like it was unreal I ve never been so immersed in a scene that I forget EVERYTHING ELSE except what s going on in the scene It s like this film moves out of the screen into your head and messes around with your emotions and thought process crazy stuff Just watch it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3448636/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2015,Well Done,There has been a lot reviews and comments on the musical and artistic integrity of the film that I am not qualified to comment on I can only take it for its face value and go from there as I am not a musician or a jazz expert This movie has a very simplistic plot and story to tell but the acting direction and camera work was excellent and really drew me into the movie with superb undertones and mood Plot wise it s a story about a boy with a dream and what he does to achieve that dream with possibly no understanding or is possibly being mislead into believing what is necessary to obtain that dream Truth is probably somewhere in between The acting is great The scenes between Andrew and Nicole I felt were stiff but the ones between Andrew and Fletcher more than made up for it with raw intensity and tension I highly recommend this film,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3205865/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2015,Sensational from start to finish,Whiplash reminded me of just how much I love films it made me feel alive it was an exhilarating experience from start to finish and it s without a shadow of a doubt the best film of 2014 The most disturbing thing is just how taken aback I was by the genius of Whiplash There is a staunch invigorating sense of malice about it there is tension that ebbs and flows and builds and the result is a work of inspired genius that leaves you pleading for more The film is edited deliberately like a finely tuned instrument hitting every line of dialogue and composing every shot with the sharpest precision The cuts are meticulously crafted with the strongest effect possible There is an arresting visceral sensibility about it There is a heavy emphasis throughout the film on the investment of blood and sweat required to play a piece of music perfectly in tune in tempo and on time Though not the primary genre of music I listen to I can certainly recognize that writer director Damien Chazelle is intensely knowledgeable on Jazz as a subject matter this holds him in good stead to deliver something purely inspirational with this film Miles Teller and J K Simmons develop a relationship of tectonic razor sharp attrition the likes of which I ve never witnessed It s a two man show of relentless ferocity Teller is astounding as a musician with aspirations of great Teller is given the much less flashy role of anchoring the movie in an emotional core he pulls it off flawlessly Simmons performance is nothing short of brilliant as the coach whose heavy handed tactics and unique methods he believes will reward him with a great student Simmons chews up the scenery at every given opportunity His character is possessed by an anecdote relating to Charlie Parker reaching the pinnacle of jazz drumming after getting a symbol thrown at his head He is rooted in the ideology that pushing people beyond what is expected of him will get him the results he craves It is through the underlying rooting of these ideas through the characters that give it that extra layer of texture that allows it to reach higher in during the centerpiece moments of the film There is an integral understanding of the fine line that exists between abuse and pushing someone mercilessly towards notorious greatness The finale is engaging pulsating exhausting and uplifting I was on the edge of my seat the hairs were standing up on the back of my neck and it was a sheer joy There may be some who are not as taken with it by its very nature a movie about jazz drumming I guess doesn t sound very exciting on paper Synopses are lame they never capture the true vision of the piece that can only be encapsulated by the sensory delights of the viewing experience I was floored shocked and amazing at its strength of conviction It put a smile and my face and a beat in my head for hours afterwards I am truly thankful for Whiplash it was a film firmly rooted in the ideas of what a film should be It had an in depth knowledge and understanding of its subject matter and showed the ability to be fearless and step out of the often stiflingly rigid narrative structures It s not afraid to be bold and take risks at the same time It was the definition of sensational,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3157327/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,Inspiring,No film has ever inspired me quite like Whiplash Whiplash is about the cost of greatness and how far someone is willing to go to achieve and or become what they ve always wanted The film answers this question in an unapologetically realistic fashion Which leads to one of if not the greatest ending in cinematic history The directing cinematography and editing are all perfect and unique And the fact that this was Damien Chazelle s directorial debut is unbelievably impressive The performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons are unflinchingly incredible But the main reason why I love this film is because of how much it has impacted me personally It doesn t just relate to people who are aspiring musicians it relates to all aspiring artists And as someone who may want to be a filmmaker one day I found that life changing Truly I wouldn t be the same if I never watched this film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7975964/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2014,Story doesn't convince,On 13 November Whiplash directed by Damien Chazelle starring Miles Teller and J K Simmons will premier at the Netherlands cinema This movie about an ambitious and talented drum player and his dominant relentless teacher is expected to do well based on the positive reception it had in many countries and at several festivals Even before its release the movie opened the Leiden International Film Festival and won the LIFF Indie Competition General appreciation is also shown at IMDb where the film scores 87 100 with about 4400 votes The story that the movie brings forward is not new Andrew a young drum player enrolls at the high class well reputed Shaffer Conservatory where he meets Fletcher an infamous teacher working with high standards and non compromising methods Andrew attracts his attention and a struggle between the two characters begins when Andrew secures the position of first drum in the school band practicing for the national school competition The movie focuses on the two main characters and the way in which they interrelate with the aim to realize the best drum performance for the school s honor but more so for their own prestige and ego Although the movie excels in cinematography acting and music provided you at least like some level of jazz music the story doesn t seem to convince The strict focus on the two men and their sole purpose leads to repetition in the narrative following the cycle of insult and pressure from the teacher hard work and pain by the student and short term victory for both when a performance succeeds Even at the end of the movie when things seem to turn around the teacher again tries to push the student into a great performance which he indeed delivers Additional characters such as the student s father girl friend or other musicians at the school are just there to support the main story They never get any depth or backgrounds and their role is minimal they are there to underline how determined and ambitious Andrew really is The school functions as decor with musicians as extra s and no sign of a board other teachers or school infrastructure Focusing on one aspect of a human relationship can produce interesting and compelling movies but Whiplash is not a good example Besides the elimination of all surrounding factors there is another possible reason why the story doesn t convince me The general idea underlying the story is that real talent blossoms with hardship and pain Consequently the message is delivered that it is good to bully and mistreat a student with talent so that he or she gets to full development To my mind this message is not true at least not always and needs more justification than a flat straight story about two egocentric men struggling for power and recognition,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3122354/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2016,Masterpiece that holds a truth seldom presented in films,This masterpiece film holds a rare honest view into the cost and need for excellence in millennials lives My expectations fairly low I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me as I am not one for jazz bands Expectations exceeded I think about this film quite often although I had to be begged to watch it Recommendation Film lovers and casual cinema goers I believe will enjoy this film Re watch value I have watched this film over 6 times since release Memorable I am still thinking about this film to this day,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3486269/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2019,A movie about competition but not music.,First I will start off by saying that this movie would be perfect for non musicians This may be a great gateway movie into understanding or even appreciating music theory or jazz for that matter May themes in the movie seem to be on the border of Hollywood hogwash when it comes to how over the top and unrealistic the scenes are I understand they do this to entertain as spread out of a demographic as possible But I feel it teeters on the verge of offensiveness to Jazz Music Schools and education The amount of allowed abuse that went on in the movie was a shock factor for viewers and they dragged it out so much to the point of extreme abuse The director has said they wanted to flirt with abusiveness in the film But I felt that what they did was beyond flirting All in All the movie had great acting and really good cinematography A lot of the playing in some scenes was completely fake but allowable and some scenes of the movie will really hit home to people who grew up with an obsession for music or a music background The movie never took you out of the moment it kept you in the seat for the whole time But after the movie was over it left a cheap thrill ride taste in my mouth Many of the complaints about the movie could seem pedantic but they are hard to ignore when a movie has such a specific theme they are working with All in all I give the movie a 6 10 and I would recommend as a good intense movie with a music background Especially for people who are not musically inclined,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5190076/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,One of the great movies that I have seen pity on transition between scenes can be a bit dragged,Love the camera work nicely done old school but nice effect The sound is good as background but also as main player not too soft or too hard and plays nicely in the scene It shows that hierarchy does exist especially in high pressure and high performance areas even though the senior levels want a more approachable environment a flatter structure As long as everybody feel the pressure and a misstep can cause their head even chances are given and human is possible When you are in that situation it is not a team sport anymore but individual so got praised or punished you are on your own and the movie really reflect it especially of the side players Love that they lift you up and take you down but for a reason but when chances are given what is in the end How far can you go Pity the guy acting is not that high maybe because the others are playing an above average quality It is nicely to see different level of passion and commitment people have even if they have the same opinion or situation The actions are bit too predictable and too easy what is pity because the story is so complicated and so deep made full of interesting elements Lovely how norms and values are seems differently especially of the society and different communities Love how the position is always tested and keeping on your toes Taken from another person seems to be legit and when it is other way around suddenly it is not Even if the one is new as new grass You see talent in yourself and you are being one of the best but when you are in higher level suddenly you are not great enough even if you have pushed yourself so hard This mean only pushing 24 7 sacrifice and given up all you have Script is great done Love the twist and plots Love the twist in the twist in twist in the twist ending This movie is not about music it is about about it all,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7842348/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2015,Whiplash: A Great Example of How Good Cinema Can Be Made From Anything. Even a Drum Set,JK Simmons What a brilliant performance from him He plays the ever threatening Fletcher with the ease of an actor who has owned the character and made it his own Miles Teller While there are no words to describe his amazing performance behind the drums he has also managed to break his mould as a sidekick in sci fi movies otherwise Whiplash will forever be remembered for being a film that has built so much around the humble drum set Miles Teller plays Andrew a teen enrolled as a drummer in a prestigious school called The Shaffer Convservatory of Music He encounters Terrence Fletcher JK Simmons who is a teacher at the conservatory with a brutal and abusive teaching style Things start looking up for Andrew when he gets picked up by Fletcher to play for the school band with the exception that he has to deal with the ruthlessness of Fletcher s teaching methods Whiplash is intense The sheer chemistry between Teller and Simmons is something that takes the film experience to a whole new level The last drum solo is a scene that is much talked and for obvious reasons Sellers delivers a stellar performance The transformation of Simmons during that scene is also something to watch out for There is also a difference of opinion going around the same last scene People who are criticizing the scene for being vague and confusing need to understand the emotional aspect of the two characters in it JK Simmons delivers his career best His on screen presence is something that is rarely seen in cinema these days Miles Teller surprises everybody with his unassuming personality which goes haywire when pushed to the limits Whiplash makes one believe that good cinema can be made from anything even a drummer and his drum set,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3249130/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2020,"Suspenseful, but the overall plot is just quite tedious",First off the acting was brilliant There was such tension between the 2 main actors and I felt a real sense of unease whenever they were together which did not let up throughout the whole film The music and drumming was enjoyable but often a bit tedious The repetitiveness of it though does add to the dynamic between the 2 characters where Fletcher the conductor doesn t accept anything less than his own absolute perfect The side characters such as Andrew s dad and the girl of interest weren t featured enough to have much of an impact on the story except for that their scenes together made me care less for Andrew I kept questioning throughout the film his and the rest of the band s dedication and allegiance to Fletcher As if Fletcher alone is the be all and end all of their careers as jazz musicians It just didn t seem realistic There were enjoyable aspects of the film but I didn t feel there was enough of a plot development or the development it did have I found myself questioning or thinking it didn t flow well with the characters,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5748622/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2019,"Compelling at times, but over the top",While I thoroughly enjoyed the performances by the two lead actors as a drummer myself I feel the musical situations scenarios of the film are often exaggerated and overblown I ve been in many of the same situations as both teacher and student and any teacher who acted the way this one does wouldn t last out the week I actually know of a teacher who struck a student and he was dismissed the same day Additionally although I understand the student s intense desire for success the lengths he is depicted going to are often counterproductive and even absurd playing until his finger bleed for instance I would welcome a little more balanced intimate look at the often very complex relationship between an experienced but demanding mentor and his her ambitious aspiring student,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5153434/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2015,"Five Word Review: Compelling, Scorching Tension; Incredibly Acted",Director Damien Chazelle helms this blistering musical drama which borders on thriller as student and ambitious jazz drummer Andrew Miles Teller The Spectacular Now is accepted into a prestigious band where conductor Terrence Fletcher played by JK Simmons Juno will do anything to realise a musician s potential Whiplash might just be the top contender for the most intense film I ve ever seen Which is surprising and doubly hard as the stakes here are nothing more than playing music in a small university jazz band But due to Chazelle s assured direction the quick editing of Tom Cross and Sharone Meir s expert cinematography Whiplash is ensured to be the very definition of nail biting Surely one of the film s main attractions is the performances namely Simmons Oscar winning performance as the terrifying conductor Fletcher Playing like an X rated version of his Spider Man character J Jonah Jameson Simmons performance is not only note perfect but also a welcome subversion on the inspirational teacher clich which sees him motivate his students with vulgar insults a constant stream of profanity and frequent violence It says something about how good Simmons is in this film that he manages to overshadow the fabulous Teller who like Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler was shamefully spurned by the awards ceremonies The character Andrew is desperate to succeed to go out with a bang and to be known and admired rather than to live a long life full of regret and anonymity Armed with this perspective he goes head to head with his nightmarish conductor wearing his raw ambition on his sleeve in his endless desire to emulate jazz s Bird himself Charlie Parker and be the best in his field And this has connotations beyond music Chazelle s masterful films deals with obsession and the price of success asking important questions about whether a hobby has a point when one does not enjoy themselves doing it The other aspects of Whiplash are similarly marvellous I found a new love for big band jazz music especially Caravan as Fletcher s band plays the music superbly compiled by Justin Hurwitz into a soundtrack that is toe tapping and memorable The conclusion put many off but I on the other hand laud the courage behind leaving it ambiguous and not feeling the need to dumb it down by explaining everything that happens after the climax just like The Gift 2015 The one solitary thing that could be construed as bad about Whiplash is that the supporting characters specifically Melissa Benoist s character and Paul Reiser father to Andrew seem underwritten and underdeveloped yet this seems only to be a side effect of the full force complexity and development of the two central characters Basically all of Whiplash is a triumph If you haven t go see it now as it is a furious intense and dramatic piece of art that definitely rests among the very best films of 2014 if not all time 97 100,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3350553/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,Crazed mentor meets obsessive pupil.,Whiplash is one of the most powerful films that I have seen in a long time The sheer emotion and power it is able to effectively convey is simply extraordinary J K Simmons Performance goes unrivalled by anyone else and his character is just as well written as it is acted Miles Teller is also great and helps to amplify the chemistry between himself and Simmons Director Damien Chazelle greatly captures the physical and mental toll that Fletcher s psychological torture begins to show on Andrew using a variety of film techniques The brilliant writing is capable of capturing the true extent of Fletcher s evil humour brilliance and his scarce humanity Chazelle also demonstrates an exceptional ability to edit and direct the rapid paced and high tension segments of the film which is able to effectively engage and relate the viewer to Andrew and Fletcher s dysfunctional and at times crazed relationship maintaining the pacing and never inducing a disinterest or boredom Also some great visual shots during the the high impact tension scenes which help ground the audience during these sequences Also to no surprise no musical choices are phenomenal from the funky stuff displayed throughout the performance scenes to the eery and well placed sounds that help amplify an important or tense sequence All of these significant pieces come together to form a truly well realised Thriller that will keep you engaged from the opening credits It may very well be the epitome of an edge of your seat Thriller one could even describe it as a masterpiece 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6810757/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2015,Great movie,This movie was a joy to watch and is definitely worth rewatching In the end of it there are a lot of twists which is very good I was wondering whether to give it a 9 or 8 but ultimately feel that 8 is the right mark for it Both the main actor and the supporting actor make fantastic appearances The supporting actor absolutely deserves his Oscar I still haven t watched The theory of things so I can not say the same with conviction about the leading actor The message of the movie is very powerful and I am very glad that titles like this get the recognition they deserve I am also glad that other titles that don t deserve this recognition albeit getting it by being nominated for an Oscar I am directly talking about American Sniper are getting low grades in IMDb If you like movies about fighting student teacher relationships you are in for great time,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3195812/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2023,"""Whiplash"" is a captivating and intense masterpiece of filmmaking.",Ah Whiplash The film that swept audiences off their feet and left them with racing hearts and sweaty palms Directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Miles Teller and J K Simmons Whiplash is a drama that explores the price of greatness and the lengths one must go to achieve it At the heart of the film is the relationship between a young ambitious jazz drummer named Andrew Teller and his tyrannical abusive instructor Fletcher Simmons Fletcher is a master of manipulation using fear and intimidation to push Andrew to his limits and beyond Their relationship is tense volatile and constantly shifting as Andrew tries to prove himself worthy of Fletcher s praise The themes of Whiplash are complex and thought provoking It s a movie that asks difficult questions about what it means to be great and whether the pursuit of greatness is worth the cost The film also explores the idea of mentorship and whether the ends justify the means when it comes to teaching and pushing young talent The acting in Whiplash is exceptional particularly from Simmons who won an Academy Award for his performance He is both terrifying and magnetic a force of nature that commands attention whenever he s on screen Teller also delivers a nuanced and deeply felt performance perfectly capturing the drive and desperation of a young man willing to sacrifice everything for his art The direction by Damien Chazelle is stunning with a frenetic energy that perfectly captures the intensity of the world he s created The score composed by Justin Hurwitz is a tour de force of jazz music that will have your heart racing and your toes tapping The cinematography production design and editing are all top notch creating a world that feels both gritty and polished realistic and heightened But what really resonated with me about Whiplash was the way it made me feel This is a movie that grabs you by the throat and doesn t let go taking you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions that will leave you both exhilarated and exhausted It s a film that will make you question your own beliefs about success and how far you re willing to go to achieve it Overall Whiplash is a must see film for anyone who loves drama music or just great filmmaking in general It s a film that will leave you breathless and make you want to stand up and applaud So go see it and hold on tight You re in for a wild ride,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8964173/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2015,Simmons' performance deserves an Oscar. The movie is forgettable.,Brilliant performances from Simmons and a well supporting act from Miles Teller are the only reasons to watch this film Besides this it is just an ordinary flick Side characters disappear into the background The whole message has been presented to us before in different ways and this movie is just another example of an old wine in a new bottle Simmons deserves all the praise and even the Academy Award The music and the BG score were about average But barring that this movie doesn t deserve another nomination Hearing all the positive reviews I really expected a lot more from this Oscar nominated movie But ended up disappointed One time watch,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3181258/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2014,"""Drumline"" for White People",Whiplash is a DRAMA not comedy about a drum student Andrew Miles Teller who attends a prestigious music conservatory with dreams of becoming one of the greats in the world of jazz percussion His talent and sheer desire lands him in the class of the most notable jazz instructor on campus Terrence Fletcher J K Simmons an emotionally and at times physically abusive man who militaristically and controversially pushes his students past their limits in his quest to stop at nothing to find the next great jazz musician This is a film which is either a lesson in how not to be content with mediocrity or an examination of an abusive relationship Whatever it is experiencing the journey Andrew takes throughout as he decides whether to travel down a path which may lead to fame and isolation or the path which leads to a normal life but away from his obsession is fascinating Writer director Damien Chazelle s directorial style here seems to be one of simply laying down the tracks or keeping the camera rolling so as not to derail his two converging leads Simmons and Teller And in a movie which is so performance driven this is all I could ve asked from a director to get the hell out of the way and let these powerhouses do their thing But if I had to pay Chazelle a single individual compliment other than the perfect use of heavily technical lingo throughout while still keeping everything understandable for those not as familiar with reading music or tempo it would have to be for his superb construction of the final ten minutes of Whiplash which includes the choice to hold on that final sequence apologies for being so vague and allow it to reach its natural conclusion The one issue I had with this movie actually stems from J K Simmons larger than life scene chewing performance which while attention grabbing at many points distracted from the film s dramatic element In truth this aspect may be the fault of Chazelle s script which has Simmons spewing the most degrading and comically mean spirited lines of dialogue The problem with that is I didn t know if his character was meant to be intimidating or just comically mean since the instances when he is berating these young students making them play drums to the point of exhaustion made me want to laugh simply on the basis of his verbiage The act of watching someone struggle and suffer while someone spews funny one liners just doesn t quite work On the other hand for some his performance may only add to the adrenaline dump of this movie Final Thought A lot of Oscar buzz will be focused on Simmons performance It will draw comparisons to R Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket But forget all of that The real star of the show is Miles Teller who gives an electrifyingly exhausting performance both emotionally and physically One year ago he was in a movie called The Spectacular Now and gave a performance which began his ascension into the stratosphere of young actors everybody should keep an eye on Whiplash sees Teller at his apex He not only deserves an Award nomination but also the career Shia LaBouf would have had if he d not A holed it all away,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3116859/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2023,You will be glued to the screen from start to finish,I wouldn t go as far as to say it s the greatest film of all time but boy it might just be the most engaging one From frame one we are introduced to our protagonist Andrew and know pretty much everything we need to know about him When Fletcher enters the scene we know everything we need to know about him as well as the duo s relationship for the duration of the film Every following scene plays off of the seeds placed within this opening scene culminating in a 20 minute long dialogue free standoff between these characters The film is elevated to the top tier by its performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons Simmons might might have won the gold statue for portraying the abusive teacher that pushes his students to the brink of sanity to become the best but Teller commits to his role with passion and creates a protagonist that everyone relates to on some level Without these performances the film would be nowhere near the level of 10 10 Writer Director Damien Chazelle definitely did his part in making sure the film was entertaining without being hollow and artful without being pretentious The actual plot is rather straightforward but the ideas at play resonate universally The film is really a metaphor for obsession with perfection and how it destroys a person s soul The music and cinematography also deserve great recognition for serving the story in a huge way especially that 20 minute standoff The film is definitely uncomfortable to watch at times thanks to Simmons almost terrifying presence but you will no doubt be glued to the screen from start to finish,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9124593/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2015,Black Swan for drummers,The types of films I love the most are the ones with a real raw intensity Black Swan is definitely the most intense film experience I ve had with Darren Aronofsky s chaotic direction becoming almost suffocating at times It s a film which I endlessly admire as is his second feature Requiem for a Dream which features a similar intensity with an added emotional punch to the ribs Whiplash is a film with that same kind of intensity It s rare to find a film which grabs you by the throat and doesn t let go until the credits but Whiplash manages to do more than that It actually tightens the grip as the film goes on until you re just about choking by the end of it all Whilst I don t think that Whiplash is quite the perfect masterpiece many people have made it out to be there s no denying that it s an absolutely stellar and riveting film It does for drumming what Black Swan did for ballet Imagine if Natalie Portman wanted to be the most perfect drummer in the world and Vincent Cassel was a shouty and overbearing bully pushing her way beyond the limits of human capacity and you have Whiplash The film relies a lot on Damien Chazelle s exhilarating direction He manages to bring scene after scene of gripping intensity which seems to build and build until the electrifying finale He directs the drumming performances with lots of close ups and quick cuts which end up leaving you feeling completely exhausted On top of that you ve got JK Simmons shouting at the top of his lungs at the students and wearing them out until they physically bleed There s a scene early on where he picks on someone who s out of tune and it almost made me want to cry like the poor kid he was picking on JK totally earned his Oscar here It s a frightening and wildly intimidating performance full of passion and force His presence fills every scene he s in and dares you not to take your eyes off of him Miles Teller who plays the protagonist drummer boy is also very good in the role He manages to be very convincing and you can t help but root for him to do well He has an infectious passion for the drums and an admirable ambition Although if I was in his shoes I d kick the drums into touch and take that girl and run The idea of watching a film about an ambitious drummer trying to make it in a jazz band isn t an appealing one It s down to Damien s superb directing and writing skills which make it utterly compelling It s also incredibly unpredictable There are so many twists and turns in the final 20 minutes that you have no idea how it s going to end I also quite liked how it ended fairly ambiguously The final scene is truly extraordinary to watch and extremely similar to Black Swan s final scene It s so intense that it has your fingernails digging into the person you re sitting next to and your heart thumping like a steam train There are a couple of problems which stop it from being perfect I thought that the plot lacked more focus which could ve added to the intensity of it all In Black Swan we re made very aware of the days passing to the final performance and so when it arrives we feel almost as nervous as Nina With Whiplash it wasn t made clear as to what the jazz band were working towards half the time At one point I didn t even realise that they were performing in front of an audience There also felt like a lack of character development However ultimately these problems don t detract from the overwhelming experience the film offers Whiplash is a masterful little film Made for only one million dollars and shot in less than 30 days Damien Chazelle has showed the world that he possesses an undeniable talent for filmmaking It s a sensational debut and I defy anyone not to come out by the end of it feeling exhausted It may not be everyone s idea of entertainment but for those who are into dark psychological and intense films then Whiplash is the film to see I really look forward to going through it all again Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www asdaman wordpress com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3192683/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,Absolutely Fantastic,Didn t expect much from this movie so I was very pleasantly surprised Just absolutely fantastic watching Miles Teller go on his journey of obsession with his craft Of course JK Simmons is excellent and it s truly obvious why he received the Oscar for this performance I have watched this movie over and over and it really is inspiring and unexpectedly funny The determination and obsession in this film are just so good The writer and director is also fantastic What a great mind and how grateful I am that he shared this art with the world This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time and I will continue to watch it time and again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8645578/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,Did you win or lose everything?,From obsession with your passion to stop enjoying what you love to do the most Whiplash not only portrays the unhealthy obsession that someone can have for wanting to be the best at something to the point of losing their family and worsening their mental health it also deals with the reality that many teachers believe that a better teaching is based on yelling and offenses While the film does not deal with technical details about music I was able to enjoy all the musical pieces that appear because the important theme here is the ego and the loss of mental balance to achieve your goals I really enjoyed watching it its ending seems more sad than happy because although it seems to have won everything it also seems to have lost a lot,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8773377/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2016,Legendary..... or maybe even better,When i first saw the poster of whiplash and realized that it was a movie about music i expected it to be just sufficiently good to fill a music lover s heart for the day However as many can agree it was a big understatement Right from the first drum beat this film has you hooked and emotional right till the end Even if you try not to enjoy it you will be met with failure as you immerse yourself in the sheer brilliance of the simple plot I applauded for the movie once it was over and 3 Oscars tell the same story this movie is amazing Miles Teller and J K Simmons define real acting in this movie and make this an epic experience It might come out as too aggressive to some but for me aggression was an important plot in this movie I have rated this movie a perfect score and undeniably love it If you have watched the movie and loved it too please check out my complete list of favorite movies If you have not watched it please do so as soon as you can,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3392857/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2021,What a film!,Without the shadow of a doubt this is 10 10 for me Wow What a film The ambiguity of the ending The unredeeming nasty qualities of the various characters protagonist and antagonist alike The realistic which is to say non Hollywood ised inspirational story So many questions left unanswered So much up in the air Yet everything that needed to be said was said Absolute masterpiece,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7099784/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2015,"Powerful, Original, Gut-Wrenching",Where to begin I saw the preview of this film but went into it without really knowing what to expect I didn t even know it had been nominated and won Academy Awards but now I certainly understand why The acting of both leads was phenomenal which is really what drove the movie as it was their relationship that it was primarily about I read only a few other reviews one of them called Whiplash a study about ambition I agree with that and then some Excellence perfection reputation the main character s cared more about these than romance and or friendships Given this I found it very interesting too that while there was no overt sexuality in this film the suggestion of it was there often Certainly in the use of sexual language usually in a derogatory fashion by JK Simmons and also in the intimations of gayness in his character and how he related to the men he taught I couldn t help but wonder are women so absent from the world of jazz musicians In fact I believe part of what was so powerful about the ending is the nonverbal communication that took place between the two main characters and the sexual nature of it the physicality the pacing intensifying sweating panting climaxing Two people making music together love of yet another kind Very powerful,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3215083/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2015,An independent masterpiece that will make you feel assaulted,Whiplash an independent film shot in 19 days was one of the genuine pleasures of 2014 in film telling the story of a promising young jazz drummer named Andrew at a prestigious music conservatory in New York being driven to manic ambition by a sadistic conductor instructor named Terrence Fletcher But it s so much more than a Faustian morality drama in functioning as a metaphor for the choice of reaching for the highest fame and success or being happy with the simple joys of life It stars J K Simmons who reminds me of the great George C Scott in that his performance here as a sadistic college band instructor is almost as intense in displaying unleashed machismo as Scott did playing General Patton At this writing the 2015 Oscars haven t been given out yet but Simmons couldn t lose the Oscar if he dropped his pants on Hollywood Boulevard Writer director Damien Chazelle drew from his own experiences in High School hopefully exaggerated to make a film that virtually assaults the viewer as if he were a punching bag continuously being pummeled by an enraged boxer After an almost unbearable nine minute drumming climax the viewer will probably stagger out into the street then spend days getting over the experience By pushing the envelope almost to the unendurable Chazelle has carved a cinematic masterpiece,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3187776/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2023,"Explosive, inescapably riveting, a phenomenal achievement",If I m being honest I ve been nervous about watching this as much as I have been looking forward to it The theatrical trailer was incredibly sharp and biting but it would hardly be the only time a trailer has impressed me so much only for the full film to be nowhere as good itself Troy Age of Ultron Gladly such trepidation is very quickly laid to rest as Damien Chazelle s picture is filled from top to bottom with those same acrid flavors As reliable a presence as J K Simmons is for any production his performance as monstrous Fletcher is absolutely ferocious the type of tour de force exhibition that will be remembered for a long time to come Any glimpse of humanity he shows us in that capacity is a fleeting shade next to the unremitting viciousness and Simmons becomes someone completely separate from himself for these 100 minutes To my disbelief Miles Teller nearly matches that explosive fierceness as blindly ambitious Andrew and between these two stars Whiplash is filled with such excruciating dark energy as to manifest tension and suspense tantamount to an outright thriller When the picture does eventually pause for a breath it s still hard to come down from the earlier peak and it s only a pause Make no mistake this is a total beast and it is absolutely worth all the anticipation Chazelle s screenplay is plum ripe with two titanic powerful characters that feed off of and into each other extremely piercing dialogue and scene writing and somehow between it all an unexpectedly dynamic narrative when all is said and done His direction is astoundingly tight pushing the feature ever forward and leaving not the slightest room for laxity yet much like the central character that drive only serves to focus the contributions of cast and crew alike shaping the whole with brilliant laser precision Sharone Meir s cinematographer feels altogether alive like a real set of eyes on the set and Tom Cross editing is truly impeccable splicing the movie together with inhuman acuity the first point of comparison to come to mind for me is Jay Rabinowitz s mind blowing work on 2000 s Requiem for a dream This is to say nothing of the incredible music that flows through the runtime treating our ears to an amazingly rich array of tunes at the same time that we re wowed again and again by everything else before us To that point I think it rather goes without saying but all the drumming herein is difficult to even describe At its best a drum kit is more than just a source of functional rhythm but can become a lead instrument all its own and I m unsure if there s ever been a showcase on film or TV the way Whiplash is Unless one already has insider knowledge music can be very difficult to describe either you get it or you don t A movie about music is much the same It would be easy to wax poetic about the tremendous performances of Simmons and Teller the vibrant dynamics between them and their characters the exquisite writing and direction the magnificent editing and so on and so forth To truly convey what all this means and impart understanding is another matter Whiplash is a feature that everyone needs to see for themselves and I do mean need It doesn t matter if you re a musician an audiophile an especial fan of someone involved or just an avid lover of cinema generally This is a stark breath taking portrait of ambition perfectionism and towering personalities that is completely entrancing from which it s impossible to divert our attention As it turns out that theatrical trailer which so quickly caught traction and turned heads is after all but a mere appetizer for what the film in full represents There s no getting around what an awesomely riveting satisfying viewing experience this is ultimately leaving one with a smile on our face like relatively few pictures can really achieve This earns more than a recommendation it becomes a demand Whiplash deserves your viewership and it s worth seeking out however you must do so Bravo,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8924502/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2022,The desire for greatness are burning us.,I used to be an introverted person who tended to be ignored in the party It was painful Even though I do enjoy peaceful times without any interruption I still want to be noticed to feel a connection with people I think maybe that is the reason why I want to be the best creator so much The masterpieces speak for them It is how we gain self achievement a vital ingredient of a meaningful life On the contrary mediocre means unworthy life which is more terrifying than death You gotta have some beliefs to support you go through all the hustle and bustle in life So what I am trying to say is this movie is really expressing anything I want to say I am both joyful and to some extent jealous It is a masterpiece I talked about and the success of this movie really proves my conviction,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8534190/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2015,"Hard to sit through, but though provoking",Whiplash is rightly named Just like a piece of music a film has many components that must come together for it to work You can t have a film without actors without a script or without a director For this particular piece of music all you need is a drummer and a teacher who will do anything to for a successful performance I believe that is what Damien Chazelle has done here He has pushed his actors as well as his audience to their limits and then some The question this movie asks is how far is too far And the beautiful thing is that it never answers it and that was precisely Damien Chazelle s intention when he wrote the ending We as the audience must decide for ourselves I didn t enjoy sitting through this movie but that doesn t make it bad It made me think and ultimately it did what it set out to do For that I applaud it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3244785/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2015,this movie ROCKS... ...(don't get cocky.. it's about Jazz),I thought I wasn t gonna review anymore movie from 2014 But this unexpected class has changed my mind No doubt it s one of the best film of the year And JK Simmons probably has his one hand on Oscar already Can t really question anything about this films It s a very good entertainment One of the few films of 2014 I ve honestly enjoyed watching It s plain it s clever it s entertaining It s hard to criticize something this good But one thing is for sure it s not the best Whiplash lacks two things Number one a real purpose in the story Number two sufficient subplots I m not criticizing anything I m just saying it s not up to the same class with the greatest evers Final Verdict 8 5 10 This is one of those films that not many people will find boring,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3171887/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2015,Get Back,I m going to strictly avoid using expressions with musical terms or that s what I would say if I knew several Whiplash left me puzzled It was maybe a labor of love being a pet project of writer director Damien Chazelle of whom I ve never heard of before The movie seems to be an indie film with a staple of an action movie thrown in for good measure A car accident viscerally shown Lately since the noughties it has been easier to show car crashes So I m assuming this one was thrown in to appeal to a wider range of fans There are a few things I don t understand about the movie Like the drum kit is one of the loudest and least quiet instruments of all So how can the father Paul Reiser be so surprised about Andrew s virtuosity Also The kid the trumpet player who supposedly was playing false really WAS playing false All these little surprises didn t gel with me because a They were stupid b They would work only if the hero was less smart than a comatose monkey which in the movie he was c they shouldn t have mentioned Casey hanged himself because it s a distraction and you think he should have been the subject of the film d the twists prevented us from knowing more about Andrew The regrettable thing about Whiplash is that there is only one person who got the perfect amount of limelight treatment and attention and that was J K Simmons The others got the same level of detail which was wrong Andrew is shown as a boy playing drums and before that at a family dinner He also dates a girl briefly He is a very quiet lad with his band and with his girlfriend but surprisingly smart Aleck and runs his mouth like a machine gun when the story asks for it Not my tempo That s all I had to say hope you found the review helpful,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202765/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,It doesn't rush and it definitely doesn't drag.,Whiplash 2014 is an experience in tension a character study that s fantastic at giving you the same perspective as the protagonist while never really putting you in his headspace that is to say telling you exactly how he feels at every single moment Its ultimate effect is an incredibly compelling thematically rich one It s an at times gruelling almost hard to watch picture mainly because we care so much about our lead and want to see him succeed a desire that is bolstered by the fact that we constantly see and hear the genuine skills in the form of thunderous top class drumming he s told he does not yet possess This makes the central battle between him and his antagonistic teacher all the more agonising urgent and investing until it culminates a riveting confrontation and the whole things ends on a fantastic final beat 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4396703/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2014,Best film of 2014.,Never have I been a part of an audience that universally applauded a film immediately after the images faded to black Indeed never have I seen film at the cinema that was more deserving of such a reception Before I realised it my hands were coming together An involuntary action a result of a perfect movie in every conceivable way Every scene every shot every piece of music that was played There were certainly a number of subtle themes permeating the background of this movie The most notable being what it takes the dedication and relentless determination that is required for an artist or indeed anyone to become truly great to become more than what was thought to be the limit of their capability or even perfection itself Despite this and the many other parallel themes at its core this is a movie MADE for drummers In saying that though you of course do not need to be a drummer or a real musician to enjoy this movie It is that incredible and that diverse that the drama the tension the comedic quotes along with the impeccable acting carry this film on its shoulders alone This is the best film of the year by at least a 20 kilometre marathon The plot of this film is simple so I will not delve into that too much But despite its simplicity the incredibly written characters and their actions their relationships make this simplicity not just relevant but yet another flawless aspect of the film One of these characters is notorious music teacher Fletcher a mean bastard of a man whose depiction by J K Simmons is kicked out of the stadium landing on the roof of a skyscraper several kilometres away J K Simmons gives us dare I say it his best performance to date as an actor Channeling his inner Vern Schillinder for the first time in over a decade his every action his every word hell even his body language and emotions were entirely unpredictable for the entire movie creating an amazingly tense atmosphere in a very different way to most other films One could certainly not be blamed for pondering is this man sick Additionally as if this wasn t enough the script he is given to work with is sharper than Daniel Day Lewis butcher knife Every word he uttered counted and many of his remarks stung worse than any Amazonian insect and as if this wasn t enough the black comedy that intertwines with the rest of the story for the most part delivered viciously by Mr Simmons is unparalleled Of course there was a few inside jokes that only a drummer or a musician could fully understand for the most part but these are sprinkled lightly on simply the best bowl of cereal you will ever come across Simmons dialogue was so strong intense scary and hilarious that it was impossible to take your eyes away from the screen Countless insults many rather graphic in nature are abound and coming from Simmons with such ferocity I laughed almost every time he spoke His methods as he says himself are intended to push people beyond what is expected of them a quote that sums up much of what this movie is saying very well Opposite J K is the newcomer Miles Teller who sets each drum kit he touches on fire with the skill and determination of someone destined to become great The array of emotions that he experiences as he single mindedly focuses on the task at hand is the best big screen portrayal of the inner strength required to reach the highest of musical goals Immature as the film begins his character s personality progresses steadily and in a believable fashion eventually causing the viewer to wonder what he will say next as his character gradually transforms before out eyes One can t help but laugh at some of the things he says often rather bluntly However his stunning drum work steal the show or at the very least share the stage with Simmons performance Alongside all this war like chaos as mentioned earlier there are many themes are touched on subtly including but not limited to trust and respect and how it is earned The relationships between family members and the miserable feeling a musician or drummer can feel when their passion their love is not taken seriously at all seen as a hobby destined to be grown out of It explores the dynamics between band members and their conductor showing us realistically might I add the tension that can arrive in an instant when that many people are trying to perfect one song together And of course it shows what real motivation true focus and dedication can do to a person both positive and negative and how far someone will go to get to where they see themselves belonging I am a drummer so I realise that I am naturally going to be a little biased But ignoring the inside drum jokes I took myself out of my body away from the drummer in me and enjoyed this movie for what it was as much as every other audience member I imagine judging from the reaction as soon as those credits rolled A factor for this sudden outburst of applause most probably has something to do with the thoroughly unpredictable riveting final scene that rivals any movie you could name for having the perfect ending I could go on and on in fact I am certain I could write a thesis on the amazing scope and execution of Whiplash But I ll wrap it up here as I have said enough and I don t think I need to tell anyone reading this that they must see this movie as soon as they possibly can,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3132471/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2015,Raw and different a film of mind numbing and physical pain. All while trying to get great!,Finally saw Whiplash I must say it s one film that takes a look at what s it s like of trying to gain success and conquer your own working demons all while trying to please yourself and others The film has Miles Teller as Andrew who s a young up and coming want to be drummer who after enrolling in a music school finds that life behind the drum is tough It s when Andrew sees that his march to the beat of his own drum instructor Fletcher J K Simmons in a very deviant and sadistic like teacher role and maybe his best performance is one not to play with as the note and key must strike to his hand right on the drum It s a pain taking task as you will see Andrew play the drums till his fingers bleed Overall okay film about toughness sacrifice discipline and coming to terms of your own success and failure while meeting the expectations of others,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3167595/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2023,"Two most dangerous words in the human language are ""good job""",The kid wanted to be the greatest the teacher wanted to find the greatest Unorthodox as it may have been they wanted exactly the same thing and they found it The expectations of being the greatest based on talent alone is bullcrap Oftentimes talent isn t even a factor Drive desire even obsession are paramount with also the necessary support Also when giving the world something they ve never experienced before you may have to ignore the opinions of those who don t matter Miles Teller is an amazing actor and this is the movie they put him on the map Not many left JK Simmons always a treat but this was his peak performance Do yourself a favor and indulge in one of the hidden gems of cinematic integrity Inspire yourself,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8890772/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2017,Disturbing but definitely worth seeing.,No synopsis of the film just a summary of impressions Some films stay with you for various reasons After seeing this film a few days ago I find that it is sitting in my head just in the background where my subconscious continues to toy with it Frankly it is a disturbing film with powerhouse performances by JK Simmons and Miles Teller Worth seeing but be prepared for some unsettling content There are lots of reviews that discuss the plausibility of a man like Fletcher existing in academia today or if one can really drum until your hands bleed I don t think either issue matters from a thematic point of view of the film Both of these aspects of the film could be attributed to dramatic license to convey a deeper meaning This is how I approached this film while watching it and in this review This does not mean I believe that the Fletcher character is implausible in real life In fact I don t think that this character is much of a dramatic stretch Its pretty typical to see coaches and teachers in the arts bully their students Growing up in a backwater midwest town I recall having a music teacher who employed tactics like Fletcher He threw temper tantrums for similar triggers as seen in this movie and tossed his baton chair and music stand from time to time One time I remember he even grabbed a student by the neck a drummer in fact and pushed him against the wall Ahh the good ole days of education in middle American Anyway suffice to say I think that this type of teacher or coach is a plausible reality The scenes of Andrew pushing himself to and beyond the his limits are a bit unbelievable with the blood and wounds and all Implausible yes but I think this was an intentional device to convey a deeper meaning so that no one could miss it All of these scenes are effective in conveying the one big theme in this film only pain creates great art This theme seems to prevail in the arts and there is much evidence to support it if you look at the biographies of the great painters novelists etc Pain is a great motivator to inspire and change human behavior I think that this idea rather romanticizes the suffering that many great artists experienced during their lifetimes And perhaps this idea seems ingrained in the arts because its such an effective sales pitch for these artists work postmortem Anyway whether or not pain is necessary for great art will probably be debated for eons to come This theme in the movie was not that interesting to me I guess I should note that the film does take a position on this issue coming down firmly on the side that pain is necessary to bring out artistic greatness Okay so the big obvious theme of the movie did not intrigue me Yet there is something that intrigued me about this film something I found very unsettling and set me about writing this review This film offers a rather realistic portrayal of the systematic abuse employed by someone who fits the profile of a sociopath or narcissist fairly well Support for this conclusion Fletcher manipulates his students and Teller s character in particular from the very first scene He puts Teller s character Andrew through a cycle of idealization and devaluation again and again He gas lights Andrew again and again He systematically uses triangulation to manipulate Andrew These are the tactics of a textbook narcissist In this same vein Andrew is the perfect victim We see him lose each and every personal boundary including one that would induce him to care for his own survival after being seriously injured in a car accident Why does Andrew do this Its all an effort to receive approval from Fletcher Andrew is the perfect victim in this film And his path in the film takes him to the place where many victims end up when tangling with this type of human being In the finale where Fletcher sets up Andrew for the ultimate humiliation for the sole purpose of vengeance I found this to be one of the most chilling things I ve seen on screen in a long while For me the film should have ended right there as this is what can happen when you tangle with a narcissist The film continues after this scene We see a wild performance and Andrew seems to get what he has sought from Fletcher from the very beginning of the film It feels a bit like a tacked on scene like something that was forced on the story a typical Hollywood feel good ending that was probably added to make the project more palatable to a test audience or producers Given the nature of the characters as portrayed in this film the ending would not end up in feel good land Rather it would likely end up as the Casey character mentioned in the film Fletcher s prodigy who eventually hung himself,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3632274/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2014,"Blood, sweat, and bangs",Damien Chazelle s Whiplash is a film that left me breathless and physically exhausted when I got up to walk out of the theater and all I had done for the past hour and forty minutes was lounge in a theater recliner and watch somebody else work themselves into a sweaty mess A good film about motivation and determination leaves you humbled but a great film about the same subjects leaves you emotionally drained and even enraged enraged from watching others bring the lead character down and even attempt to compromise his or her dreams The film may even leave you determined to exercise your own dreams out to a fuller extent not compromising your talents or adhering to requirements and realizing what makes you happy may not make others happy but those others aren t you or likely sleeping in the same bed as you Whiplash is a contemplative film in that regard a film that earns every word of praise and every glowing adjective on its theatrical poster and the many accolades it has received It s a film that gives you the heartbreak of perceived failure and allows you to be affected by the few words of praise the lead character receives as well as every negative drawback and vulgar criticism and there are plenty here The film concerns Andrew Neiman Miles Teller a nineteen year old first year student at Shaffer Conservatory a prestigious music school Andrew is a drummer but not your typical I m in a band drummer his goal is to go down as one of the greatest drummers who ever lived etching himself alongside Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker At first we the audience may sneer at his dreams but it s cool Andrew couldn t care less When we see him practice until his hands are calloused and bleeding excessively from the tight grip of his drumsticks is when we see his determination is real When we see him tear through his drumset banging his sticks angrily on his symbols and throwing his kit across the stage is when we truly realize his drive to be the best he can be Andrew s entire world is tested when he meets Terence Fletcher J K Simmons an uncommonly strict music teacher who has no problem making his classmates stay until 2 00AM to get the music notes right or sees anything wrong with throwing a chair at one of his students who can t keep up with his tempo His personality is vulgar blatantly calling his students two demeaning twelve letter words along with some other homemade curse words himself giving these kids more discipline than they ve ever been granted in their lives Fletcher doesn t just push kids past their limit he pushes them into mentally corrupting realms boldly stating to Andrew there are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job Beneath an incorruptible drive in Andrew is a tender soft soul at first who sheds a single tear when Fletcher vulgarly criticizes him for the first time What am I a double rainbow he asks Andrew spitting and contorting his face in various ways Fletcher is a no nonsense guy and no better to play him than the incorrigible character actor Simmons himself The man who played a contemptible vile subhuman in HBO s Oz gives probably his most engaging performance yet as one of film s strictest most uncompromising professors His intensity is heightened to the point where we the audience feel compelled to lift our theater seats despite them being bolted to the ground and hurl them at his character calling him every disgusting name he has called his students I ve said before that Teller is on his way to becoming a truly remarkable actor after performances in The Spectacular Now and Two Night Stand show true promise as a human leading male and Whiplash will be one of the various used to iterate that point to others Teller communicates not only the attitude but the mentality and the realism of these characters becoming not just a person for his films but an attitude and a personality throwing himself into the mindset of a dateless loser a teenage alcoholic or in this case an incomparably determined music student His performance here is by far his most amazing work Whiplash also features a beautiful score and live orchestra music maybe not in the opinion of Simmons Fletcher who would probably ostracize it as a contribution to the downfall of contemporary jazz but sounds absolutely incredible The piece of music Whiplash played frequently in the film is a mesmerizing and relaxing piece of music contrasting the film s breakneck tone On top of that the editing style of the film done by Tom Cross is a visually arresting art here consistently captivating us with briskly paced scenes of literal blood and sweat and close ups of a wide variety of musical instruments as they are both prepared and played Much will be made about the ending some will love it others will say it s incomplete I find it to be satisfying if disheartening While audiences after giving it enough thought and credit will likely be pleased they may realize a deeper sadness and that sadness is simple where is Andrew going after this Without divulging into spoiler territory it s something every artist faces after his or her best work and it s a terrifying thought For a film with such a quiet almost devastating ending Whiplash sure gave me one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3127913/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2023,Among one of the best nominated movies over the years!,I probably could ve reviewed this movie sooner I just haven t watched it since before I started reviewing a few years ago now I happily own this gem in 4K Miles Teller and JK Simmons are electrifying throughout Whiplash is focused on music dedication the right tempo sweat harshness and astounding performances I love the intensity of the music and the way the JK Simmons character behaves he s so tense and he s perfect at that in any role Damien Chazelle has become a legendary filmmaker at the young age of his mid 30 s which is impressive I love Whiplash it is a great magnificent movie very worthy of the awards at the time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8923126/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2018,I was completely drawn in by the movie and felt all sorts of emotions,Whiplash is a story without a real hero J K Simmons is a terrifying villain and Miles Teller is a self absorbed masochist That being said this movie is absolutely compelling I ve never been in a band and I m not a jazz fan yet I was completely drawn in by the movie and felt all sorts of emotions mostly fear panic and anxiety I hope to never encounter someone like Terence Fletcher in my lifetime,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4430715/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2014,Whiplash – Captivating reach for perfection,Full Review Andrew Miles Teller is a young and talented drummer enrolled in one of the best music colleges He is mentored by Fletcher J K Simmons an absolute perfectionist who believes there is no line that can be crossed when trying to bring out the greatness in a student The film follows Andrew as he is consumed and abused by Fletcher to the absolute limits hoping to be one of the greats Whiplash is a psychological battle between individuals that is tense at every palm sweating second of the movie You will be completely captivated by the riveting performances by Miles Teller and J K Simmons who show an acting side that we have never seen from them This is not an easy movie to watch for some disturbing decisions made by the characters but it is oh so rewarding to experience Quickie Review For me Miles Teller for a long time was just some comedy actor After watching another movie of his The Spectacular Now I saw a potential in him to be more than that So that is the reason I wanted to see Whiplash but he simply blew me away more than I had expected Equally J K Simmons character is still haunting me after watching the movie The most enticing and attention grabbing moments were when Andrew and Fletcher were in a scene together It is a constant back and forth head butting of tolerance for each other Andrew can be disobedient towards his mentor and meanwhile Fletcher would be physically and verbally abusive Seeing how they react to certain situations sometimes made my jaw drop and leave me speechless There were moments where I d repeatedly think why WHY Why is he doing this as if they are real people I know they are just some characters on a screen but because of the strong on screen chemistry as stressful as it was I felt compelled to react This brings me to the stellar acting by Miles Teller and J K Simmons without whom Whiplash wouldn t be the gem that it is I loved seeing the absolute dedication Teller showed through his character So much so that in some scenes Teller is in actual physical pain that his character would be experiencing Watching the drive for greatness destroy his other aspects of life and life itself felt very real and palpable Many of you might know Simmons for playing J Jonah Jameson in the Spider man movies take that character make him more short tempered get rid of the lovable quality and un censor everything that comes out of his mouth that s Fletcher scary I know One quote from the movie perfectly sums him up Fletcher says There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job It can t be any clearer how much he despises anything less than perfect Well Simmons if I were to ever meet you I d say you were perfect This is yet another movie that is not widely released on every major screen I had to go out of my way to see it in another city But I have to stress because of the exceptional acting talent Whiplash is worth going out of your way to experience Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector http thestubcollector wordpress com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3125632/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2017,Ba dumb bumb cheshhh!,Whiplash tells the story of Andrew Neiman Miles Teller a young drummer whose obsession is to become one of the greatest and who finds his match in Terence Fletcher a conductor who put the mentor in monster and monster in maestro and will push Andrew to heights of unsuspected greatness and to the edge For lack of a sequel we ll never know if Andrew became the best drummer of his generation but there s one thing we do know Damien Chazelle is Oscar nominated for La La Land If he wins and he certainly will he ll be the youngest Oscar winning director of Hollywood history And there s more La La Land earned 14 Oscar nominations tying the record of Titanic and All About Eve and it is very likely that the film will tie the all time records of Oscar wins if not break them And Chazelle isn t even thirty he doesn t even look thirty Only two years have passed between his directorial debut and the kind of wet dream for a vet director let alone a squeaker So I m not sure if I want to review Whiplash a fascinating coming to greatness story or the story behind Whisplash which embodies the same nervously inspirational spirit Actually it is not a hazard that Chazelle made his bones through a movie about talent ambition and discipline as he applied these vital life parameters to himself How do I know that he s got talent Is it subjective I don t know But there s an interesting moment that says all when Fletcher visits Andrew s school band looking for someone to pick I ll pass over the mockeries and derogatory comments to the untalented players so you have Andrew as the second drummer and not even appreciated Fletcher lets the first drummer play then Andrew They play like one second each yet these seconds are enough for Fletcher to detect the real potential It seems that Andrew s got the little sparkle just enough to be considered a page turner in Fletcher s conservatory but it will be a long road till he earns his part or not Now has Chazelle talent Well judging by whatever was displayed in this film in terms of acting directing writing editing and even sound mixing I would say hell yeah The squeaker earned his part as one of the most promising directors of his generation And Whiplash is a long road to greatness paved by the harrowing mind wrestling between the fierce mentor and his ambitious disciple and one of the most captivating love and hate relationships of recent years And as painful or cringe worthy as it gets we feel that harassment is the kind of end justifying the means technique to go beyond expectations Fletcher does have a point and it s true that there s no good coming from casual complimenting I myself remember a teacher who used to harass us in prep school she could let me fill the blackboard for four uninterrupted hours and always commented the work we did by could have been better or pathetic One day I managed to elicit a jaw dropping very good and it was an extraordinary feeling I wish sometimes I had someone harming me for the sake of my accomplishments But now I m projecting my own experience in Whiplash while the film goes deeper in the enigmatic personality of Terence Fletcher He believes in Andrew s talent but he doesn t like him for all that Fletcher is an antagonist and the paradox is that his antagonism improves Andrew s talent more than anything JK Simmons who owned the Supporting Actor category during the awards season is an instant icon in this film and the way he loudly asks Andrew if he s dragging or rushing was so intense I felt like he was shouting at me Fletcher shows us the key to self accomplishment not rushing and not dragging seizing the right timing the right tempo to get to action and secondly an indirect lesson no one owes anything and the least you expect from others the more you expect from you Andrew isn t perfect either there s a moment where he breaks up with his new girlfriend killing the relationship before it even started He didn t want her to undermine his path as if he was convinced already he was going to be the greatest embodying Muhammad Ali s classic I was the greatest before I knew I was But as admirable as his self confidence is the journey of Andrew doesn t go without a few accidents some more deserved than others and I wouldn t dare to spoil the third act which elevated the film from a fine Indie music to a fantastic duel of egos with drums and music and venomous rancor as weapons Whiplash is one duel after one between rival drummers Andrew and Fletcher and ultimately Andrew and himself He doesn t belong to a musical family he has dreams that alienated him from family and friends but he knows if he was good enough to catch the ear of Fletcher that might say a thing or two about his talent Granted Fletcher isn t the nicest guy but nice guys aren t all talented or successful So it all comes down to Whiplash s third act a satisfying jazz crescendo culminating with a super finale where everything is beating your feet are tapping and for one moment you do believe that jazz is the finest musical expression of all time after classical music And maybe beyond ambition talent and discipline the reason why this awkward college boy looking director made such a sensational impact is because he knew about jazz it was his passion So maybe passion is the key And he was so passionate that in order to get the money he simply made a shorter version and submitted the film to Sundance and the rest is history Like a sort of Rocky with drums and its extraordinary ending Whiplash is simply said the embodiment of its own success story Ba dumb bumb cheshhh,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3638518/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2016,troubling,An interesting study in obsession ambition and sadism brilliantly crafted and compelling to watch despite the disturbing content endless sexism abuse and brutality But in the end it seemed to me an eloquent justification for bullying and as such very distasteful Teacher drives talented student to the brink of total self destruction I don t doubt that it sometimes happens and is a worthy subject for a movie Apparently the story is based on the director s own experience But would a teacher whose abusive behaviour is so brazen extreme and public really last long in a top institution This movie seems to argue that such teaching actually works and is to be celebrated No thanks,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3414716/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2015,A Very Well-Made Film,Whiplash follows a first year music student who is talent spotted by the school s most fearsome teachers Now one of the drummers in his class Andrew Miles Teller is under pressure to become the best he can be and more Making a film solely about drumming at least somewhat interesting can be a difficult task because it is such a niche interest Whiplash manages to make a fantastic film about drumming Please do not be put off by this film s subject even if you know nothing about music or drumming this is still a thoroughly entertaining film to watch and enjoy One of the reasons this film works so well is that the performances are all great J K Simmons obviously steals the show as the terrifying Fletcher whose rants are appallingly personal to the extent where you eventually start cringing at every drum solo just waiting for him to stop the music and begin his bullying once more Miles Teller also gives a great performance although his hasn t received awards recognition it is still a solid performance that proves he can do more than comedies Of course it is not just the acting in Whiplash that makes it so successful the direction of this is so effective that you can literally be on the edge of your seat during some of the drum solos The only way to describe these scenes is as being almost like action scenes The camera work at these moments is so fast paced it creates a fantastically tense atmosphere These are the aspects of the film that make it so great it is difficult to convince most people to go see a film about drumming but hopefully people will give Whiplash a chance,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3177698/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,Totally riveting.,Who would have thought that a movie about a young musician training to the the drumming world s equivalent of Charlie Bird Parker could be this gripping but Damien Chazelle s Whiplash it s only his second film and he both wrote and directed works both as a study about a pupil teacher relationship and as a film about obsession as well as being a superlative jazz musical and it s a film that confounds expectations at every turn Only once does it go slightly off the rails in a melodramatic sequence leading up to a crucial concert but it recovers from this blip building to an incredible musical climax in Carnegie Hall The pupil teacher relationship is that between Andrew a priggishly self confident young drummer and Fletcher his martinet music instructor Fletcher s idea of teaching is to abuse verbally and sometimes physically his students until they do things his way If they don t measure up they re out He s played by J K Simmons as the music world s equivalent of R Lee Ermey s drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket and at times you hope he might suffer the same fate It s a career best performance from a great character actor finally getting his dues and almost certainly an Oscar Andrew is MilesTeller and neither Teller nor Chazelle make him particularly likable or sympathetic which is a nice touch there are times you feel he deserves all he gets A cosier actor would have made for a cosier picture and a less exciting one When they go up against each other you feel at least we might have a battle of equals Fletcher is a monster but he might also be a great teacher who knows he may have finally found his Charlie Parker There s just enough of an edge to Simmons performance for us to want to look for the man beneath the caricature just as Teller s Andrew is equally alienating Luckily for such a blood soaked saga in a very literate sense there is enough humour in Chazelle s excellent script to get us through the sticky passages and there are a few there s only so much cymbal throwing bluster we can take and the almost wordless climax including a nine minute drum solo is as musically and dramatically riveting as anything in recent cinema Whiplash may not be perfect but it s as near as dammit and marks Chazelle out as one of the best and most exciting young directors working today,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164744/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2015,Sensational!,This has got to be one of the most impactful inspiring and humanistic film I have seen in a long time From the start to finish it was breathtaking and emotional to sit through Because of the cinematography that builds tension and the direction that brings about that captivating and compelling feeling You can almost literally feel the emotions poring out of the characters This movie revolves around the human ambition for greatness and how not everyone is how they seem This is just simply a sensation film making from start to finish and it really had my attention all the way through Certain people need that kick in the rear to focus and get started but the question is how much pushing can some people take I guess if they want it enough they can handle it because the end justify the means for them Watching this film was sort of like a more artistic and powerful portrayal of how Gordon Ramsay treats his chefs on television Except Ramsay is probably doing it for rating and publicity stunt Although certain portion of him makes him do that it s mostly for the ratings Overall this is a film that really hits the core with it s emotions and intensity I highly recommend it The techinical aspect of this film when it comes to the music instruments direction and cinematography with some fantastic acting trutly brings this film to life 9 8 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3293885/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2014,One of the most epic showdowns in cinematic history!,WHIPLASH Five Stars Out of Five A critically acclaimed and Oscar hopeful jazz musician character study that plays more like a psychological thriller than a heartwarming drama It was written and directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Miles Teller and J K Simmons The film tells the story of a young jazz drummer studying to become great at an acclaimed music school under the obsessive guidance of an abusive instructor It also features Melissa Benoist and Paul Reiser in supporting roles I found it to be nothing short of great and a true masterpiece Andrew Teller is 19 years old and just started school at the Shaffer Conservatory which is widely known as the best music school in the country He really wants to be one of the great jazz drummers and to do so he ll need to gain the approval of a highly respected conductor at the school named Terence Fletcher Simmons Fletcher is determined to find the next great musician and his tactics for bringing out the best in students are highly questionable and border on psychological abuse and torture Andrew is just as determined to become a great musician though and the two engage in a battle that turns into one of the most epic showdowns in cinematic history Simmons is great in the movie and he s now seen as the Best Supporting Actor frontrunner at this year s upcoming Academy Awards I ve been a fan of his as a character actor for years and it s great to see him taking on a lead role that he s this powerful and memorable in it showcases all of his best talents Teller is just as good as the main character though he s a new actor but he s already shown an amazing gift for acting The two very flawed but inspired characters these actors bring to life in this film are classic It s a great story but what s even more impressive is how visceral a film going experience it is Chazelle s directing is always breathtaking and beautiful to watch I don t think a character study could possibly be more intense and thoroughly involving than this and it does feel like a thriller or fast paced sports drama It s one of the best movie experiences I ve had this year Watch our movie review show MOVIE TALK at youtu be TybVNWfCjYM,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3126500/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2022,Poor.,Coming from a non musician This movie was bad Not terrible just plain ol bad Although as I stated I am not a musician in any way so I don t know how accurate the drumming was I did not feel any sense of presence when the drums got played The Two lead characters that being the main drummer and J K Simmons character where pretty good in terms of acting But in terms of care I had for these characters developed in the story and the scenes that where meant to be intense that where ultimately left on a sour note I say this movie is a mess Without spoilers I would even like to point out that the ending is terrible It builds up a cool scene that lasts a good amount of run time just to instantly cut it with no conclusion But unlike Inception this movie didn t benefit from such a gimmick Story 5 10 Characters 5 10 Music 2 3 10 Acting 7 10 This is a movie that would ve benefited from having a longer run time but even then it would have had to have been a lot better to have had a chance to hit the 5 10 range In terms of musical films yet again coming from a non musician this one is pretty poor compared to it s challengers in the same category 3 10 wouldn t recommend but isn t necessarily a waste of time,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8173651/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2020,Intense Authenticity,There are times when watching this movie that you find yourself holding your breath as the tension pounds along with each beat of the drum The performances of Teller and Simmons are exceptional Their ferocity leads to many dramatic confrontations that take the movie to another level that drizzles with passion which is what this movie is about This movie carries a great deal of emotional violence that is managed brilliantly particularly by Simmons who for much of the film looks as thought he is about to murder his entire band The road to greatness doesn t miss a beat,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6024648/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2015,Not Quite My Tempo,I don t think anyone can question Miles Teller s acting talent after watching Whiplash Matter of fact it should have never been in question especially after The Spectacular Now or even Divergent He is getting better with every role and it s only a matter of time before he is also being nominated for an Oscar J K Simmons plays the ultimate jacka teacher who looks to other means of educating the Jazz band abuse When I say I don t think there has ever been more of a despicable character I mean it I can t even describe his character without cursing and wanting to yell in this review Whiplash is truly an exhilarating experience that anyone with a superior who pushed them too far can relate to Andrew Teller is a motivated drummer fresh out of high school and enrolls at the cream of the crop music school He meets Fletcher Simmons who is just about the most strict music teacher on the planet I never had a teacher like that but I did have a harsh baseball coach in high school that took things too far at times You re not a teacher or coach when you make the kids hate what they re doing and despise coming to that class or practice everyday It makes me wonder how many of these educators we have in the world and worse how many are getting away with it He s the type of man that when he walks on screen you immediately worry for everyone in the same room Simmons was intense in the Spider Man franchise but he is ten times as bad in Whiplash I think I m actually afraid of J K Simmons now Miles Teller apparently learned how to play drums for this role but his intensity and emotional depth is unparalleled here I can t see how he will be a bad Reed Richards even with the chaos surrounding that project He literally put his blood sweat and tears into this project and it showed That s why it s heartbreaking to see his character change as he gets more lost in Fletcher s world His personality takes a turn for the worse and it ends up pushing the people closest to him away Some of the actions Andrew does or tries to do to impress Fletcher is intolerable for the audience to see Because of how much I hated Fletcher I don t think I have rooted for someone more than I did with Andrew I can say I will never coach kids or students like this it s just inhumane The script is nearly perfect Some of the lines Simmons says are a few of most malign things someone can say to a person What s worse is that he knows if you re lying and will flip the script on you if you re caught Simmons will easily win the best supporting actor Oscar this year but his character is so maleficent that I almost don t want him to I do have a problem with the ending Without spoiling anything I just wanted more out of it I would like to think with who these characters are it would have wrapped up more to my liking It s almost like the characters stuck too much to who they are instead of completing their character arc Teller s immense dedication Simmons enough said Exhilarating roller coaster Script Relatable with probably everyone Ending 8 4 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3170108/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2015,"Riveting, intense, passionate. Simply stunning.",I don t think I ve had this intense this passionate this wild and soaring a film experience since yes Black Swan four years ago when I first saw it They should probably put a label before the film starts warning viewers because this is probably the best depiction of a roller coaster ride as I ve ever seen a film be How funny though months ago when first hearing about the film thinking it was going to be sort of like a simple and sweet story of a young man learning how to play drums Entertainment wise it doesn t get any better than this really You get completely entranced into it all I knew J K Simmons was going to play a tough instructor but gosh was never prepared for what I got The film wisely plays into many of your emotions at extremely high levels It s a terrifying and intense film and the direction is why How Chazelle isn t being considered a front runner for Director is anyone s guess The film is a crowd pleaser through and through A scary one a perhaps too demented one but a crowd pleaser nonetheless riding on the audience s feelings from minute to minute If Black Swan had so much success with awards and nominations how can t this When that was a genre film about ballerinas and this is about playing music Baffled J K Simmons yeah not much else to say really everyone s said it already What I found surprising is that he has a ton of screen time and the film really is about him and Teller okay Teller and his obsession with his music but in terms of human relationships It s all told through Teller s perspective so there s no category fraud but it could ve been a case certainly because the AMPAS has nominated way shorter roles in leading Miles Teller again how he isn t in the awards conversation at all is baffling baffling to me His part is extremely meaty and he knocks it out of the park stunning you in awe He doesn t go overboard at all either he plays it exactly as it should for it to have a huge emotional impact yet still feel realistic enough to sustain that impact As an experience it doesn t get much better than this However the film plays so much on emotional momentum and intensity and passion that I feel like it may not be a film that holds up that well in retrospect whether it be in months or as the years go by I know that probably doesn t matter to quite a lot of people but I rewatch films quite often and to me the rewatchability retrospect factor is a big part as to why my love for certain films is sustained I feel like certain people will be less enamored by it over time like Black Swan and that just like Aronofsky s thriller many might just see it as an over cooked silly unrealistic and over the top drama And perhaps worse because Black Swan is seen as a genre thriller and this a music drama I have some of those concerns too but the heck does it matter now,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3156672/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,"Pointless, plotless, boring",Clearly I watched a different film to everyone else I came away with only one feeling boredom Hardly anything happened I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters I didn t care that the teacher was an arse and I didn t care about the kid Almost the entire film was kids drumming in a room I must ve missed the point entirely because I finished it and just thought what a pointless waste of time,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8281664/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,Stupid and absolutely ridiculous movie,I m not even one of those people who think bullying is categorically wrong or useless I even think it s important in some areas But it makes absolutely no sense when artistic creation and music is involved The fact that the movie is about jazz which is urban meltingpot garbage makes the entire drill instructor routine even more ridiculous If you see it as a satire comedy it s quite funny though,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5740481/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2015,"An Intense Piece of Film that is sure to Delight all Moviegoers,",Whiplash is an fantastic movie with a really well developed storyline and an outstanding cast I was in shock and awe throughout it is a very intense film as we get a very deep look inside the life of a young man wanting to make a career in playing the drums there are many scenes that are so powerful that I found myself not taking my face away from the screen for one second not even blinking I don t want to spoil any of these but I will just say that there is nothing like them in any other movie I think we could have been given information about Fletcher I know that we are following Andrew but I would have liked to known some more about Fletcher s past and what made him turn out this way it would have made J K Simmons performance even more substantial than it already is The performances made this movie as it is one that would have been terrible without great acting J K Simmons and Miles Teller hit it out of the park I was always saw Simmons as a versatile actor but he was never really given roles where he could really shine he is given that opportunity in this and uses it to full effect he is terrifying and in a strange way very likable Teller also delivers a spectacular performance particularly in parts where his character lashes out and he clearly put in some serious drum lessons which is very impressive Dramatic intense and all around outstanding three Oscars dosen t lie I would recommend Whiplash to all moviegoers After enrolling in a music conservatory a young man aspiring to become a drummer is challenged by his mentor to be the very best he can be at whatever step it may take Best Performance J K Simmons,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3257138/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2015,one of the best movies of 2014,Without any expectations without any cue I went onto seeing this movie but I wasn t prepared for a Jazz thing which I never experienced before J K Simmons nailed it A simple story in which a smart student tries to get the appreciation of a tough guy This story is mingled with the drum thing and jazz thing to get a fabulous performance from both the lead actors and when it ended I just thought may be some more One of the best movies of 2014 for sure Support for low budget movies like this is very appreciable Wish I was in America to catch this on its opening,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3182260/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2020,Terrific and terrifying actor,J K Simmons really steals the show here This film puts a horrific twist on the usual aspiring artist plot by throwing in a very alarming figure who distresses and abuses his students Yet they stick around because they feel this is their only path to greatness Is it worth it This film explores the consequences,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5790312/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2015,The Vidiot Reviews...,Whiplash Being the drummer means being out of range of beer bottles the audience throws at your band However the audience attending performances in this drama are more apt to lob wine glasses Determined to be a great musician like his idols Andrew Miles Teller a freshmen drummer enrolled in the Shaffer Conservatory s Jazz program accepts a spot on the studio band But the ensemble s abusive conductor J K Simmons abruptly dissolves any dreams Andrew had of glory Discouraged by his teacher s exacting and insulting nature Andrew is pushed to his physical and emotional edge The caustic couple later climaxes on stage where each humiliates the other in order to achieve their best With intense inspired performances from both leads breakneck editing and an unrelenting rhythm permeating throughout Whiplash is a fresh in your face approach to weary mentor mentee movie clich s Furthermore drum solos are the ideal time to go to the washroom Green Light vidiotreviews blogspot ca,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3194870/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2015,"A ""Very Good Job."" ♦ 75%",When jazz and cinema go for a date together it usually ends with bitterness While in Damien Chazelle s Whiplash the date goes fine there still remains gaps that could ve been filled The story of how an overly disciplined jazz instructor Fletcher J K Simmons uses severe admonishment to push the abilities of a drummer Andrew Miles Teller who he thinks has the potential to make it great strikes its audience as a parable Andrew tries normal ways to become a good drummer but his meeting with ruthless Fletcher narrows his focus and inspires him in a manner we only find in prodigy stories The film talks about the arduous path to success through a jazz setting which helps in the recommendation process people who enjoy jazz music will derive more pleasure from Whiplash The film focuses on cussy tutelage and frames it as a necessity in the field of pedagogy While it also throws light on how evolved the music industry has presently become we do not fail to realize that strict teaching is what begets great musicians Factors like perseverance struggle grit and passion are heavily sampled and one may even grade the film as inspirational J K Simmons is well directed and with his bald cranium he easily handles the authoritarian air Miles Teller s hard work is splashed everywhere and one stands and wonders the sheer brilliance with which he portrays the role His subtle romance his mild introspections his familial negligence all are done so well as the story picks up the gradual pace While I can vote for Teller to be rising star of 2014 I don t see an Oscar Simmons should receive the Best Supporting Camera work is another best thing about Whiplash It points and emphasizes on things that hold importance in a specific frame It moves and focuses and fades with absolute charisma Overall direction is good Writing hits few bumps but they are negligible Editing is very precise as is evident in the final sequence which reaches crescendo both with respect to the music playing and the movie itself The teachings in the first half suspends its audience as we anticipate every following actions of the characters While the story doesn t necessarily take a route that we expect there is delight in every route it tries Because jazz Music is atmospheric There are times that we feel all the admonishing goes over the line and the story to be a gimmick Damien fails to draw a line between reality and strange fiction Ounces of madness here and there makes it an engaging watch But it crosses the invisible line and surrounds some frames causing a mess Cinematography and editing may get the nods but Best Picture looks far fetched BOTTOM LINE Whiplash is brilliant and hard hitting It inspires its audience to stop dilly dallying and go beyond one s own abilities and with drumming the most laborious music art it succeeds in conveying the message Recommended Can be watched with a typical Indian family YES Profanity Very Strong,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3159712/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2015,Big Boy Tempo,As a student of classical music for 20 years I have always been in AWE of jazz musicians I love jazz I love listening to it love the sense of humor it has the style the spirit and yes the tempo jazz is way more complex than your normal every day music whether it s classical rock or whatever Whatever people think about the brutality or how music teachers push their students towards greatness is really not the point to me The point is that it takes extreme discipline to reach perfection How does one measure perfection The only measure I know myself is if I get goosebumps when listening to a performance and if I hear that Big Boy Tempo without any hiccups This movie and its music gave me goosebumps Simple as that So 10 10 stars here no ifs or buts about it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3198537/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2015,Dizzying and intense,For a film primarily focused on the relationship between teacher and student at a prestigious music school Whiplash actually feels like one of the best American thrillers in years Yes it is about one young man s struggle for absolute greatness in his field and poses questions about how hard one should push themselves to achieve artistic integrity but it is the verbal sparring between lead Miles Teller and the scene stealing J K Simmons and the sight of Teller pounding his drums to dizzying effect while his palms gush with blood that really causes the heart to race Andrew Neiman Teller is a first year jazz drummer attending Shaffer Conservatory playing as an alternative to core drummer Ryan Connolly Austin Stowell When his class is paid a visit by notorious conductor Terence Fletcher Simmons Andrew is given a brief moment to shine and is bumped up to Fletcher s class with immediate effect He again plays as alternative this time to core Carl Tanner Nate Lang and believes he s bound for greatness until he is asked to perform Whiplash a particularly tricky and extremely fast jazz number When Andrew struggles to keep to Fletcher s tempo he has a chair hurled at him and is emasculated in front of the class And so begins a tirade of mental abuse as Andrew strives for his master s acceptance J K Simmons quite rightly won the Best Supporting Actor at this year s Oscar s for his terrifying portrayal of a passionate yet sadistic man His drive is his desire to a find a new Charlie Bird Parker who as the legend tells it had a drum symbol hurled at his head during a disastrous early career performance Rather than being deterred Bird practised his arse off and of course the rest is history Fletcher beats down on his students shattering them with verbal assaults as they try to prove themselves worthy Only Fletcher doesn t seem to have a limit they are not on his tempo as he repeatedly tells them He wears black t shirts has muscly arms and a giant zig zagging vein pulses on his forehead He is a formidable presence highly charismatic and in the end almost sympathetic Teller is impressive too A drummer in real life from a young age he appears in every scene of the film and pours his blood and sweat literally into the extremely physical musical performances His showdowns with Fletcher provide the spine of the film but the intimate moments with Andrew alone pounding his drums as his face twists and turns that provide the brain Is the sacrifice truly worth it We see Andrew push his body to dangerous limits isolate himself from his family and his concerned father played by Paul Reiser and call for an early day on a brief relationship with a girl from his local cinema Melissa Benoist Just when the plot seems to be steering into conventional territory at the finale director Damien Chazelle provides one of the most satisfying climaxes in recent memory It s a dizzying orgy of cuts close up s and sheer style which is as toe tapping as it is awe inspiring,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3242514/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2014,Stretched the bounds of believability,It is often taught that a screenwriter can do anything in the first five minutes of the script and the audience will go with it Unfortunately the same does not hold for the first 30 minutes of the film This film really stretched the believability quotient for me It was over the top absurd at times and I didn t buy much of the action The music school was preposterous people simply wouldn t let this behavior fly in this century Miles Teller was quite good as the student but I felt JK Simmons was miscast Not because he is not a good actor but because his TV persona is so memorable and opposite that I just couldn t believe him in this role unfortunately The role was just ridiculous at times so it s not just the actor I m happy to say that the film does get better in the second half but not enough that I would recommend it,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3125976/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2015,You'll never look at drums the same way again,This film is what the movie experience is all about You must see this in a theater to get the benefit of the sound which is key and the immersion of being in a room where the story is the only thing going on without distractions Simmons and Miles inhabited their roles The tension in this story began in the first five minutes and did not relent until the credits rolled As the lights came up we three viewers turned to each other and said WOW simultaneously We went to this film with no expectations but had read other reviews that were glowing Based on them alone we took a chance SO MUST YOU The acting is so fierce at one moment and then so subtle in the next These characters are extreme studies of what is takes to be one of the greatest You will be thinking about it for days,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3174945/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2015,J K Simmons Deserves Oscar,JK Simmons is a teacher at a prestigious music school in New York City obviously Julliard but the name is changed here but it doesn t matter the story is a compelling one with Miles Teller as an aspiring drummer who falls under the wrath of Simmons Mr Fletcher The man is a Vince Lombardi type of instructor who treats everyone with equal contempt in order to get the best out of them I am not a fan of jazz but I as a music lover I was able to appreciate the struggles of musicians of any kind Teller is excellent as the kid who plays so hard that his hands bleed and Paul Reiser appears as his supportive father Simmons has been nominated for best supporting actor and he should take home the Oscar I remember him playing a neo Nazi on the HBO series Oz and he is clearly a great character actor Whiplash is one of the best movies of 2014,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164372/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2014,Explodes into a musical epiphany,If you are thinking about engaging in some other activity after watching Damian Chazelle s Whiplash be sure to leave some time for decompression Winner of the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival the semi autobiographical Whiplash is a visceral adrenaline pumping musical drama that raises but does not resolve the age old question of whether the end justifies the means In the film 19 year old Andrew Neyman Miles Teller The Spectacular Now an ambitious drumming student enrolled at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory of Music fictional in midtown Manhattan comes under the tutelage of Terence Fletcher J K Simmons a high ranking instructor who is well known for pushing his students to the limits of their endurance and beyond From the time that Fletcher watches Andrew in practice and invites him to play in the school jazz band the film is essentially about the confrontation between the driven student and the seriously overbearing instructor both pursuing perfection but by vastly different approaches Fletcher does not hesitate to use racial religious and homophobic slurs throw chairs or play demeaning psychological games to motivate his students In one instance he starts and stops a performance over and over with shouts of not my tempo and repeatedly browbeats a pupil demanding to know if he is rushing or dragging In another example he yells that someone in the band has lost the beat and asks the culprit to identify himself When no one comes forward Fletcher singles out a heavy set boy and pressures him to admit that he was off beat then on his reluctant admission orders him to get out Later he tells the class that the boy was not off the beat but the fact that he didn t know that was just as telling Close ups of Fletcher s one on one confrontations show every line on his face including his contortions grimaces and each drop of his sweat One of his justifications is that toughness pays off citing the apocryphal story of teacher Jo Jones throwing a cymbal at the head of Charlie Parker that motivated him to practice harder and become the great jazz musician he turned out to be The two most harmful words in the English language Fletcher says are good job He is however apparently more interested in his own legacy than in developing talent and his lack of integrity is evidenced when he lies about what actually caused the untimely death of one of his best students Andrew is also single minded in his pursuit of excellence becoming the band s core drummer by mastering the double swing time beat and practicing until there is blood all over his hands and instruments His only release is going to the movies with his father Jim Paul Reiser an English teacher who gave up his ambition to become an author As a single dad he is very supportive but has no vision of what Andrew is capable of Though powerfully assertive behind his drums Neyman is awkward and insecure socially His relationship with Nicole Melissa Benoist a concession worker at the movie theater begins promisingly but ends abruptly when he tells her that their relationship if continued would become a hindrance to his ambitions an idea she predictably does not take kindly to When Andrew s cousins receive plaudits for playing football and both he and his father are disparaged at a dinner party the conversation deteriorates into an angry exchange of insults about what it takes to succeed in life Andrew while truthful comes off as a bit Fletcher like in his put downs Both Teller and Simmons turn in amazingly convincing performances genuinely capturing the essence of their characters and it s difficult to imagine any other two actors in their roles Teller an accomplished drummer is vulnerable and likable though we become leery of his escalating internal fury Simmons is a powerful presence who dominates every scene he is in Though he is basically an unsympathetic character he shows moments of humanity that bring his toxic character into a sharper focus While the most provocative aspect of the film is the question of how far a teacher should go in motivating their students it seems to me that Chazelle is saying that while harshness crudeness and authoritarianism may sometimes work temporarily to achieve a desired result without the element of compassion a talent may be realized but only at the price of health and well being The most compelling aspect of the film however is not the philosophy but the music and it is terrific All the emotional build up of the film comes together in the final segment which while open to interpretation as to its underlying meaning explodes into a musical epiphany that is far beyond anything that I ve ever seen in film in the same vein If Whiplash could succeed in turning me into a jazz fan there is no limit to the miracles it can accomplish,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3120302/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2017,Utterly mystified by the high rating for what is a terrible film,The only thing I can find to recommend this is the acting of both principles and possibly the drumming skills of Teller Firstly the idea that drumming can be made into the fine art Fletcher is pretending it can is ludicrous While the director is to be commended on avoiding the usual Hollywood happy ending the way it does culminate just leaves the viewer feeling entirely nonplussed Even some of Andrew s reactions to Fletcher s behaviour are not realistic It is similarly hard to credit that such an individual could be allowed keep his job in today s ultra litigious world A complete waste of time Avoid,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3617570/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2015,"Exciting, suspenseful and a film even non-jazz fans will appreciate",Jazz music and psychology create a furious cinematic swell in Damien Chazelle s Whiplash a striking breakthrough effort that will have toes tapping and pulses racing Centered on a 19 year old aspiring Jazz drummer pushed to his limits for better and for worse usually worse by a merciless instructor Whiplash tells a simple story of how far one s willing to go for their dream and what inspires and motivates greatness Miles Teller stars as Andrew a first year student at a music conservatory with a clear cut dream become the next great jazz drummer His talent catches the eye of Fletcher J K Simmons the conductor of the school s revered studio band a no nonsense teacher who pushes his students to their breaking point through cursing screaming and insulting them and he particularly enjoys directing his questionable tactics toward Andrew By and large Fletcher s methods inspire Andrew to push himself but not without instilling a certain fear and anger in both him and the audience The tension becomes powerfully thick whenever the two are in the same scene and any time Andrew makes the slightest mistake that will certainly invoke Fletcher s wrath it s a gasp worthy oh crap moment Chazelle easily gets the audience under his finger in this way but it s Simmons who really gives him that power Simmons has been a beloved character actor for more than a decade in large part due to his mouth and exceptional line delivery The role of Fletcher plays to these strengths while allowing him to access a more sinister and dramatic side In other words when he rips off a comic insult in this film you re also laughing out of nervousness He s every strict terrifying bigoted foul mouthed teacher instructor coach or boss you ve ever had or that s ever been on screen rolled into one and that has a profound influence on the film s suspense Interestingly executive producer Jason Reitman director of Up in the Air and Juno has a lot of influence too and that goes beyond that he likely recruited Simmons for the project Chazelle likes to use a lot of sequence shots such as all the student musicians opening their instrument cases one after the other to create a rhythm to the film one of Reitman s hallmarks That said it should by no means diminish the work Chazelle has done He balances this with a lot of other techniques the opening shot for example is a long take and weaved together the film takes on the characteristics of a carefully orchestrated piece of music Music has always played a crucial role in the creation of cinematic suspense so a suspenseful film about music naturally has to take this relationship to another level That s where the focus on percussion makes a difference There s the obvious piece in that the drums are the pulse of the band so the connection to our own physical response to the film is apparent Also and maybe slightly less obviously there s a lot happening visually so it s much easier to convey the intensity on film Chazelle films Teller playing from just about every possible angle and distance which ought to tell you that Teller s own drum skills were definitely put to the test The suspense also impacts jazz standards Whiplash and Caravan and other pieces heard in the film making them infinitely more gripping because of what s at stake for the characters A surprising third act twist takes the story to another level and elevates a script that otherwise might ve gotten too satisfied with simply highlighting the moral dilemma Fletcher and Andrew pose There are weaker components too like a side plot involving a love interest Melissa Benoist of Glee and a little stuff with Andrew s father Paul Reiser and extended family but they help break up the intensity and also show that Andrew s pursuit of greatness doesn t exist in a vacuum Whiplash works by being both niche one small story taking place in the little seen world of competitive collegiate jazz and yet universal while employing a multitude of sensory components both visual and aural to creating an engaging accessible and entertaining film Chazelle will surely have a number of encore performances to follow while giving us an all time great one from Simmons Steven C Thanks for reading Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3175784/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2020,Perfection.,Chazelle Teller and Simmons made a perfect film This film is the embodiment of tension of suspense of anxiety of gratification Everything it hits every single ball out of the park Chazelle s directing is flawless and the color is absolutely perfect I found myself pausing this movie very often to just look at the shots and colors that Chazelle had composed on the screen Teller acts the HELL out of this role and he does it perfectly Simmons acts the HELL out of this role and he does it perfectly I may not have said perfect enough but as a longtime band member and avid film lover this film is perfect,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6060352/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,A movie all about music for those that understand it,A budding jazz pianist Miles Teller is admitted into the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory where he comes under the eye of the legendary Terence Fletcher J K Simmons who promptly starts driving him like a dog trying to take him as far beyond his human limits as possible Frankly speaking movies about music have never been my thing I m in no way musically talented or inclined and thus whenever for example there s that one scene where someone has to play something over and over again getting yelled at the same time to get it right until it finally goes it just doesn t open up to me Every single take sounds the same Might be that that s the purpose but I do believe that you re meant to hear the subtle differences if you re good enough And in that regard I don t think Whiplash has what it takes to take someone on a journey into the world of music A movie about war for example can show you what it would be like to be there on the battlefield But then that s explicitly what it is trying to do Whereas Whiplash seems to be about music made by those that get it to those that also get it Luckily music is only half of the movie The second big theme is greatness and what is needed to achieve it Because it cannot be just about raw talent Every day a person is born with the capability to become a great musician But few of them end up in the business and only a few of those have the drive needed to urge them onward even when they ve already achieved some measure of success Whiplash is a fine film Personally I didn t find it as compelling as it probably is to so many others but I can definitely recognize talent heart and soul when I see it,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4039516/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2021,Well that is a hot take,This is one of my favorite films of all time In large part it is because Fletcher Andrews views on what Greatness mean especially in the context of art is compelling utterly clear and completely horrifying To be great one must suffer and deny to yourself all experience outside the narrow pursuit you have elected I don t know if this how art work but I do know some people think so Chazelle has created a hypnotic ode to such people while criticizing them Nothing is more compelling and ambiguous then the final shot of Andrew s father with a look of awed horror at what is son has become Much credit must be given to Simmons and Teller for making their character s thoughts so clear while not excusing them As a piece of character driven drama the film has a subtext that one can infer if you are inclined too It is very hard to not see Andrew s intense desire to be pleasing to Fletcher and one can wonder if his drive is about being a great drummer or a great protegee Add in Fletcher s domineering is often manifests in sexualized insults count how many times he calls someone a homophobic slur and I cannot help but see this as intense erotic and dysfunctional relationship I doubt the Chazelle Teller and Simmons intended this the commentary on the DVD acknowledges this reading and Simmons seems to say not intended but valid but it is also a big reason why I love this film as much as I do It is such a strong and clear subtext that makes the film have a seductive power Such a great film no matter what lens you look through,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6831112/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2020,"A remarkable mix of ""Full metal jacket"" and ""Black swan""",Whiplash is about the relationship between a young drummer Andrew played by Miles Teller and a dictatorial instructor Fletcher played by J K Simmons at a New York music academy The dictatorial instructor acts and talks very much like sergeant Hartman in Full metal jacket 1987 Stanley Kubrick However the victim of sergeant Hartman is the wimp of the group who is lagging behind by each excercise The victim of instructor Fletcher is an over ambitious student For this student Fletcher is not only a bully but also an idol A complex relationship of attract and repel arises This relationship is more in line with Black swan 2010 Darren Aronofsky than with Full metal jacket Whiplash can be seen from different perspectives Andrew faces the choice between ambition and social life He chooses for his ambition sacrificing his girl friend to his drum kit Instructor Fletcher has to decide how demanding he has to be with respect to his students He decides to be very demanding In his eyes There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job To utilize the full potential of that one talented student he does not shy away from burning down the many average students In my opinion one very revealing scene is when Andrew is back home The moderate succes of his nephew in American Football is higher rated than the succes of Andrew in one of the most demanding music academy s of the country something that made me think of October sky 1999 Joe Johnston After that there is a conversation a the dinner table This conversation centers around the question what is the essence of success is it money or is it fame Andrew has a pronounced opinion about this question Referring to Charlie Parker he says I d rather die drunk broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about me than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remembered who I was Whiplash is a multifaceted film J K Simmons plays Fletcher in a very convincing style and he got an Oscar for this role However convincing he was played the character of Fletcher is not very plausible His behaviour mavbe accepted in the army a music academy is a very different world I hope,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5803012/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2015,Freakin' WILD!!!!,Spoiler Alert This film was so intense I could barely sit through it and watched many scenes through gritted teeth and squinted eyes But I m glad I didn t chicken out for something lighter because the climax was totally amazing The two lead roles and their elaborate interplay was absolutely brilliant and kept the pressure on so that almost 2 hours of viewing seemed to pass at break neck speed This is a story about blood sweat tears and the utter determination to succeed against all odds The sheer fire of Andrew Neyman the young and ambitious Jazz drummer played to perfection by Miles Teller is fuelled by a deep down knowing that this is what he was born to do But this knowledge does not come into full force and confidence until the very last scene when it literally erupts out of him as a mixture of rage defiance grit and artistic brilliance all rolled into a roll interspersed with lashings of utterly wild embellishments Meanwhile his cruel and driven mentor Fletcher played horrifically flawlessly by J K Simmons provides the emotional stimulus for the movie as he is the fascist ass hole who will do just about anything to push the potential out of his students He embodies the amoral dogmatic maestro who values power above decency adds insult to injury but ultimately bows to musical genius when he hears it The relationship between student and mentor builds and builds throughout the film creating suspense and anxiety that something unexpected could happen any second which it does frequently and instils that edge of the seat fear of power gone wild in the viewer Their relationship reaches its final climax in the last scene when apprentice becomes master of his own emotions of his instrument and equalises himself with his mentor So finally the balance of power is restored and all is well in the jungle To sum up Whiplash is the clever weaving of a spell in more ways than one the music the drama the power plays all cleverly and intricately crafted in every element It is really about the forging and moulding of talent and skill into real genius The movie is like an orchestrated symphony in itself loud and soft movements rises and falls climaxes and summations all with impeccable timing An unblemished masterpiece in fact I thoroughly enjoyed it Superb,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3156532/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2015,Who would of thought that a film about a young drummer could be so intense?,I think being the greatest musician of the 20th century is anybody s idea of success Damien Chazelle s Whiplash is one of the best films of 2014 It doesn t matter if you aren t much of a music fan I m not because there is much more going on here than the simple premise of a young drummer trying to achieve perfection I don t know much about jazz or music but somehow Chazelle managed to make one of the most intense films of the year Who would ve thought that a film focusing on a relationship between a young drummer and his mentor could be so intense and have you at the edge of your seat during the final ten minutes of the film It was quite a memorable experience This is Chazelle s sophomore film his debut film was Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench and you can already conclude he s a brilliant director and one to look forward to He s as determined as the main protagonist of the film When he wasn t able to come up with the funding for this film he decided to make a 20 minute short which debuted at Sundance in 2013 and after garnering attention from critics he was able to finance this film Perfection comes at a great cost and it requires discipline and practice Chazelle makes sure we understand that this pursuit of perfection comes at a great cost and he lets the audience decide whether it s worth the price or not Whiplash is one of those rare films that leaves you with many different things to think about It raises so many questions Does the end justify the means Is the pursuit of perfection possible Is it really worth all the sacrifice and the most important question in my opinion what is our definition of success The young drummer in this film played brilliantly by Miles Teller who had a breakout year in 2013 seems to have his mind made up of what success really means but is he right The director avoids taking sides and lets the audience come up with their own conclusions There is a brilliant scene where Teller s character is courting a girl and telling her about his goals in life and his reaction is brilliant when the girl played by Melissa Benoist doesn t really know what she wants to do with her life He is so determined and focused that he finds it confusing that someone could live without this sort of ambition These small scenes are what makes this movie so great because it allows us to learn new things about each character through these interactions The core of this film is without a doubt the relationship between this aspiring young drummer and his abusive mentor It is very different from most other mentor student relationships explored in movies in the past and it avoids falling into similar formulas and clich s found in other films This isn t the cool teacher this is someone whose personal philosophy is about pushing his students to sacrifice everything in their lives to pursue greatness and the only way to do so in his opinion is by pushing and bullying his students to the point of breaking them It is the opposite of what a mentor like Professor Keating in Dead Poets Society is like towards his students and most films take a similar approach having an inspirational and caring mentor But in Whiplash J K Simmons Fletcher is the complete opposite and he psychologically terrorizes his students You can feel the fear he installs in the students and his presence alone every time he enters a room is felt Simmons performance is the best I ve seen all year and he delivers in every scene he s in He is the main reason why the film is as intense as it is because every time Teller s Andrew gets in front of the drums we feel that anxiety and tension We want him to succeed but at times the cost seems too high Simmons presence is terrifying and even when he seems to be cooled down we know that he can burst in any moment with a missed note The way he verbally assaults and demolishes his students is also a troubling part of the film because as an audience we know that it is wrong but we can t help but chuckle at some of the things he s saying His character is almost cartoonish at times but it is part of his persona because he thinks it is the only way to push his students to become the best As good as Simmons is in this film Miles Teller doesn t allow him to steal the spotlight Teller is the lead character in this film and even when Simmons isn t on screen we are engaged with the story The moments he is interacting with Nicole the girl he is dating and with his father played by Paul Reiser are also incredibly well constructed and they say a lot about who each character is These relationships give us a glimpse of who Andrew really is and what drives him Teller s performance is solid and even his drum skills are amazing in this film The entire cast is fantastic but of course Simmons receives most of the recognition because his presence on screen is just amazing here There are so many other aspects of the film that work so well like the rapid editing that goes along with the jazz beats The cinematography is also gorgeous Everything about this film is great and the performances simply elevate it all,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3159019/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2017,Great performances but the same can't be said for the film,Whiplash delivers some great and intense performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons They conveyed an intensity throughout this film and the audience can easily understand how much being a great musician means to the young Andrew In the same respect the audience can appreciate how the teacher wants to uncover the next best thing and push for greatness However the performances are the best part of the film because the film seemed slow and disjointed It also felt incomplete in the end We got the sense that the plot was about a relentless teacher striving to push his students to their full potential and you have a student striving to be the next big thing However the film abruptly ends with Andrew s fate not being revealed There was no text to reveal the outcome of the entire movie Apparently this was a satisfactory ending I understand others may not share my view but it is quite disappointing to see films made like this are considered art We are starting to let go of coherent deep and well thought of films in favor of incomplete slow and dull films What makes it worse is you have so called film critics in magazines who struggle to form basic sentences calling it art In its essence Whiplash is characteristic of new art films that ask you see something that isn t there To conjure up a feeling or a depth that simply does not exist in the film through its writing symbolism or directing Some of the critics for this film will go so far as to say you didn t see the point and then fail to explain it coherently themselves because the reality is you can t Hot air only gets you high enough Sadly these films are attracting more sheep or bees to an artificial honey It s no surprise Moonlight won the 2017 Oscar for best picture,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3674463/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2015,Great Intense Drummer Movie,Andrew Nieman Miles Teller an aspiring drummer is enrolled at Shaffer a high end music conservatory and is tutored by Terrance Fletcher J K Simmons who demands perfection and who has a tendency to push read push too far students he thinks can be great I was kind of tentative about seeing this movie because all the promos had J K Simmons yelling and shouting crude sexual insults at his students Did I want that to continue No not exactly but decided to go ahead anyway And hey I have always liked J K Simmons and always thought he deserved better than what he got awards wise Also I almost bought some Farmers Insurance because of him Okay the real reason I like drums Whiplash is a musical piece and it also can be considered a physical neck whiplash as Fletcher starts and stops the music at breakneck speed I cannot say enough about the editing in here Wow Miles Teller is a new comer and yes his looks at times can remind us of Elvis hey you said the same thing about Robert Pattinson and his acting performance is very good All the cast were very good but this was a contest um battle between Andrew who would probably kill himself to be a great drummer and Fletcher an wanna be mean Drill Sergeant Fletcher keeps saying he wants to push a student so the student can achieve greatness but we see him as that mean drill Sergeant on a never ending ego trip However both Teller and Simmons give amazingly great performances that would be hard pressed to forget Kudos The break up scene between Andrew and girl friend Nicole Melissa Benoist was something we have rarely if ever witnessed At the time it made sense to Andrew No not to us We do get to hear some arguments regarding musical greatness crossing lines and does the end justify the means There is a twist in here and the very last scenes make this movie all the more worthwhile They are some great really great scenes I read that Miles Teller did perform all the drumming you see Wow The music was simply great even though we only got snippets for the most part due to Fletcher s starting and stopping at unbelievable speeds But on the whole the musicians were probably some of the best we shall ever hear Kudos J K Simmons won the Best Supporting Actor Award and deservedly so The Academy should install a new Oscar the J K Simmons Oscar to those actors who we see all the time and are exceptionally good but they never achieve any kind of elite status Otherwise those actors will have to wait for an Oscar Worthy role as J K Simmons did in here and that role may never come It s time for this new award Just so you know this movie was nominated for Best Picture and did win Oscars for Editing and for Sound Mixing and deservedly so 9 10 Violence Yes Sex No Nudity No Sexual insults Yes and quite crude too Language Yes,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3196427/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2021,"If you're looking for a deep story, keep looking. Because this doesn't have any.",I hated this movie There s nearly no plot and zero character development Regarding the music if you re super into fast drum solos sure you may find this appealing But for me I don t find this tasteful at all I like jazz but the jazz in this movie was just too noisy I hated it On top of all these this movie manages to send all the wrong messages of revenge of bullying and of pettiness This was a waste of time and money,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6776888/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2019,One of the best films this decade,J K Simmons gives one of the best supporting actor performances ever I really love this movie and it s tempo of going is quite my tempo Chazelle is maybe my favorite young director working today Miles Teller did good job worst thing you can say to someone according to Fletcher as a young musician Ending is magnificent,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4676023/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2014,Superb Entertainment,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3130991/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2019,Electrifying. Dangerous. Masterful.,It s a riveting thrilling film that gets away with an ending that s perhaps just a little too keen to cleanly resolve the jagged drama But if you ever thought Glee or Fame would be better rendered as a one on one psycho thriller here s your film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4677763/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2015,Both exhilarating and exhausting,This is not a film with mass appeal there are no super heroes or car chases or special effects but the discerning viewer will find it a cinematic treat The title alludes to a piece of jazz music but it might as well describe the tongue of Mr Fletcher J K Simmons teacher and conductor at a top New York music academy whose lacerating comments on the efforts of his charges literally result in blood and tears The prime focus of his teaching or torture is 19 year old Andrew Miles Teller a drummer in Fletcher s elite band Teller gives a fine performance but Simmons is simply stunning in a career best showing in a lifetime of acting mainly in television it deservedly won him an Academy Award The movie was both written and directed by Damien Chazelle who at school wanted to be a jazz drummer and had a tough music teacher and it is a feature length version of an award winning short film of the same name The plotting is quite thin but this is not a slow work the rehearsal sequences which are the core of the story are sharply cut and well shot What gives the narrative some complexity is that Mr Fletcher s appalling behaviour is a consequence of his own failure and could be seen as well intentioned while Andrew s willingness to take so much abuse and punishment is the result of his all consuming passion to be the best A prolonged drum solo at the end is a tour de force that seems to make it all worth while but you ll end up feeling exhausted,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3314899/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,"Overrated, but still great.",Whiplash is an amazing film and J K Simmons and Miles Teller are a great duo with great chemistry The acting is top notch some of the best I ve seen and this movie is just an icon with iconic scenes The plot is great and the character development is very good especially from Andrew,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7237527/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,"Very good, but J.K. is better than all the rest",It is good very good indeed maybe I shouldn t be expecting perfection tho It is not perfect First things first J K Simmons jeez What a performance On his eyes on his words on his gestures on his walking on how he fills a room with his presence Tremendous Much better and much more multidimensional than our main character I m sorry but even if Miles Teller showed me the effort the passion the love the pursuit for your dreams it came across as super unidimensional Yeah maybe that was the point Maybe he is just a douchebag a kid who thinks he is the best in the world the best ever I m not entirely sure tho that I should end this film with more feelings for Fletcher than for him feeling much more his pains than Andrew s I did Technically this is a magnificent film The editing and the sound are two maginific things here you can t get better than this and Chazelle demonstrates a great understanding of all the elements in play I m not entirely sure about the so well spoken Screenplay I have issues with the third act I have issues with the necessity to open so many doors and close or not at all all of them in the exact same place Overall a very good film with one monumental performance and perfect techincal elements I would maybe cut a bit of the jazz ok it s stupid to say this in a film about jazz but a lot of people said that in a film about tennis last year so I can and would focus a bit more in some underdeveloped relationships and characters,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8079754/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,"Yes, excellent but...",This movie could give us a dangerous idea of the cost of greatness and I have trouble with it As a psychologist and like everyone I suppose it s obvious how dangerous these kinds of obsessions can be anxiety stress depression severe mental disorders in general that can conduct to cardiac arrests illnesses deadly diseases and suicides to all that it joins a flood of collateral damage with third parties relatives friends couples children etc After everything Fletcher did to Andrew throughout the entire film Whiplash ends giving us the idea that perfection obsessions can be reached by human beings which is stupid because this only exists as an ideal It makes us believe that through hard work and immeasurable demands a musician can become successful Maybe with these ideas the film could also give us some kind of justification for Fletcher s behavior with his students Whiplash is an excellent movie cinematography acting music and many other things were magnificent But I like to think that this film wasn t created just to try to inspire people to highlight in an increasingly competitive and individualistic world Instead I want to believe that it was made to warn people of how dangerous can be this way to success the cost of it and its several consequences To incentivize mental and physical health care above anything else must be a priority for everyone,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6397909/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2014,And The Beat Goes On,This film is highly recommended The need to create and the artistic challenges that go along with that innate desire are the force empowering the characters in Whiplash a wonderful melodrama about a controlling teacher and his talented student Their ongoing conflict is the basis for this film Despite some overdone moments it is one of this year s best Skillfully written and directed by Damien Chazelle Whiplash tells its conventional story very well Andrew Neiman Miles Telller has a dream of becoming a first class jazz drummer and nothing will stand in his way He practices daily to the point of bloody self destruction and gets the attention of Terence Fletcher J K Simmons a demanding conductor at the school whose high standard of excellence becomes Andrew s mantra Chazelle has made a stylish film with superb editing by Tom Cross that follows the riffs and rhythms of its musical score while focusing on its central players The passionate performances by Teller and Simmons are remarkable Their rehearsal scenes crackle with tension as their relationship builds to become a master class in acting Teller conveys the youthful eagerness to please with the vulnerable side of a gifted musician s fervent interest in his art Simmons has been given the role of his career There is no beloved Mr Chips on campus This professor lobs his barbed words at his class for direct impact and makes his tirades sting with indignation If Simmon s memorable role as the overly zealous Fletcher is overlooked this award season then the rules need to be revamped immediately However the logical question does arise and make one pause to the actual reality of academia could a music professor be so sadistic and cruel and still be in charge of this class The physical and mental abuse he inflicts on his pupils is layered with constant profanity racial slurs and acts of violence that certainly would never have given him tenure let alone keep a job This leap of logic almost tilts the story to absurdity But the dramatics outweigh the reality of the situation The film is so well crafted and boasts two of this year s finest performances that it demands your attention Whiplash is emotionally involving from its first note to its last GRADE B Visit my blog at www dearmoviegoer com ANY COMMENTS Please contact me at jadepietro rcn com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128512/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2020,MASTERPIECE,This time I want to review my best film of all time whiplash directed by damien chazelle who directed the film La la land the first thing I like about this film is the acting of JK Simmons who according to me that it went too well and also the acting of Miles Teller who directed the film La la land amazingly good I really like the way of shooting the way the camera moves I like it very much not to mention the synopsis which is very interesting I like and maybe this kind of film doesn t have it anymore huh If we know and we watch now most of the films are drama comedy or action genre according to me the three film genres are getting more and more now films with drama music genre may now be rare maybe there was only one year or it could be nothing at all Rating for this WHIPLASH film I give you a 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5826233/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,Disappointing,Went into this completely open minded having no idea what the film was about and hadn t even heard of it before but it was on BBC iPlayer late when I couldn t sleep I m partially deaf and watched mostly without being able to hear which is just as well cos I don t care for jazz and would have probably found the jazz heavy lengthy drum rape a bit too much As a musician and former student to an abusive vile bully like this I got what it was doing or aiming to do and distinctly felt a lot of what the students felt during classes I just didn t buy into the characters or their stories at all Initially I bought Andrew s desperate hopes to impress this legendary music teacher everyone fears but respects I recognised and bought Fletcher s abrasive and vile personality the harsh unnecessary and physically abusive practices because I know that very sort one of whom was head at the school of music I attended It all went tits up and lost me when the two characters became unbelievable and did what would directly contradict and conflict with their natures Fletcher s abuse increases to physical violence and assaulting students one of whom we later discover has killed himself and it wasn t checked or picked up on at all until things reached a head with Andrew who pasted him and was kicked from the school but not before helping to bring a case and see Fletcher loses his job Andrew has given up on his dreams and drums but happens to stumble on Fletcher playing in a bar and I bought his initial intrigue curiosity or willingness to at least speak with his former teacher Fletcher seemingly having awareness and acknowledging his faults was immediate suggesting it was genuine because his vile temper and inability to curb and control it wouldn t have enabled him to think so quickly on his feet and have that whole act ready to roll out When he invited Andrew to join him this confident self assured kid that flattened him in front of everyone and cost Fletcher his job suddenly became the keen eager and totally na ve young first year student all over again He d been robbed of his dreams and given up on his passions solely because of Fletcher so it made zero sense to me that he d allow him the chance to do it all over again in a hurry and yet he did When Fletcher was setting him up for complete failure and humiliation I could see how that might happen but not how things went from there Andrew had the balls to refuse to let Fletcher win goes back on stage picks up his sticks and drums like it was the last time he d ever drum which fit his character Fletcher has a few brief outbursts in anger then suddenly takes Andrew s sheer defiance and attitude as something worthwhile visibly reacts and encourages Andrew to really go for it which he does Then two men are supposed to have met each other on equal playing fields found mutual respect with Andrew the next Charlie Parker and Fletcher the reason for it That just would not have happened I know teachers trainers and instructors in many areas and disciplines that believe you have to push someone harder and beyond what they think is their limit in order for them to achieve more than they ever thought possible I m sure there s an element of this being true and in many cases an approach that does work because you have to step outside the comfort zone to find where the magic happens This level of accepted bullying and abuse is pretty common in the performing arts and as I say it s something with which I have a lot of experience but it s much less obvious seldom physical usually a psychological emotional stripping of someone s confidence and self assurance under the guise of them only aiming to push students so they can reach their full potential I would have believed and been on board were Fletcher either less physical and or if Andrew had less balls which would account for him putting up with Fletcher Neither of the two men would tolerate each other let alone discover a new sudden mutual respect understanding and appreciation on an equal basis,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6751856/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,Sensational,Whiplash is one of those films that reminds me why I love cinema not that I particularly need a reminder It managed to turn the seemingly nondescript story of a music student at a competitive college into a breathless gripping edge of your seat experience From the opening shot you can just tell this film is going to be something special It delivered on pretty much every aspect you could want from a film The performances were incredible J K Simmons thoroughly deserved his Oscar for his stunning portrayal of the viscous taskmaster and conductor I was on absolute tenterhooks watching him The moments where the film fell quiet and we were waiting for his hand to drop and the orchestra to commence were filled with almost unbearable tension His rage and his interactions with the students were so explosive and so great to watch Simply superb Miles Teller was equally fantastic Such a physical performance which allowed us to go on this emotional and painstaking journey with him He made his character very relatable despite his flaws On top of this his interactions with J K Simmons were brilliant You never knew which way they were going to go and this unpredictability really raised the film to another level As well as this the film had such a brilliant style and tone The direction was spot on with the camera work adding to the frantic and desperate feeling of Miles character The pacing was also perfect with the film coming in at a nice and crisp one hour forty five Phenomenal,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6531480/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2015,Mildly entertaining with mind-blowing musical scenes.,Now despite of what I m going to say I want to make it clear that I don t think this is a bad movie at all As usual it s just the script that fails to live up to it s premise and indie movie or not Whiplash is being harshly overrated in my opinion First of all while J K Simmons performance is highly enjoyable his character development is being entirely neglected throughout the movie leaving me unable to comprehend his implied ambiguity at all This is a major drawback considering his motifs are a big part of the movie Apparently I m not the only one who noticed this writer and director Damien Chazelle takes the cheap way out nevertheless and instead of giving Simmons some actual scenes to develop trough he just blatantly bashes in a monologue at the end trying to clarify the characters motifs Chazelle instead puts all the focus on the character of Andrew Neyman and his rather trivial coming of age problems which are appropriate for an upper middle class boy his age but nothing even in the ballpark of justifying a whole movie He s studying music at an elite school and has to prioritize His family doesn t quite get him So what The other thing being totally neglected is the chemistry between the two main characters This might be understandable in context of the plot but in order for me to be able to connect with a relationship there first needs to be one This unfortunately means Whiplash falls short on it s premise exactly where it matters trying to be an underdog movie without a real underdog or a real mentor or real stakes making it impossible for the movie to live up to it s potential These are just bad writing choices easily explained by simply not neglecting that Chazelle was the writer behind masterpieces like Grand Piano and The Last Exorcism Part II as well Now while I feel the movie is being praised rather for what it could have been then for what it actually turned out to be I would still recommend it for most viewers Teens and casuals probably won t be bothered by the shortcomings of the script and everyone is set to enjoy the musical scenes that are nothing short of amazing and fortunately receive major attention The rest is kept together neatly by solid craftsmanship from everyone involved All in all Whiplash is mildly entertaining without any real lows and some amazing highs every time Andrew picks up those sticks 6 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3185710/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2015,A GREAT Film; Simmons Deserved Every Award He Received,WHIPLASH is an insane rush Who would ve thought a movie about jazz drumming could be so intense Or good Seriously just go scroll through the list of awards this movie took home Jazz normally a subject I would make an effort to avoid is the heart of this film about young Andrew Neimann Miles Teller who is accepted into the Schaffer Conservatory s award winning jazz band as an aspiring drummer Andrew loves jazz drumming spending 100 of his waking hours listening to it talking about it or practicing it except the odd occasion when he s not taking in a classic movie with his dad Sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime yeah Enter Terence Fletcher J K Simmons Fletcher is the head of the band and a jazz aficionado and he does not accept anything short of perfection His methods are unconventional and well downright abusive He often recites a tale of Jo Jones throwing a cymbal at Charlie Parker s head and how it supposedly inspired Parker to become the legendary drummer he s known as and he has apparently based his entire teaching method on that one moment If Andrew wants the opportunities being in Fletcher s band will afford him he is going to have to push himself to the limit and beyond But that sort of dedication doesn t come without a price and the strain of it all becomes overwhelming Does Andrew have the drive needed to become the jazz drumming legend he aspires to be Or will he fold under the pressure Only two things matter in WHIPLASH characters well two of them anyway and drums Story is a distant third As amazing a film as WHIPLASH is it s not for the creative plot There are very few risks taken story wise and there are minor subplots that are picked up and dropped almost immediately Melissa Benoist is lovely as Nicole a movie theater concessions employee on whom Andrew has a crush but as soon as he gets the nerve to ask her out he s breaking up with her a scene later Her entire role in the film was to demonstrate how Andrew is willing to sacrifice parts of his life to ensure his focus remains on drumming and only drumming There s a slight callback to it later with a bit of too little too late closure but that s all it amounts to No this movie succeeds because of Teller and Simmons I primarily know Miles Teller as being the guy I m always confusing with Shia LaBeouf could ve sworn he was the sidekick in CONSTANTINE and Sam Huntington could ve sworn he was the sidekick in Dylan DOG DEAD OF NIGHT but apparently I ve only ever actually seen him in PROJECT X which I don t remember and now the 2015 reboot of FANTASTIC FOUR So he couldn t have picked a better film to break out of obscurity with He s pretty awesome here His character Andrew goes through a distinct change over the course of the film Well that s not accurate More of an awakening I m almost certain the Andrew we see at the end of the film as within him the entire time and it just took Fletcher to drag it out of him And speaking of Fletcher J K Simmons totally owns this role It s no surprise the man won a boatload of awards for this performance The man s intense We ve seen a taste of it with his hot tempered J Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi s Spider Man series but here he s given a fully realized character to sink his teeth into Fletcher is abusive no argument there but he s got a personal ambition he s striving for Every insult flung every chair tossed he s doing it for a reason Jazz is his life His entire world really He is on a personal mission to find the next era of great jazz musicians he just has a less than legal means of weeding out the losers Teller is fantastic in the film but Simmons steals every scene he s present in His character is just incredibly interesting The big climax of the film between Andrew and Fletcher of which I ll spare any details here is one of the most intense sequences I ve seen all year And I can barely stand jazz Just as FOXCATCHER did with wrestling WHIPLASH takes a subject about with I care almost nothing and turns it into an amazing film The movie plows along at a breakneck pace and I m engaged from beginning to end by the time the end credits roll and we re let loose you ll almost feel whiplash yourself Big recommend from me,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3378240/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2016,A movie that rocked me to my core!,Whiplash was for sure one of the greatest movies in 2014 The things that are most outstanding is firstly the acting including Miles Teller s performance of an promising drummer who also visits as he says the greatest music institute in America and on the other hand J K Simmons who maybe offered the moviegoer of 2014 one of the best performances seen in a long period of time it s still a riddle why he was nominated as an supporting actor Secondly I would like to mention the sensationally effective way of how the editing was used to appeal to the viewer in a certain way namely that camera and sound editing work perfectly together and brought the movie on a exhilarating level The story is thrilling just the thought of having a music teacher like Fletcher J K Simmons is simply a comparison of yourself going through hell Andrew Miles Teller has to do it Does he enjoy it Probably well pretty sure not but he follows his plan of becoming one of the greatest drummers of all time although the pain for him is inconceivable The relationship of these two definitely stands out and saying that Fletchers methods are near to rape physically and psychologically is not very understated By giving Andrew a few opponents drumming his way through the studio band makes the movie even more interesting and shows how deep and on point Miles Teller s acting can be The movie is from the very beginning with the nice overture after a few minutes and other musically supports till the end with again some great acting amazing It could be said more about this masterpiece but I would like to leave it right here as it is my first review Go and watch it NOW,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3474302/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2015,558th Review - And all that jazz,Whiplash is a tour de force of a film that hits you hard in stomach from the get go and keeps going With career defining performances from J K Simmons as a Svengali mentor and Miles Teller as an ambitious young drummer willing to go through hell to achieve greatness Director Damien Chazelle gives the film a near stage like look that suits it well there are only three or four outdoor scenes otherwise the claustrophobia created by focusing on the music practice room suits the piece well This is a film about suffering for ambition A film about the need to be the best to strive for fame but also about two characters who are destined to clash Simmons is pure vitriol knowing exactly how to use his temper and words to break a player and it is a fine performance showing just the right level of loss of control with a cold logic Central to the film is the struggle jazz has to be seen Given the immense work required to become a jazz great jazz tends to be difficult on film compared to the glamor of rock This is a film that likes it jazz straight up and is better for it It is one of the better films of the year It is a powerful film with great performances that it is about very human traits the need for approval and the abuse of power and if liberation is ever possible Recommended,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3168288/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,At a loss to believe review score,I m a music lover not overly keen on Jazz but had great expectations of this film given the review score Oh what a disappointment The only half decent thing I can say is that the last 10 minutes were good Great drum playing but blimey I could not recommend this film,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6490109/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2015,"A blistering, intensely gratifying study on what it takes to succeed",My head is still spinning from the whirlwind of what I just experienced WHIPLASH isn t just a film It has to be seen to be believed The plot although it probably won t do it justice is about a young drummer Miles Teller who is accepted into a conservatory jazz band led by Fletcher J K Simmons Miles Teller s character wants to be one of the greats and Fletcher uses what some would consider questionable methods to push him in that direction That s really all you need to know going in I should say that this is the absolute best I ve seen out of Miles Teller having graduated from teen fare like THE SPECTACULAR NOW And J K Simmons Wow He brought such an intensity to his role that I wasn t prepared for He s probably the best antagonist I ve seen since R Lee Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET and pretty much as creative However it s not just the performances that make this such a compelling watch This film has some of the best editing I ve ever seen and it fit so well with the jazz score The various production elements were tightly woven and integrated in a way that pulls you into the story and never lets you go until the final frame Unlike say BIRDMAN this completely lived up to the hype in my opinion As a character study on what it takes to succeed WHIPLASH is second to none This feels like something that will be studied in years to come and it s definitely worth your time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3285401/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,Not my cup of tea,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7494867/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2015,Good job,Whiplash is an astounding piece of modern day cinema Its a film that leaves you physically shaking even after the second watch and with a complete sensory overload as you try to reconcile every element of that film that seems to have been seamlessly and passionately crafted All that I hope is that Whiplash is not too overpraised in the sense that future audiences may meet it with harsh expectations and come away underwhelmed Part of what made the first experience so special was that I had no expectations I saw a short trailer and it was at a convenient showing time Its excitement may dwindle like sussing out a roller coaster following its turns and loops from the ground before you even hit the queue Whiplash is adrenaline cinema and is best met head on,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3195526/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2023,I wanted to like this....,I wanted to like this movie I really did I tried but I found every main character sort of loathsome with no redeemable traits Though I don t need to like characters in a movie to be able to be absorbed by a film I found myself rooting against most of these characters I love J K Simmons but he felt very wooden and I had the impression that I could see his acting and nothing felt real or organic in his play Plus his sociopathic behavior had rolling my eyes at the idea this was enabled by the school Miles Teller s character was just as unsympathetic and I was hoping he failed at every turn Plus this movie is a total sausage fest with women only serving as plot points and not counting as real people,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9197534/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2015,An intense & electrifying film.,Whiplash is a story about Andrew Miles Teller Andrew is an aspiring jazz drummer who is enrolled at the Shaffer Conservatory of Music Andrew is extremely passionate about drumming will do anything to impress the chief band conductor at Shaffer Fletcher J K Simmons However Fletcher is an extremely short tempered driven teacher who will go to any lengths to make the student play to his full potential beyond This could also mean something as extreme as inflicting emotional physical harm on his students Soon Andrew s drive to become the best jazz drummer in the world turns unhealthy borders on obsession Whiplash is an outstanding film Right from the opening scene the viewer is captivated by Andrew s drumming goals aspirations However Whiplash is an unforgettable movie thanks to the character of Fletcher played by J K Simmons Fletcher is unforgiving intense hilarious terrifying all at the same time The jazz music in the film is catchy foot tapping What s even more impressive is Miles Teller did all of his own drumming in the movie Director Damien Chazelle has made a scintillating film about jazz music Miles Teller is brilliant as Andrew Teller portrays Andrew s fatigue as the film progresses beautifully J K Simmons has given the best performance of his career as Fletcher Simmons portrayal of this insane teacher is flawless the highlight of the film J K Simmons truly deserves all the praise awards he s received for his portrayal of Fletcher Looking at the trend he s definitely going to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor Paul Reiser is great as Jim Neimann Melissa Benoist is good as Nicole Austin Stowell Nate Lang are impressive as Ryan Carl Tanner respectively Whiplash is a must watch Watch it immediately,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3188684/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2015,One Of The Films Of The Year,Superb film led from the front by Miles Teller in the performance of his life and a show stealing performance from JK Simmons who will be sweeping every award ceremony this season The film does have some peripheral characters and story lines but in essence its the JK and Teller show The tension that these two build up in the film with their heated exchanges and aggressive bullying tactics is ridiculous I was pretty much on the edge of my seat the whole movie just waiting for this volcano to erupt As with many films though a lot of crescendo throughout the film can lead to a real let down of a finale as the tension built up just fizzles away like a firework that didn t go off This is absolutely not the case with Whiplash The finale is anything but a let down I ll say no more on that subject All in all it s a fantastic film and is well worthy of its recognition by the Academy in this year s Oscar reckonings,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3186724/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2016,Complete garbage.,Whiplash is the story of a dreaming teenage drummer and his interactions with a strict jazz teacher who team up to become some dynamic duo That would be clich as it is but the writer director tries to go for something different and fails miserably Thankfully it s short because there is hardly a single good thing about this waste of reel except for perhaps a few nice cinematic shots First of all JK Simmons as Fletcher JK is a good actor and plays the role very well but the writing of his character is some of the worst in modern day cinema Jazz is a very relaxed and fun genre Smooth jazz is called smooth for a reason you know Fletcher is a jazz teacher who screams in his players face belittles them in class and even literally assaults them by throwing chairs at them and punching them in the face This isn t the army this is JAZZ This character would be cartoony in an episode of Spongebob let alone a live action film supposedly set in the real world Do you really think people play SMOOTH JAZZ while being threatened and scared to play a single note incorrectly No they don t they need to be calm In one scene Fletcher harasses an obese kid with a dumb name and claims he is playing out of key He isn t but second guesses himself when Fletcher calls him out When the kid thinks about it Fletcher not only calls him fat but kicks him out of class Another student had been playing out of key the entire time and Fletcher says I know was actually in key but not knowing what key you re in is worse than being out of key Are you kidding me Of course you ll second guess yourself if a highly respected and very unstable man accuses you of playing out key And literally the other guy who actually did play out of key gets off with no troubles Unbelievable and very inconsistent with his character as a real Fletcher would ve given him some sort of punishment All throughout the movie Fletcher is belittling Miles making fun of his dead mom and his depressed father as if that would realistically motivate me to work with this guy further If an instructor began making fun of my mom s cancer or my suicidal tendencies I d leave immediately and probably file a lawsuit Again this is very unrealistic for a character who is instructing a jazz band Jazz players need to be as relaxed and free flowing as their music sounds and they shouldn t be constantly on edge because of a sociopath Gunnery Sergeant Hartman of a teacher Miles Teller s character is an smug arrogant douchebag much like the actor himself I genuinely believed he had some form of autism in the movie He separates himself from society and even belittles his girlfriend and family members for something he s barely good at I get that the writer was trying to make it seem like drumming was tearing him apart mentally as stated later in the movie but there is a much better way to do it than you re an idiot and I m gonna be famous one day like he s a 5th grader brat And then he later on tries to contact his ex girlfriend who he called an idiot on their final date and asks her out despite the fact that he knows she has a new boyfriend He s an immature child and not the character we should like In fact not a single character is likable in this heap There are so many more issues within the screenplay that it actually caused me to hit the 1000 maximum word limit so I am just gonna jump to the ending The film ends with the worst ending I ve seen in a theatrical film this decade Miles and Fletcher rekindle several months after the incident and team up to play in a new not related to school jazz recital where Fletcher is the conductor Right before the recital starts we essentially learn that Fletcher is a mentally unstable child who reveals that this entire teaming up was just a ploy to get his revenge on Miles Yes a 57 year old man with a job and career tries to get even with an immature autistic 19 year old college freshman They also made it very clear that this was the big show and that the gig could either create careers or end careers So Fletcher s decision to humiliate a 19 year old by intentionally screwing up the entire gig is super villain levels of evil but not in a good way In retaliation Miles decides to one up Fletcher by going on a six minute drum solo where the most insulting part of the film comes The final shot of the film is a close up of Fletcher grinning ear to ear and Miles nodding with another smile implying that these two are back together again The script even says and Fletcher has finally accepted Miles What a joke and proof that something is seriously wrong not only with Fletcher but this entire movie and probably the writer director too,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3522759/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2015,An ACTION movie about Drumming!,I have completed my quest to view all of the pictures nominated for the Academy Award this year with my viewing of WHIPLASH And I finished my quest with a BANG Whiplash is basically a two hander between drum student Andrew Miles Teller and his teacher mentor Terence Fletcher Sounds boring right Not one bit This movie has as much action as the best thriller Front and center of this movie is the BRILLIANT portrayal of Fletcher by Simmons He has walked away with just about every major Supporting Actor award this year and deserves every one of them It is a tour de force performance and is the best acting performance of the year Lead or Supporting Male or Female BY FAR Fletcher is menacing sharp cutting brilliant and yes vulnerable it is this last trait that really makes the character For if he was all blunt force and bravado this character would seem too one note But he is not he is complex Which makes him well worth watching Of course a performance like this would not be memorable if he did not have a strong performer to play against and Miles Teller more than holds his own It was also welcome to see Paul Reiser appear in this film as Teller s father I sure hope we get to see more of him in the future Director and writer Damien Chazelle crafts a motion picture about drumming DRUMMING expertly and the final performance showdown between Teller and Simmons is an action sequence plain and simple The fact that this action is a drum solo makes it quite remarkable indeed Still hanging on in theaters to bring in the Academy Awards crowds like me WHIPLASH will soon be out in home video Check it out if for nothing else to see the performance of the year by JK Simmons 8 out of 10 stars and you can take that to the Bank of Marquis,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3184044/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2015,Whiplash is like a time-bomb ticking to a point of explosion and that comes in the form of the movie's climax,Whiplash turns the conventional teacher student relationship on its head There are two words that come to my mind that wholly define the movie BLOODY INTENSE and ELECTRIFYING Easily Whiplash is one of the most thrilling dramas that you will ever come across The movie rightly earned an Oscar nomination for Best Picture as it captures the various human emotions like passion determination perseverance and dedication to superior effect One can actually feel the emotions like currents flowing through the veins of the actors Miles Teller and J K Simmons and both of them carry the movie together with utmost brilliance So Whiplash is about a music teacher Fletcher J K Simmons and his student Andrew Miles Teller and their struggle to master the art of drumming The film talks about the extents to which one can or should go to survive in the current scenario of cutthroat competition One may surely not relate to Fletcher s teaching methods but J K Simmons plays the role with such authority that he makes it very difficult not to love his character as he walks on fine lines of an anti hero The power packed performances make the movie what it is and a tight screenplay adds on to its thrilling quotient as the movie deals with the teacher student relationship in the most reckless way imaginable Coming to the cast J K SImmons as Fletcher is a music teacher with highly unconventional teaching methods that mostly involve barking orders cursing like a sailor because according to him everything is fair in teaching as it helps him bringing out the best in his students There are no two words in the English language more harmful than GOOD JOB this particular quote can be called as Fletcher s teaching ideologies in a nutshell and explains his psychology quite perfectly He gives the performance of his lifetime in Whiplash as the movie derives most of its intensity from him and in my opinion he surely deserves an Oscar for this Miles Teller as Andrew plays the role of a determined student who is an apprehensive lad pressurized to his saturation point by his music teacher Fletcher but at the same time he is very optimistic about his career as a drummer Miles Teller brings in the much required vulnerability as well as realism to his role and he completely wins your heart in the third act of the movie The film kick starts right from the word go and once it gets the momentum there s no looking back That s the beauty of Whiplash It has some brilliantly crafted scenes that are so intense and snappy that you might need a moment or two to catch your breath again Whiplash is like a time bomb ticking to a point of explosion and that comes in the form of the movie s climax The drum solo of Whiplash played by Andrew in the live concert with Fletcher finally acknowledging Andrew gives the movie a perfect finish as the chemistry of both the actors on stage reaches a state of euphoria That s the point when Fletcher discovers that the true potential of his student has been finally realized and the relief on his face says it all It s like the whole movie was desperately trying to reach there and the immense satisfaction that the movie leaves you with is brilliant,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3202100/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2015,A highly tuned pile-driver of a drama,77 A film void of death murder and violence yet is as intense as any thriller horror or action flick With parallels to Foxcatcher with the student and trainer theme only here J K Simmons character is not a fraud but in fact is very gifted and if anything is even more hardcore in his approach Miles Teller is perfect as the gifted student you really do believe every step of the way that the guy can achieve something if pushed but you never truly know for sure if he is being pushed too far This has all the bases covered in terms of acting writing and direction with J K Simmons brilliant performance just about nosing it above all else as the best asset There s also some white knuckle plot twists a huge amount of politically incorrect insults thrown around and a brilliant and somewhat deafening ending A fondness for jazz isn t required to get something from this in the same sense that you don t need to like boxing to really enjoy Rocky and as such this is deserving of a look for almost anyone looking for something well made interesting and memorable,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3166492/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2014,"""With it's subtle script explosive fun and stunning performance by J.K. Simmons makes Whiplash a blast to watch""",This is probably the best if not the Best film of 2014 for my personally It s a movie that keep it s simple plot but use it in very subtle way to avoid the clich and repetitive Not only that Whiplash is a movie that i have so much fun with it s intense scene between Miles Teller and J K Simmons characters makes this movie an explosive fun to watch Also i have to say that i m kind of a surprise the performance by Miles Teller last time i saw him on screen is in Divergent movie which he s not memorable at all but in this movie he s doing really good job and prove himself a bit too BUT the real star of this movie is J K Simmons his performance is so amazing and stunning all the time he just control the movie in his own hand and i will be surprise if his name is not in a contender list in Oscar this year In the end Whiplash is a Blast to watch with it s subtle script explosive fun scene between Miles Teller and J K Simmons and a amazing performance by J K Simmons makes this movie on the top of the list this year instantly and it s a movie that teach us the dream is not something you can just try and get it you will have to try more harder and more harder even if it makes you bleed you still have to try more harder,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3118170/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2015,This is why I quit band,If you ever thought you had a mean and abrasive teacher please allow Whiplash to make that teacher look like Mother Teresa You don t know angry instructor until you ve seen J K Simmons furiously shout his head off as Terrence Fletcher the biggest hard ass of a band teacher to ever grace cinema screens He s a teacher whose methods include spewing a creatively brutal string of insults with the intention of pushing a student to their full potential You ll never hear him say the words good job because they are the two most dangerous words you can ever say to a musician Whiplash is a movie carried by its two main characters Miles Teller as Andrew Nieman a college aged drummer and his teacher Fletcher played by Simmons Nieman wants to be the best and Fletcher is determined to get him there no matter how many times he has to spit the f word at his face or how many chairs he has to throw at his head The film is no more than a character piece between the two forces but it is a compelling intense and in your face piece that defines the student teacher relationship when it comes to music My band experience in high school was very short lived but I have heard enough stories from band geek friends to affirm that the intensity of Simmon s character isn t too far fetched I have a feeling that Whiplash is a film that will resonate with any musician whose gone through professional training and will strike a chord with any instructor whose mean shouty ways have always been misunderstood as sheer assholery Sometimes it takes an asshole to make a maestro and this is the feeling that you walk away from Whiplash with This is a movie that takes a big risk as it relies solely on the performances of its two leads to make this film compelling in any way Luckily its got a great script delivered by a competent Miles Teller and a wildly entertaining and nerve wracking to watch J K Simmons The scenes where Simmons attempts to keep Teller from dragging or rushing make my anxiety flare up and it makes me so glad I ditched band in high school and left it to the safety of film to make me understand the fury an instructor is truly capable of When it comes to writing Whiplash is excellent When it comes to performances it s impeccable When it comes to pacing it s jumpy and rocky at points but when it comes to overall quality Whiplash tells an excellent and believable story It s not something I d watch again but definitely something I d recommend,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3165929/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2014,The rhythm and beat of Whiplash only got more intense as the film continued,As a part time actor I understand how competitive the world of creative arts is The biggest and most fulfilling goal is to find something we love doing and being able to make money doing so Some have a passion for the office life but plenty others would rather do something creative Who wouldn t like to make a living by singing and dancing The problem here is that there are more untalented then there are prepared It s not just that they come to make it but it s that they stay without an epiphany that would send them home The new goal is to show why you re better then the bunch So that s when we turn to education to not only improve our abilities but hope that some connection or showcase might give us something once we ve finished There s no guarantee but the ones that work hard are likely find something to do But to make it to the end we have to prove to our teachers that were capable of handling the workload and pressure The biggest question we face is why we need to prove our peers There teaching because there not performing so are they even the right people to prove I guess it depends on the teacher but the question gets bigger when we consider Whiplash Andrew Neiman played by Miles Teller is an aspiring jazz drummer who is in his freshman year at the Shaffer Conservatory the best music program in the country He strives to be one of the greats and hopes to catch the attention of the schools infamous conductor Terrence Fletcher played by J K Simmons Neiman knows of Fletchers reputation as a tough educator but still aspires to be noticed as he continues to practice and juggle a new girlfriend A surprise in class audition finally gets Neiman a spot on Fletchers orchestra At first Fletchers seems calm and encouraging to the young man telling him that everything will be fine But once Fletchers anger is revealed and a chair is flung Neiman breaks down in the middle of class never having dealt with someone as intense as this conductor is At this point he knows that he has to impress him mentor so he makes the decision to break off his relationship and all social life to focus on drumming He gains bloody knuckles and blisters on his fingers but Neiman strives to show that he has the potential to be the next great drummer Whiplash is intense Nope that s not even the right word here Whiplash goes beyond horror film intense The lengths that our characters will go to play jazz is just surprising This film breaks down upon the principle that practice makes perfect Practicing helps but does that create a genius It seems to hint that it s all a croak and that were are either great at something or not I can see the angle here as I m aware of several people that read monologue daily hoping that they ll be better actors That helps improve their skill but they can t be born gifted They simply are better at it or not This film works well because of our leads Miles Teller and J K Simmons Teller must of gone through a crazy preparation for Whiplash as they clearly show him playing these up to ten minute drum solos that would have made my own hands fall off Perhaps the actor himself should be a real drummer Simmons on the other hand is the kind of teacher that no one ever wants Sure he s passionate for creating the next great players but you really question how far he ll go to get that out of his students The relationship between these two is something that s never been done to this extreme between student and teacher I ll give this ten bloody drumsticks out of ten As I said with Nightcrawler the same company behind that also produced Whiplash sanity is all over the place and that just makes for a better movie It s all very fascinating and something that everyone who wants to go into the creative arts especially music should see,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3130734/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2015,Best Movie in Years,Honestly I ve been thinking that the age of great movies was over I d still venture that it is very likely still true TV has really entered its golden age and I can hardly be bothered to actually go to a movie theater and pay full price to see a show any more If I am going to watch a movie I ll wait till is available for rent and then I won t feel so bad that I ve wasted my money if it turns out to be bad Guess what Whiplash has restored my faith in the motion picture This movie is beyond exemplary I cannot understand how it didn t capture Best Picture at every single awards show this season Miles Teller and JK Simmons are absolutely incredible in this film and create the most intense and electric movie experience I ve encountered in a very long time The very last scene had my heart pounding and I could hardly breathe The performances direction editing everything was stellar I had to watch it twice back to back it was that good Do yourself a favor ignore the naysayers that are too preoccupied with the bullying They won t ever get this film so don t pay them any mind Watch this and I assure you that you won t regret it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3193705/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2015,"Pluses/Minuses, yet definitely worth the watch in any case",Loved the way Whiplash played perilously on the margins of the question of whether the teacher really cared or didn t care a whit about his young charge The direction acting cut make it so that at times I was on the verge of concluding that the teacher really was simply an unregenerated cold blooded ba5tar9 It struck me that J K Simmons could easily have R Lee Ermey whimpering like a little girl The technical work around creating believable musical milieus was lovely You really believed in the musicianship of all the actors Not exactly a date flick eh The strong allusion to the fabled mutual exclusion between the drive to excellence and boy girl romance came off to me like a fatal dose of c0ckbl0ck I can imagine loads of date couples walking out of the theater with dark clouds of impending argument cold shouldering trailing behind I felt an overall pacing issue We re invited to believe in the young man s initial musical skill aptitude and his development over the timeframe depicted At times it did feel like they pushed a little too hard I can understand the constraints and I feel another accolade coming on The story was just too big for the standard time constraints of popular film practice Whereas so many films feel like they go on too long only to find that they faithfully hewed to the 90 minute running time the ending of Whiplash comes too fast When the end credits start rolling you blink in astonishment And there was a bit of a time accordion effect as you re watching the flick like trying to squeeze a dockworker s ham foot into a svelte high heeled pump Perhaps they should have created a double length feature with entr acte like the big budget epics of yore But I can imagine the suits at the studios doubting the worthiness of that tack balking at the very idea Damn their bottom line eyes Loved J K Simmons in this He was generally well directed and always amazes in taking direction Speaking of direction the only place where I felt there was a lapse was at the very ending when J K was I presume directed to play it a bit over the top Besides being poor direction it struck me a bit unworthy of a flick about excellence in jazz seeing how good jazz manages tone with control and taste Kinda sad to see this little ball get dropped at the very end But my remonstrances are minor compared to the overall impression which is very impressed indeed Great story good production generally good direction fine acting warmth fire charm high drama great music really a very worthy piece of film work Check it out,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3156675/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2019,"""Whiplash"" is astonishingly beautiful and different!",Wow I mean WOW How did I let this movie pass me by when it first released because I can wholeheartedly say that Whiplash is a modern masterpiece Never in my 16 years on this earth have I ever been as captivated by a movie as I have with this one and I m not even a musician But yet this movie managed to pull me into the screen preventing me from ever taking my eyes off of it and letting me be sucked into this world I mean what else can I say this film is just amazing J K Simmons has perhaps one of the best performances I have ever seen He is so real you feel for Miles Teller s character because what transpires between them doesn t feel like something that was written and performed It doesn t feel like acting It feels real and that is also due to the script and the direction these amazing actors had This is also an incredibly funny movie Seriously everytime J K Simmons opens his mouth it s usually to insult someone in an hilariously crude way Also this film has one of the best 3rd acts of any movie I have ever seen with a finale so climactic that I litteraly didn t avert my gaze for a second in fear of losing even the smallest detail There is only really one very minor criticism I have for this masterpiece and that is the romance subplot between Miles Teller s and Melissa Benoist s characters It just felt to me like it didn t go anywhere and didn t bring much to either character but I m just grasping at straws here Perfection is not easily achieved but I m very confident in saying that in Whiplash perfection was achieved in every way possible A,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5367293/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2023,A masterpiece,Whiplash 2014 is a drumming crescendo of passion and obsession that resonated with me earning its 7 10 rating Miles Teller and J K Simmons deliver electrifying performances creating a tense and captivating dynamic between student and teacher The film editing is a rhythmic marvel mirroring the heartbeat of its music driven narrative The strength lies in its unapologetic exploration of the extremes artists go to achieve greatness though the relentless pursuit may be a weakness for some The music central to the story is both a character and a force that propels the narrative forward The cinematography captures the sweat and intensity of the drumming sequences immersing the audience in the pressure cooker of musical ambition Whiplash with its relentless beat and nuanced performances is a symphony of determination that strikes a chord with those who understand the cost of chasing perfection,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9353967/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,Two words: Music and Fletcher 8/10,Whiplash is one heck of a masterpiece I ve been dying to see for so long and now that I ve seen it I can safely say it is spectacular Damien Chazel directed one year prior to Whiplash a short movie by the same name Once he submitted it to the Sundance film festival and won best short film He got the funding he needed to direct a full longer version of the film The final version is the art shown in front of us Miles Teller portrays Andrew a young student who wishes to become one of the best drumists if not the best His journey makes him ambitious and obsessive when he meets his mentor and enemy Fletcher J K Simmons a hothead full of rage music teacher who pushes Andrew to his limits and drives him insane Among the music Fletcher is the best thing in the movie His ideology to push students beyond what is expected from them is what causes Andrew to prove himself as the best and be more arrogante He and Fletcher bump heads against each other several times proving they don t get along All this tension is cleared off in the third and final act when Andrew and Fletcher are on the stage of the Jazz festival and work together in one of the best sequences of the decade Whiplash is a perfect example for many characteristics tension between characters obsession that drives a man insane composition of music to scene and more Every piece of music in the soundtrack matches the scenes in a great way Making the movie both a joyful ride and caravan of madness,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8066956/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2018,Scary...disturbing....a master class in abusive behavior.....but an EXCELLENT film.,Well one thing s for sure this movie clearly polarized the reviewers Numerous 9 and 10 ratings and a whole heap of 1 to 3 ratings This alone shows we aren t dealing with an ordinary movie it s exceptional As you can see I m with the 9 and 10 ratings rarely have I seen a more though provoking and challenging movie It s an essay in obsession and how those who are obsessed can and are exploited by others to fulfil their own needs Definitely not pretty Definitely not pleasant viewing But a compelling examination of manipulation and ruthless behavior and what it does to the victims Fascinatingly a lot of the low scoring reviews come from people who felt the movie didn t realistically portray what might actually happen in a top music school Or that they felt the manipulation being dished out by the JK Simmons Fletcher role was too repellent to be true Seems it just made a lot of people very very uncomfortable and they watched behaviors they d rather believe don t exist Two points to that Firstly the film is clearly allegorical I agree that in this day and age it s unlikely that the sort of scenarios described would for a moment be tolerated in any decent Western school That said we see around us in the papers every day a storm of evidence of where the powerful in positions of trust have done essentially what was portrayed in the film and much worse to boot So I for one believe that this film is a very valuable examination of the model that can exist where a trusted person in a position of power builds themselves up by tearing down playing off and humiliating ruthlessly those left in their trust J K Simmons in my view stole the show He convincingly created a role of pure evil Initially he ingratiates himself with the vulnerable young Miles Teller Andrew role Naively Andrew believes he may have found a champion Fairly quickly we see that Fletcher is in fact a very nasty piece of work who thrives in brutally playing off one member of the band against the other His word is law and anyone who even looks like challenging him is ruthlessly crushed He s charming when he thinks it will benefit him like many narcissists but exists only to build his own ego at the expense of those around him Ruthless abusive manipulative bullying isn t nearly strong enough he s a psychopath Sadly the kids he s dealing with are either too scared of him to react or they are hoping that they may avoid his wrath and benefit from the discipline he exerts This film s message is so direct and powerful that I d almost suggest it should be compulsory viewing for all kids in early youth The take away would be YES people like this DO exist and they will destroy anyone who lets a monster like this into their lives So know what you are dealing with and absolutely keep your distance,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4131447/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2015,Ringo never had it this tough.,Andrew Miles Teller draws the attention of drum instructor Fletcher J K Simmons whose methods are not exactly easy going Probably not a movie to put on if you re looking to relax Whiplash offers a movie experience like dynamite It makes no apologies about being brash and uncompromising The fact that its well made brilliantly observed and written most will concede Whether they LIKE it may depend on their temperament It raises interesting questions about nature vs nurture and morality and refuses to spoon feed the answers Reactions to this film should be mixed according to the personal truths people found in it I could tell you my feelings but that would defeat the purpose of what I ve said and what the film is saying Its up to you to find that line for yourself is it worth it 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3239998/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2019,Driven To Extremes,Trying to be the best at anything can frequently come at a price for anybody famished enough to want to go for it This is especially true when we talk about fame here in the United States where it seems Vince Lombardi s mantra Winning isn t everything it s the only thing is something that is far too instilled in our culture This is personified in the 2014 film WHIPLASH the film that put its writer and director Damien Chazelle on the map in a big way Miles Teller portrays Andrew Neimann an aspiring 19 year old jazz drummer who has enrolled himself at New York s Shaffer Academy where he comes to the attention of music instructor Terence Fletcher portrayed by J K Simmons who snagged a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role and rightly so To say that Simmons teaching methods are unconventional would be a monumental understatement Simmons character Terence Fletcher is the musical conservatory equivalent of Lee Ermey s drill instructor in director Stanley Kubrick s 1987 Vietnam War classic FULL METAL JACKET a man who is more than willing to push all of his students but none more so than Teller to their musical and even psychological extremes with a whole host of basically shouted scatological imprecations and more than a few choice four letter words Teller s own father Paul Reiser despite being proud of his son s dedication to the art of jazz drumming fears for his son s own sanity under Simmons near psychotic dedication to the art of perfection to the point where Teller s hands actually bleed onto the drum kit Getting involved in a car crash the same kind of incident that a previous student had while struggling to cope with Simmons methodology and which led him to hang himself Teller finally goes to the authorities and finally gets Simmons 86ed from Shaffer something that Simmons inevitably finds out about But it is Teller who will have the last word Based to a large degree on the experiences Chazelle had had in his high school s band which led him into filmmaking WHIPLASH is an often exhausting film to watch and at times deeply unsettling Simmons gets results by hurling the most demeaning insults imaginable at the students in general and Teller in particular because it is his belief that he can get the next Charlie Parker out of these guys something that by his own admission he had never been able to do To him the two worst words any teacher can say to any student are Good Job he ll accept nothing short of perfection because to him Jazz is a dying musical genre in America Chazelle to his credit even though he both wrote the screenplay and directed the film based on his short film of the same name doesn t necessarily see perfection as a bad thing but he doesn t exactly believe that Simmons method of getting there is exactly a good thing either Teller does a yeoman job of showing us how his character s dedication to perfection having to somehow please a tyrant who is all but impossible to please even on the best of days drives him almost to the brink of psychical exhaustion and even a psychological breakdown It is not hard to put ourselves in Teller s shoes because some of us have been in this position a time or two with a character like Simmons here and Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET But even with the experience of the first thirty minutes of Kubrick s great movie and Ermey s performance in there the whole of WHIPLASH with Simmons and Teller battling back and forth is emotionally and psychologically draining especially when compared to the carefree spirit of Chazelle s next film LA LA LAND and the awe inspiring FIRST MAN WHIPLASH is a extremely masterful character study But be prepared for its emotional extremities,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5295947/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,"All it takes is two, Teller and Simmons lead the way in Whiplash",I had high expectations going into to this movie the other day and I must say it delivered Miles Teller stars as Andrew Neiman a promising young drummer who enrolls at the Shaffer Conservatory which is one of the best music schools in the US and he wants to be the best he can be and one of the greats Enter Terence Fletcher J K Simmons a ruthless conductor who happens to be looking for a new drum alternate One of the great qualities of this film is the relationship between Andrew and Fletcher as it plays a bit like a two man show and how the relationship between the two changes as the film progresses as it is them two that carry the film on their back This film is great as it also proves you don t need a well known cast to have a beautifully made film One weakness is the lack of character development between the other band members as they re in the periphery for most of the film although the supporting roles from Paul Reiser as Andrew s father and Melissa Benoist as Andrew s girlfriend Nicole add just a little bit of sparkle Positives for this movie are the performances of the two leads in Miles Teller and J K Simmons the storytelling as it takes you for a ride with the use of the music played throughout the practice scenes and the cinematography is superb I had only previously seen Miles Teller in Divergent but boy is he a young star on the rise as he has talent to burn and I have seen J K Simmons in a few Coen Brothers movies and Spiderman but this is the first time in his career as a successful character actor that he completely steals the show with his tirade of insults towards his student accompanied with acerbic wit and the like and when is yelling at the class I could feel my pulse racing as if he was also yelling at the audience which makes it play out like a thriller even though this film is technically not a thriller Truly a great manipulative villain here in Fletcher as he made me despise him I don t normally say this but in my opinion Simmons is so great here that he must win the Oscar as he gives one of the best supporting performances of the last decade and anything less would feel like a tragedy,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3165318/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2023,As symbolic as it is chaotic,The 2010s had some offbeat high brow dramedies that blurred the lines between insult humor and serious subjects Perhaps one of the better examples of this is Damien Chazelle s Whiplash which follows the story of a love hate relationship between a rising drummer prodigy and an elite a hole jazz band conductor At its core Whiplash is intended to show how similar these two characters are to each other despite the fact that neither appears to identify with the other at the surface level The incredible acting between Miles Teller and J K Simmons makes the film what it is it s hard to imagine another duo trying to recreate this to the same success But it s not just the ferocity of their performances that make Whiplash stand out the symbolism not cymbalism and imagery that is woven into the fiber of the film make it louder than any crescendo you can imagine It s quite possible Whiplash couldn t have been made in this era so it s important to appreciate the film for what it is an electrifying coming of age story that shows how passion and grit can make the most beautiful music,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9316057/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2015,Fletcher's method is completely wrong,This story mainly focuses on the relationship between a gifted music student Andrew and his master Fletcher It turns out that this master uses an absolutely wrong method to deal with his students Fletcher behaves more as a sergeant whose role in barracks is to form brute soldiers using violence intimidation and humiliation instead of behaving as an educator whose mission is to encourage his students to strive for excellence I believe that values as love friendship solidarity cooperation team spirit respect stimulation of the self confidence are more important to stimulate someone to focus on the search of excellence than threats and humiliating critics which undermine the self confidence Who is humiliated use to have one of these two reactions he becomes traumatized and flees the challenges or develops e great hatred against who has humiliated him I believe much more in the approach of Andrzej Kijowski in the story The Orchestra Conductor directed by Andrzei Wajda where the conductor succeeds to improve the quality of the musicians of the orchestra that he conducts by improving their self confidence and not their hatred,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3313491/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2015,So...the moral of the story is... be mean & harsh to people if you want them to do better!!?????,I like J K Simmons especially for during his Spider man years I think he s all the more deserving of that Oscar for being underrated for so long still hope Edward Norton gets his pretty soon And I love jazz and I love all sorts of genres of music as long as I hear a good talented song whatever it is I i like it Though I draw the line at heavy metal I just watched this film just to see what all the hype was about saw on people s review videos from film critics from Best Movies of 2014 lists etc But I m a Christian and I prefer more the wholesome family esc morally strong uplifting and feel good movies that are just enjoyable to the general audience and I m not a fan of violence or profanity nore do I find them the least bit entertaining Overall I just think this film is quite unrealistic a teacher bullying his students especially in music classes in New York I just honestly don t think that would happen I don t think I have any friends who practice any of the drums have a teacher even remotely close to that of Flecther Though it s almost ironic how Simmons the actor I like played the antagonist while Miles Teller an actor I almost don t like played the protagonist In the end I give this film a a solid 6 simply for Simmons keeping me on the edge of my seat PS Want to watch a good wholesome underrated film Then watch The Encounter here  www youtube com watch v VdTMhMGy5rk,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3195784/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2016,"""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ""good job"" """,Andrew Nieman Miles Teller is a teenager newly enrolled at the Shaffer Conservatory of Music the school with the best music program in the United States hopelessly obsessed with his compulsion to become one of the greatest drummers to ever live He is the black sheep in many aspects of his life his family is not musically inclined he struggles in social situations and has no desire to forge friendships Andrew is a loner driven only by his musical passions One of the most noted bands at the Shaffer Conservatory is Terence Fletcher s J K Simmons jazz studio band Fletcher s band is as well known for its penchant for winning band competitions as it is for it s militant and abrasive conductor Students vie for a seat in Fletcher s band due to their consistently high competition standings but Fletcher s brand of leadership is not one that all students can endure Fletcher pushes people to their very limits with his verbal abuse knowing exactly what punches to throw based on the individual Despite his constant abuses Andrew wants nothing more than to gain Fletcher s respect and accolades Being brought into the band as an alternate drummer Andrew will stop at nothing to prove himself to his disparaging instructor Eventually sacrificing everything in his life including his coveted relationship with his single parent father and his health Andrew must decide what he is trying to do in his life and how Fletcher and his expectations correspond with Andrew s desires Director Damien Chazelle makes some brilliant decisions for his 2014 film Among the decisions that make Whiplash a cut above the rest are the quick cuts he uses throughout By choosing to use such rapid fire cuts throughout the film Chazelle makes the audience a part of the world of playing music especially helpful for novices of the craft Another outstanding choice by Chazelle was the low key lighting used throughout the film The lighting which almost makes the film look yellow or orange sets a unique tone to the film illustrating the notion that being a part of Fletcher s band is like being in a whole new world Chazelle also focuses his lighting mostly on the band with special emphasis on the drums initially casting Andrew outside of the lighting eventually engulfing him the more he becomes engulfed with the version of success Fletcher identifies with J K Simmons nearly convinces me in this role that no actor has ever been more deserving of the Best Actor Oscar than he was in this film he is that good in it Simmons character who initially comes off as a one dimensional drill sergeant like band teacher is revealed to have a depth that not all actors could have pulled off Simmons had the task of creating a character that was uniquely inspiring yet unnervingly debilitating Fletcher seemed to truly believe that he was on a mission to sift through every practice room where a truly great performer may go unnoticed and hone their talents before gifting them to the public It seems Fletcher uses his rigid hateful demeanor to weed out those that do not possess the skill and drive that it takes to become one of the greats The much talked about ending pits the master against the student in a duel to prove who has the stamina to withstand the other and whether or not the talent was present all along or not Was Fletcher trying to ruin Andrew it seems so but when Andrew refuses to be thrown to the side like a set list after a concert Fletcher s motivation seems to change right before the audience s eyes After his initial plan fails Fletcher seems to push Andrew in a positive way through the difficult music and seems to want to see Andrew succeed Even that shift in attitude leaves the audience wondering just what Fletcher s motivation is Is Fletcher simply attempting to pad his resume by finding great musicians he can groom for success or does he just love music so much that he wants it to be enriched with the best talents available in the world at the time the audience never knows and Fletcher may not either This complicated motivation and multi layered characterization serve as a testament to what Simmons did with the part and how well he pulled it off There is a brilliant scene during the ultimate on stage battle at the end of the film between in which Andrew s father Jim Paul Reiser who was in the audience for Andrew s show is seen looking through a doorway at his son on stage There is a fleeting brilliantly captured look on Jim s face that show simultaneously that he no longer knows who his son is and his worry that he may have been replaced in his son s eyes Andrew has completely changed who he is in order to fit into Fletcher s band and the skilled way in which he is playing on stage prove that he has greatly developed as a musician Drumming can no longer be brushed off as a lighthearted hobby discussed only during Thanksgiving dinner anymore and he may actually be one of the greats like he always wished to become Jim also seems to see that Andrew has been far more influenced by his instructor than his father Andrew has been strongly motivated by another man possibly diminishing the role his father will play in Andrew s life A stunning visual spectacle a wonderful score and superb acting from J K Simmons make Whiplash a film to be remembered for years to come,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3581234/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2017,A Rip Off of Full Metal Jacket and Black Swan,Cinematography looks like urine stain Lots of shaky hand held camera work lazy The acting is atrocious Miles Teller sucks like always JK Simmons plays a cartoon character The dialogue sounds like it was written by a pretentious Harvard student This film is a rip off of Full Metal Jacket They have the drill instructor that is loud and over the top except the dialogue is trash The music is boy band crap not real Jazz The film rips off Black Swan s plot The drive of ambition and obsession of art forcing the individual to sacrifice everything and embrace his artistic values to the next level Oh yeah there was a movie called Black Swan Nice try Chazelle but you ve been caught 2 2 ripping off other people s work I hope Chazelle gets sued He is no artist he is a copycat like Tarantino 0 10,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3697470/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2022,An electric motion picture!,The breakout for damien chazelle and a reminder of Simmons talent Whiplash is an electric motion picture from one of the most promising filmmakers working today Whilst the anwsers to the questions the film poses are not the right ones this is understood by filmmakers and explored in a ferocious and unapologetic means that only heightens the movie s insane energy and tense atmosphere Whiplash is a simple premise especially compared to the oversaturation of franchises we face today yet manages to seem all the more important in today s climate with it s demand for only the best and most significant art Whiplash fits that category,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8619408/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2015,A haunting and claustrophobic musical drama more intense than any modern horror film,In Whiplash an aspiring drummer faces a music teacher who echoes Gunnery Sergeant Hartman from Full Metal Jacket Throughout this powerful punchy drama the student tries to succeed while his brutal teacher terrifies him and us and tries to drive him to victory in the most damaging way possible An awards season favourite Whiplash boasts many fine qualities which will see it take home at least one award come Oscar night Miles Teller shows vulnerability character depth and determination as the main character although his performance is overshadowed by J K Simmons as Terrence Fletcher probably the Margaret White of music teachers Fletcher is a very frightening character and is the antagonist of the film but he is given depth and motivation as well Whiplash deserved a best director nomination and the editing and cinematography are intense and electrifying matching the rhythm of the drum sticks beating furiously upon the drum throughout the film The script dissects its characters and rounds them well and neither the protagonist nor the antagonist are two dimensional Whiplash has its problems though J K Simmons is being tipped as a favourite to win the Oscar but all he really does is shout most of the time so he shouldn t win Andrew the main character is not a very interesting character at first and while he evolves later he never becomes someone we particularly care about Whiplash is a claustrophobic experience as it s so ferocious and this means it can be unpleasant to watch Also with a lack of anything genuinely uplifting Whiplash is a ugly at times and is an overly depressing examination of the search for greatness It s not a film I will rewatch but it deserves its praise and for anyone interested in music it s a good film to watch It s not the masterpiece many have said it is and doesn t beat the likes of Birdman Boyhood and The Imitation Game but it s worth seeing in the cinema and overall a unique look at ambition and pupil teacher relationships 8 10,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3167380/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2016,A simple concept with a brilliant execution,There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job This is Whiplash s mantra Damian Chazelle s second feature starring Milles Teller who helms the film as a driven musician and drummer in a conservatory band led by the strict and abusive mentor J K Simmons The plot follows their relationship as Teller struggles to gain success and the approval of his mentor If you re not a jazz fan don t worry Whiplash is as much about jazz as Raging Bull is about boxing It s just background or maybe even less than that This is a film that knows what audiences are fed but it also knows what they are craving Its story might seem almost too simple or formulaic but the urgency with which it s told is what makes it unique In an age where most movies dawdle through their run time unsure of where to go or what to do Whiplash is a breath of fresh air but a breath you ll most likely be holding throughout the entire film Whiplash builds up like an exquisite piece of music and doesn t waste a single frame Teller and Simmons s relationship is at times sick poisonous and even destructive Chazelle magnificently frames Whiplash in ill lit and oppressive environments Its close ups are for a lack of a better word claustrophobic and make Whiplash look like it just might bend the frame and burst from the film at any time Of course a lot of this energy is merit of the actors as well and in this case to say that J K Simmons is great is an understatement I fail to recall a more menacing and authoritative performance since R Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket Damian Chazelle has taken a simple and universal concept the eternal struggle for success and acknowledgment and made it into an incredible and high octane film While I know better than to congratulate him with Whiplash I think it s safe to say he s earned it He s done a hell of a job,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3423505/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2022,Stunning performance from Simmons and Teller,As an amateur drummer I felt pretty connected to this movie but it s of course a double edged sword seeing as I was looking for any kind of slip ups in jargon or Teller s drumming The cross editing of his playing was incredible and deserved every ounce of praise it got but I learned that he was really playing in the movie and for that I applaud him greatly On a similar note Simmons performance was nothing short of astounding and when he s screaming his head off in the film it really feels like he s screaming at you The film was also very engaging for me as I found myself getting furious excited and even genuinely worried at times Overall great film with not a flatly traited character in sight,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8004832/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2015,A classic.,Simply put already a classic movie In years to come we ll be looking back to it Yes it s that good Amazing performances amazing screenplay surprising twists it has the lot The movie that should have won best picture of the year If you happen to be playing in a band it s even more relevant If by one of those weird synchronicities you happen to see it just after a bad rehearsal on which you quarreled with the drummer which I had it s kind of an emotional experience I couldn t help but root for Fletcher If you are into music technically he was right all the time There s not a moment in the movie when he s not spot on He s a bastard and you can argue if it s right or not to treat another human being as he did which I don t think it is but he was fair When they played good he said it That s his saving grace And he had no hidden agenda Just musical perfection,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3199088/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2015,Gripping and also inspiring then most films,Terence Fletcher There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job Whiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer single minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory Plagued by the failed writing career of his father Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats Terence Fletcher an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods leads the top jazz ensemble in the school Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band forever changing the young man s life Okay let me just start off with this You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash This was on my movies to check out list because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the Full Metal Jacket but with no war or guns but with music and well drums I think Whiplash and Birdman was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list because who knows they might make the list I haven t seen Birdman yet but will do soon but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways Whiplash is the best move of 2014 J K Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in he s career Every word that came out of his mouth didn t feel like he was reading from the script then act it out no I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him because it was real and not fake I didn t see J K Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie no he was the freaking Fletcher Now let s talk about Terence Fletcher The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven t seen the film yet well his like Gny Sgt Hartman from Full Metal Jacket He has the best lines when his on screen your locked on and his also like the kind of person that would be somebody s worse nightmare to have for a boss This guy doesn t just like music he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn t flat out just hated him I actually understood him He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say You did a good job and yes I did use the words you did a great job n my past reviews but now I m never going to use it ever again after this movie Miles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie and just like Foxcatacher where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he will wants to tell people his love for music but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it s truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough and Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless The directing and the writing in this was just perfect Damien Chazelle directed this movie and written it and man did he do it with style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it This movie also had probably the best finale that I ve seen in years My nails were digging into the seat I didn t dare to look away not for one moment not for one second I was simply locked on and when it was over I m kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie Now the biggest clich that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like You will clap at the end but you don t or You will feel inspired after the film and I you don t But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap It s message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn t just going to come to you Movies like Pride freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me until I watched this movie For problems The movie had it slow parts and that s it really Whiplash is a movie that everybody should see This isn t just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character s have with their passion of what their what to do in life get s over shadowed by something you don t want to do and this movie get s it right So go and see if you have the chance,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3156908/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2015,One flaw: overly dramatic,I had high hopes for this one but they were not fully met Aside from the great acting I found the movie overly dramatic I completely understand the general idea of drama and intensity that drives this movie and I find it true and applicable to various aspects of life I also agree with the concept of being ultra demanding with students if the goal is to form a master musician one who would never be discouraged But still saying this movie is overly dramatic would be an understatement It s dramatic to a point that it s often annoying and occasionally beyond what is believable The teacher himself was great but went too many times over the top The director should have managed better these peaks with less over the top peaks the movie would have had a smoother more believable narration and those very peaks would have had even more impact I also don t like the idea of success continuously pictured here it s like having success in life is only about how famous and established in your work you are What a load of effin bullshit I still give this film a very good rating of 7 5 10 because of acting and some cinematography good twists towards the ending and for the core of the story too AND the great final drum solo But I was hoping for more Or maybe it s correct to say I was hoping for less,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3159223/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2015,Wonderful intense experience led by Simmons performance,Whiplash is a story that winds and lurches unexpectedly but decidedly against the conventional Hollywood grain In Whiplash a drummer aspiring for excellence comes under the subversive mentorship of a great jazz instructor Please believe this is not the standard Hollywood redemption story nor does it have the upliftingly sappy teacher student clich Whiplash is an intense film about those few creative artists that pursue the notoriety of achieving elite greatness Withing the confines of the cutthroat and prestigious Schaffer Conservatory a promising freshman drummer named Andrew gains the attention of an esteemed professor named Fletcher whose reputation precedes him Fletcher invites Andrew into his exclusive studio band It is a story of drive ambition and the pursuit of excellence and the discipline bordering on insanity needed to accomplish this near impossible goal At first glance the title of the film Whiplash comes from the song Fletcher uses as a competition piece for his jazz orchestra The title and term whiplash can also be applied as an analogy for the constant jerking that Fletcher inflicts upon Andrew as Fletcher tries to unlock Andrew s potential through necessary but brutal harshness No one truly knows the unyielding intensity that is needed for reaching creative genius when the capacity exists The dynamic between the young prodigy and seasoned mentor created within Damien Chazelle s screenplay and translated with his direction to film is the most realistic representation of this relationship captured on screen in modern times More impressive is the ability of Chazelle to flesh out his 17 minute short that debuted in 2013 at Sundance Film Festival into a feature film The film is a little slow to start but once Fletcher ignites the drive within Andrew that unleashes some confidence it is impossible for your attention to be diverted anywhere but on the screen The character of Fletcher created by J K Simmons is complex esoteric and obscure He is unlikeable ruthlessly and maliciously sarcastic unrelentingly tough but completely engaging Every scene featuring the actor has your undivided attention with villainous allure Whiplash is a story that winds and lurches unexpectedly but decidedly against the conventional Hollywood grain Some viewers may feel the film ends unsatisfactorily open ended but I find the final scene to be a definitive and momentously clear conclusion to the movie Please check out our WEBSITE for all the reviews of awards nominees and recent releases,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3160928/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,Whiplash grips its audience from start to finish with a remarkable awe-inspiring performance by J. K. Simmons.,BRUTAL Whiplash is a savage film with mind blowing career defining performances interesting storytelling and palpable oppressive anxiety J K Simmons didn t deserve an Oscar for this movie he deserved all the Oscars I was in awe of the intensity and cruelty Simmons unleashed throughout the film while peppering in moments of vulnerability that keep the audience guessing if he is a clever mentor or a manipulative abuser I love how the film ends leaving that very question open ended I didn t enjoy the volume of language and obviously the subject matter of the movie wasn t a fun focus but the mastery of the performances cinematography and storytelling establish Whiplash as a true Oscar worthy film,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8684729/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2018,A real disappointment,How did this film get 3 oscar I still wonder Without a story if not that of a guy who thinks he s becoming a drummer with speed sessions which does not express a true drummer just to please a psycho sadist what it s actually playing Not the technique but the transport that can give during the execution of a piece Plotty and barren in history A film that I discourage everyone unless you want to stop playing definitely I do not say this out of anger towards a bad master Hartman on the contrary that was the most interesting part not to fall asleep Appointing a Rich Buddy without mentioning a Gene Krupa another serious mistake in short a flop,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4070121/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2015,Nothing less than a straight ten is fair for this electrifying emotional blockbuster.,As the end credits rolled I let out an uncontrollable cheer and burst into spontaneous applause It wasn t a film festival premiere it was a cold Saturday matin e in Edinburgh in early January But I had been emotionally unravelled I d been through the wringer and had come out the other end a whooping fan boy Exhausted I staggered from the cinema gasping for breath How on earth could a movie about a Jazz teacher and his drumming prot g elicit such a visceral reaction It s hard to say why because on the surface subject aside there is little that s fundamentally original about the movie s structure But what there is is two absolutely gut wrenching and enthralling performances that smash your emotions all over the cinema Hits to the solar plexus are about the size of it The story concerns the relationship between a 19 year old drumming major in his first year at North America s best music conservatory and his desire to succeed at almost any cost in carving out a springboard and a shop window for a future career as a Lincoln Centre core member His tutor is if anything even more focused than he is and certainly as unforgiving and intolerant of anything less than perfection as it s possible to be The result is a fascinating emotional power struggle shot through with manipulation by both protagonists Much has been said about JK Simmons barbaric performance as the tutor and Jazz Studio conductor who has expectations the height of Everest But far less credit has been given to the equally powerful turn by his pupil played by Miles Teller Simmons simply could not have achieved the heights he has without this perfect foil The film smoulders from the opening scene and aside from Simmons and Teller pretty much nothing else matters other than Charlie Parker Buddy Rich et al whose canon of work is electrifyingly brought to life by the Studio Jazz Band that Teller so wants no needs to join Much of it consists of boot camp scenarios where imperfections are punished again and again and again It s these scenes that create the unbearable tension But punctuating these are the human side of it like Teller s inability to build any relationships at all other than with his single father Drumming is always more important And not just drumming but drumming fame Do not let the subject matter put you off Do not let the fact that this is a jazz infused hour and a half much of it in performance put you off This really is a very special movie indeed and fully deserves a straight ten rating,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3167395/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2020,Saw at Theatre First Day it Came to San Diego,I saw a pretty intense movie today called Whiplash It tells the story of a Young Music student enrolled at a Music Conservatory where the instructor is excuse my French a F Kind of like Hell Week in a Fraternity or Boot Camp in the Service except the kid plays the Drums in a Jazz Ensemble The film stars JK Simmons you know him from the Farmers Insurance commercials with a non comedic role for Paul Reiser from Mad About You fame Miles Teller plays the drummer with an intensity hard to describe you just gotta hear it R for Language from 2014,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6284304/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2018,Rubbish!,As a professional drummer all my working life I had high hopes for this film I am sorry as I could only stomach 15 minutes of this totally unrealistic load of rubbish Music can t be created in some sort of boot camp fear school Other people are saying this is a great film Maybe if you are not a musician you might think it is realistic but really within five minutes I wanted to puke,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4172287/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,The best film for motivation,The 2014 film Obsession Whiplash won three Oscars at the time including for the male supporting role If you add a lot of positive reviews here it already becomes interesting So the main characters are a very young young man Andrew Nieman a drummer who attends the conservatory He not only loves his job he is also ambitious and comes to audition for a local celebrity conductor Terence Fletcher This teacher is famous for his bad temper but he leads the orchestra which is considered very cool in this educational institution In the end Andrew gets his way but what does he get out of it in the end An interesting topic of talent disclosure was raised by Fletcher himself near the end of the film He explains why he is so angry saying that he helps people so much to jump beyond their capabilities,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7778009/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2014,"Whiplash is cinematic freeform jazz: unexpected, unpredictable, and quite fulfilling",Being an artist whether writing something filming something or playing something requires a special edge This special edge is a passion that not everyone can possess and not everyone can maintain This special edge can alienate you from the rest of society can cast you as a black sheep can drain all your willpower but at the end of the day if you are good at your craft this is all that matters Whiplash is a grandiose work of cinematic bittersweet delight that explores that darkness of said passion and the drawbacks that comes with it It is required viewing if you ever want to know what it feels like to be a tortured soul determined to be the best There were only 12 people in the theater when I watched this we all wound up clapping in the end Whiplash thrashes around like bebop jazz initially inviting then becomes loud unexpected twisted daring violent and entertainingly tedious On the surface it looks like a simple tale of an aspiring jazz drummer entering a tough course with a nasty instructor becomes something much more It is about two people that seek perfection in their craft in an art form that can easily hide the blemishes It is about two people trying to succeed in a type of music that is a far cry from what it used to be The olden days are referenced aplenty from style to music to the victim artists within the genre On the surface it may look like a simple film to direct But Whiplash contains a heavy and hyper dosage of extreme close ups long shots fast alternating cuts and just a dizzying cinematographic energy that is on par with the best action films Damien Chazzelle not only writes the strong script that is far from predictable but also gives the movie a strong flavoring of authenticity from the small details to the music that is ultimately performed in front of our very own eyes The acting deserves Oscar nominations all around Although J K Simmons will receive almost all the well deserved attention for a spellbinding and flawless performance as a profanity laced and dangerous perfectionist teacher that becomes a tyrant once the class starts Miles Teller also deserves just as much acclaim for bringing his extremely devoted yet sympathetic lead character to life The jazz action is intense the blood sweat and tears are frighteningly real The tension is heavy in an unlikely Hitchcockian sense and by the time you get to the climactic scene you will simply be swept away by the musical emotional and psychological madness It is not an easy movie to stomach it is a tough pill to swallow But surviving the intense thrill dramatic ride of passion brings enough catharsis and snarky emotional payoff to have you hooked from beginning to finish Whiplash is easily one of the best films of 2014 as it all comes together perfectly like a great jazz ensemble Being an artist is zealous torture plain and simple Whiplash perfectly personifies this fact of life And this type of torture is exactly why I am writing this review at 4 in the morning And whether you understand this aspect of my life or not I wouldn t have it any other way,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128693/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2020,"""Funny games"", music edition.",It s extremely popular these days in the silicon valley to claim regardless of how much success you have yet to have that it was the result of hard work and certainly not luck You know these TED x talks encouraging your fellow man or woman to put in 19h days in front of the PC every day or be a sore loser Replace your meals with pre made smoothies don t socialize it will all be worth in the end when you eat caviar at Harrods In my opinion this can only create a society formed of frustrated future millionaires with devastating results on mental health Whiplash however begs to differs It initially explores this theme using all sorts of unrealistic plot device to anyone with a basic understanding of music school but it s ultimately at the 1h20 mark that it delivers a love story to bullying and self effacement for the glory of being signed to blue note AKA money getting rich On the plus side there s something organic about the style of filming in Whiplash and it s undoubtedly a pleasure to watch in that sense There s also a great deal of risk being taken here with a good 2 3 of the movie being just well jazz imagine the script Andrew plays then plays some more So kudos for that it s courageous no doubt especially as it pulls off its ending brilliantly These courageous decisions sadly do not stop the movie from leaving the audience wondering if they should root for a sadist or for someone so driven by success that he loses his humanity in the process And offers no subtlety in its conclusion,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6024427/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2017,"When ""Good Job"" fails to inspire...",Rarely does a movie hit so close to home that you don t know if your assessment is based upon the movie or your own experience Whiplash pertains atop many facets of life the definition of success the outer perception of achievement the dedication of those who follow a path out passion as well as a personal and pointed view of survival of the fittest as determined by Herr Direktor One could say that the simple lesson of whatever doesn t kill you makes you stronger but that would be too much of an arc Whatever doesn t kill you can still put you through social and passion crushing hell That s what I can relate to in our drummer and Conductor brilliantly portrayed having personally been embarrassed by my HS musical director in class and on stage I can tell you that soul searching is a perfect phrase for such events whether they are caused by you in class or by the conductor himself on stage You don t have to be a Charlie Parker or have a teacher in search for him to end up with self doubt Todd Rundgren wrote They say pain can bring out the artists best but why is self doubt so necessary to achieve greatness I bet we really don t know what greatness is,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3656088/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,Ruthless! quasi! Cool!,The director s control of the music can be said to be at the peak refer to the Grand Piano of the director s screenwriter the previous year although the plot is very bad but the piano performance is also exactly the same as the film the high speed editing fully catches up with David Finch almost perverted The teacher student wrestling brought the protagonist to a thrilling suffocation when the protagonist was forced to the dead end several times Finally the big explosion of the reversal of control status can only be described in three words ruthless quasi Cool,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5667630/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2023,Whiplash (2014) Electrifying and perfect,Few music movies managed to make me feel what Whiplash did Each scene is filmed and edited to make every moment stand out and it works really well It s impossible not to be electrified when Miles Teller fully embodies the character and delivers an incredible performance Character development is phenomenal and the film wastes no time in developing external plots but when it does it is precisely to develop the protagonist The soundtrack is the main point and it is outstanding it works a lot it shivers and makes the film even more immersive J K Simmons delivers a perfect character with many layers Damien Chazelle worked magic in writing and directing the entire film delivering a work that may never be able to surpass itself again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9266168/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,"Let Down By A Single Plot-Hole, However, Aside From That, It's A Masterpiece",Pros 1 The editing is spectacular The cutting speeds up and slows down to greatly harden the impact of the scene being shown 2 The music is wondrous It s obvious that Damien Chazelle Director has either a real passion for music or that he took time to carefully research it 3 The famous Are you a dragger or rusher scene is one of the most intense captivating and terrifying scenes in cinema 4 Miles Teller Andrew and J K Simmons Fletcher both deliver phenomenally masterful performances 5 The story is beautifully paced and despite the lack of content it never once loses tempo 6 The dark and brooding lighting not only enshrines the film in a mesmerising glow but it also helps to effectively heighten the tension 7 This movie helps to explore abuse more specifically it explores the relationship between the abuser and the abused how it affects the victim and the changes to said victim in addition it explores how destructive the abuse can be on everyone affected including the abuser The film does all this in an intelligent and nuanced manner 8 The conclusion is simultaneously uplifting as Andrew takes one step closer to becoming a great but it also ends on a depressing note as you witness Andrew falling back under the spell of his abuser Cons 1 There is just one problem with the plot It s never explained how or why someone could have stolen the drum notebook without Andrew noticing,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5847556/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,Total Fanciful Rubbish,As a professional musician of 40 years who has worked in many facets of the industry including as an educator for primary secondary and tertiary students I found this movie an absolute abomination which could not be further from the truth I have never in my lifetime encountered or even heard of someone who would treat their students in such a way as portrayed in this film In the real world someone who would conduct themselves in such a manner would have been arrested and charged for emotional and physical abuse In the real world of musical education students are certainly encouraged to find their full potential but with all the care love and concern for both the student and their craft Certainly not as portrayed by the heartless character in this film For this film to be nominated for so many awards is also a joke and is indicative of the pulp fiction that Hollywood is only capable of producing,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6195787/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2023,Mediocrity is the Enemy,This movie made me wanna roll up my sleeves get into work and immerse myself in my craft Whiplash is such a phenomenal film that will motivate you to stir up the gift that is inside you not settling until you get to the point of mastery The film presents the questions of whether how far are you willing to go for your dreams and to what costs How bad do you want it And if you are ready to pay the price to make those dreams and aspirations a reality This movie will keep you glued to the screen with all the tensions and the twist and turns of the events One moment the atmosphere will loosen up and you ll get a sigh of relief for Andrew when he finally gets the part And then the next moment the protagonist yet again will be presented with a new challenge The acting is superb and J K Simmons Oscar award is well deserved You ll hate his character in this film but you ll love him for how good his acting was Miles Teller is a gem You ll see him immerse himself to a point of obsession it s believable His acting is sometimes intense occasionally subtle Overall just the perfect match to Simmons If there s one thing I do not like it s the intense gratification of Fletcher s teaching style and how the film failed to addressed Fletcher s abuse with no resolution,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9123982/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2015,9.5/10,Riveting to the point of unbearable Whiplash is a triumph of the power of the cinematic experience both in emotions and afterthoughts When you are watching this movie there is no way possible you will be thinking of anything else if not this movie when you will have stopped watching this movie not many thoughts will have priority in your head to you thinking about this movie Firstly I want to address the fact that some people have said that the film s message is that the more you practice the more you ll get better or that as a critic said Whiplash does not celebrate jazz nor cinema So firstly if you think that the message is the more you practice the better you get I strongly invite you to re watch the movie and maybe turn your head on ha I will not get into spoilers but dam it When our character reaches the top of success he had not been practicing for months at least He clearly reached the top of success because of inspiration to do so obviously practice is fundamental for a musician but without the drive you ll never achieve anything and that is exactly what Andrew wasn t expressing through the music And this is coming from a musician with 15 years of experience Once Andrew realizes it s time for music and it s time to make a show he finally gets to the best he had ever been All those hours of practice and of tension and harassment with Flectcher proved to be nothing compared to the drive of giving proof of himself Moreover Whiplash is an amazing cinematic piece of art it is technically flawless and has some of the most solid and conscious direction you could expect Finally I have never ever been into Jazz it is probably the only music genre in which I lack totally but man did this movie make me get into it I finally got a kick out of it I don t know what it was and maybe Jazz purist will laugh at me maybe not I am not an expert but I know two things the music was Jazz and I really enjoyed it Speaking now of the cinematic qualities Whiplash has It excels in so many fields I really don t know where to start because I simply can t put my finger on which one was better than the other I ll go with the obvious choice to start off and add my two cents to the millions of praises J K Simmons got for this performance It is astounding full stop I cannot think how any other actor could have ever improved it he definitely gave the best performance I have seen so far this year form anybody be it actor or actress I have been a Miles Teller fan before it was cool to be so and I will say that this is his best performance yet He is being slightly overlooked because of Simmons but he really isn t is no less than him Carrying on to other elements the sound the editing the pace the cinematography the writing the direction I could list them all and talk about each one for pages they were so perfectly calculated and never occupied extra space never felt artificial or intrusive They are an example of true brilliance and genius in the craft of filmaking I will say that the film to me did slightly overlook a big element that being Andrew s character I already hear the voice of the reader going Wtf f k this guy But just hear me out I didn t say it completely didn t study him but as much as the core material the themes the energetic scenes and the adrenaline pumping performances captured me I never understood Andrew s character there are a couple of references in the film but it does not deepen him enough I know that s not what the film is centrally about and I did certainly feel for him and connected to him but I never got a deeper look at him and I kind of regret that I wanted to know more about who he was You see him transform you see his down spiraling but you never understand to what degree does he change or how does he think Whilst on Simmons side you get a profound character study which is certainly more the point of the film the lead remains half in the shadows But that is all I have to say against Whiplash it is a masterpiece that culminates in a breathtaking ending and has an ambiguity to it that will keep me thinking for god knows how much,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3168014/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2014,Editing and Cinematography Excellence,Very well shot edited acted and designed with a fresh take on old ideas The movie may have a very specific focus and be nothing earth shattering on the intellectual side but it s worth several Oscar nominations The music is fantastic See it on the big screen As for the controversy around the abusive teacher I would say that it s not necessary to feel that the teacher is justified or unjustified good or evil effective or hindering in order to enjoy the movie and find interesting food for thought in it If a semi vicious teacher who in the real world would overstep the bounds of ethics and even effective technique is a flaw in the movie then it s not a damning one,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3114182/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2015,Best movie of 2014,I was expecting for there to be too much hype and I wouldn t like it as much but this is excellent JK Simmons gives his best performance Miles Teller is not talked about as much he gave an excellent performance too For a movie about a jazz band it was intense I saw American Sniper and I was on the edge of my seat more in this movie I have more respect for people in jazz band now I like to think of this as the effed up Karate Kid I could say this is one of my new favorites I enjoyed the first and second act but the third act is one of the best third acts I have ever seen I can t wait to see what the actors will go on to next Please have a cameo of JK Simmons in the next spider man movie The way it was shot was intense too if you don t like movies with insults then you will hate this The only problem I had was the car crash if they took that out it would be one of the few movies without a problem Other than that this gets a 10 10 if you haven t seen it yet then go buy it now,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3197555/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2020,It's not the inspirational movie you think it is.,Much of the film s success came from its tight editing excellent acting and unconventional portrayal of mentoring relationships Admittedly the film editing is sharp and accurate except for a little slack at the end the whole film is more like an action suspense film the rhythm is accelerated again and again the conflict is escalated again and again the film ends 107 minutes imperceptibly in the past The film s treatment of the music is also quite careless showing the attention to detail and professional spirit,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5602373/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2022,A Masterpiece,This was a masterpiece It took a fairly simple concept a student striving to be the best and a teacher pushing his students to breaking point and executed it to perfection Powered by this premise and a strong central duo it s simple but brilliant The central duo are the team of Miles Teller and J K Simmons Simmons is already a distinguished actor but Miles Teller is much younger he d only been in a couple films when he made this but he holds his own against his distinguished co star Both performances are excellent taking you on a journey with them They vary between angry sad ecstatic the two actors are doing fantastically and their performances help take you into a world you may know nothing about and have you feeling completely at home by the end This film is stressful I don t think I have felt so stressed since Uncut Gems my shirt was soaked through by the end with sweat The movie comes with an impactful message about toxic masculinity and ego but also how difficult it can be to reach the top of a profession At the end the messaging is flipped on it s head which leaves you unsure in the best way possible of who was in the wrong There are a couple moments that only serve to move the plot along but even these don t take away from the final product Damien Chazelle takes two characters one likeable and one not so much He manages to twist our perceptions of both of them multiple times and through showing their points of view without siding with any particular person lets us decide at the end how we feel,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8056818/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2018,One of the very best films of the 21st Century.,Teacher student relationships have always been heavily romanticized in movies for years the ability to inspire young minds to believe in themselves in order to accomplish great things is no easy task As expounded on a year before Whiplash in Blue is the Warmest Color we all want guidance a mentor in this unknowable world and we try to find that in various outlets one of those being our teachers and educators Damien Chazelle s sophomore feature Whiplash begins with Andrew Miles Teller coming to think he has found that person in the demanding hot tempered and never satisfied force of nature that is enigmatic Jazz Band Conductor Terrance Fletcher J K Simmons There is the old introspective exercise of listing the most difficult teachers to get through their classes then listing the teachers you got the most out of when you were their student most of the time with those lists coinciding with one another one to one It speaks to the things that push our limits actually in fact come to define who we are Miles Teller reaches new heights as the the promising upstart Drumming talent enrolled at a Juilliard esque University Conservatory music program He can only see the castles in the sky for himself he just needs to find a way to build the foundation to them His turn in The Spectacular Now as the free spirited teenager Sutter who gets a lesson in the school of hard knocks put him on the map made him a talent to watch out for in the future Here as Andrew however the actor is the very antithesis of the easy going carefree teen in his previous movie The guy knows what he wants and becomes incensed doesn t let anyone get in the way of that and will do whatever it takes to get it J K Simmons in the role of his career so far plays Terence Fletcher a jazz band director at a prestigious music school in NYC who represents in a sense the darkest parts of our self conscious He hurls insults screams with frustration and even threatens with physical and emotional pain He infuses doubt so that those who have it are separated from those who don t or at least from those who can t take it A little bit of Fletcher is in all of us putting ourselves down when we lack the courage to do something we want to do but don t have the nerve to act on If you have struggled to succeed and or believe there is some grand purpose to your life that has yet to reveal itself then you may find Damien Chazelle s fabulous Whiplash strangely revealing,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4150182/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2019,Visceral and abrasive to the point of disbelief,Following its critical acclaim Whiplash was one of the films to see in 2014 a storied account of a promising orchestral drummer in over his head On paper this movie sounds like an excellent premise non conventional and darker than almost any other musically oriented productions However the result didn t quite have the magic I was expecting the aggression displayed by J K Simmons who deservedly won numerous awards for his role seemed misplaced given the nature of his job and the film around him doesn t offer much else Miles Teller one of my least favourite actors working today is well suited for his leading role balancing his character s fractured personality against his commitment to the music It is also worth appreciating Teller s devotion to his performance as he took 2 hour drum lessons 5 days a week for the 5 months prior to filming Outside of Teller and Simmons the rest of the film is just a foil to allow their chemistry to spark constantly pushing against one another to see who will cave first Their intentions however are not the same Simmons has an element of pure hatred hard to capture on screen further capturing the difficulty of his role The camerawork is also strong maximising darkened backgrounds and closeups to highlights the subtleties of each instrument s operations Makeup is also used minimally but effectively slowly building Teller s face up to emphasise the strain he undergoes for his job Whiplash has a lot to like but personally didn t grab me as the reviews suggested If you can build the emotional connection with the leading roles then Damien Chazelle s other directorial triumphs First Man La La Land will also be worth your time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4842526/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2015,"""Whiplash"" is exceptional filmmaking, but is just about one minute too long.",What price success That s basically the question asked in Whiplash R 1 47 Is there such a thing as being TOO focused on a goal How about pushing someone too hard to reach his potential When does motivation become abuse We ve probably all either had a goal for which we were willing to sacrifice nearly everything or had a parent a coach a teacher or a boss push us to the point where we wondered if it was all worth it Well what happens when those last two conditions are present in the same situation Can we expect the result to be excellence or tragedy or both Miles Teller plays Andrew Neimann a freshman at an extremely prestigious but fictional music school in New York City called the Shaffer Conservatory Miles is a jazz drummer who is determined not just to BE great but to be one of THE greats His only friend is the single father Paul Reiser who raised him He doesn t have friends or girlfriends He needs to be free to focus on his music He practices obsessively and things only get worse when he comes to the attention of Shaffer s most demanding professor Terence Fletcher J K Simmons who picks Andrew for the school s very exclusive Studio Band Fletcher makes the drill sergeant in 1987 s Full Metal Jacket look like a purring kitten Andrew literally gives Fletcher his blood sweat and tears but he never seems to be able to fully please his mentor Fletcher regularly abuses all his students emotionally and even physically especially Andrew It s Fletcher s idea of motivation He sees it as necessary to bring out greatness and greatness is what Andrew covets but this relationship is not exactly mutually beneficial It s toxic And combustible As the tension builds Andrew even seems on the path to becoming as rude and cruel as Fletcher if Fletcher doesn t destroy him in the process It seems just a matter of time before someone snaps Inevitable Besides asking some very important questions Whiplash gets credit for excellent execution mostly First of all the acting is terrific Simmons deserves all the awards he has won for the role and one wonders why Teller wasn t nominated for any awards The film s cinematography and editing really add to the on screen tension and the music is so much a part of the story telling that it s practically a character unto itself This film will probably do more for jazz than any film since The Talented Mr Ripley 1999 The only real problem I had with this film is the ending What seems to be a strong narrative thread a consistent message and a uniform tone all thanks to writer director Damien Chazelle who based the characters on his experiences as a music student gets off track in the film s final scene This movie is simply 30 60 seconds too long Except for that this is a very artistically intense film and deserves a look and more than a passing thought about the questions it raises B,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3171997/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2015,Definitely Deserved an Oscar Nomination,Wow That is the first thing that came to my mind when I finished watching this film A great film is one which still leaves you thinking about it after it is over and that is exactly what this film did for me The film is about a student Miles Teller in a musical boarding school who gets a chance to play in the school s best conductor s J K Simmons band The problem though lies with the instructor as he is very abusive towards his students How the student plays in the band is what forms the plot of the film Miles Teller is great as Andrew the student who gets a chance to play in the band He showcases in this movie why he is one actor we should pay attention to in the future as he has the potential to be one of the best actors of his time The director Chazelle has done a fantastic job in keeping the audience glued to their seats and keeps us guessing what the next move by one of the character s will be But at the end of the day the film belongs to one person and one person only J K Simmons Simmons plays Terrence Fletcher the abusive music conductor in the band His intense performance leaves you in awe just by the intensity of his character It is no surprise he got the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor It almost seemed he was destined to play this role In the end of the day Whiplash is an excellent movie and one in which no one should ignore Watch it for the story as well as the performances,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3301982/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2015,The most inspiring movie I have seen this year!,I watched the trailer for this movie prior to seeing Interstellar While I enjoyed Interstellar when the movie finished all I could think of was how much I wanted to see Whiplash Finally I just did and I can happily say it was well worth the wait What an unbelievable feeling when the movie finished It started a little slow however and I was also a little confused with what the characters would bring to the table I couldn t figure out whether the movie was about the love of Jazz music a man that takes you beyond your limits or about the obsessiveness you need to develop in order to be truly remarkable at what you do But I guess you have to wait for the ending to be really sure And when you do it will lift you off your chair While I now want to listen to Jazz music more than ever before and to learn all I can about the likes of Charlie Parker Louis Armstrong and the rest I also want to go to the fist library and grab any book by Napoleon Hill and Earl Nightingale to dig deeper into the subject of life goals and personal success This is how hard this movie has hit me Inspiring,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164193/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2019,A perfect semplicity,Whiplash is an excellent movie dense and captivating that is definitely worth watching I want to start mentioning the superbe work from J K Simmons and Myles Teller because I feel they did great and surely the final movie wouldn t be so good without them In general the entire cast was good but the movie is heavy centred around the two actors previously mentioned But the real x factor is Damien Chazelle who wrote a great screenplay and then thanks to an energetic and electric direction he involves the wathcers into this story This is about the psychological fight between a drum student Teller and his professor Simmons and it isn t something intricated or difficult Indeed is simple but it is executed so well with a great characterisation of the protagonists that this semplicity becomes a plus And finally since this film is about music the score and the jazz songs present in the movie are really important and even in this aspect the quality is really high In conlusion Whiplash is the triumph of the careful semplicity of the passion to telling small stories that speaks to the audiences,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5016568/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2015,Whiplash,A promising young drummer enrolls at a cutthroat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realise a student s potential I finally got to see Whiplash starring Miles Teller and J K Simmons I remember the first time I noticed Miles Teller in a movie and that was in The Spectacular Now with those two films he has shown us that he has a lot of talent and here especially on the drum However J K Simmons in this film is an absolute revelation He s brilliant and totally Oscar worthy What s the most beautiful aspect of this movie is the drive Teller s character feels this desire he has to be great this passion he has for this subject and how he struggles to express it to his family Every person with a dream and a passion for a particular subject where you know everything there is to know about it can understand that Sometimes it can be hard to communicate this idea to someone else make them understand and appreciate it as you do This is a psychological film This movie is so much more than just music it s a psychological battle between two people who believe so strongly in their opinion In fact J K Simmons character is coming at him at all angle verbally mentally and physically He s taring this kid down in the first place and till the end he s giving him hell the entire time This movie builds a level of intensity that I haven t seen a lot in movies and I ve seen a lot of movies particularly through the tune and drumming but also through something bigger it s so intense because it s so personal We get Teller s character feelings as we ve all wanted something so bad enough so bad in our lives that we ll literally put ourselves through hell to get it and if you don t Don t worry You will Overall Whiplash is an intense film in which I can t see one flaw It s simple and efficient It deals with an ambitious young character played by a really good actor and his teacher played by J K Simmons who kills it Somehow you re able to project yourself into this movie and now more I think about it better it gets,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3160205/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2017,Ultimately unsatisfying,Admittedly Simmons s performance riveted me and frightened me more than once in the first half of the film Until it didn t because it was too much one note played too often I thought the ending was a mistake undercutting any kind of moral redemption the film might have won for itself but even if I accept that it s ironic or postmodern or a valid artistic choice good God a 10 minute drum solo You have to either be a drummer or high on LSD to enjoy a 10 minute drum solo Cutting frequently during it did not make it any less painful I m sincerely shocked that some studio exec didn t manage to demand that it be edited down to five minutes which might have been tolerable Lest you think I m an idiot who didn t get the point rest assured I get the point And I don t need all of my movies to have the moral coda that a 1964 episode of Lassie has But this was just nihilistic which I really don t need to pay to hear and it ended with a freaking 10 minute drum solo Gah,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3676730/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2023,"Compelling, but NOT jazz!",College jazz bands are not representative of the real world of jazz This film is about a white version of jazz closer to big band The kind of jazz this tyrannical a hole teaches is not relevant to the real world of jazz music it s a contrived story that sets up a confrontational narrative that appeals to popular American movie fans they ll think they re getting a valid insight into the actual world or jazz but it s a completely faux construct So the delusion of cultural relevance is maintained for the masses but it s actually nonsense Compelling on some level but reality suffers fatally in the process,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8901247/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,Jazz?,After spending nearly 20 years in the jazz world at very high level what can I say did the great read music some some not because everything is coming from the soul not just technique and certainly not from bullying I found also this film very homophobic is not how the real jazz world is it make me really sad to see muosi get bullied by a bold schizophrenic homophobic guy make me so sad because people watch this and think is real if Sheila Jordan friend of Charlie Parker see this she will be horrified sad sad sad Why people think this is jazz I think is really disgusting a guy play with bloody hands did people like goore Aldo in jazz music Again sadness is blowing all over me and all the musi who try to keep this art alive,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8713582/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2019,I must have watched something else,Another example of where I must have watched a completely different film from everyone else The character development isn t just lacking it s practically non existent the great cinematography is undoubtedly impressive but only comprises of comedy drummers faces The message of the film is dishonest and trite Nothing good I can say about this,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5095885/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2015,The determination and drive to be the best,If there is a craft in which you are trying to succeed at all costs you need to fully realize that it will take every ounce of commitment from you even if that alienates you in the eyes of others The question is are you willing to go through with it Whiplash is in that regard the answer to that situation and whether one agrees with the method of getting to one s full potential one cannot deny that once the final product is revealed the struggle was worth it So we are introduced to a young man named Andrew Miles Teller with dreams of becoming one of the great jazz drummers to ever exist At the music school he attends Andrew is picked by the most lauded teacher in the staff Terrence Fletcher J K Simmons seemingly to Andrew s delight But he will soon discover that his new mentor is abusive and mean spirited with his teaching method From there on Fletcher will look to push Andrew to his limits in order to truly shine as a full fledged drummer while Andrew will have to decide how much he is willing to give up in order to make his dream come to fruition All in all when it comes to passion for art in this specific case music Whiplash showcases a powerful connection between the art form and it s performers The movie works around the dynamic between Andrew and Fletcher which is to say the student and the master However it s in a twisted reverse psychology motivational tool that Whiplash stands out from other movies of the type besides maybe war movies where tough discipline is a way of preparing for the future The relationship as a whole grows throughout the movie as does Teller s performance as he becomes increasingly more confident and focused As for the soon to be Oscar winning turn from J K Simmons one can immediately highlight is commanding presence and demanding nature when he is angrily shouting at his students yet his ability to change right back to a more understanding figure shows the diversity he brought to the role as he is asserting in both capacities Whiplash is unlike any movie you will see about the fight to excel no matter what obstacles are put in front of you It s an addictive powerful and complete film that will leave you begging for more Rating 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3186191/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2020,"Good tempo, great beat!",This is so much more than just a film about a drum student at a jazz college It s a film about obsession sacrifice emotional abuse and the relentless drive for perfection The two main characters are JK Simmons teacher and Miles Tellers student In many ways whilst each character has redeeming traits that draw you in you never really warm to them Each displaying on many occasions narcissistic characteristics and a total abandon for anyone else all in the name of Jazz If anything the one thing they agree on is everything else is secondary to the principal goal of achieving greatness The tension during the movie is at times excruciating and held almost at will Simmons In particular creates incredible almost palpable tension never have the words Not my tempo been uttered quite so menacingly He thoroughly deserves the Academy Award The climax of the movie is just masterful key characters facing off fantastic camerawork working in sync with the music and a scene that you feel the whole movie has been building towards The subject matter of this story is simple the execution though is sublime masterful storytelling one of the best films of the last few years,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5872360/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,Quite my tempo!,Ever felt that a movie was so intense and magical that the very thought of it gives you goosebumps and chills in your spine That you wanna keep watching endlessly all day long without wasting a moment That literally makes you a character in the movie rather than one in the audience Well there may be quite a few such masterpieces and the recent to join my list of those unique cinematic experiences is Whiplash A movie which keeps you engrossed on it all the while but feeds you a thousand thoughts to think about after the credits start rolling The main objective being pushing yourself beyond the limits JK Simmons Academy winning gray shaded role may seem villainous to some and heroic to some But as explained in the bar club scene he is a symbol in making you realize your full potential and breaking all barriers Not only in music but life as well Choosing music as a medium to inflict this thought made it sound way too cool I wish this movie had made it much more bigger and won a few more Academy awards There is simply nothing to talk negative about or complain in this movie Be it the power packed acting battle between the charismatic JK Simmons and the meek Miles Teller the immensely grasping screenplay the fittingly thunderous background score or the cut throat editing everyone has drained and pushed their limits for this movie The ultimate final fifteen minutes the part where you forget to blink your eyelids deserve a special mention It will be considered as one of the most epic finales and be remembered for a long time Arguably one of the greatest movies I have ever scene in my life The projection of a simple story with a powerful moral in a such an intense manner is something really unique and movies like these are hard to find nowadays All cheers to Damien Chazelle for giving such a spellbinding masterpiece,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3197992/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2015,Amazing.,Whiplash is an incredible piece of work that gets better every time I watch it Not only does it have amazing performances by both JK Simmons and Miles Teller but the script is incredibly well written and the movie itself is entertaining as hell Intense is a word that doesn t even cut it this movie had me on my toes almost every minute of it It is also very inspiring NO spoilers but there s a scene where Simmons character is talking to Neiman in a bar that scene and the chemistry of the two on screen is just breathtaking Great job by everyone that took part in the movie There are also some shots of the city and of bleeding hands that actually really help emphasize the mood and current situation in the film In the end Whiplash is an amazing film with outstanding performances,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3264916/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2015,Pretty Compelling With Unlikable Characters,One of the most acclaimed films of the year Whiplash is about a drummer and his struggle to become the best in the best music school in the US The only thing standing in his way as well as pushing him to be greater is an overbearing verbally abusive perfectionist professor Whiplash has a few flaws but it is pretty great The story is very compelling and original The pace is pretty quick The acting is great The lead does great but J K Simmons as the dictator music professor really made the film and probably an Oscar The characters themselves are not that likable Obviously JK Simmons is not but I did not expect the main character to be dislikable So as compelling as the entire film is it is hard to like people in it The music is incredibly fitting So if you like drums jazz or pop orchestra you will love the entire film The finale is also one of my favorite finales of the year And the editing So good Whiplash is rated R for language which is moderate but not heavy So if you are looking for a compelling story about success and being the best you can be I ve got the film for you Unless you hate jerks in films or you hate film about drumming Lots of drumming I will say Whiplash is totally worth checking out at store price Would be worth seeing in theaters but it s not in wide release I will give Whiplash an 8 10 Really only because I did not like any of the characters,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158261/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2014,Black Swan- for men,We were deciding on movies to watch at the local cinema and somehow I mixed up the plot lines of Daniel Radcliffe s Horns with Whiplash and thought it was a horror movie We ended up deciding to see this I was half right this was a horror movie Not a horrible movie but a horror movie It shows how blind ambition can descend into obsession and how mentoring can turn into sadism This is the second movie I ve seen in a week where two strong characters are played by two strong actors and that s what makes this film work The first was The Judge In this movie it s like the scene in West Side Story where Tony and Maria only have eyes for each other and everything else is a blur You can see glimpses of how the other musicians feel about the showdown but the show is clearly Teller s and Simmons What made Teller s performance to me is the contrast between his obsessive desire to be great and respected to just having a poker face in a pivotal scene with him and Simmons Teller s face is a blank stare where you don t know if he s thinking What s my next line or On a twisted level I understand where he s coming from or This man is sadistic man trying to justify it So without the verbal and non verbal cues you have no definitive answer to how he really thinks of his mention And Simmons is Simmons as usual The other thing I appreciated was that it kept me on the edge of my seat like any good thriller Most of the time I can call a movie from beginning to end because of it s predictable plot This one I had no idea what would happen next I was tense the entire movie and it took a minute to finally catch my breath when the movie faded to black You can t even say that there was no reason to have such a visceral response because no one died because well you can t Masterfully done with subtle closeup shots that you wonder whether they were done as clues or just shots to be closeup shots And being a jazz aficionado it helped to have an awesome soundtrack Look forward to buying it because the performances of the pieces in the movie were unmercifully short,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3116682/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2015,This Will Be Brief.,I liked Whiplash It wasn t fast paced or anything like that because it didn t have to be All it needed was the main characters looking for perfection and that s what made this this film a great one Andrew Miles Teller joins a prestigious music school and is taught by Fletcher J K Simmons An instructor who seeks nothing but perfection What caused me and probably others to go out and see this film was J K Simmons character Fletcher Fletcher J K Simmons was like a musical drill sergeant abusing his students to get the best out of them I know I m not the only who thought this but at times I was being reminded of Full Metal Jacket J K Simmons performance in this film was excellent That s why he won an Academy Award for best performance by an actor in a supporting role for this film Also the two main characters form an unusual bond that steers the film almost into another direction making the film just about perfect,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3215802/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2021,Mesmerizing...you can't take your eyes off the screen,Before seeing this film I knew character actor J K Simmons for his effective but relatively brief roles as the CIA big shot in Burn After Reading the newly fired desk jockey who dreams to be a chef in Up in the Air and Juno s dad None of those performances could prepare us for his take on Terrence Fletcher in Whiplash Fletcher is a brilliant yet sadistic music professor who grooms a 19 year old who wants to be the greatest drummer since Buddy Rich Nothing matters more to Andrew not his other school classes not his family not his friendships Fletcher is the perfect mentor for this ambitious and probably bipolar kid Fletcher yells slaps throws instruments around verbally degrades nearly every one of his students But then shows a calm likeable side outside the music room Brilliance comes with a cost and Fletcher Simmons puts us through the ringer The climax of the film which involves Andrew and a car crash will have you gasping for air And this is not a thriller or a horror film There hasn t been a greater performance by an American actor in 20 years Bravo to all especially J K Simmons,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7364197/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2014,The Most Exhilarating Film About Music,Rash ambition has been quite the popular theme to explore this year with just last week s Nightcrawler considerably raising expectations on the honesty and depth we can witness from such commentary Our culture the dog eat dog system grooms us to be such ferocious competitors and through it we lose more and more of our humanity We lose sight of the people and the objects around us and all focus is concentrated on one single objective like a cheetah menacingly sighting its prey Well it s Andrew Neyman s Miles Teller first year at the fictional best music school in the country Schaffer Conservatory and he wants to make something extraordinary out of it Playing drums from a very young age he has reached the point of maturity in which he wants to excel beyond cute talent that family simply compliments and prove himself in front of true professionals Unfortunately it s going to exhaust his soul and really test his endurance to reach that level The jazz orchestra s conductor Terence Fletcher J K Simmons who s promising that end goal of potential success and fame is an abrasive foul mouthed and mercilessly strict nightmare who puts his students through torture before they can even hope to perform in front of a large crowd or make it into serious competitions To merely survive his class is to be one of the absolute best Andrew has no idea what he s in for though but when he starts getting slapped around and coarsely yelled at because his drum beats were rushing and in other moments dragging by just a hair the lengths he ll have to reach for in order to ultimately prove himself become clearer His hands already bleeding and his face heavily perspiring how much harder and faster can he pound those drums to reach that paramount level Competition out in the world is undoubtedly fierce and after barely tolerating days after days of soul crushing insults that can send anyone s self esteem into oblivion an even greater desperate drive begins to consume Andrew Realizing that becoming one of the greats is going to require hard confidence and unrelenting ambition Andrew s attitude suddenly begins to take on an utterly smug egocentric nature as he loudly proclaims that he s far superior to any of his peers and is very well on his way to becoming the next Buddy Rich At this point he doesn t even bother making superficial friends or attempting to please all the people around that are essentially meaningless in his climb to prosperity Whiplash certainly remains tense throughout its entire duration as we see Andrew suffering pounding the drums at an unbelievably rapid rate literally with blood sweat and tears which only gradually increases from there with every practice session and every vile rant from his teacher Thrillingly immersive close up shots of the snares and the pedals and the drumsticks the whole intricate process is edited with such intensity that anyone in the audience regardless of whether or not they have a musical background feels the rush and taps their feet along to the ceaselessly energetic drum solos as Andrew only beats at it harder and harder Of course definitely one of the crucial elements of this picture is its two central performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons which are completely revelatory in their excellence the emotional roller coaster between student and teacher with the former s hope assurance slowly draining away yet desperation totally escalating and the latter s uncompromising brutality pushing his students beyond capability and expectancy What we have is a relationship that culminates in a compellingly angry battle of egos The screenplay dialogue moves along with such a sassy swift pace obviously complementing the hasty beat of the jazz music that it represents but also implements a surprising amount of hilarious dry humor beneath all the emotional and philosophical darkness Right from the very first shot as the film opens up to a long murky corridor with Andrew at the end of it practicing and practicing on his drums you can tell how gloomy Whiplash is going to become by its prevalent darkened color Everything from the crowded streets of New York City to the haunting classroom is presented with a transparent shade to these environments that would otherwise be brighter However by the end Whiplash s thematic intentions become somewhat ambiguous is it meant to be a dark critique on impossible ambition because then its consequences and negative impact are not satisfyingly underlined or is it an inspiring crowd pleaser as some critics are pointing out which is terribly frightening The actions and logic of the narrative do eventually begin to reach a troubling level in believability as the film nears its end but the story isn t meant to be taken absolutely literally The overall package is more or less a stark metaphor on the dangerous attitude that leads to final triumph but also destroys one s character and relationships in the meantime There are no two words in the English language that are more harmful than good job Terrence claims A man will never be as definitively great in his craft if he s not pushed to the absolute limit okay but what when exactly is that limit,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3119534/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2023,Wow. Just wow. I have a new addition to my 'Favorites List',This movie was so much more than I expected even though it has such fantastic reviews When a movie closely entails something in which I m not interested but I enjoy it anyhow it has to be good For example Breaking Away I m not a bicycling fan and bicycle racing is the backstory of the movie but it s one of my favorites Same goes for Rudy and football Same goes for Hoosiers and basketball I ll avoid giving away any spoilers here The backdrop of this movie is a young man who has enrolled at a top national music conservatory as a jazz drummer Normally I d be saying Next at this point But it is the personalities of the characters that hooked me in quickly and I even enjoyed some of the music that was played in musical scenes though I ve never been into jazz I don t know where they got people who were both so gifted at playing their instruments and were also really really talented actors but they did This adds a huge level of credibility to the movie and to the characters themselves The instructor played by J K Simmons was someone with a personality that was all over the map We have all known people like that one minute friendly or at least cordial and the next minute mean and nasty That is not the whole plot but it is an ingredient And Miles Teller the jazz drummer student has the ability to react very convincingly in his role to everything that the instructor puts him through Near the end of the movie there is a huge plot twist followed by another and yet another The movie ends up leaving us with a good feeling but boy you re gonna go through plenty to get there Someone in the Reviews here called it a modern day masterpiece I totally agree And it s an example of a film that is carried by top notch acting and writing not sex or special effects This is a really really good film and I strongly urge you to watch it when you get the chance It may become one of your very favorites too,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9174258/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2017,Very good,Whiplash is the story of a young talented drummer Andrew who enters a famous conservatory with a very demanding teacher During the whole movie we follow Andrew in his everyday life where he has to train harder and harder to hope to be part of a concert ensemble But his teacher is really obsessed by his idea to find the new Charlie Parker in one of his students and is really tough with them It s really interesting to follow the evolution of Andrew during the movie and how the relationship with his teacher affects him The teacher being violent closed minded and nervous changes Andrew s way of seeing his future He sometimes feels that he can become one of the best drummers in the world and sometimes that he is not good enough to be part of his teacher s band This love hate relationship is put forward by the fact that Andrew has a deep fascination for Terence his teacher He always wants to do his best but cannot always meet his teacher s requirements The whole movie is just a portrait of how music at a high level can be difficult and how students have to work to fulfill their dreams of becoming a great musician,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3739399/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2020,Whiplash gave me whiplash,I m not a fan of jazz I m not a fan of Miles teller I was aware this movie had gotten numerous accolades but I d kept putting it off because I was expecting some kind dramatic character study with a lot of jazz thrown in Man was I so wrong The summary is fairly straight forward Miles Teller is a drummer attending university in the hopes of someday reaching the fame of famous Jazz musicians like Charles Parker While practicing late one night he s observed by J K Simmons Fletcher a renowned Jazz composer looking for players that could fill out the sound his orchestral band needs to win a coming US competition meant to be the height of success After accepting an invitation It becomes immediately clear that Fletcher is an awful terrifying taskmaster who s mental games consistently crushes members souls while also making it clear if they give up their hopes of ever reaching success are over While at first intimidated Miles Teller s Neiman becomes obsessed with winning the mental battle with Fletcher This battle reaches insane near unparalleled heights in cinematic history This is not a drama this is an action thriller I mean that literally This movie was so intense I was gripping the edge of my seat until the credits In a way I would sort of compare this to full metal jacket Specifically the basic training in the first act that leads to the terrifying conclusion but the largest difference being that unlike Pvt Pyle Miles Teller s Neiman has a drive and intensity to succeed far beyond what is acceptably human It also kind of reminded me of The Usual Suspects in that there s twists in this movie you can t possibly see coming I think I audibly gasped three separate times I left this film with the kind of exultation and exhaustion I didn t think you could feel watching a movie I would recommend this to anybody excepting those with heart conditions,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6428387/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2015,Simply Amazing.,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3162232/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2015,brutal compelling movie magic,Mark twain once said the 2 most important days of your life are the day you was born and the day you find out why and miles teller character portrayed this saying perfectly This film was brutal but so compelling the battle between miles teller and j k simmons is nothing short of genius portrayed on your big screen The story is breathtaking and the way the characters act out this extremely brilliant written script is a Oscar nomination material From the start to the must see ending the movie is set at a thrilling edge of seat pace Whiplash sets the bar very high for films of 2015 you don t have to be a music lover to appreciate and enjoy this memorable film i cant praise this film and the actors high enough,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3157795/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2015,"Brilliant acting, can't get it out of my mind",I was dreading watching this film having grown up with an abusive alcoholic father But I did it and it wasn t uncomfortable like I thought it might be However it is not a true story and it has nothing to do with alcoholism It is a fictional story with a well written script played by high caliber actors Although Whiplash is not Best Picture material it is worth seeing for the outstanding performances by the main two actors JK Simmons absolutely deserved Best Supporting Actor for his role I ve been a Simmons fan for a long time although many people are probably just now learning who he is But in my opinion the story is not really about him In life we all run into toxic people from time to time How you deal with them says a lot about who you are I can t say enough about the ending a drawn out scene filled with edge of your seat tension I could not tear my eyes or ears away Lots of great jazz music in the score so make sure your speakers are turned up,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3193350/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2023,"Blood, Sweat, Tears... and Triumph!",Whiplash is a revelation a stunning and triumphant example of great story meeting great talent and coming together perfectly THIS is what a movie should be and how a film should move you Miles Teller and the brilliant JK Simmons absolutely knock it out of the park as driven student and ferociously abrasive teacher locked in a mesmerizing battle of will control ambition and success Rarely have I seen two more powerful performances in the same film these two appear onscreen either together or alone for virtually every moment of this tour de force I have only two regrets first I m sorry that I waited 9 years to check this movie out And secondly I m saddened that I can t give this film a 12 I ll close by simply saying this is a must see and as close to a perfect film as I have seen this millennium,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8889484/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2015,An Intense Thrill Ride Anchored by Star Turning Performances,Music has never really been my thing unless you count film soundtracks and not many people do So it thrills me to say that this film had me in shock when I left the cinema I felt like I was on a drug a drug that only a film like Whiplash could provide Whiplash is in a way unique it is not a thriller yet it grips from start to finish like only a masterfully created film could So although this film is a Drama it is incredibly intense always opting for the hardest most difficult route It never holds back and for some it may make the film difficult to swallow It is this tendency towards filmmaking that hearkens back to the great unforgettable Alfred Hitchcock Is it a film that matches his greatest work Vertigo I would argue yes The Director appreciates film not just as entertainment but as an art form as well Take note Michael Bay Every overriding factor of this film excels I for one was not overly keen about a film that concerns a driven drummer Yet the beauty of this film is that it pulls you in and overwhelms all of your senses The script is pitch perfect in every way imaginable We are always primarily concerned with Andrew masterfully played to the full potential by Miles Teller who now has an astonishing film to add to his CV Andrew wants to become one of the great drummers of the world and Teller s performance could just be the start of him maturing as an actor I really hope he pays attention to scripts like these in the future J K Simmons revels in the ugly side of his character literally the only side Not to say that he is a weak character because he sure is well written There is no other word to describe his performance scary He plays the determined Mr who doesn t care if he has to throw a chair at your head to bring out the best in you This man is determined to not let anything get in the way of his band being the best that the world has ever heard Yes he doesn t have an ethical code and believes the only way to get Andrew at his peak is to torture him mentally and physically J K Simmons will get the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and if he doesn t then I could not care less about the Oscars He even adds a bit of snarky humour in there for good measure He is a teacher you cannot trust be picked as lead drummer one day miss a beat the next and it is all over for you Making the dramatic stakes in the film even higher and becoming all the more engrossing for it This films soundtrack makes it even more heart racing and is the key for the film s success If this music is poor then the majority of audience members will switch off straight away It isn t and I could listen to Miles Teller drumming for his life all day pouring sweat pain and blood into his work not just metaphorically either Although relationships in the film account for less than fifteen percent of it they add a layer of depth to the characters and make them more fragile and nuanced Andrew struggles to explain the situation to his girlfriend and ends up saying the wrong thing in the process As his drumming career become more important than ever he is left with some difficult choices to make He cannot have his girlfriend and his career at the same time one of them has got to go Another thing that I could not get over was the editing and the cinematography As Andrew s drumming gets louder and the beat and tempo quicken the editing is more sudden with quick cuts and the camera work is more jarring One key image that will stay with me forever is when Andrew plunges his bloody hands into a bucket of his ice The screen is white and suddenly turns blood red Andrew pushes himself beyond the limit no matter the cost or the pain to his own body If it was up to me the film would run over three hours unfortunately it cannot So instead we are left with under two hours of filmmaking bliss Every cast member is on top form and shatter expectations The camera work is stellar Teller and Simmons give us a powerful dynamic to their relationship as student and mentor and the score is any composer s idea of heaven If this film doesn t make it into your Top Ten Films of 2014 then I d advise seeing a doctor you re brain clearly isn t functioning well,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3162054/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2020,Abusive a-holes win,Finally watched this movie and it is one of the worst I ve seen in years Great acting but seriously flawed message The message is that if you are a horribly abusive a hole you will win in the end Abusive a holes create great musicians That is the message While I will agree that many abusive people are never held accountable I can say from experience as a psychologist that children and adults who are emotionally abused do not win,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6074505/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2015,A Top 10 Movie of 2014,Whiplash is without question one of the best movies of the year and worthy of every single Oscar nomination it has received The performance by J K Simmons is terrifying easily the best supporting role of the year The amount of passion he brings to the movie is incredible even during his lighter moments his persona is none the less intimidating and frightening at all moments of the movie He is without a doubt the heart and soul of the movie take that with a grain of salt It s pretty crazy to see a movie about music and instruments pack so much energy and passion when most action movies can t deliver this kind of tension The movie takes the classic tale of What are you willing to sacrifice to be the best and spins it around the music career of a dedicated aspiring drummer And the movie doesn t make it a cake walk either Andrew the title character must first go through emotional hell in order to achieve his dream I ll leave the ending a mystery that way you ll be able to see if he comes out cleansed or not Whiplash is one of the best movies of the year and certainly one of the most surprising how many other movies based around music have been a hit lately And as I said above J K Simmons deserves an Oscar for his performance Whiplash may revolve around Andrew but it s Simmons character who gives the movie life Full Review at www simplefilmreviews com,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3169984/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2022,Whiplash,This film was an immensely intense experience throughout From beginning to end the viewer will be under pressure of a combination of anxiety and suspense that make for an almost completely perfect movie The attention to detail from director Damian Chazelle demonstrates his specifically unique filmmaking that tells an amazing story without as much as saying a word The performances are beyond incredible with J K Simmons being a clear standout The complexity of his character is beautifully matched with the flair of a performance he gives making it a passionately human portrayal The editing immerses the audiences into the stress and tension of the setting making each note of an instrument played have the equivalence of a rapid heartbeat The story invokes the feeling of originality exploring the ideas of obsession and what that can do to a person Although for the majority of the film much of it is executed in an artistic and brilliant manner the romance between the protagonist and the love interest fell flat in its depiction The drama between them was not fully explored leading to a break up that lacks an emotional response from its audience Besides that the artistic exploration of the film s themes the performances that illustrate it and the structure of the overall project ultimately will leave a high emotional feeling of tension and stress for any audience member,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8115464/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,An All-Time Favourite,Damien Chazelle s debut film is phenomenally directed and intense to watch from start to finish but what I really love is how well the film captures Neiman s drive and motivation for drumming Despite everything Fletcher puts him through during the film he still chases his dream right until the end and it s that drive that keeps the film engaging and keeps the stakes high JK Simmons is obviously phenomenal in what is probably one of my all time favourite performances but Miles Teller also kills it in his role aswell I ve had the song Whiplash stuck in my head since this rewatch but the actual score is also really great and sticks in the head well The dialogue is probably the strongest element every line hits so hard from simple conversations to the larger concert scenes It s just a brilliant film and one that I can see myself revisiting time and time again in the future,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6607075/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2015,Whiplash is enthralling from the first frames to the final curtain.,Wow wow wow wow Truly humbled and awed on seeing this film Soo here goes the review A devoted Buddy Rich fan with stellar ambitions Andrew is relentless like no drummer Fletcher has ever taught and the bullet headed Fletcher is distinctly evocative of Full Metal Jacket s foul mouthed bullying and merciless drill instructor Sergeant Hartman Fletcher eschews jazz improvisation for impossibly strict cadences and tempos And when he asks the band to meet for practice at 9 am he will enter the room at that very second Andrew is no slouch in the determination department he dumps his sweet girlfriend Benoist to focus on playing and play he does till his hands bleed It s a battle played out with hatred and respect It s no surprise that Fletcher sees talent in Andrew and wants to coax it out and Andrew s obsession with being the best makes his conductor s approval his solitary aim Whiplash is never about anything other than its two leads however and the pay off is extraordinary a final scene more exciting than any offered up by any big budget blockbuster in recent memory There are very few good movies about music By that I don t mean musicals nor do I mean films with musicians as actors playing their own work The Beatles A Hard Day s Night I mean films with musicians as serious dramatic subjects dealing with their passion for art and the pressures of performance Movies that deal with why people dedicate their lives to music despite the uncertainty of career expectations the constant expectations of performance and the demands it makes on their family and love lives Whiplash does evoke this theme and dramatize it well despite all its regrettable missteps in narrative and characterization The casting of the film is also a key to its success Miles Teller is a gem of a find his desperation sweat and blood are all hyper realistic Every time he struggles to hit the drums you feel lucky you don t have to be in his place Simmons certainly deserves Oscar for best supporting actor Seldom do we see characters in cinema that are so powerful His bald headed black attired mere presence is threatening thanks to those condescending eyes and deep voice Every time he looks at you it feels like he is going to hit you and yet you feel like you have to live up to his expectations Young filmmaker Damien Chazelle has set himself a very high standard here by trying to create the atmospherics of the military school in Full Metal Jacket in a music school of all places Before Whiplash a music school in our heads would have triggered images of peace loving harmless musicians gently punching out tunes out of a piano or bespectacled geeks lost in their violins Chazelle succeeds admirably in reflecting the tension between students and teacher The subtext also underlines the importance of being kind rather than abusive Slick editing with quick cuts and intense montage lead to the final concert at the Carnegie Hall where Andrew plays an extended powerhouse drum solo Never mind the jazz standards what makes WHIPLASH worth the watch is the excellent editing camera work and above all the acting Whiplash is enthralling from the first frames to the final curtain,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3245482/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2022,Driving the Nail of Perfection Home,The first time I ever watched Whiplash I didn t quite understand just what the goal was I saw the hype surrounding it and felt like I had to watch But I just couldn t wrap my head around why it was considered great The ending just didn t quite meet my expectations I still enjoyed it nonetheless But upon watching it again with a little more maturity and understanding of musical drive under my belt I can call this movie a great movie without a shadow of a doubt in my mind As a musician myself I understand the desire to want to be one of the greats and this movie acts out on that feeling in a way I never knew describable I loved Miles Teller s character s drive to be one of the greats He s put down a legendary performance and became someone every musician wants to be And J K Simmons rocked his part in pushing his students to be the best they could be And while his methods were intense and what most would would consider wrong and evil and rightly so don t get me wrong I think he put down the perfect balance of antagonist and teacher Every moment in the movie made for a suspenseful movie but that ending is something out of this world It s perfect and I understand that better now thankfully It s amazing to see every second of the movie come together and show off just how each character made that moment come to life This is a movie to obsess about and I see myself enjoying it more and more with every watch,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8397298/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2015,Great acting+great directing=great ...amazing..spectacular movie..,Lets start off by saying that Simmons is amazing in this movie and also without a doubt deserves the Oscar he got for it and lets go forward by saying that the directing and story was just spectacular in this movie When I started watching it I was just praying that it doesn t bore me but i have to say that it surprised me in every aspect including comedy drama and more When the movie finished I didn t say anything I just got up and drank a glass of water and called all my friends and family to ask them to watch it so i can talk to them about it Whiplash completes all our expectations of an amazing movie that is not only good but also memorable and in a crazy way amazingly good Whoever is reading this review don t waste your time just go ahead an watch Whiplash because you well be astonished like Neo was astonished in The Matrix when he found out what the real world was like,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3384528/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2015,"Not a ""Good Job"" :)",I ll explain my title further on this is also going to be a shorter review because it has been a couple of days since I saw the movie Whiplash is about Andrew Neiman He is very driven to become the best jazz drummer in the world but not just in the world he wants to be remembered for his drumming He starts his first year in the best jazz school in America In the class he is in he gets discovered by Fletcher Fletcher asks him if he wants to join the jazz band of his In this band Andrew is capable of entering competitions Fletcher is willen to push every member of his band to become better but maybe he is pushing them to hard Whiplash is directed by Damien Chazelle He did a nice job at directing the movie The cinematography was also handled nicely there were some nice shots The only thing that bothered me a bit was the color pallet It fitted the theme of the movie but because there was a lot of black in it you couldn t always see what was going on The editing was flawless Especially in the last fifteen to twenty minutes when he is drumming What brings me to the next subject The music The music is so so good I loved the music and normally I am not a fan of Jazz music It was nice to look at how Miles Teller played on his drums The realistic theme of the movie was also something I liked The blood on the drum sticks the sweat on the drum itself and on Miles Teller The movie was surprisingly tense full as well You didn t want Andrew to fail The acting was superb Miles Teller was perfectly cast as Andrew Andrew is the main character of the movie You cared about him He is driven to his absolute breaking point to then rise and become better then before But now why Miles Teller was the best casting choice Teller started playing on the drums since the age of fifteen Which gives the drumming a more realistic feel I ve also read somewhere that the blood on his drum stick his own blood was I love when an actor dedicates himself that much to a role He was very good as Andrew J K Simmons played Tarrence Fletcher He trains Andrew Teller in a very violent way e g by throwing chairs at his head He was absolutely amazing This is his best performance yet He was so good and so intimidating as Fletcher He really deserved his Oscar and it is such a shame that they gave him such a small role in Terminator Genisys They could have made this movie a lot better than it is now Melissa Benoist plays Nicole She is the love interest for Andrew She was willing to support him in his decisions but Andres thinks it is better that they break up so he can focus more on the drums She was also very good better than in the new cbs show Supergirl The rest of the supporting cast was good as well The writing was brilliant How they wrote the characters was very good The curse words Fletcher used were creative but what I think was very powerful was when the car of Andrew got hit by a truck This was powerful because it showed how afraid Andrew was to lose his part that he even ran after a accident and just drummed on a stage This was definitely something that defined his character With Fletcher there is also a character defining moment When he tells to his band that an old student of his is pasted away He tells his band that the person died due to a car crash but later we find out that the person committed suicide The characters were all fleshed out very well Now I ll explain my title At a certain point in the movie Andrew and Fletcher are talking to each other Fletcher says to Andrew In the English language there is nothing more harmful than good job So the title is actually a joke The movie was an amazing time it is for sure a got to movie for music lovers or just for people who like a good movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3359456/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,Intense,Whiplash is simply stunning Its easy to see why the screenplay was blacklisted and the movie nominated for numerous awards JK Simmons too is deserving of all awards after an intense performance This movie is electrifying emotional and is genuine edge of the seat stuff Its a compact movie with a high quality level of drama every moment captured is excellent Miles Teller was superb in his draining role his experience of ambition is dark and testing The finale was strong and outwitted itself so much so that Whiplash will endeavour to be one of my favourite movies of the year for its climatic spectacle of entertainment,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4944253/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2022,Undisputed masterpiece,THE GOOD The script entirely original I might add is undeniably one that was crafted with care passion and love by Chazele Miles teller and jk Simmons come alive in their respective roles delivering their lines with authority The cinematography isn t the flashiest it could ve been gratuitously so if put in the hands of a lesser dop but sets the tone with its dark and ominous atmospheric lighting The editing is perhaps the best I ve ever seen There are scenes especially the final one that could ve fallen apart if the editing hadn t been perfectly conducted The relationship between our two main characters is the driving force of the film and each part of the filmmaking process plays a role in bringing it to life The ending sticks with you long after the credits roll making you question whether it was a happy ending or not and I m my opinion it was probably about the most depressing but brilliant ending possible THE BAD no WILL I WATCH IT AGAIN Yes every year for the rest of my life,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8488349/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2021,J.K. Simmons Like You Have Never Seen Him,J K Simmons dominates the movie His acting is outstanding and it s nothing like anything I have seen him in before He terrifies his students as his way of teaching them to strive for their best He won the Oscar for the Best Supporting Actor but it is hard to look at him as the Supporting Actor in this film It will make you uneasy There is lots of cussing and verbal abuse If that will offend you avoid this movie If you are a jazz musician you also may not be happy with the movie I am not someone who can judge the quality of the music I am not really a fan of jazz but I still was drawn into the story of student and teacher I found it well worth seeing I had heard about the movie and have people I know who reference it all the time I am glad I finally saw it I now understand the hype,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7074568/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2015,Buddy Rich approved,I could write a long review like all the others here but since I fully expect you to read those before you get to mine I ll stick to the core here Miles Teller as Andrew and J K Simmons as Fletcher are the film It s about the the blood the sweat and the tears of music I was training as a boy to be a piano player and later played tenor sax in school Because I had tough teachers I learned to stretch to be full of myself sometimes and other times know that I didn t know it all no matter how good I thought I was The dynamic here is gripping to the point I could not tear myself away but during the travel bit involving a rental car From start to finish you know that what you see is real there is no lowering of standards for the non musical or the that s really nice crowd Every moment to the most extreme has happened in practice or in your head or in the teacher s head at least once and more often than not the bits some will think exaggerated are if anything not as brutal as the real thing And so we come to the drumming was it him or was it clever editing and some anonymous hero The simple answer is it was Miles Teller playing but with help from extended takes and lots of practice that s why it s so good And it s no accident that he has pictures of Buddy Rich all over the place I saw Buddy Rich live as well as see him practice with his band for over an hour when he came through my part of the world Not only was that man a beast on drums he expected only the best from his orchestra A perfectionist he ran that practice like a drill sergeant getting results worthy of the most knowledgeable paying customer in the hall In both teacher and student the ghost of Buddy Rich haunts and possesses them body and soul Whiplash proves that sometimes you need to be an arsehole if you re going to be the best at anything I regret not pushing harder to keep my piano teacher but then again I was 10 and being a dickhead thinking I could just jump ahead and improvise during lessons before I had proved to my teacher s satisfaction I had nailed the material Practice and discipline above and beyond the call of ordinary are the other pillars and in Whiplash you see that in abundance As music films go and they are rare as hens teeth to start with Whiplash touches on all the elements you d know are missing only if you ever studied music seriously I loved it I hope lots of people go out and see it so more such films will be made in future,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3184376/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2021,Absolute Classic.,Whiplash is a real world masterpiece and a remarkably powerful study on ambition and authoritative abuse This film is centered around a sadistic yet respected bandleader and his relentless pursuit for perfection from his orchestra and in particular Andrew or Miles Teller Whiplash is truly a superb and beautifully orchestrated film and will absolutely age as a classic This is most defintely the finest hour of Miles young career and JK simmons was absolutely enthralling as a fuehrer like band leader his Oscar was beyond justified as this was one of the more captivating performances in film I ve seen in quite some time If it wasn t for 2014 being an absolutely stacked year in film I believe Whiplash would of more then likely won best picture Truly a sublime motion picture,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7088215/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2019,When a man it's pushed to his limits,I love this movie It s really rare that you watch a film were passion and commitment is at the forefront its hole play trough I have never in my entire damn life met a more evil person on screen the J K Simmons performance as the musician Terrence Fletcher he is so evil and psychopatic that you hate him more and more when it becomes very clearly that this man is the devil in human form Miles Teller plays the young drummer Andrew Neiman that tries to become a professional musician and get Fletchers respect with his drum skills but it all goes crazy in and extremely sinister way with Fletcher psycho manipulation off the young drummer that is in a nightmare where he either have to fight back or be totally destroyed It s a film that does everything right pacing plot twist acting it got it all And the ending is the best ending in any movie in 20 years I just loves this movie Breathtaking,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4769336/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2014,Whiplash is incredibly tempered film with two brilliant performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons,Whiplash is mindblowing story of success and dreams and the question of how far would we go to achieve those goals Andrew Nieman Miles Teller went all the way to be the best at Shaffer Conservatory of Music in New York in the whole world At Shaffer being the best means to be accepted by Terence Fletcher J K Simmons at his class and still it s always just the beginning and the road is never easy Fletcher is an eccentric charismatic harsh indifferent asshole He is the best teacher and the worst person the same time so it s always intense to be in the same room with him Nieman to the contrary is an young boy full of dreams skills and guts who is just starting to step into the jazz world His temper and obsession with jazz grabs Terence s attention who invites the newbie to the class Even though Andrew has heard a lot horrible things about Fletcher he experiences something only one man had experienced before and he then committed a suicide Even though Teller s character is extremely talented there is never enough for his teacher who does literally everything to turn his students into someones exceptionally brilliant Unheardly difficult practice sessions are the least of problems when you might be thrown a chair at if you play a note slightly faster or slower But Nieman is never ready to give up ends relationship sleeps with drums and does everything to get a permanent drummer place And it all ends up with mind blowing competition between two brilliant minds creating a spectacular journey from day one of their meeting to its end Whiplash is a masterful movie for so many reasons Even though it s a small film it has a lot interesting and memorable to suggest two phenomenal performances good story number of crucial questions answers and it will make you fall in love with Jazz Fairly I d start with performances and by performances I not only mean J K Simmons who gets all well deserved attention awards but Miles Teller who definitely delivered so far his best and career changing performance that I will remember for a long time Teller is unbelievably perfect as Andrew Nielsen who has plenty of important emotional twisty moments that can be a dreamy material for any Hollywood actor He nails all of them started from teardrops on the first lesson to late night practices in the middle with rage fights against Fletcher He completely becomes his character this young confused though very strong kid who decides to go against the tyrant intimidating the whole NY music world There is not much I can add to what has been said about J K Simmons s performance it s breathtaking He managed to create a monster from a man who was really a monster and the same time he somehow feels sympathetic Because of his brilliant acting whenever you see Fletcher on the screen you freeze just exactly the way his students do and this emotions stuck in my head very deeply even though I saw Whiplash couple of weeks ago Besides the fact that Damien Chazelle s screenplay is an amazing material for both actors it s a very challenging story It makes you question so many things and most importantly how ready are you to fight for being the best Showing the relationship of those two people gives you multiple answers and then it s up to your choice Being written and directed by the same guy Damien manages to craft a beautiful story and deliver it in the way that you feel every second of it and never gets boring The reason why I appreciate his work is that it influenced my attitude towards jazz in a good way it actually made me to listen to it to feel it and it s not something many films can not do out there The way he shot scenes with close ups made feelings more acute and sequences were changing as fast as the rhymes of music Each second where they play an actual music named Whiplash is a masterpiece of editing masterpiece of sound and as a whole hugely influential scenes I loved how Chazelle played with blood scenes showing Andrew s bruised hands blood spots on drums and sticks it all aggravated emotions how hard it was for the character to follow the his own and his teacher s ego In conclusion Whiplash is one of the most memorable movies I ve seen this year with two unforgettable performances a quality writing and directing It s an absolute must see,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3151632/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,"Really, Really Enjoyable",This film is not for everyone It s been listed as a psychological thriller but it really defies a genre Call it a drama and be done with it But so original and so brilliant that it s a must see JK Simmons is outstanding as always The support cast is passable to be honest But the story and the presentation are just beautiful An aspiring drummer is pushed to his limits by the jazz orchestra director Simmons All in all the story raises some important questions that are rarely explored What makes greatness It is certainly not talent alone As director and teacher Fletcher Simmons knows that greatness comes form within and from an abiding and fearless place that is fueled only by desire Anyone who doesn t have the drive and the confidence will never achieve anything beyond the space he is assigned And so with out protagonist A wonderful journey from neophyte to hero the story is fulfilling and joyful,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8088837/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2015,When did drumming become a BloodSport?,After the hype all around I went in to watch this movie with a lot of expectations Especially because I haven t seen a movie on drumming at least not a drummer as the protagonist I have to admit I am a little disappointed Drumming is an art One needs finesse to be a drummer Here in the movie it seems all about speed playing fast tempos Double time and triple time To the extent blood oozes out of your body Is that the definition of good music Haven t the makers of the film heard of rests in music charts What not to play and when not to play is more powerful than what you indeed play And why is it that the Conductor Mr Fletcher has his eyes set only on the drummer Not once did we see him interact with the other musicians of the ensemble With all that filth and anger from the Conductor one really wonders if any good music would ever flow out from that band It reminded me of the great movie An officer and a gentleman The Commanding Trainer in the movie was arrogant and ruthless for a good reason But not so in Whiplash,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3189493/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2023,One of the greatest!,I recently had the opportunity to watch a movie that has completely swept me off my feet I can honestly say that I have watched this movie three times this week and I still can t get enough of it It s hands down one of the best movies I have ever watched in my entire life and I m 100 sure I won t find something like it anywhere else This movie is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word The characters are so well developed and their stories are so captivating that you can t help but get immersed in the movie from beginning to end The plot is both heartwarming and suspenseful keeping you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen next I have to give credit to the incredible acting from the entire cast Their performances were so authentic and convincing it felt like you were watching real people and not just actors on a screen The cinematography was also outstanding with every scene beautifully shot and perfectly framed What s more the movie touched on some profound themes that left me thinking long after the credits rolled It made me ponder about the importance of family sacrifice and the beauty of life itself Overall I can t recommend this movie enough It s a rare gem that I believe everyone should see at least once Personally I would watch it every day without getting bored because it s just that good This movie is truly one for the ages and I am confident it will have a special place in my heart forever,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8968556/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,A great film with a great sense,Whiplash A lot of times I saw this film at the top of some movie recommendation lists Finally I decided to watch it and now after watching it I m sure it s one of the most strong pictures I have ever seen The cast is really impressive Miles Teller acted a common guy who has a great dream which is to become the greatest drummer It s really difficult to share all the feelings and pain with a viewer but Teller did it When I was a kid J K Simmons acted a newspaper company owner in Spider Man was my favorite supporting character and it happened again Simmons starred a strict teacher who is the most demanding character I have never seen Everything he wants is to find a musician who can go though problems and finally become the best For the majority the plot is the most important aspect of a movie and I agree with that but there aren t a lot of films where its sense is more important than its plot I tend to belong Whiplash to that type of films The first half of the film was a bit boring Nothing interesting was happening But then I started empathize with the main hero I felt everything he felt It was really difficult way he chose but eventually he made his dreams come true While watching the film you think of some occasions that you had You think of some people who were always rude and demanding to you but after watching it you realize how wrong you was and how much they wanted to help you Most successful people had been able to go though their problems and competitiveness and that s exactly why they became those who they are now Whiplash a great film with a great sense 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7289758/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2016,"An inspiring, energetic, engaging masterpiece.",Whiplash is written directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Miles Teller J K Simmons Melissa Benoist Paul Reiser Austin Stowell Nate Lang and Chris Mulkey A promising young drummer enrols at a cut throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realise a student s potential Whiplash is simply outstanding Beautiful cinematography incredible lead performances and an energetic soundtrack If there were ever such a thing as a perfect film it would be like this It s been just over a year since I first watched Chazelle s impeccable Whiplash and since then I have re watched and studied it many times As a composer and a fan of jazz music I may be a little biased However with such critical acclaim I can t be the only one raving about this film Miles Teller leads as the promising young drummer Andrew Neimann who dreams of becoming one of the greats Teller showcases an ensemble of emotions and without a doubt delivers his best performance yet He decided to learn the drums again and play all of the pieces you see performed in the film live just to be that little more convincing No doubles no camera tricks it s really him playing Of course to make the music consistent with the cuts and to be of high quality they dubbed his already recorded takes over his very real playing Teller now stands as one of my favourite actors from just this role alone J K Simmons is delightfully dislikable as Fletcher pushing Andrew to the absolute edge and eventually corrupting his mind and changing his life forever The writing for Simmons character is genius There are many memorable one liners and skilfully performed scenes throughout Chazelle has put so much work into the story characters and screenplay and it shows The soundtrack features many electrifying jazz pieces and an original score by Justin Hurwitz Every cue every scene every piece is perfectly placed throughout the film and only adds to the brilliance displayed not only on screen but behind the scenes As I ve mentioned before many times I always keep an eye out for camera work and how a director chooses to tell their story The cinematography in Whiplash is stunning There s a subtle colour grade over the shots nothing distracting feeling very appropriate for the mood of the film Another item to look for is the editing It s skilfully fast paced and feels wonderfully fluent Everything about this film is so vividly engaging and exceptionally thought through I can only thank Damien Chazelle Sharone Meir Tom Cross Melanie Jones Hunter Brown Karuna Karmarkar Lisa Norcia Justin Hurwitz Miles Teller and J K Simmons as well as everyone in the Art Sound Casting Costume and Music departments for their blood sweat and tears in making this film possible Verdict Whiplash is simply remarkable Featuring captivating visuals intricate editing an exciting soundtrack and two tour de force performances from Teller Simmons This is definitely my tempo Whiplash 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3553732/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2023,I hate Jazz,Whiplash invokes nightmares of the 1970s and the horrible jazz music they injected into all manner of life at the time For this alone I was never interested in this film and it weighs it down through out no matter how well made it is The soundtrack echoes in your head like a droning chaos of instruments in an elevator While this is a very well acted and directed film it unfortunately follows the typical artist tropes for the lead musician and father writer Yet is not surprisingly written by a pretentious writer who is trying to tell some sort a life lesson but is doing so using one of the most disliked genres of music In a way this is more of a fantasy film because music like the lead character s cousin correctly states really is completely subjective If you did a poll today no jazz musician would rank even in the top 1000 So believing you are going to be one of the greatest musicians of all time in a genre most people don t care about is completely delusional This film confuses intensity and obsession with hard work and passion It is right on one point that you need to earn your spot but to do so you need to know what it is you need to earn A teacher needs to be a little bit of everything a coach mentor disciplinarian etc not just a drill sergeant At the end I really wanted to like this film but looking at the train wreck the lead left in his wake it is hard to think this is a good lesson for anyone to learn Great musicians have relationships families and normal lives not just their craft Jazz like Whiplash just really isn t very good but it is also hard to stop watching My main problem with it though is I hate jazz,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9317490/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2016,Thankyou so much for the movie -Damien Chazelle,Really an inspiration movie which felt me like a music student who sitting under pressure with J K Simmons role real hard way to hang on music as hard life till the end I think each shot you had perfectly depicted to movie without losing the intensity special thanks to J K Simmons The J K Simmons and Miles Teller characters made this movie more powerful which made audience kept on toss As this is a really story experience and best part is how beautifully the screenplay which made this film stands out from crowd Electrifying moments which made me felt that I m student in the band a fear to play the instrument with proper numbers All the best Damien Chazelle for your future assignments This movie will be one of my best liked movie in recent years,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3451773/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2015,"Feverish and Original, Whiplash excels",Whiplash is an ingenious clash between jazz and psychology bringing with it a resounding tale of terror music and insanity that resolves itself so perfectly viewers will be truly speechless at the end of the film The film depicts Andrew Neiman an ambitious young drumming student at the fictional yet very prestigious Schaffer Conservatory A teacher at the school Terrence Fletcher finds Andrew and adopts him into his band where he proceeds to harass verbally as well as physically abuse and push Andrew to his absolute limit The dynamic of the two characters is riveting A young yet highly ambitious he dumps Melissa Benoist to pursue drumming I mean you have to be ambitious to dump Melissa Benoist student attempting to impress his seemingly unimpressible teacher who pushes and pushes Andrew inevitably to his breaking point Damien Chazelle crafts Andrew s practice scenes exquisitely often tuning cuts between shots to drum beats hammered out by the sweaty bloody and often exhausted Andrew as he wrenches his face and pounds away once even punching a hole in snare drum out of sheer frustration at a dilapidated old drum set Andrew becomes cold reckless and violent in his pursuit of greatness while all this is encouraged by his teacher pulling him deeper and deeper into an inescapable sinister and hopeless rabbit hole I believe that the only issue with this film is its occasional lack of loyalty to a certain subject At certain times it seems to jump between the central theme of jazz and the central theme of ambition creating a sort of cinematic identity crisis However this is quite easy to overlook But still Watch it for the jazz Watch it for the excellent performances from Miles Teller and J K Simmons Watch it for the unrelenting depiction of human ambition and what it can lead one into Or watch it for Melissa Benoist Whiplash is truly an excellent film with a mind blowingly awesome ending,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3223835/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2015,"Satisfying on a visceral level, but overcooked and conceptually absurd",Saw the film this past weekend and after mulling it over ultimately came away liking it but not quite loving it I think the movie is superbly made on a technical level it s tremendously edited the use of sound is terrific the whole thing is incredibly kinetic has great energy and is an absolutely enthralling gripping experience But on a conceptual level it s just so preposterous and absurd I had a lot of trouble taking it seriously and maybe I m not supposed to But for this film in particular it was problematic for me and kept me from embracing it completely This is going to sound harsh but the movie played to me like a really really good student film It just feels overcooked sort of show offy but without much justification for all the razzle dazzle It s set at such an outrageously high pitch from the outset but the dramatic beats don t feel earned or believable in any way It makes me wish the film were set in a different world where the character dynamic is still the same but credible in a different narrative context I get that part of the appeal of the film is that it s set in this world where you wouldn t necessarily expect this kind of tension and intensity to be wrung out of it but that s part of the problem for me It s like Chazelle started with this idea and setting and graphed the drama onto it so forcibly that the whole thing just feels inorganic and overtly concocted if that makes sense So much of it works incredibly well but it just lacks a convincing conceptual backbone This may seem like a strange comparison but I enjoyed the film for the similar reasons that I liked Blackhat another film I saw this past week I found both films to be very engrossing and satisfying on a purely visceral level in spite of their shortcomings Chazelle seems like a promising filmmaker and this film is impressive on a craftsmanship level so I look forward to whatever he makes next Again I ultimately liked it but not enough to call it one of the best of the year I feel like I m in the minority in saying that because I ve seen it on so many people s top ten lists,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3178324/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,The beauty of this movie,Art is an extension of the personality or rather of the human soul and this film does not show the opposite A simple basic argument and plot but with a lot of emotion literally showing what was most present in human history the suffering the pain of becoming something better the sacrifice in winning Miller Teller and Jonathan Simmons played splendidly managing to demonstrate strong emotions two roles The brightness and success of the film is certainly in its interpreters,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8245616/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,All Round Good Film With An Amazing J.K. Simmons,The characters were believable and the set up unique J K Simmons was amazing in in his portrayal of the relentless Terrence Fletcher I m not musical but I loved this film I believe there are many people similar to Terrence Fletcher but I ve never seen these people represented on the big screen The relationship between the two main characters is complex and ever evolving I m unsure if I liked the ending though it had its good points too It left you judging whether Terrence was good or bad I just wish that the film had more a take home message As you can see my rating though this didn t affect my enjoyment too much Edit I m changing my review from a 9 to 10 something I ve reserved for perhaps only 2 or 3 films out of hundreds I take back about what I said about the take home message Three years after watching this film I m still thinking about the takeaways from this film on a semi regular basis something so rare The careful balance between positivity and maintaining high expectations is much debated in teaching Interestingly what teachers do and what the research suggests is best doesn t seem completely aligned Having entered teaching and having read deep into the research it becomes even thought provoking,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4257984/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2015,Whiplash: Teacher Abuse has never had such rhythm,J K Simmons has always been that guy in that thing and he really has been in a lot of things from Spider man Farmers Insurance commercials to a family sitcom about a blind guy And while Simmons has been around awhile he hasn t really been given anything to sink his teeth into In comes young upstart writer director Damien Chazzelle and his jazz ensemble epic Whiplash Whiplash has the unique honor of being the least profitable film to be nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards along with Chazzelles script and Simmons for supporting actor but for a film that appears so small it is one of the biggest and most epic viewing experiences of the year One of the reasons I loved Whiplash is that it surrounds a subject matter that I have little knowledge on the world of surprisingly competitive jazz ensemble Jazz music is all about precision technique and patience and all of those are on display in explosive fashion The story follows a young aspiring jazz drummer Andrew Miles Teller who dreams of greatness while at the Schaefer Music Conservatory in New York All of the students hope to join the exclusive Jazz ensemble led by the tyrannical Terence Fletcher Simmons who puts the title of abusive teacher to a whole new level Everyone has had that one teacher or coach in their lives that was unbearable They would scream criticize and cause you so so much emotional abuse that caused you to fail more than the class or sport ever could Few films have ever been able to capture this idea better than Whiplash as we watch Fletcher verbally emasculate his band members to tears and physical torment that is almost too much to watch It s hard to say why Simmons was so effective here He has the deep menacing voice threatening eyes and is looking surprisingly jacked in his black t shirts seriously is Simmons gonna be the next Marvel super villain or something that help make him the bane of existence for all of his students You also can t talk about Whiplash without mentioning the lead role of Miles Teller Teller is one of Hollywoods talented up and comers especially if you ve seen him in The Spectacular Now and he almost seemed to be the heir apparent to Vince Vaughn as the funny fast talking likable schlub who could go on to lead comedies for the foreseeable future This is actually the most different Teller then we ve seen in his young career His character of Andrew is of a socially awkward and talented musician who hasn t had a lot of success in life and will do anything to establish himself and make it so he is remembered for being great long after he s gone shown perfectly during the dinner scene with his family maybe the best scene in the film To do this he is willing to take Fletcher s abuse and use it as the motivation to prove he is great Anyone in the teaching coaching profession can tell you that arguably the most difficult aspect of the profession is motivating your students Fletcher s choice to use fear as his motivational tool proves to have varying success rates as he very easily breaks his students but their fear of him pushes them to be perfect because that is what he expects You grow to hate Fletcher so much throughout the film that when it gets to a point in the film where he explains he cruelty it messes with you emotionally because you begin to somehow empathize with him The fact that you can show any sympathy towards the character after what you ve seen him to is a feat in itself and the credit goes to Chazzelle for shaping the story that way I hate to use the term emotional roller coaster few films of recent memory fit that clich better than Whiplash The Jazz genre really fits the flow of the story because it can be easy going and calculated one minute to explosive and heart pounding the next Being able to fit so much size into a small budget film like this is amazing and a screenplay Oscar for Chazzelle should be in order if there was any justice in the world I don t know if Chazzelle had a film teacher who was as harsh as Fletcher who pushed him as hard but one thing is for sure is that much like Andrew Chazzelle seems like he wants to be great and I can t wait for him to continue to prove that,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3179488/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2022,The most intense film ever,The Level of intensity is absolutely high in this film and it s balanced beautifully It s an another masterpiece from Damien Chazelle I actually consider him as a great filmmaker just by this and La La Land He s a genius The way that he s trying to live up the jazz music is gorgeous and fascinating I personally respect and love him for bringing jazz to the masses in 21st century He directed and written Whiplash as a great filmmaker Almost flawless Justin Hurwitz and the standard numbers were gorgeous and splendid J K Simmons and Miles Teller were great J K Simmons acting was perfect From down to top everything was played perfectly He s awesome Miles Teller played his parts like he s a drummer for years which is unbelievable It s really about someone abusive in power and someone thirsty to thrive and how sometimes this combination can lead to disaster This could act as an allegorical psychological story to almost every situation like for example an abusive dad who wants to have successful son no matter what or what cost There were some very tiny flaws in things that I could change from this bombastic film like excessive bleeding which is not entirely realistic 8 5 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8524535/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2015,Flawed but brilliant,This film has very little to do with drumming It has even less to do with Jazz Musicians who complain about the factual and musical inaccuracies of this film are kind of missing the point It s a drama The script is excellent the characters are as deep as you could possibly wish for the acting is absolutely top notch across the board the pacing as the story develops is wonderful the ending will leave you hot and cold at the same time Yes the Charlie Parker story is apocryphal but from a storytelling point of view it s perfect Yes Miles Teller s miming is sometimes rather off but by Jove you can see he s put some bloody work in and taken it seriously This isn t like Julia Stiles in Save The Last Dance Incidentally J K Simmons piano miming is pretty on the money If you don t know anything about music you ll love it If you re a musician you ll love it if you ve got any bloody common sense and remember that it s a film Verdict It s the Jazz version of Amadeus So what if it s inaccurate IT IS A BRILLIANT FILM yetanotherfilmreviewblog tumblr com,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3339774/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2020,Kept me on the edge of my seat!,Wow this was such a highly intense film which I did not expect at all It made me very hyped up and energetic while nervous of what happened next in this film This film is about a young drummer aspiring to be the next biggest hit As he came under a mentor he started having a high dunk of himself Too high This was a very intense ride of a film as you saw the uprising downfall and once again uprising of this young drummer The acting in this film was phenomenal besides that especially the performance of this young drummer played by Miles Teller He truly only saw one way out which was forwards He got blinded by success but in the end managed to escape the spiraling downfall he was getting into This film honestly made me quite speechless as probably can be seen from my review because I am writing this right after having finished the film I recommend everyone to watch this film even if you don t find drumming appealing at all because this film surely will keep you on the edge of your seat like it did to me,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5777743/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2015,The hype is pretty much justified. Whiplash is a superbly acted adrenaline-shot.,Being a film that won three Oscars and being ranked nr 36 on IMDb s top 250 this film had a lot to live up to and based on the trailer I had no huge expectations in any way but I was curious And my curiosity was answered met and extremely satisfied This is not a film with many important characters most of the support like Paul Reisers odd but concerned dad exist only in the periphery and that is completely okay a film does not have to go all Magnolia and have half of Hollywood in it sometimes all you need to make true sparks fly is an overlooked character actor and a newcomer eager to prove himself Miles Teller of whom I ve never heard delivers a star making performance Truly impressive showing an extreme range juggling Andrews insecurities obsession frustration inner turmoil and rage I expect great things from this young man I have never held J K Simmons in extremely high regard I really dug him in OZ and as Jonah Jameson in the Spider man series but otherwise he often didn t really register having a face that God seemed to have shaped to define the true expression of constant dead pan sarcasm Simmons completely sheds his usual on screen persona here Sure his Fletcher is mean a bully a tormentor a sadistic perfectionist but he is given so much depth and complexity handled by Simmons without missing a note not one moment rings false This man will sacrifice his own career just to find the next Charlie Parker What first comes off as cruelty is a test of our young protagonists ambition I might hate to admit it as a big fan of Ruffalo s work in Foxcatcher and Norton s in Birdman but this veteran actor truly deserved his golden statue This is a film about obsession narcissism competition ambition and music Both of the main characters have the same goal For Andrew to achieve absolute greatness The road to that possible goal is unfortunately for Andrew paved with abuse torture and self torture all instigated by Fletchers harsh but effective coaching One of them must take the role as antagonist for both to be able to reach their common goal which might be easier said then done This film especially Andrews bleeding fingers makes drumming seem more intense and endurance demanding then Mixed Martial Arts it sucks you in and refuses to let go No none of the two leads Maybe Simmons should ve been up for a lead Oscar are especially likable Fletchers vulgar persona is pretty quickly presented to us while Andrew in a hilariously awkward scene breaks up with his girlfriend based on elaborate selfish speculation on how she would react to him having drumming as his number one passion They may not be that likable but they are very human and though not admitting it they both know they re flawed individuals The editing is amazing in this film The frantic rhythm the close effective cuts in a rhythmic musical tempo especially during the films drumming sessions are hypnotic Along with the flawless sound mixing that makes for three very well deserved Oscars What a film What an energy What a masterpiece I can not wait to see what the confident newcomer Damien Chazell brings us in the future If this is not your tempo then I don t know what is,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3208634/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2015,Teacher/Student relationship,I teach painting drawing and workshops in public art and would never treat my students let alone another human being the way Terence Fletcher the intensely controlling jazz instructor in a prestigious Music Conservatory in NYC eerily and wonderfully acted by J C Simmons hammers his students to what Fletcher considers perfection WHIPLASH directed by Damien Chazelle is part psychodrama horror story case study in manipulation naked ambition and teaching techniques do results justify brutal means OR as I have found to be true does it do the opposite discourage students to such a degree that they drop out or break down We first meet Andrew Miles Teller in a movie theater sharing popcorn with a companion who happens to be his father Andrew though socially awkward is a young man who single mindedly knows what he wants from life to be as great a drummer as the legendary American jazz drummer Buddy Rich and in an almost Faustian bargain willingly succumbs to the spell of an abusive teacher who he believes can deliver him his goal Fletcher s modus operandi is one of debasement coupled with an occasional affirmation all in the name of precision and superiority a frighteningly dictatorial approach to the evolution of creativity The exchange between student teacher can be a tender one growth develops out of sensitive and genuine respect for a pupil s intelligence and capacity or one that is fraught with anxiety and sadistic motivational techniques In WHIPLASH the apt title comes from a Hank Levy American jazz composer and saxophonist tune that the school band is rehearsing over and over again blood is psychologically and literally spilled under the master s pummeling the repetitive practice drilling into one s psyche the audience becomes as tense as the pounding sounds emanating from the tautly stretched membranes which are struck with sticks know as beaters Personalities and events are not always anticipated which made the movie compelling Characterizations are slowly revealed through frenzied musical performances audacious hunger for success taking precedence over one s personal life and human contact Between the two lead characters there are shifts in domination like a wire which coils and uncoils pulling their mentor disciple relationship together and apart spawning a tarnished creative union,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3159950/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2015,"It's the drum set, stupid",Premise a tough teacher with heterodox methods who manipulates and mistreats a promising proteg in order to make a triumph of him The former gets away with psychological torture and even physical abuse in a manner that in real life would get him fired and banned from his profession in 15 seconds and yet he succeeds even when trying to undermine the poor kid In another movie this would turn me off completely and make me snore for the whole 107 minutes Instead it is one of the most thrilling flicks I have ever seen It put me firmly in the edge of my seat That s because the art at stake is no McGuffin The jazz drumming is a third more powerful protagonist than either the bully or the victim or their face off despite the undeniably excellent performances JK Simmons is a slam dunk at the Oscar The characters say what they are doing is all about the music about becoming Charlie Parker about being one of the greats But in reality you could not pull off this story with any other jazz instrument certainly not with Parker s saxophone I can t stress it enough Damn the brass the woodwinds the bass In the drums there is something visceral at the same time primitive and sublime that comes through in a away music listeners perhaps never realized The instrument forces the character to bleed to suffer to submit his mind to the beat to the merciless tempo to the task of commanding the band at the same time the player seems to be in the background It demands his transfiguration into a brute who brings delight It is much tougher than the sadistic over the top teacher The movie is about taming an instrument more than Karate Kid is about karate or the first half of Full Metal Jacket is about making soldiers More than any sports movie are about a sport You never cared so much about the activity that supposedly is there only to provide the plot without even noticing it And you don t realize it because the characters never discuss the particularities of the dreaded sticks snares and cymbals Not for one second Maybe that is the brilliancy of Whiplash People talk about the drum set as if it was any other jazz instrument It is not Instead they just show and show and show challenge of the drumming You live it you suffer it and you are enchanted by it There is a reason the first and last shots of the movie both abrupt have Andrew at the stool hitting the cymbals with all his energy and skill In the end you don t know why you loved the movie despite the stock characters weak plot twist and clich d situations that stretch credulity You are swept and wonder what is there that you never seen before The drum set is omnipresent yet and nearly unmentioned It s alive The drum set is the real appeal of Whiplash It IS Whiplash The piece that gives the movie its title and is played over and over has a heterodox challenging time signature Seven beats per measure Maybe this strangeness contributes but I don t know jazz enough to say for sure The direction is above par stylish and discreet at the same time The actors are brilliant But who cares Just hit the notes Andy until you bleed get beaten up by the instrument until your brain turns into mush and ultimately produce pure art,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3160416/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2015,more than the sum of its parts,This movie works so well in that it does what a good film should It provokes thought and discussion I went to watch this with my wife at the cinema and then out for a meal After a decade of marriage and three kids date night sometimes becomes a chat about jobs money and the children After watching this film we were both so intrigued that we chatted about it for an hour and that chat morphed into a chat about existence and triggers and passion in life I don t want to give too much away but there is a conversation near the end that meant we both interpreted the ending in different ways and that is where our conversation began And it didn t stop the more we talked the more we got into different themes raised by the film Now it may read as if I m thanking this movie for giving me something to chat to the wife about that is not really the case What I wanted to say is that this is a wonderful film because our conversation was not what was good and bad in the film it was what did it mean to you Great art should provoke thought and conversation between it s viewers Whiplash does just that It takes a simple story and lays it out in equally simple terms but the narrative runs a lot deeper so does the subsequent deconstruction,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3157640/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2020,Ya. Wow.,Don t know why it took me so long to write a review for this movie I saw it almost 6 years ago and have seen it probably around 20 times I honestly don t understand why it s so good Like it actually boggles my mind Like I think about it almost everyday And the one thing that really pops out to me the most is probably the cinematography and lighting I never thought that the color orange would be such an amazing color in a movie But it really captures the drama and hardship of both these characters And the way they filmed it is just hecking amazing And we can t forget the acting I had always loved Jk Simmons before this movie came out I remember watching him in the Spider Man movies and he would make me just laugh my butt off But in this movie oh my god is it just astounding on how good one person can act And also miles teller gives the best performance of his career and he doesn t get enough credit I think he definitely deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his work And this is coming from an 18 year old yes I did see this movie when I was 12 but even then I knew that they were doing something right I m sure this is a little too late to say but if you haven t seen this movie I don t even know what you re doing with your life honestly,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5544302/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,A Whiplash,The best chemistry between two leading actors within years I have been waiting to see this movie for such a long time and for that reason I am really sorry that I couldn t enlist it in my Top 10 films of last year But now that I have enjoyed it I am pretty sure that it is in my Top 3 maybe just behind Birdman Why Because of the perfect acting lessons displayed in it Best supporting actor of the year no doubt J K Simmons destroys Miles Teller s character and then builds him depending on Teller s inner talent to produce perfect music I am really starting to think that most of all I enjoy the overall feel of a movie and then the actors play These two factors maybe are the two most interesting and inspiring aspects of a movie for me And the music of course Jazz is improvisation polyrhythm and swing which we have a lot in this wonderful piece of movie history I have no doubt that Whiplash Grand Hotel Budapest and Birdman will without a doubt find their dignified places in the history of cinema The intense play is inspired by the beautiful script showing human emotions as we rarely find them in movies This brilliant acting lesson is a true revelation for both leading actors and the director Damien Chazelle It is no wonder that the American critics love it so much It advocates the true statement that no talent can emerge without tons of hard work and practice But the more compelling storyline is the one which shows us how the character of a person can grow when confronted by a real catalyst the mentor the teacher the challenger This is what I really liked in this film the human emotional development within a talented young person And Miles Teller is such a young talented actor too So the symbol is perfect For us Europeans it is really refreshing to see this psychological clash between the two main characters in this movie All the more challenging is the setting the stage seems like a gladiators arena It is by the end of the movie like a true battlefield The hero of the story is challenged by this villain his mentor And he strives so hard beyond the flesh and bone to reach perfection that he surpasses perfection by the end of this beautifully shot film piece And the music in this movie is performed so well that it accompanies the characters journey through this immense psychological arena of war The interaction in some scenes is so intense that it is simmering with uncompromising sharpness We are viewing not only the main character s growth we are seeing our appreciation of hard work grow too And in a country like Bulgaria this kind of a lesson although lifelike obvious should be much appreciated Whiplash professes the things that matter to us and more importantly how we can achieve them It is the uncompromising will of our own souls which can only bring us to success and peacefulness Perfection is not a mirage it is a state of mind a focus so clear that one can achieve only by working hard on his talents Every day every second and every way possible Even beyond the possible,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164662/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2015,Speechless with joy,I could tell just after the first 10 minutes that this film was an extraordinary experience It is both intimidating and inspiring packaged in a intense brew of bloody notes Although it is specifically about a drummer and his teacher it speaks to anyone who has struggled to soar beyond the mediocre and is willing to sacrifice everything to get there Wow And my son thought I was tough as his Suzuki violin coach While I would never go to Fletcher s extreme in shaping a musician I do see his point Too many people go at their craft half heartedly and wilt under the faintest of criticism Even worse they become successful for unexceptional work product that only serves to limit their development The look on the drummer s father s face when he watched his son playing and realized that his son was more than a drummer he was a galaxy,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3156590/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2014,Does not miss a beat - no pun intended,In 2013 writer and director Damien Chazelle attempted to make a small but innovative movie about a musician and his relationship with a mentor Unfortunately the funding was denied so he made a short film to tempt them into funding it instead It was incredibly well received and immediately given full feature funding and that movie is Whiplash Filled out with a deeper story character study and creativity the film follows Andrew Miles Teller a first year student at a musical based college With aspirations of becoming a drummer who will be remembered he is chosen to join the school band by Mr Fletcher JK Simmons a ruthless teacher that pushes students beyond limits to make them realise their potential often to the point of stretching his humanity Like a boxer tapes up their bloodied fist Andrew tapes up his fingers as he practises harder than ever before to gain Fletcher s approval Much like the boxing films we track Andrew on the difficult vigorous journey to become the best It s a basic plot but the reliance on the characters pays off and incredibly shot in just nineteen days it is overall cinema perfection Fletcher portrayed by JK Simmons is close to what Pogue Colonel is in a Full Metal Jacket raw terrifying and bursting with energy Starring in the lead role Miles Teller is outstanding in the enduring journey to be the best under his dreaded teaching It doesn t matter if you are a Jazz fan or not the film is innovative enough to engage you Overall Whiplash does not miss a beat no pun intended,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3109710/?ref_=tt_urv

Film.,This is one of the greatest films of all time Always on beat never off tempo and selling the art it portrays to such a unique level The performances are great Miles Teller stands out a bit but ultimately is overshadowed by the incredible J K Simmons This goes down as one of the greatest supporting acts in history You d be scared of Terrance Fletcher from the moment you saw him and there s never a beat when you re not The story is unpredictable with a masterfully crafted ending Damien Chazelle might be a genius The writing embraces Jazz and becomes a part of it The direction is one of the best directions I have ever seen From the very first sequence we re pulled in and never pushed out We re in for a ride that ll make us gasp cry and cheer The music is an essential component of this film and it shines quite well As a jazz trumpeter in high school this music brings me back and lets me feel alive again Thank you Justin Hurwitz Whiplash is a unique experience everyone should see 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4283549/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2015,This IS my tempo!,Totally engrossing from frame one Whiplash grabs you by the throat and doesn t let go until the very end And we are talking about a movie focused on playing the drums No murder plots explosions sex scenes etc simply a tight well told story Fast cuts help move the plot along and it never drags Surprises and twists make this a phenomenal movie that forces you to go back and analyze everything that happened The music is great I think that is really important because the sound becomes a character that helps tell the story The greatest part is this movie is not a niche movie it s not limited to band geeks I d say it is identifiable to anyone who has worked in any way to be the best at something Whiplash tells the story of a man who wants to be the best and shows the cost and torture he will endure to seek that goal The language is vulgar but even this serves a purpose is our teacher abusive or tough with good intentions,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3284362/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2023,"Blood, Sweat and Tears: the Dark Side of Perfection and Abusive Student-Teacher Relationships",Whiplash is a phenomenal movie that s beautifully filmed with precision and style A masterfully written story so tightly done that the movie goes by in the blink of an eye With outstanding and unforgettable performances by J K Simmons and Miles Teller this movie is a must watch This is without a doubt one of the best movies about musical passion ambition perfection and what it takes to become the best and reach your full potential It s also a movie about the human condition and how flawed we can be as a species but also how amazing our potential is when we set our minds to something we truly and utterly believe in An inspiring movie that s equal parts intense funny exciting and captivating Whiplash is a modern day masterpiece There is nothing wrong with it and it is perfection A very gripping character study that mainly focuses on two people that are flawed each in their own way One of course being more flawed than the other Fletcher being way more f ed up than Andrew Fletcher feeds his ego and his void by controlling and psychologically abusing tormenting and manipulating his students He s basically a power hungry psychopathic narcissistic monster Andrew on the other hand opens himself up to the abuse that Fletcher inflicts on him and he lets it happen because he values success ambition and perfection above anything else something that both Fletcher and Andrew strive for It s because of this shared strive for perfection that Andrew is willing to put everything on the line even if it affects his mental physical health his social life or even causes near death experiences He strives to be the best while also seeking Fletcher s approval Andrew s upbringing caused him to be flawed as well We see it during the family dinner scene where it s evident that he was raised in an environment of toxic competitive people This movie takes a somewhat exaggerated and cynical look at the dark side of teacher student relationships Fletcher was the sensei from hell but it was also what Andrew needed in order to become great If Fletcher hadn t pushed Andrew to the lengths he did he probably would ve never reached his full potential Each hardship that Andrew faced was a new lesson learned a lesson that could be used and adapted not only in music but also in the real world But the way in which these lessons were taught by Fletcher pushed Andrew into an unhealthy psychological and physical state Andrew would then take out all his anger self hatred frustration and doubts on the drum set We would see this when he practiced at home and played until his hands and fingers were all ripped open and bleeding It s a pretty dark look at abusive relationships and the dark side of the strive for perfection It s also a very illuminating and insightful look at the human psyche and what we might be capable of,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9422923/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2021,Can't stop thinking about this wonderful film,Am writing this to try and stop thinking about this fantastic film It won t leave my head after watching it yesterday from my sofa Put it on as something to pass the time while I was doing the ironing then had difficulty getting to sleep last night I was so caught up in it The performances are wonderful I find it hard to believe that the lead Miles Teller is an actor or that he has done other films he inhabited the lead character to such a degree One point other reviews I ve read have not focused on is the portrayal of the relationship between the protagonist and his father Paul Reiser There are just a very few scenes eating popcorn mostly but that and what we learn of their family made the whole film so much more dramatic for me The final hug was very powerful So characters great Acting great The plot also sizzles with some great twists After they begin to come I had no idea where it was going or where I wanted it to go I had to stop the film at the climax it was just too tense and then came back to it the following evening And it almost made me like jazz music 10 out of 10 out of 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6612551/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2017,"A real emotional ride, superbly done.",One of the most surprisingly simple yet incredibly intense movies I can recall with incredible acting incredible cinematography no wasted visual moment just cut right to where you are meant to be for the next development and snappy non typical focus It leaves the viewer with deep questions especially for driven people such as artists if not everyone It very much catches you up from the first scene and carries you through to an ending which is emotionally satisfying yet philosophically questionable All of this is in addition to some absolutely unbelievable drumming To me a perfect little powerhouse of a movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3789940/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2020,Intense and realistic,As someone that wanted to persue art as a career and worked beyond my limits for long years this movie is really close to my heart In my own life I had a teacher who was similar in many ways to Fletcher but of course not as abusive and I know from first hand experience what it is being in the limit and keep going what it is to cry compulsively and keep going what it is to try desperately to please someone who is treating you incredibly bad I have to say that that teacher made me improve exponentially and made me realize that my limit was much further than what I had previously thought Of course my experience wasn t as abusive as Andrew s but he represents perfectly the strength of someone who will do whatever it takes to pursue their dream An incredibly well crafted story,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5785359/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2021,Incredible! One of my favorite movies of all time,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6945836/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2018,Immense film to a point of being troubling,What a film I found myself drawn into this film with the intensity and power from the main 2 actors its quite a stripped back film with no gloss which beautifully captures the brutal torment of Tellers character I took far too long to see this film with the mistaken view of it being quite simple simple in set up yes simple in intensity and emotion defiantly not i m not quite sure how Miles Teller didn t get at least nominated for an Oscar for this but i m guessing he will be in the running again soon,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4344367/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2023,A suspenseful movie,An amazing and intense film that attracts with its plot that focuses on Neyman who is a young ambitious drummer who is capable of anything to achieve perfection In the film we see the famous jazz instructor Fletcher who is strict and merciless pushes his students to their limits by humiliating them The key to the film is the music which combined with emotional scenes and effects is able to create an immersive experience In short the film is brilliant and keeps you in suspense from the beginning to the very end and goes straight to the heart I recommend you watch it and see for yourself,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8906630/?ref_=tt_urv

And they ain't buddies...,There are only 2 type of people who will enjoy WHIPLASH Real Drummers and folk close to them and masochists How does a musician any musician actually become the best that he can be Practice right Obvious stuff Well that s kind of the theme of this movie J K Simmons is a perfectionists band teacher dedicated to getting the best he can out of his college age jazz students He is a DI in the real sense of the term totally reminded me of Drill Instructor I suffered under in the Marine Corps His chosen student Miles Teller will become the greatest jazz drummer ever or die trying And that is JK s mission and the story Add lots of foul language and physical abuse and way too much solo drumming and you ve got this movie Not fun too watch not fun too listen too Not much of an Academy Award worthy movie really And the ending is not believable either,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3191379/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2018,A must see with strong character performances,I went in this movie thinking it would be a feel good movie about a young drummer getting to make a career This movie does tell that story but there is not much to feel good about after the credits roll The movie is about Andrew Neimann Miles Teller a promising student on the drums at Shaffer Conservatory of Music who wants to be as good as legendary drummer Buddy Rich Andrew is currently drumming in one of the school bands but he wants to get a place in the schools studio band that is conducted by the most respected professor of the school Terence Fletcher J K Simmons One day Fletcher suddenly storms in the room where Andrew is practicing with the band and after listening to and insulting each student briefly he invites Andrew to come to his class Andrew starts as an assistant drummer and quickly learns that Fletcher transforms into a drill sergeant from hell when conducting and the whole band is trembling in fear when he accuses one of the players being out of tune However when the band takes a break Fletcher does strike up a friendly conversation with Andrew talking about his family and gives him a chance to be core drummer Andrew is made temporary core drummer after the break but when he struggles to keep up the tempo of the song Whiplash Flitcher hurls a chair at him slaps him in the face and throws the details of his personal life back in his face as insults Despite this abuse Andrew still wants to be the best drummer of all time but will the ridiculous high standards and physical abuse of Fletcher be to much for him to handle This movie was exceptional since it tells a story we all have seen before promising student climbing to the top but without the typical feel good element usually found in these movies Fletcher is an absolutely dis likable figure who believes his harsh way of teaching is justified because it s the only way to find the next great jazz musician That he destroys many good students careers or even lives in the process does not concern him at all he cares only about meeting his ridiculous high standards I felt sorry for Andrew in the beginning he tries really hard but Fletcher keeps pushing him further and further that I was hoping he would simply find another teacher But he keeps destroying his own life sacrificing everything to meet Fletchers demands and turn into a huge jerk who is so full of himself that he alienates everybody around him including his other band members and his family The greatest thing about this movie is the exceptional great acting from J K Simons and Miles Teller Simons plays an angry Fletcher so well that i felt uneasy myself when he is getting mad at Andrew because he plays out of tempo Teller also plays a great role starting as a likable student and turning into a jerk with delusions of grandeur And while I don t listen to Jazz the music used in the music was really great The only problem of the movie was that after the first act there were no likable characters This made it both interesting and hard to watch and kept me hoping for a happy end It s hard to talk about the ending without spoiling but I will say that it can be viewed both as happy and not so happy if that does make any sense Definitely a must see if you like movies with strong character performances and stories about people developing from student to greatness,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4471235/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2015,"Magnetic, radical and profound.",This is not a film about music It is a film about pure ambition hard work perseverance and raw determination It is magnetic radical and profound And thousands of people are delirious about it I don t blame them Let s start from scratch This is the story of Andrew a 19 year old ambitious drummer attending one of the most prestigious music schools in the country He is talented and smart and he knows it But Andrew has no idea how to socialize He spends his free time practicing with his drums or watching films with his dad His only worry is to become the greatest of the greatest Fletcher is the most infamous teacher of the school tough and constantly angry he coordinates a band where only the best enter Everyone is scared to death for him he pushes students physically and mentally to the edge he is fearless but most of all he is necessary for anyone who dreams a career in music He is the connection the one who can make it happen Andrew knows about Fletcher and knows that endless possibilities unfold when it comes to his band He would do anything in order to enter And he does But the pressure is too much Fletcher follows humiliating practices towards anyone who either disobeys him or makes one mistake during practice His methods can be described as at least barbaric But somehow this works Especially with the band They keep on participating in big contests and working as hard as ever Maybe it is the fear of the students that keeps them going without complaining or probably the fact that he pushes a person till he gets the best out of him Either way they are aware of his power on them One word and their possible career is over They only obey And the worst He knows it more than anyone And he abuses this power Andrew creates a unique relationship with Fletcher He is submissive to his remarks and abuse but soon he will start resisting He will stop obeying Till the guy finally notices him Till Fletcher finally recognizes his worth This seemingly endless kind of game has its ups and downs When you think it is going good between them something happens and f s up your brain and everything turns to the raw fragility of the beginning Whiplash opens a constant and very intense conversation about surpassing any kind of obstacles or difficulties but mostly yourself and your limits in order to accomplish your goals It is full with competitive attitude the one necessary for achieving It is testing your limits like Fletcher is testing his students Even though it is Damien Chazelle s debut he has already shown a craft and ambition that I personally salute The rigorous rhythm of the film focuses on Andrew and Fletcher s relationship cutting out all the others revealing through tight close ups extraordinary performances by both of his leading actors J K Simmons has just won the Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his supreme performance and along with Miles Teller they are marching towards this year s Oscars Andrew and Fletcher s relationship is purely poisonous and stimulating at the same time Andrew is craving for Fletcher s recognition he wants to be the next great jazz drummer and this is his greatest motivation he desperately needs Fletcher s acceptance Fletcher sees Andrew s potential and helps him but with his perverted methods he only play games with him aiming exclusively to push him harder to the very edge to his own best Through constant drumming a tempo fury and unexpected events rising up to a pure catharsis Whiplash does make the difference It winks violently at you proving how a big dream is never big enough and no matter the mistakes and disappointments the delays and drawbacks if you share this flaming perseverance and determination anything ANYTHING is possible Thank you Damien Chazelle for reminding us that http mycinematographies blogspot nl 2015 01 whiplash 2014 html,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3160936/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2015,Mesmerising journey of a young drummer.,Drumming Really Who knew it could be so exciting This is a superb film with standout performances at every stage and the script fizzes off the screen continually self referencing and catching the arcs as you spot them and they come to fruition this is a masterclass in how to pen a screenplay The whole film is shot lo fi and there is an intimate and almost voyeuristic nature to the filmmaking which I really liked You practically want to punch the air at many times during the film and sometimes punch J K Simmons who is AMAZING I found myself tapping along to the music and at one point along with the rest of the cinema nearly jumped out of my seat and the whole experience felt like a roller coaster ride from start to finish Great film cannot recommend it enough,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3160433/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2015,Brilliant for lovers of drama.,Absolutely amazing film Expect no pandering to the audience with run of the mill scenes of joyfulness and positive reinforcement which is so common in the modern film Instead expect real grit and emotive acting in this dramatic real and slightly psychotic film Very good performances by the two main actors portraying the student and teacher respectively by Miles Teller and J K Simmons Even though this film is about playing an instrument essentially you will be both eyes glued to the screen in anticipation of what happens next as it could be a great thing or a negative thing acknowledging that not everything in real life is sunshine and lollipops if you re not willing to work at it But there is also the opposite end of the spectrum,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3222858/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2015,Whiplash Review,Damien Chazelle s Whiplash is an electrifying film about the lengths someone is willing to be pushed in order to achieve greatness Miles Teller as Andrew Neyman and J K Simmons as Terrence Fletcher drum up their best performances to date as well as a pair of the best performances of 2014 Teller as Neyman is phenomenal and the butting of heads between the leads is what drives many scenes of this film All of the Oscar buzz behind Simmons performance is valid Terrence Fletcher is the ruthless music teacher at Schafer college whom Andrew Neyman strives so hard to impress J K Simmons gives such a vulgar astounding and unrelenting acting job as Fletcher that even I felt infuriated by what he was saying while watching this film The emotional and physical pain Neyman goes through to try and impress Fletcher is absolutely unbelievable but the acting by Miles Teller who has come a long way from 21 Over allows the pain to be understood Damien Chazelle s directing is also very smooth and the score is perfect for a movie about Jazz music Whiplash is a fantastic film with magnificent acting wonderful music and a final fifteen minutes that will entice and amaze any viewer able to appreciate how far Andrew Neyman has come,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207357/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2018,A Powerfully Memorable Film,It s hard for me to stop thinking about Whiplash a stunning independent film ostensibly about a young drummer but really about unyielding ambition and passion Miles Teller plays a music student pushed to his limits by a sadistic coach played by J K Simmons It s a film in which Teller and Simmons support each other with shared intensity and tension That tension becomes the uncredited leading character which in turn grips the audience through every minute This tiny film builds and builds then slides back and blows up with a final frenzied conflict in which both characters connect in shared achievement Whiplash was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture and J K Simmons scored a a win for Best Supporting Actor although his heel character was probably the easier one to bring to life Teller shines too just a bit more quietly yet the film would have failed with any other actors in the lead roles Ya gotta see this one,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4449616/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2020,Entertaining but NOT the way to learn Jazz...,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6407433/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2015,"A freshman at one of the top music schools in the country is pushed further and further towards perfection, but at what costs?",Everyone has had them at some point in their academic life that cutthroat soul smothering devastatingly proactive teacher that spat sweat and obscenities in a do or die mission to create perfection They are that one teacher who if embraced became singularly admired for their dedication and drive to back you into a corner until you pushed back Possibly not as impetuous as Fletcher JK Simmons our rash but headstrong professor at Shaffer Conservatory yet an influence that takes the path less traveled It is this demonstrative ideology that our film takes hurling verbal cymbals at our head in what surmounts to a throat clenching wake up call to our senses From the opening act we place our motivational fortitude and drive to succeed on the table in the end coming back to something beautifully and honestly changed Andrew Miles Teller is a first year student at Shaffer Conservatory in New York City one of the most prestigious schools for music in the country We re introduced to him visually afar yet audibly intimate his actions unfocused with a sound that s precise After being heard and invited by Fletcher Shaffer s top jazz professor to sit in as alternative for core drummer in studio band Andrew soon realizes the methods to Fletcher s teachings He is belittled slapped and deconstructed in front of everyone on his first day reducing him to tears He then clears his room moving his drum set into his studio space in order to better himself playing as fast as he can until a defensive wall is constructed around him Eventually earning his position as core drummer battling it out for hours against his peers Andrew begins bleeding Fletcher s fervor in a pursuit of perfection Infusing his character with a determination and na ve sense of guidance Miles Teller ignites the screen with the crack of a snare drum When we first hear Andrew speak it s through his music as he rolls and flams until he is recognized a recognition that s responded to with uncertainty Andrew doesn t so much voice his thoughts when he isn t playing but emotes them through his gaze Miles manages to capture the brittle mannerisms and the anxious looks of a young talent with total conviction often saying more with a downward glance than anything verbal can capture When he meets Fletcher and begins to adopt characteristics that come off foreign for him Miles assumes a mirror image of his impressively tyrannical teachings his blood spewing both literally and symbolically Taking turns playing off each other is an undeniably fire starting performance by JK Simmons as Fletcher who tempos his vehemence and disparaging remarks like a whip with Andrew his star whipping boy Dressed in a tight black shirt his arms acting more like weapons than batons Simmons pushes our film forward with intensity and gas soaked propensity for evocation As Andrew reacts to a cymbal hurtling towards him we react in the same manner our expressions of disbelief continually poked until a fire is raging within us Fletcher and Andrew respond back and forth between each other one using words while the other uses notes all the while both are secretly being stripped of what they love Written and directed by Damien Chazelle Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench Whiplash plays out like a musical gladiatorial match thunderous and composed our freshman focus entering the arena in hopes of obtaining his freedom in the form of recognition Having written The Last Exorcism Part II Chazelle constructs his characters out of the character moldings of a horror film filling Fletcher with an unpredictable rage and an obscure background that generates metronome like terror Andrew never flees from his captor instead battling his opponents with a tenacity and ferocity that eventually places him in the path of his deadliest adversary There s a scene in which Andrew must prove his capability and worth drumming toe to toe against two other potential core drummers It s a scene that champions Chazelle s abilities behind the camera and one that creates a slow burn for Editor Tom Cross We re fixated on Andrew as he splits wounds in an even display of speed and impeding success our visual tempo increasing as the scene unfolds It s a phenomenal display of jump cuts that only gives us a taste of what s to come Andrew s drum guiding the camera with precise intensity We erupt with a snare buzz across the screen in a climactic confrontation that leaves us on the edge of our seat with our eyes and ears synched in stupendous harmony In the end Whiplash leaves a completely welcoming mark across our necks as visual craft merges with auditory storytelling in what surmounts to an undeniable achievement for Chazelle and Cross Placing ourselves in front of the screen we are pointedly told to observe the aspirations and barrages both mental and physical of our young talent culminating in one of the most rewarding experiences this genre has ever seen As the final act closes and we are left with just our ears as guidance it becomes immediately evident that Damien Chazelle s sophomoric effort juxtaposes that of Andrew s virtuosity placing itself as a cinematic rarity,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3382584/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2016,"Up-and-coming jazz drummer aspires to be ""one of the greats"" and the only way he can get there is through a brilliant but harsh instructor",Whiplash While definitely being a movie that hid in the shadows for quite a while Whiplash is an excellent film that grabs hold of your attention and doesn t let go until you ve left the theater thirsty for more JK Simmons performance is incredible as he portrays a bully that is too brilliant for his own well being while Miles Teller portrays an up and coming jazz drummer that doesn t see his own potential until his anger forces it out Both are great actors that do this film justice and give the audience an exhilarating roller coaster ride of emotions There are few movies that inspire me to follow in the characters footsteps but surprisingly after this film I had wished that I could play in such a way as Miles Teller performed Nevertheless this movie is a must see whether you have an interest in music or not 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3418711/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2015,INTENSE - you got that right.,Hooked that is what I became front start to finish I originally thought it would be something good with drums and some maybe tongue in cheek comedy because I like Mister Riser in anything he does that I have seen HOWEVER this was one thundering surprise for me The pursuit of perfection is one hell of a hard road to travel and this movie shows it from a few angles The lead characters do a truly splendorous job whatever they were paid they earned every penny and most likely more If you want to hear music and good music this is a good movie If you want to see some excellent acting this is a very good movie Start out with a goal in mind figure out what ways are available to you to get there then getting there is the truly hard work But if you are committed you will make it if you have what it takes Who should have an idea of what it takes why someone who has the qualifications Except for one thing of my personal taste which you will know after watching this movie I say to one and all WATCH IT it is fantastic,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3265983/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2015,An enthralling and vicious drama,An exhilarating drama about an aspiring young jazz drummer who is pushed up to and over the edge by a sadistic college professor in order to reach his potential What at first appears to be a standard story of a talented but difficult pupil being taken under the wing of an uncompromising and unconventional mentor soon moves into darker territory J K Simmons is brutal as Fletcher the band leader who terrorises his students to breaking point in order to achieve perfection The physical and verbal abuse he dishes out is shocking and it s hard not to feel anxious for the the young musicians as they perform under unbearable pressure Miles Teller plays the talented student Andrew Neiman who initially comes across as an awkward and endearing loner but soon displays his own antisocial behaviours Although some of the treatment he receives is hard to watch at times the fact he is not a wholly sympathetic character makes it difficult to completely empathise with him and condemn Fletcher The performances of the two main actors are excellent and as the film progresses a psychological battle develops as Fletcher s intense ambition to discover genius by essentially shattering and manipulating his students resolve clashes with Andrew s determination to prove his talent at all costs This comes to a crescendo in the thrilling finale as the two main characters make their final moves in a theatre packed with powerful music industry figures to discover if Andrew really does have what it takes to become a jazz great,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3345895/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2020,Inspirational,The synopsis of Whiplash never really peaked my interest enough to commit to watching the film However it s impressive ranking in the IMDB top 250 eventually forced me to bite the bullet and give it a chance last night I am so glad that I did In essence the story is about a student striving to become the best and a ruthless teacher pushing him physically and emotionally every step of the way It does not matter if you have no interest in jazz or music at all for that matter the themes are applicable to sports singing dancing any competitive walk of life that requires the utmost dedication to get to the top Anyone serious about doing so should watch Whiplash and use it as a source of inspiration Miles Teller and J K Simmons are incredible and the success of the film cruxes on their performances Teller was most surprising as an actor I d only previously seen in the occasional rom com in this role as the ambitiously determined student willing to put blood sweat and tears into becoming the best However it is Simmons who swept all the awards including an Oscar for best supporting actor playing the role of Teller s vicious bullying mentor and cramming every scene with tension and fear He is an enigma and a rollercoaster just when we think we understand his complex character he turns aggressive again and humiliates Andrew Teller once more As dark as this sounds until literally 5 minutes from the end of this film I had no idea if our protagonist was going to triumph and finally win the respect of his mentor or end up killing himself The stakes are really that high and overall it makes for 100 minutes of incredible drama that you can t take your eyes off I d recommend Whiplash to anyone 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5798400/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2018,Bravissimo,OMG what a phenomenal movie The pace was excellent the writing was superb and the performances simply outstanding I needed this movie Movies like this reminds me why I watch movies The way the main characters play off one of another from the very beginning is something to look out for this is very seldom done and doesn t always work well However it works here and I loved the fact that the character development was not too much but just enough for us to have fallen in and out of love with both the antagonist and the protagonist 8 stars,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4501774/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2021,How on earth?,How on earth does this get such high ratings It s horrible Slow and boring Drumming and screaming That s all it is What a waste of time Only gave it 2 stars because the drumming was pretty good,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7686372/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,But Is It Worth It?,On the surface this film is pretty grim tense situations major characters who are presented as maniacal self involved jerks certainly NOT a romantic comedy Although Fletcher is presented as an oppressive tyrant we see in a couple of scenes that off the job he can be kind and human Is the tyrant just a role he plays to achieve an objective On the other hand Andrew does not show many signs of humanity but is still likable since he is the victim of Fletcher s fury I think the writer director is trying to make a point or a few points The film has so many underlying themes I am not sure what point s the writer director was trying to make Certainly one point is that to be great or at the top in any endeavor or profession dedication and sacrifice are required I think many people will be willing to stop there But lurking in the shadows is the big question is it worth it When you consider the sacrifices made by both major characters in pursuit of their goals for most rational people the answer would be NO There was a similar theme in the film La La Land which was by the same writer director Damien Chazelle And both films featured some really good jazz Although I knew who Buddy Rich was before I saw this film I wonder how many other viewers did Something to think about,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6674906/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2020,Wonderful movie,The director s control of music can be said to have reached its peak referring to the director s screenwriter Grand Piano the year before last although that plot is extremely bad the piano performance is the same as the film The high speed editing caught up with David Finch in an all round way and the nearly abnormal struggle between teachers and students brought the audience a thriller like suffocating pleasure when the main character was driven to a dead end several times,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5810563/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2015,Simply one of the most engrossing films I have EVER seen!,The reason this film is SO engrossing is the tension that begins in the opening and just when it is easing you think it hits you again Simmons is the evilest meanest son of a bitch band instructor in a top music college Young Teller is a drummer and the movie is basically their story It is so difficult to review without spoiling this fine script I can only say you DON T have to be a big band jazz fan to be mesmerized by the casting acting cinematography editing sound etc It SHOULD have won BEST FILM at the Academy Awards in every category including Best Film I am not a RAVER ever but this I will watch again tomorrow Again from the very edge of my chair And what PROOF that you don t need to spend a half billion to make an amazing film This film was budgeted at just over THREE million dollars Simply a MUST SEE,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3193724/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2015,One of the most powerful and intense movies ever made.,There are very few movies that can generate such a mixture of emotions whilst you re watching it Whiplash is one of these exceptions It s an edge of your seat thriller drama with one of the most unique relationships ever portrayed on film The story that focuses on a young drummer Miles Tellar trying to impress his brutal and abusive teacher J K Simmons is perhaps one of the best examples of a student teacher relationship The performances by Miles Tellar and J K Simmons are nothing short of amazing Tellar s performance is great as his character grows a huge amount in the film Whilst drumming is a prime target for him it becomes his obsession and he s determined to do anything he must to prove himself Simmons delivers probably the best on screen performance I ve seen in a long time I mainly remember Simmons for comedic work such as Spiderman and Juno as well as his voice work in Portal 2 However here you both love and hate the man He s very reminiscent of R Lee Ermey s drill instructor from Full Metal Jacket however 10 times better Every scene he s in you re biting your nails as he is an incredibly unpredictable character and he deserves every bit of praise that he s getting The movie also has one of the most exciting and thrilling finales I ve seen in a long time I can t say much more about this film then to go out and see it It s definitely my favorite film of 2014 and possibly one of my favorite films ever It s intense screenplay amazing performances from its two leads and the music score all help to make this one of the greatest movies I ve ever watched,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3170609/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2015,Oscar Worthy Indeed,An extraordinary movie that is one of a kind It is one of the few movies where you feel like the antagonist feel his pain ambition and drive for striving in excellence You actually feel that you are picking up the drumsticks and playing You heart starts to beat faster as the bass beat of the drum increases I actually did not know either of the actors I learned that J K Simmons was the guy from Spiderman But now I am sure that both of them have left their mark in film history and have raised the bar for motivational films all over the world The movie is intense I can say that even the Saw franchise s brutality can not reproduce this kind of a scar in our minds like Whiplash did And I love the name of the movie too Whiplash It kinda relates to something in the movie but if you watch the movie closely you can find out the brilliance in its story and its connection with the name The movie has no flaws at all You can watch this movie no matter what mood your in or what age you are or what gender you are or anything God I so wanna play drums now,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158313/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2016,A c-milking masterpiece,As a drummer I wasn t sure what to expect going into this film I knew the general idea of the story and of its reputation but it s hard to be prepared for the actual level of intensity and visceral emotion put into the performance This is the kind of movie that deserves a close watch and attention to detail it s by no means light watching or something to turn on in the background This is completely uncompromising and gripping drama that may also hold additional interest for drummers jazz aficionados or anyone who works at a craft that requires copious amounts of practice The basic synopsis for this story is that Andrew is an aspiring jazz drummer at a music conservatory who will stop at nothing to achieve greatness and his teacher Fletcher is a jazz band director who will stop at nothing to unlock greatness One might think that this combination of goals should allow for a fruitful and cooperative partnership but the way that the two go about pushing themselves to find this greatness is as destructive socially as it is constructive musically This space isn t meant to give deep film analysis so suffice it to say that this is one of several interesting ironies found within this story Without getting into any finer plot points or spoilers the meat of this film lies in watching Andrew fall into complete social isolation and obsessive unhealthy practice habits to improve while Fletcher pushes him in some less than conventional and often illegal methods that would make R Lee Ermey or Louis Gossett Jr blush The contrasting notions of respect conflict and hatred between the characters are extremely compelling throughout Your mileage may vary but this movie was a solid 10 10 for me As long as you aren t overly sensitive or have a short attention span I think the film brings a lot to the table First of all the acting is absolutely superb JK Simmons is always good but he s never been better than in this film He plays Fletcher to the point where he draws so much contempt from the audience that it can be easy to forget he is just playing a role at times and yet there is this slightest twinkle of humanity that he manages to hold onto and instill somewhere deep within the character that leads you to wonder whether or not there is any actual goodness present and the nature of his true motives The sights and sounds of the movie are top notch The cinematography is a very strong point for the film While the film sets aren t particularly interesting and don t need to be for this film the frenetic action drumming shots from various perspectives really feed the emotion and intensity of this film The audience can feel Andrew s pain and his triumph as he physically and mentally pushes himself through these performances There are a lot of great perspective shots off of the cymbals and drum heads Andrew Miles Teller is a drummer in real life and did perform these parts to a certain extent but a ton of expert editing went into this movie to make the performances look 100 accurate and legitimate to actual musician viewers Aurally there s a good selection of well mixed jazz numbers in this movie that really bring it to life This movie is not for everyone some people will always only feel comfortable with lighter fare and a more conventional plot sequence However in my eyes this does not detract from the rating Art doesn t need to make compromises Greatness doesn t need to make compromises This is a main theme of the film Realize this this film s very existence and earned success in modern mainstream cinema is almost an exact mirror of the struggle that Andrew and Fletcher face in their quest to create something legendary and lasting Uncompromising and goal oriented unwilling to bend or show any leniency for social awareness and yet the movie was able to garner an 8 IMDb rating and 90 on other critic aggregate sites There is no doubt in my mind if this film reined it in a bit and adopted a more conventional and digestible story it would have not received the same amount of critical or audience acclaim The film is absolutely relentless from start to finish in the best way,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3416681/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2015,"plot-less, and what's there is just dumb",the plot less plot Spoilers I guess A psychotic music instructor screams at his student calling him a FAGGOT throwing things at him to play faster and faster not better mind you eventually makes the kid so nervous he gets in an accident then the kid plays a corny mid tempo jazz number the end There ya go That s the film Unreal that this is getting such attention even nominated for an Academy Award Just goes to show how visceral elements such as cinematography and over the top acting can trick people into thinking something more is going on than actually is Final Note Practice makes the master having an escaped lunatic screaming in your ear while practicing drums will only prolong your attempt to get into the zone,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3179095/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,Better than Lalaland,I think this is this writer s best movie tbh The music in Lalaland is more enjoyable but the this movie is just so much better The shots are beautifully intimate and the color use is particularly impressive Idk the whole movie was eye candy and I just love watching a movie that s makers have such a grasp on emotion and storytelling I m also a musician who developed most of my skill in a fortunately less harsh but definitely very similar environment so this movie was really relatable to me It is truly a remarkable movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6682038/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,It's just an amazing movie.,And let me start by saying Whiplash is one of the best movies I ve ever seen Everything is so damn perfect I almost wanted a sequel But that would ruined this movie so I think I m good This is everything what a movie should be I ve only seen two drum movies This one and The Rocker This is with no doubt the best This is so amazing fantastic perfect and extremely brilliant Whiplash is a masterpiece from start to finish Whiplash makes you want to hop on a drum set and just play out loud I ve actually played drums in 8 years and has the opportunity to do that It motivates and inspires drummers around the world and makes them want to be better at drumming even if they don t like to practice This is one of the most rewatchable movies of all time and surprisingly enough I have only seen the movie twice It s soon time to rewatch this masterpiece I m sorry for using the same words to describe this movie but there is only a few words to explain it and every one of them is positive Now let s talk about the acting Wow The acting No wonder why J K Simmons got an Oscar for this It s not many people in this movie and few of them I actually knows who are You ve got J Jonah Jameson in one of the best supporting roles I have ever seen and he s not very supporting in the movie Then you have Reed Richards aka Mr Fantastic 2015 in the amazing lead role Much better than Fantastic Four And then you have Supergirl in some scenes but she s not important She s in the shadow of great talents like Miles Teller and J K Simmons This is probably the best movie of 2014 with close follow ups by The Grand Budapest Hotel and Birdman And everyone was cheering in the finale cause that s one of the best finales I ve seen too especially the editing I really recommend checking this out And if you don t like this movie I will literally come to your house and kill you in your sleep Nah I m just kidding Or am I Anyway check this movie out,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6660824/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2021,One of the smartest movies I've ever seen,This movie absolutely left me in shock my favorite part of this movie is the mind game between fletcher and Andrew them constantly sabotaging one another trying to make the other look bad how they both are out to get one another when there both in the same room absolutely fantastic and frankly is a once in a life time experience when it comes to witnessing a movie as smart as this next is the acting probably the most widely praised part of the film but it can t be understated how brilliant everyone in this film is ik Simmons and miles frankly give two of the best performances I ve ever seen next I wanna talk about the characters another incredibly strong element of this film I ve talked about the mind games but this film goes deeper then that it explores fletchers obsession with absolutely nothing but perfection and how that mindset starts to be a big part of Andrews personality due to being around flitch Andrew starts the film as this pretty nice and normal teenager and ends up a egotistical near physcopath who s willing to do anything for success next the music don t got much to say other then it s absolutely amazing and one final point near the end of the film I was very curious worried how they would handle the climax and omg it was the most spine chilling climax I ve ever seen please for your own sake watch this movie especially if your a music lover like me,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6649400/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2015,Holy ****.,This film blew me away as soon as it would start to slow down it d slam me back up against the wall and my eyes would be glued to the screen This is pure cinema This is art It s essentially flawless The script and direction are so incredibly well done it made my head spin Every scene has raw power behind it Right from the start there is this immediate sense of tension You re legs won t stop bouncing and you re not entirely sure why This is a testament to the immaculate talent on display in front and behind the camera Miles Teller and JK Simmons absolutely destroy their competition They dedicated themselves to every scene every line of incredibly written dialogue and the pay off is spectacular If I were to criticize one thing just for the sake of nitpicking I would say the overall story is slightly shallow you basically know how the movie will end what matters is the journey The film is far from predictable and keeps you at the edge of your seat quite literally but some may be underwhelmed by the ending Oh and the editing was fantastic some of the best this year right up there with Birdman and the Raid 2,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3182003/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2014,Raw and Invigorating; Highly Recommended,Whiplash is centered around a drummer named Andrew Teller a first year music student enrolled at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory who is one night whilst practicing his drumming skills approached by the immensely respected jazz conductor Terence Fletcher Simmons who later offers him a place in his jazz band the most respected band in all of the college Andrew and Fletcher s personalities collide as Fletcher reveals a volatile and destructive nature upon Andrew s first rehearsal with the band From here on out Andrew attempts to earn the respect and admiration of a man who seeks only to push and demand perfection from his highly talented students Released earlier this year at Sundance to universal praise from critics and audiences alike Whiplash is one of the most adrenaline filled films of the year despite not actually being an action or sport film Infused with an electric quantity of energy primarily due to the inventive fast paced and astounding cinematography and editing Whiplash dazzles punishes challenges and ultimately rivets the audience member to their core This is first class entertainment a film which captures the ferocity and vehemence of an action film of the likes of Edge of Tomorrow whilst combining it with the exploitative tendencies and emotional range of a film like Gone Girl Strange comparisons but accurate nevertheless What makes Whiplash tick though is its unflinching documentation of a man who is so driven to achieve that he resents communication and socialization with those outside his chosen craft Even as Andrew attempts to connect and discuss with those outside his life of drumming including his father and a romantic interest in a girl named Nicole the film always makes these portions of his life insignificant and unimportant in contrast Andrew unknowing of how to properly interact with people due to his lack of social skills seems to be acting himself as he tries to fumble his way through a break up and through seemingly insignificant conversations His lack of interest in anything outside of his profession is showcased most prominently towards the end where many of the characters receive little to no resolution whatsoever apart from Andrew and Fletcher the people instrumental in developing and challenging his drumming capabilities Everyone and everything else simply fades into the background as to Andrew they re unimportant The film is intensely personal and often riveting in the way it handles the primary protagonist as the cinematography often reverts to close ups and still shots focusing solely on his speed and his efforts As Andrew drums his way to bloody fingers and immense sweating sessions the camera seems to block everyone else out of the shot focusing solely on his exertions alone The entire atmosphere of the film helps us to focus on our main protagonist allowing us to get more in tune with Andrew his emotions and his drive This is partially due to the efforts of the lighting technician for the film Jack M Guberman who provides an eerie colour palette for the frame all the drumming rehearsal and concert scenes are shot with an orange filter reflecting a jazz vibe Whilst it s at first comforting the intensity of the lighting continues to build and build as Andrew becomes even more concerned with success and perfection by the final concert of the film the camera seems to visibly remark upon the intensity and power of the lighting taking notice of it at every opportunity Miles Teller and JK Simmons bring the characters of Andrew and Fletcher to life and both are equally as commanding and compelling in their respective roles Teller is fantastic as Andrew whilst Simmons is merciless and cold as Fletcher For neither of them to receive nominations for Best Actor and Supporting Actor come end of year would be a travesty for these are honestly the most vivid and highly intense performances of 2014 The two men clash at each other with power and fire but as they slowly come to respect the other as a fantastic musician and a driven individual their delight and enthusiasm is most evident Teller s eyes alone tell a story of pain and ambition his expressions and eyes often moving from saddened to angry with natural precision His somewhat sympathetic Sutter from The Spectacular Now entirely disappears as he inhabits Andrew a man who is oft times morally ambiguous but commendable and confident nevertheless Simmons is on a whole nother planet the rest of this year s Best Supporting Actor Oscar contenders coming nowhere near his level of intensity pain emotion and brutal honesty His threats directed at both Andrew and his fellow students are both sublime and ethically questionable his moments of weakness and sadness raw and desperately genuine and his encouragement forgiving and welcome Every single scene these two are in together stun they bounce off each other with grace and as their relationship strains to an eventual climax the tension leaps to new highs I ve had few experiences at the theatre this year be this effective engrossing and highly entertaining whilst also being immensely vigorous and exhausting Leaving the theatre I was awash with emotions As a musician I was moved and provoked As a casual viewer I was stunned and depleted This is a cinematic experience not to be missed whether you desire a fantastic plot which takes a number of interesting and unexpected plot twists a drama which focuses on the desire and desperate strive to become one of the greats or a high octane burst of energy in a crowd of films that are currently in cinemas which lack such Damian Chazelle s direction and screenplay is masterful and fit alongside stunning performances tempo driven editing from Tom Cross stunning cinematography from Sharone Meir and a brilliant score from Justin Hurwitz Whiplash is undoubtedly one of the year s best films and one of the best directorial debuts I ve ever seen Watch out for Damian Chazelle for he has all the talent to go far in this harsh and destructive business 10 More film reviews at www entjunkie blogspot

25 March 2017,An absolute masterpiece,There have been great directors in the past such as Stanley Kubrick Sergio Leone Alfred Hitchcock and many others Often times people fondly remember these directors and their movies and wonder which of the directors working today will be considered one of the greats in the near future In my opinion there are many great candidates such as Wes Anderson and Christopher Nolan however there is a new kid in town Damien Chazelle has officially put his stamp on the movie scene with his latest film La La Land which has already received six Academy Awards and seven Golden Globes I ve already watched La La Land in cinemas twice and can t recommend it highly enough and so I was curious what his other movie Whiplash had to offer In Whiplash Chazelle tells the story of a teenage boy Andrew who s dream it is to become the world s greatest drummer In order to achieve his dreams he enrolls at a music conservatory known for its very competitive jazz band helmed by Fletcher Fletcher is no ordinary conductor and has a rather unorthodox style that does not always resonate with every member of the band There s a lot more to this story than this however part of the experience is not knowing what to expect I d hate to ruin this for anyone but what I can tell you is that this is one of the most original stories I ve seen in a long time It s very well put together and unfolds masterfully with a lot of fun and unexpected twists and turns Characters are very well defined and always seem to act according to their beliefs Both Andrew and Fletcher are very interesting characters and their story lines interact beautifully The dialogue itself is also very realistic and often appears as if it s been taken from everyday life The script is also very well balanced as it s very serious at times but also funny when it needs to be Behind the characters of Andrew and Fletcher are Miles Teller and J K Simmons Both characters were already interesting enough however the actors give them an incredible amount of depth Teller really makes you feel for his character and when he is pushed to his limits you can t help but want to reach out through the screen and give him a helping hand In any other movie Teller would easily have been the star of the film however it s extremely hard to pick favourites with Simmons in the supporting role His character is a very strict music conductor and Simons gives his all to portray this fact If the actor is anything like his character than I would advise anyone to stay far away from him However one of the best things about Simmons his act is that he always makes you feel as if there still is a human being hiding inside Fletcher I would argue that with Whiplash both actors have come very close to reaching the top of their abilities but I would hope that the future will prove me wrong What ties Whiplash together is Damien Chazelle with a directional style that is absolutely stellar Although the movie may be slow for some in my opinion the pacing is very well thought out The story progresses very steadily and there is never a moment where it feels as if nothing is happening With the use of low level lighting Chazelle pulls you into every scenario and combined with the constant use of the drums this creates a sensation unlike any other movie The drumming especially gets under your skin and the constant sense of tension this provides perfectly mirrors that which is present between the character Even though the movie is not classified as such it most definitely feels like a thriller and I would personally rate it amongst movies such as The Shining and The Silence of the Lambs solely in terms of suspense Damien Chazelle has literally created a masterpiece and if I would have to point out a flow I d first have to watch it countably many times However Whiplash is so captivating that I would probably forget to look The movie is extremely well directed with acting performances that are amongst some of the best I ve ever seen It features a unique story with an ending that s the cherry on top of the an already delicious cake This movie is perfect in every sense of the word and gets a perfect five stars out of five,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3670222/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2018,An electrifying breakthrough for Damien Chazelle,Damien Chazelle has become a notable rising star in film direction in the past decade his 2016 musical La La Land was the subject of the infamous Best Picture mess up at the 89th Oscars Despite this after a Best Director win Chazelle has been tipped as a great and one of his films that demonstrates this perfectly is his 2014 breakthrough Whiplash the story of an ambitious young student under the tutorage of an abusive music instructor Chazelle has crafted an exhilarating and detailed film owing less to a La La Land esque musical but rather to sports movies like Rocky Miles Teller stars as Andrew a young and hugely ambitious drum prot g desperate to impress his notorious instructor Terence Fletcher J K Simmons stars as Fletcher and is certainly the star of the film his muscular physique and sharp tongue create a monster yet one who remains human enough to remain terrifyingly believable Slowly we see the film turn into a game of cat and mouse as Andrew is relentless in his pursuit to impress Fletcher who argues that tough love is the only way to breed musicians that make history Whiplash is brutal when it needs to be Tom Cross editing adding a sharp execution often cutting to the central drum kit to Chazelle s attentive direction The film is unforgiving in its pace managing to turn even the most permissive drum solos into gripping dramatic set pieces Even as the film descends into melodrama plot wise literal car crashes begin to overtake the metaphorical Whiplash never loses that golden forcefulness and intensity that makes it work so well For a film about music Justin Hurwitz provides a fitting score his striking bouncy music immersed within the jazz standards The score feels like the film itself brassy and pacy yet somehow relaxed and perfectly measured at the same time Whiplash is a fine film Chazelle s aptitude for detailed and thoughtful direction is clear and even when the story trails into the unbelievable you can t bring your eyes way Simmons is stellar in his performance his delicious brutality making him well deserving of his Oscar Whilst La La Land shows Chazelle paying homage to the bygone movie musical its predecessor is a very different film nail biting and uncompromising Whiplash is a very accomplished piece of filmmaking,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4551013/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2018,A wide grin-inducing roller coaster of a film,During my long distant university days for just a brief time I had a Latin percussion tutor by the name of Dave Hassell a serious fella a top notch professional drummer and by all accounts a bit of a task master according to the resident skin beaters on my course Certainly they were no strangers to putting in hours of practice above and beyond what might have been expected of them Drums were not my instrument so I couldn t vouch for the intensity of his methods but if he imposed even a quarter of Terence Fletcher s ferocity in his approach then my belated commiserations guys Whiplash is a serious film about the serious business of jazz music and wannabe jazz musicians Terence Fletcher played by the excellent J K Simmons with uncompromising menace bordering on the psychotic is both revered and feared in equal measures by his students at Shaffer college America s premiere music conservatory Here the students lucky enough to make it into Fletcher s studio band are pushed to their very limits by his tough uncompromising almost boot camp style none more so than newbie squeaker Andrew Neeman played with great conviction by Miles Teller who aspires to be spoken of in the same breath as such jazz luminaries as drummer Buddy Rich There s no room for sentiment or hard luck stories here in Fletcher s world and his methods and insatiable desire to discover his Charlie Parker or Buddy Rich undoubtedly will break and indeed has broken many a determined spirit along the way Neeman s initial ambitious yet quiet and reflective demeanour gives way to a scowling cynical selfishness and arrogance as the film progresses How much of this is down to Fletcher s methods and how much of it is Neeman s possibly natural latent character is hard to say but the change is definite pronounced and unsettling What follows is an exilharating tale of single minded desire drive revenge and counter revenge producing at times almost excruciating levels of tension as the plot twists and turns keeping us guessing right until the very end where the whole thing crescendos to one hell of a tumultuous climax a genuinely electrifying finale It s absolutely riveting viewing swept along by a brilliant powerful and pounding Justin Hurwitz soundtrack Whiplash fully deserves every last accolade it has already received and surely will continue to receive on it s full UK cinema release Not many films produce a loud cheer from a clearly enthralled cinema audience at the end Whiplash did as much I d imagine a collective release from the film s at times tortuous tension as it was a joyous show of appreciation of what is clearly going to be a very strong contender for film of the year Absolutely stunning This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4360770/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2015,The director/writer is only 29!!!,I came across this movie as I was randomly watching movie trailers one day I found the trailer and I was hooked I watched this movie the next day and it just blew me away It is quite shocking to know that the director is only 29 years old You won t guess that after you watch this movie This movie has basically 2 actors Miles Teller J K Simmons Rest of the cast don t even matter Both gave equally great performances in their own right Miles Teller Andrew as a kind of shy but committed to his goal student and J K Simmons Fletcher as a ruthless brutal perfectionist teacher Miles did a good job as a student and this movie will be one more feather in his cap in his still very young career The character of Fletcher is a bit grandiose but looks brutally believable because of a very stellar J K Simmons performance and he rightly got nominated for Best Supporting Actor His character is plain ruthless I had a lot of hatred towards his character throughout this movie He should get bigger roles in the future It would be a shame if JK Simmons doesn t win an Oscar for this Overall this is easily an Oscar worthy material but I doubt if it will win Still it is the best movie I watched that released in 2014,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3181998/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,One minute on stage and ten years off stage,We always enjoy the wonderful music in the concert hall see the brilliant scene of the musicians on the stage but never see the story behind them This film vividly illustrates what we have to experience as a student of music Although there are few specific events it is enough to show the hardships behind this the pain on the way to learn and even the scars on the leading actor s hand As for the vivid introduction it can be said that for a person who studies music it is really empathy Although the strict teacher may be a little unrealistic the character contrast between the characters intelligence also creates the distinctive character characteristics between the two characters which adds a lot of highlights to the plot of the film especially the student lead which seems to be extremely weak in expression and reaction However all the characters that this character needs to express are displayed very accurately which makes us deeply believe that he will be an ordinary student studying jazz drums As for the teacher we can see that the teacher should have confidence and attitude towards students but the drama has made it more severe and has also formed some sharp differences which can be said to be an inspirational film,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8820334/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2017,A rare gem.,Movies are a lot like music They require an ensemble of different instruments and talented artists to achieve a polished result Whiplash a thrilling low budget diamond in the rough is a story about an ambitious young jazz drummer Miles Teller and his terrifying instructor JK Simmons as director Damien Chazelle whips up an aggressive drama fueled symphony that could go down as 2014 s most surprising movie Not much is known of Damien Chazelle except that he has natural flair for the obscene and obscure as the music room slowly turns into a torture chamber Andrew Neyman a student borderline obsessed with mastering the fine art of drumming His soft and naive nature is pure cannon fodder for the volatile and barbarous Mr Fletcher a character that cares solely for his orchestra and brutally discards anyone who dares tamper with it As we see Andrew s relentless drive toward Fletcher s pursuit of nail biting perfection and approval the film and its character s reach a primal arena reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick s Full Metal Jacket To say Whiplash is one of the years best films may be a stretch but no one can deny its entertaining and ferocious brilliance pushed to the absolute limit by Simmon s charismatic presence I look forward to Damien Chazelle s next installment,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3838003/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2015,Way to go JK Simmons!,Whiplash definitely earned its best picture nomination this year I ve never seen a music movie that was so intense There are really only two actors in this film that matter and they are Miles Teller and JK Simmons Miles Teller is a young man who will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come especially with his involvement in the reboot of the Fantastic Four Teller can act and he could have been nominated for an Oscar for this role Teller is a veteran drummer so this story was something that he was certainly passionate about and that passion is apparent throughout the film I m glad they didn t stick a rookie behind the kit JK Simmons who has already won a Golden Globe for this performance was so amazing This guy came out of no where The biggest role Simmons had before this film was playing J Jonah Jameson in the original Spiderman trilogy and he played him beautifully but Whiplash will be the film he is remembered for He is up for an Oscar for this film and I think the odds are likely in his favor considering the competition I think that anyone can enjoy Whiplash because of its intensity,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3187255/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2019,Whistleblower,In an age where anyone with an airplane loyalty card and a whistle calls themselves a popular musician this movie is a necessity to safeguard the foundations of music There are two ways to the top excellence or corruption Whiplash talks about both with unmasked honesty Whereas many gatekeepers to the stages of the world are corrupt excellence must find a way to shine through This way will be painful as we watch the passionate jazz drummer student growing up in the class of a sadist and corrupt teacher But the lesson is for reality and the result is a musician who truly knows his craft instead of defining his profession from applause It seems appropriate that this movie has won a Sundance prize I deduct a star from the rating for one dimensional characters,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4999658/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2015,"Only ""Boyhood"" Was Better 2014 Flick Than ""Whiplash""",By now you ve surely heard about or seen the trailer for Damien Chazelle s latest picture Whiplash That s the one in which veteran character actor J K Simmons plays a loud obnoxious condescending jazz band director at a prestigious music school If you re like me you re not thrilled about seeing this one A little of that screaming goes a long way Please allow me to tell you how misguided your decision to skip this one is At first Simmons the father in Juno struck me as a jazz band version of R Lee Ermey s drill sergeant character in Stanley Kubrick s Full Metal Jacket In both cases the attitude is merely theatre designed to drastically alter the mindsets of young men But the difference is that Ermey s character attempted to make soldiers of men who might otherwise panic when faced with a life or death situation Ermey s ranting and raving was in a way vital to the survival of our nation at least that s the way he saw it But Simmons His Terence Fletcher is bellowing at music students not soldiers Yes I initially found his character to be way over the top But I soon realized there was a method to his madness Fletcher s life was changed when he read about Charlie Parker s drummer who threw a cymbal at young Parker when he didn t think the future saxophone aficionado was playing up to his potential From that moment Fletcher made it his lifelong goal to berate greatness if you will from his students Fletcher is not a guy who ever says Good job He can t be pleased he can only be impressed One day he personally picks a freshman percussionist named Andrew to be an alternate player in his top jazz band Fletcher sees enough potential that he subjects Andrew to his discordant teaching style in hopes that he may become the next Buddy Rich What ensues is a fascinating game of one upmanship as these two strong personalities do battle against each other Fletcher to bring the musical genius out of Andrew and Andrew to keep from being insulted and dishonored in the process Still not convinced you oughta pluck down cash for this one Let me tell you the two leads are out of this world I wouldn t be surprised to see J K Simmons win not just nominated but win the Supporting Actor Oscar even though I think both leads belong in the Lead Actor category but that s another discussion for another day And Miles Teller so convincing in last year s The Spectacular Now is every bit as robust in his role as Andrew In fact Teller has the same problem Tom Cruise had in Rain Man How do you turn in a persuasive performance playing the straight man against a triumph of acting But in both cases Teller s and Cruise s they are able to match the exultation of the actors in the more glamorous roles Teller certainly deserves a Lead Actor nomination I d also be remiss not to mention both the script and the cinematography Damien Chazelle s screenplay is succinct a la David Mamet s screenplays There are no extra scenes no filler material and the abrupt ending is perfect Chazelle wisely opts to leave out the denouement scenes in a story of two individuals who respect one another but don t particularly like one another And Sharone Meir s cinematography deserves to be nominated as well The musical sequences are peppered with rapid cuts and edits Remember Martin Scorsese s The Color Of Money in which the camera seemed to concentrate on the rapid motion and beautiful color of the pool balls Scorsese made the relatively mundane act of two men shooting pool into a spellbinding visual treat Same thing here We re not simply treated to watching a twelve man jazz band belt out a tune Instead the camera pops from close up shots of sweaty hard working Andrew with perfectionist Fletcher interspersed with quick shots of the beautiful shiny brass instruments Viewers become mesmerized as the music seems to crackle right off the screen It s a real masterpiece of filmmaking without being gimmicky as the long tracking shots were in Alejandro Inarritu s recent Birdman In short Whiplash is the best film I ve seen since Richard Linklater s Boyhood was out this summer During awards season I hope Whiplash doesn t become a forgotten memory buried amongst all the big budget over hyped cinema of the year This one s a gem and I can t wait to see it again,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3304100/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2018,Drum roll please.....,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4288630/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2018,Easily watchable and enjoyable.,Well i had number of movies last night in my watch list It was really tough to select a movie from such amazing collection I was actually looking for a short not much complex and simple adventurous yet inspiring movie This movie had all the ingredients I was looking for I was also wondering during opening credits that by trailer it looked like a movie about a student and his tough strict and abusive coach which kind of made the movie predictable But still I was hoping some character twist that s why it was so popular This movie from start till end is engaging and entertaining there is not a single dull moment and because of much detailed and inspiring sequences it looked like a biopic movie many times and I was amazed that all it is is a fictional story Performances by Miles Teller and J K Simmons were amazing in fact watching Sir J K Simmons was so pleasurable and his performance was so flawless and believable The other actors Paul Reiser as Andrew s father Melissa Benoist as beautiful Nicole and the other actors as musician were amazing in their roles as well In a nutshell this is a worth watching movie You will not be bored and it will give you some inspiration for your career and way of thinking,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4231708/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,"Has some small but big plot holes, but its amazing acting, directing, editing and writing make Whiplash a great film",Whiplash stars Miles Teller and J K Simmons it is directed and written by Damien Chazelle and it is awesome seriously just awesome It is a dazzling electrifying and original movie Andrew Neiman Miles Teller is a drummer who aspires to be the best like Buddy Rich He is a part of an elite music school and one day conductor Terence Fletcher J K Simmons accepts him into his band as the substitute drummer From the first rehearsal it is apparent that Fletcher is the king dick of the galaxies He is abusive of his students assaulting them in every way possible While practicing the song Whiplash he hurls a chair at Andrew for being on his tempo and begins to slap and berate him for rushing and dragging the band Fletcher continues to push Andrew to his limits and in order to earn his approval he starts practicing all the time These two provide amazing acting despite Simmons being the one with the most award buzz I thought they were equally stunning with incredible chemistry to boot Teller brings the drive to be the best to the screen creating an engaging and relatable character who eventually becomes possessed with his ambition his scenes after being under Fletcher s tutelage does to him as a person it makes him start to lose his mind it is very very interesting he provides fierce acting It s as if Teller is an unstoppable force and Simmons is an immovable object Another awesome thing is that he did most of the drumming himself that s already worth a lot of praise right there His exhaustion is real and you feel the work he put in the role it all pays off culminating in incredible acting And Simmons he is astounding What a performance He is so ferocious and ruthless and his insults are great and I hate to admit it but they re pretty hilarious the actor delivered them with such anger just amazing Such a dick of a character just the fact that an actor can get so into character to the point of you wanting to beat him up so bad is something to behold The other supporting actors Paul Reiser his dad and Melissa Benoist his girlfriend are very good as well both their relationships with Andrew are very interesting to see The movie is very well written as well it has as good characterization for the two leads as it gets Both of the characters have such intriguing character arks with amazing development by the time the movie ends Andrew of course is very humane and real and since joining Schaffer he starts to become overwhelmed by his ambition to be the best and starts to become disturbed like what he did with his girlfriend and the character gets even more interesting from there While Fletcher is usually this feral man who has a terrible influence on his students as can be seen from what he does to Andrew He could have been pretty much a cartoon but the script and Simmons performance gave him such depth showing some scenes where he truly does not seem like an entirely bad person and while you can still see his reason for being a total dick to his students of course it s not justified but I liked how he had very strong views on his methods And the butting of heads between these two Such an amazing and interesting conflict also best chemistry I ve seen these two did such an incredible job And now for my only flaws with the film and unfortunately they are big it s the film s complete lack of realism in key plot points for example how the hell has Fletcher not lost his job And this is after Andrew s first rehearsal hell before the movie even began I mean if you hurl a chair at a FIRST time student because he wasn t on your tempo well you can t expect to not be sued for everything you have this is 2014 New York no way in hell he would walk away scot free Also there is another scene where Andrew goes to play in a concert and something happens with him something big but no one reacts to it hard not spoiling it Those two problems drilled a gigantic hole in the plot and they took me out of the film a bit The rest of the movie was great however nothing else wrong Chazelle of course directed this film as well and there s another praiseworthy achievement each image is very well filmed I specifically loved the beginning shots which showcase Andrew walking around the beautiful nighttime NY with each shot focusing on the buildings then scooting down to him with some groovy and smooth jazz playing in the soundtrack which is awesome Full of fun and electric tunes while also including some quite sad and dramatic songs And the final act that was some of the best minutes in a movie last year everything in it is simply put specially the music direction and editing Chazelle does a magnificent job filming impossible shots right at the mouth of each trumpet and trombone and the editing my god it s so good Tom Cross does an incredible job here with tightly edited closeups of each instrument changing the viewpoint with each beat and giving each instrument its time to shine The sound is incredible as well to make all those instruments sound so perfectly while all playing at the same time is a great feat The ending of the film is really awesome and I believe everyone will like it a lot Despite its small but big flaws Whiplash is a really awesome movie one that reaches out to any type of moviegoer it is beautifully acted directed and edited and has an amazing script with a strong story that is electric emotional and astounding all at the same time,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3170310/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2018,Intense !,Not what you d think from a story about a drummer with only two main characters Both characters are described in much detail without any word of mouth needed it s all shown through camera angles lighting costume and props every little detail is thought about and the contrast between the two characters who are at constant conflict really make in for a story that can really suck you in and make you feel part of the movie and connect with the characters This connection wouldn t have been possible if it wasn t for the outstanding acting of Miles Teller and J K Simmons,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4021438/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2018,Brilliantly crafted and fantastically brutal,Lets be honest guys This is one of those movies where the story sounds lame but the movie well we can just say it speaks for itself I ll be honest when I pressed play on this I had absolutely no idea what I was walking into I was just willing to try it The intro drumming began the first shot of Andrew with the camera slowly moving down a corridor came to I was hooked This movie does not suffer because of the lack of atmosphere at all it doesn t need music In fact it utilises the jazz music that the movie is based around to provide the atmosphere which may be one of the cleverest techniques I ve seen it helps to engage in the film far quicker than you may usually do similar to the music at the start of 2001 A Space Odyssey In fact Whiplash is incredible looking at it from a critical perspective the way the title is interweaved with the movie s theme the music the acting the direction the dialogue everything I could write a 10 page essay on how good this movie is and why Fletcher s character is ingenious probably the most well developed intruiging movie character I ve ever encountered His character creates all these senses of fascination but with a brutal deliverance that allows those emotions to be mixed with an element of fear Trust me you won t soon find another one like him His dialogue is so clever made to feel like nothing and everything is due to happen in the moments that follow the one you are engaged in The huge amount of swearing only serves to add character and in fact Fletcher is so well crafted you can almost feel the way Andrew changes throughout the film as he gradually loses his humility and nearly all his positivity in multiple scenes drumming so intensely that he makes his hands bleed then plasters them up and continues drumming The story wow the story is good It s absolutely relentless with its harsh telling with shouting swearing and equipment being thrown at people s heads at every twist and turn In fact it offers the whole package determination completely unpredicted twists one of the most brilliant character motive stories in the form if Fletcher s explanation even an out of nowhere shocking moment And yet everything is cleverly integrated along with the music to make you feel a part of the whole traumatic experience To give you an idea of how powerful this movie is my mind has been flashing back to it s best scenes every day for a month now Despite how hard it is to watch struggle on because you will never critically view a movie the same way again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4213052/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2015,Tense.Tense.Tense,Whiplash is a movie about a first year music student Miles Teller who wins a seat behind the drums in a jazz band led by teacher J K Simmons who uses fear and intimidation to push his students to perfection The movie is outstanding with interesting characters played by talented actors It shows the evolution and determination of Miles Teller s character and how he is willing to lose everything to be the best The movie is filled with nail biting moments which you wouldn t expect from a movie like this And J K Simmons s performance was one of my favorite and without a doubt one of his best the way he made his character come to life was amazing In the end the movie was excellent the acting was excellent and the drumming was excellent Whiplash is a must see not only if you like Jazz but even if you like good entertainment,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3194659/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2022,Fantastic portrayl of obsession.,Great movie Every actors of the movie has given his her all Miles Teller is amazing and he does a great job manifesting a person who is obsessed with his craft Anti social and absolute just amazing Also the co protagonist Fletcher is a masterful portrayal of an oppressive authority figure Manipulative offensive brutal and also he has the reputation of a great teacher This combination is so appropriate for a man that wants to have control upon his pupils The movie teaches us what is normal and what is pathological when it comes to practice and effort Also it teaches us about resilience and determination in the face of dark times The directing is also good and in some cases symbolic He uses color to highlight some things and he does not do anything that could be considered pretentious The best part of the movie hands down is the teacher development If you ask me this is a story about a kid who wants to be great and a teacher who challenges him in order to provide the appropriate foundation for his dreams,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8310279/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,Excellent,Rhythm The editing of the entire movie stepped on each of the most exciting lenses and the progress of the clouds and waters The performances of the two starring actors were also out of frame every frame All the priorities in the film seemed to be a natural combination,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5863505/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2023,Mr. Holland's Opus Meets Full Metal Jacket,This film walks a razors edge in its depiction of a toxic abusive authority figure Equal parts inspiring and terrifying The writing and acting also beautifully capture the duality in all people even villains have a soft side and the hero that we re all rooting for has a darkness that challenges the viewer Though I ve seen this film several times in the nine years since its release it s no less potent and engaging The story it tells transcends music and applies to all discipline be they artistic or otherwise as it addresses the human condition and how our aspirations can lead to our annihilation,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8875187/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,Its awesome ! You will need it.,Whiplash is an amazing movie that shows the working toward your passion It shows passion is much greater than any job The movie story shows how a mentor guides or basically states his ways his style to help improve a person,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6063158/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,Jesus,Watched in December 2022 I m leaving a review to say that I have only heard endless amounts of hype about this movie over the years since it s release It appears in tons of lists singing praises for how amazing it is Everyone talks about J K Simmons and how his performance is mind boggling This is the first movie I have ever seen that lived up to the hype Watch this movie This is one of the top 500 movies ever made I m not sure where it falls on that list but top 500 ever is high praise 500 movies released during the time it took to read this review The end of this movie gave me chills and I can t get it out of my head,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8751948/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2015,Oscar-Worthy,Whiplash As someone who s in orchestra and plays sports this movie is like an overkill supercut of my scariest moments Although some things in this movie you might not get as well if you don t play an instrument the intensity is still incredible I ve never had a movie where I ve been sweating the entire film and shoot the drum solo at the end is surely deserving of a 10 flat If you enjoyed this review be sure to check out my YouTube channel Quinn C the one with the James Bond emblem I review films old and new as well as take in depth looks at the James Bond series If you like film at all in particular James Bond please be sure to check me out on Quinn C with the James Blnd emblem on YouTube Thanks,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3285186/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2015,Not just Great Performances but a Great Film.,Obviously going into this film the hype was high with word of J K Simmons and his masterful performance however I was pleasantly surprised by just about everything pertaining to this film The performances dialogue lighting cinematography and over all direction was extremely well executed There is a specific event in the film which kind of crosses a line into a completely unbelievable circumstance however it does recover itself The editing at points felt abrupt and rough however it doesn t hinder the film too much Just about every actor is over shadowed by the absolutely masterful performance by J K Simmons one thing to be noticed by the end of the film is the performance of Miles Teller who seemingly solidifies himself as as clich as it is to say one of the best young actors around This film is certainly worth watching no matter if you like Jazz or not Also I would like to say that I ve noticed a few negative reviews regarding the intensity of some characters and the vulgarness of some of the lines These people are politically correct douchebags the type of person who get offended for other people and who think a film showing assault simply means the creators condone that behavior If anything this movie is enjoyable if you ve experienced life persevered and even after doing everything right you re told it s wrong that s life and this film nails it It makes you feel defeated at points and it makes you feel enthused about something only to get slapped in the face in a good way,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3161741/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,One of my all time favourites,So if you see a negative review of which there are only a few they are the most stupid pretentious ramblings you ll ever have the misfortune to read ignore them it s just a great film it s acted insanely well and the final scene what can you say it actually evokes a physical response you will feel happy exhilarated intense joyful even I have watched it loads of times and the ending is always fantastic I think not only because it is hold your breath exciting but because there is something really satisfying about them both getting what they wanted from the other one Now I don t now about high brow details lol or jazz but this is what a movie should be a journey a story and a ending that makes you smile and want to download caravan on Spotify,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8275270/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2021,Gripping,This is not just a mere success story of a young boy who wants to be a drummer It dissects the torments the blood the tears and the cost of somebody who wants to be great The warmness of the scenes are very striking and whatever is not warm is something the character has to avoid to be great Great performances by JK Simmons and Miles Teller As opposed to the short film Miles nailed it better,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7706285/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2014,"Whiplash : ""The pace is too fast, you just won't last "" !",Whiplash deserves all the good critics it received How not to be carried away by the preposterous and unreasonable pace of Andrew s drum sticks a young drummer of the Shaffer Conservatory obsessed with the recognition of his talent The film s dynamism itself is designed as a hysterical sequence of notes but the ensemble of notes is formed by a set of shades of the same notes making the film panting almost suffocating and administering a dose of unsustainable adrenaline Yet this is exactly what happens to Andrew in his relationship to Fletcher prestigious professor at the Conservatory What is emerging is a constant struggle between these two entities on one side Andrew tested and on the other Fletcher The film takes its full extent in the many narrative and emotional breakdowns because each rhythm set by the instrument immediately becomes a visual rhythm that almost forces the viewer into the torments of its characters However in the reflection of Andrew what drives him contrary to what we might think is the break in the rhythm and in relationships What drives him to play more intensely until he even bleeds is a break in the game between him and Fletcher who encourages him for a while then suddenly and sadistically discourages him J K Simmons plays the conductor in that he carefully organizes these ruptures that eventually form the film s tempo and the determination of the unresolved Andrew to be unique Whiplash tinged with a black humor partition and intense sequences conducted by the stunning performances of Miles Teller Simmons clearly stands out in the Oscars race being already rewarded many times at the tempo of one instrument almost too proud of itself paradoxically exhausted by its inordinate ambition as it demonstrates extreme measure,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3150356/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2018,"A strong story, very well acted",This is one of those films that equals the hype Just J K Simmons alone makes it worth the time but Miles Teller also breaks out as a bonafide star also The themes will resonate with anyone who has cared about something so much they ll put up with almost anything do get it It s excruciating at times but always with a payoff,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4096392/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2021,WHIPLASH!!!,Whiplash Written and directed by the fairly unknown up coming Damien Chazelle Who is recently known for his involvement in 10 Cloverfield Lane First Man Staring Miles Teller JK Simmons this picture is set in modern day New York City centring around a university for music arts JK Simmons plays a Jazz teacher Fletcher and Miles Teller is our sensitive protagonist one of Fletchers many students Andrew My favourite aspect of this movie is the intensely brutal and sometimes awkward atmosphere created by the collision of these two characters The tension is formed through the cinematography dialogue and the excellent performances alone JK Simons Is ridiculously intimidating in this role constantly pushing the ambitions and emotions of Tellers character to absolute breaking point with his ferocious temper and teaching methods The scenes are performed so well it s as if you re sat in the rehearsal room concert hall with these characters Miles Teller also plays the drums for real which makes the performance that more realistic and captivating for the audience I watched this movie upon release back in 2015 I m not an avid fan of Jazz music but after my initial viewing I could admit I gained a new found appreciation for the genre and have since rewatched the movie 4 times It s value unsurprisingly never decreases after a revisit which is a testament to how groundbreaking Whiplash truly is I highly recommend,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6701645/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2015,One of the best films in recent years.,There s not many movies that I can think of that put me on the edge of my seat and was completely engaged to the screen as I did with Whiplash This film is one of the best films I have seen in recent years and anyone that loves movie should watch this film It s about a young drummer named Andrew Miles Teller who s trying to be the best drummer in his field and in order to do so he s being instructed by a ruthless Jazz Instructor named Fletcher J K Simmmons From there it is an intense psychological battle between the two and it is gripping to see the pair butt heads against each other J K Simmons was absolutely brilliant as Fletcher It s very hard for any actor to be a complete jerk as he was in this film and yet there was still something entertaining about his performance that makes me appreciate his role in the film Miles Teller was also really good and a little bit underrated as you can feel that his character is willing to put through hell just to be the best drummer in his field I find it extremely fascinating that a movie about a jazz drummer could be so incredibly intense and Damien Chazelle the writer and director of this film was able to make the whole experience absolutely gripping The music as you might expect is really great as the jazz songs that they have absolutely perfect for this film and extremely catchy as I would catch myself humming the songs long after I watched the movie But if there s one thing that I have to give the movie big props for is that it was able to make me to applaud at the end of the film which I ve never done that in my life Without giving too much away the ending scene is absolutely intense and completely gripping to the point that when the ending sequence was over I felt like that I was in the greatest movie trip in my life This is my favorite film of the year and anybody who loves movies need to check this out,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3213140/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2017,"""Whiplash"" stakes claim as indie frontrunner",Independent films have grown increasingly popular as of late 2014 was filled with these types of movies that seemingly came out of nowhere and Whiplash was one of the frontrunners Miles Teller plays Andrew Neiman an aspiring jazz drummer attending Shaffer Conservatory in New York City Terence Fletcher played by J K Simmons is a well respected instructor at the university who takes notice of Neiman and recruits him for his studio band Neiman s excitement to join the band is short lived however as Fletcher s brutal methods of teaching prove immensely taxing physically and emotionally Throughout the film it is difficult to tell if Fletcher is a protagonist or antagonist Do his methods truly better his students or is he just trying to find his own Buddy Rich Where does an instructor draw the line Is being one of the greats worth losing one s humanity Neiman desires to be great and this is shown in his decision making throughout the film His passion allows him to endure Fletcher s physical and emotional abuse and the battle of wits that ensues between the two actors is where the movie shines Damien Chazelle s writing and direction fuels the intensity of the performances Chazelle himself struggled to make it as a jazz drummer in high school and he even had an intense music instructor who inspired the character of Terence Fletcher His musical experience is evident in the script and the quality of the jazz music is no doubt a testament to Chazelle s guiding hand in the production The music itself is captivating and Fletcher s ferocious conducting is not only the product of good acting Simmons graduated with a music degree from the University of Montana where he minored in composition and conducting Teller also possessed some experience in rock drumming tracing back to his teen years Rock drumming and jazz drumming are two different monsters however and for two months Teller trained three to four hours each day under professional drummer Nate Lang in preparation for his role Because of his hard work Teller was able to actually play in portions the difficult pieces Neiman performs in the film However the fluidity and intensity of Neiman s drumming is more of a testament to Tom Cross editing The last 30 minutes of this film will have viewers eyes locked onto the drama it is one of the most emotionally gripping finales I have ever seen Whiplash is an impressive feat by 30 year old Damien Chazelle winning three Oscars including the well deserved Best Supporting Actor recognition awarded to J K Simmons It is a fast paced full throttled drama that will have viewers on the edge of their seat until the last drum stroke,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3682918/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2015,Blind ambition drives the tension of this student-mentor relationship underscored by powerful performances,Right from the first scene you feel the tension that develops between a young student entering a top music school in New York and his teacher who stops at nothing to push his students beyond their limits Andrew is a talented 19 year old drummer with a drive to be the best in the world Fletcher is jazz music teacher whose teaching style is geared towards finding the next great jazz performer He will stop at nothing his methods use a brutal manipulation put downs with the most refined language emotional and physical abuse and a total disregard for any common decency Andrew s ambition takes over his whole life as he drives all of his friends and colleagues away from himself in the blind pursuit of his dream Only his father remains by his side as his constant support Fletcher never doubts that he has a right to push his students by any means His arrogance has no end Just as you hope that maybe there is a human being behind the cruel persona he proves you wrong again To him the worst two words in English language are good job as they are only for those who aspire to mediocrity He wants his students to aspire to nothing but greatness An emotional drama builds up and never lets go Who will break first The balance between the teacher and the student shifted several times and stayed unpredictable till the end The drumming and jazz music was telling the story alongside the excellent performances of Miles Teller and J K Simmons Achieving greatness has a cost and this film lets you think about the balance between the two I give it 8 out of 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3180395/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2017,Whiplash,When I sat down to watch this film I didn t know what to expect I am not usually a fan of films about musicians but this was a brilliant and tense masterpiece The story is of a very ambitious boy named Andrew played by Miles Teller who is a music student in New York He aspires to be noticed by a prestigious music teacher named Fletcher played by J K Simmons As his wish starts becoming a reality he realises the brutality of this teacher who continually pushes him with questionable methods Damien Chazelle s direction is almost of a tense boxing or war action drama in that it constantly uses the music of the drumming to build the tension whilst using violent and sharp editing whilst the jazz band play Chazelle s screenplay is very well written It is filled with humour tension and heartbreak The way in which Fletcher switches during Andrew s first lesson is expertly done Fletcher relentlessly insults Andrew in a very shocking way which really creates a huge sense of sympathy for Andrew s character as he struggles to respond The insulting dialogue is very similar to Stanley Kubrick s Full Metal Jacket in that it is both humorous and disturbingly distressing The performances in this film are remarkable Miles Teller is a relative newcomer but takes to this character with so much depth and understanding The drumming scenes look like incredible and torturous workouts and Teller really shows the pain and agony his character is going through to reach his dream The chemistry between the two central characters is flawless J K Simmons is perfect as the abusive music teacher Simmons manages to combine Fletcher s distinguished persona with his terrifying unpredictability Simmons reminds me of his character in Valve s Portal 2 in which he continuously spouts insults at the player in a darkly hilarious way Overall Whiplash is a fascinating study of passion ambition and love The film asks questions about the morality of getting one s dreams and the acceptable methods of acquiring them Full of amazing performances all around and created with such intensity and spirit my final rating for this film is 4 5 stars,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3655266/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2015,One of the best films of the past 10 years.,WHIPLASH Whiplash is an independent movie brought to you by writer director Damien Chazelle Chazelle entered a short story into the Sundance film festival in 2013 The clip was so high praised he gained funding to adapt it into a full movie When it was shown in last years Sundance Festival on the 16th of January It was given such high praise It won the Dramatic Audience Award and has been consistently talked about ever since Do not fear greatness Some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them And boy did this movie achieve it Andrew Nieman Miles Teller The Spectacular now is a 19 year old drummer at the fictional Shaffer Music Conservatory in New York City Plagued by his farther s failure to become a prestigious writer he will stop at nothing to reach his goal of becoming one of the greatest jazz drummer of all time One day while he is practicing he catches the eye of the great Terrence Fletcher J K Simmons Spider Man Trilogy Who leads the top jazz ensemble in the school After impressing him he thinks he has got the sweet deal he had always dreamed of But instead of being the knight in shining armour that Andrew thinks is He will soon discover Fletcher s frightening and brutal methods that will forever change his life Andrew s passion to achieve greatness quickly spirals into an obsession eventually pushing him to the brink of both his ability and sanity Editing isn t really something I pay attention to or even notice while watching movies but the editing in this movie is fantastic It is filled with swift transactions between the character to drum set How it moves perfectly over to each drum or symbol in perfect timing to the music The back and forth switching from character to character is outstanding especially in the confronting and emotional scenes The most liberating thing in this movie for me is the acting Oh man the acting is incredible J K Simmons really does give the performance of his life in this movie He s so viscous and mean but he plays it to a T You may say well it doesn t take a great actor to be able to scream and shout but to give the emotion and brutality that he put into his scenes I feel absolutely no one could do better Picture J Jonah Jameson mixed with Sergeant Hartman from FMJ but 10 times worse and that s Simmons in this movie Also let us not forget Miles Teller He really poured his heart and soul into this movie a ground breaking performance from him He catches the emotion of Andrew to perfection and I couldn t imagine anyone fitting that role more than him This movie is near perfection the only real flaw I have with this movie is Andrew s girlfriend Nicole Melissa Benoist Glee I don t really thing she was necessary to this movie maybe if they would have added just a few more scenes maybe an extra 5 minutes just so we could get a real feel for her character and care how she ends up That is the only thing stopping me from giving this a 10 10 A 9 8 10 will suffice But it is definitely in the run for some Oscar nominations and I believe it definitely deserves a few wins as well,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3159256/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2015,Unrealistic but worth watching,I have been both a musician and a music teacher and this movie is unrealistic in so many ways No prestigious music school would allow the bullying profane monster portrayed by J K Simmons to have access to its students No drummer s hands bleed in the manner portrayed by Miles Teller s character maybe a blister or two might pop before he develops callouses drummers should speak to this The movie is almost unbearably slow at times besides However it is worth seeing if you like jazz although most of the music is not modern jazz at all but more from the big band era and if you like good acting Both J K Simmons who won the Oscar for his portrayal and Miles Teller do a phenomenal job of acting out their parts in this wildly unrealistic drama of a driven young musician s descent into near madness caused by a sadistic instructor The movie Shine with Geoffrey Rush was in a similar vein but was done much more realistically and with a painful type of beauty J K Simmons absolutely deserved the win for his portrayal but anyone who would rush to see this movie should go in with eyes wide open and a shot of caffeine to stay awake,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3194145/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2015,"""Whiplash"" is simply a tense, captivating study all about what it takes, and what is needed, to be great.",Whiplash is initially a captivating study about what it takes to be great and what is needed to become great and it ends as a captivating study about what it is to be great Miles Teller playing Andrew Neiman and J K Simmons playing Terence Fletcher are both absolutely fantastic in their respective roles and their performances are on par with those I loved witnessing in Birdman and they fit perfectly as Birdman s cast did with that films respective themes with what Whiplash is all about Greatness as I mentioned earlier is what Whiplash is all about Teller s and Simmons drive reflect this and it comes through in their characters Andrew wants to be one of the greats and Fletcher wants to be the man to coach one of them Yet this is certainly the absolute minimum of what I gathered about this film before I saw it This kind of drive is in motion about halfway through the film and Whiplash has several twists and turns in it before it finishes Teller and Simmons develop extremely complex characters and what you come to realise is that what makes them complex is their drive Andrew for example is an initially very easy character to understand and in some ways to relate to We ve all wanted to be better and get great at something But what takes Whiplash in a different direction from the one where we see Andrew asking the girl behind the counter at the cinema out is Fletcher He pushes Andrew beyond what is expected of him Watching Teller develop Andrew as a character is a fun ride although Fletcher swearing slapping and throwing cymbals at him is not so much but it s all for a reason But is it necessary Fletcher believes so calling it an absolute necessity in a scene where he seems to reveal himself as the grand villain right beneath our noses this whole time Whiplash asks these questions and it s almost as if the film sprouted from them not that they came up and were developed as the film continued to shoot Andrew and Fletcher s relationship is an attempt at answering them leaving it up to you whether the answers Whiplash puts forward are right or wrong Are Fletchers methods the way forward Could Andrew harness his talent and be great without Fletcher Did Andrew have the talent to do such a thing Is talent even a realistic construct Whiplash asks all of these questions and puts forward its answers here Of course Teller and Simmons are fantastic too and deserve the nominations they are getting Simmons character is particularly well developed and funny too and again it is a joy to witness Teller s development Neither character can be described really Simmons seems describable but there seems to be something beneath him that I couldn t figure out and in one scene we see that he isn t quite as tough as he seems to be What surprises me though is how Simmons keeps winning awards and Teller does not For me they are both brilliant and one does not outdo the other because in Whiplash you come to think of them as entirely separate individuals and their relationship is instead an eternal one in regards to how it can be applied to several examples and asked whether it is one required for greatness What s also worth mentioning is the films score It s brilliant It really is just a complete appraisal of Jazz Drums of course predominantly feature and although the score is not as good as Birdman s again heavily featuring drums the reason it is not is because the score in Whiplash is external and in Birdman it s internal inside the cast s heads It has meaning and something to do with the film whereas in Whiplash it s almost as if Jazz music and the drums in this case are being used as a way by which we can see Andrew become great It s another eternal concept of sorts Whiplash is definitely worth seeing and although I wouldn t quite call it the film of the year it certainly puts forward a good performance in several categories and has done well considering it was shot in 19 days and adapted from a short film Most should come out saying Whiplash was a good film It s tense and has some good performances in it and asks questions and talks about greatness It s visually tense as well helped along by slow motion shots of sweat bouncing up and down off cymbals and blood dripping from a hand Because of this it was an utter relief and felt hard earned in some respects to see the films ending,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3162963/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2017,House of Whipcord is probably better,I MUST have watched the wrong movie The reviews for this film could in no way apply to the contrived claptrap I ve just seen Perhaps the positive reviews here were intended for that 1974 masterpiece House of Whipcord The movie called Whiplash that I saw stars J K Simmons as Terence a music teacher who can slap a face with such force as to make General Patton wince The film also stars Miles Teller as Andrew a student of Terence s who yearns to learn from him how to properly play the drums Andrew accomplishes this by volunteering to let his teacher play the bongos on his face I won t say that Damien Chazelle s direction is heavy handed but I would probably prefer to stick my head in Andrew s bass drum during the climactic scene than to endure watching said scene again A word of advice to anyone considering seeing this film go to YouTube instead and do a search for Buddy Rich You will see the greatest drummer ever and spare yourself the agony of viewing this over the top trite clich d eye roll inducing effort Your eyes and your ears will thank you for it,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3628566/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2018,On the thorns until the end,An excellent movie which maintains a constant level of anxiety never banal absolutely worth seeing Perhaps not to be reviewed as much of the effect of anxiety is based on the surprises that the main character reserves about the behavior that will be held in the minutes to follow Surprising J K Simmons annoying until the end but this is it seen october 2018,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4456140/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2020,Not quite my tempo,A great movie with a simple plot and high in potential of hitting you off The story is set in a Music School where our protagonist Miles Teller is trying his best to make his dream of being a perfect jazz drummer come true On the other side of the story there is a music instructor who out of nowhere meets Andrew practicing some techniques The story doesn t end here as due to the perfectionism of the teacher things become tough for Andrew to the point he is ready to bleed and lose everything for his great ambition Containing some cliches like if you practice hard you will achieve everything and blah blah the script is mind blowing that it s capable of engaging its viewers for almost two hours I don t have any bright opinion about the cast except for J K Simmons His performance is nothing but absolute perfection Not for one second can you think of him being an actor He offers a memorable portrait of a perfectionist teacher who is ready to sacrifice everything to find the next talented drummer of his time and the performance of him was indeed gripping and adorable Now to get to the technical aspects of Whiplash everything is well crafted and executed The cinematography is all well set and the music is right at the tempo Now you might wonder why I have given an eight to this movie Well to be honest I was of a high expectation of this picture as I had already heard a lot about it but at the end of the movie beside the solid performance of J K Simmons and a top notch narrative including the story of music artists it didn t live up to my expectation and somehow made me not to think of it as sharp and witty as I wanted Nevertheless overall it s a marvelous movie to watch and thoroughly recommended to be watched at least ONCE,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6371034/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2018,One of the best written films I've ever seen,In this magnificent piece you will find amazing acting an outstanding score intriguing visuals and dialogue created by the gods Damine Chazelle is one of the most underrated directors of our time I never hear any news about him except for La La land but his work has been lying in the shadows This film proved J K Simmons amazing acting capability as he performed his heart out as the antagonist of the story yet at the same time pushing the protagonist to greatness via madness Miles Teller s performance was very realistic and extremely emotional his near madness in the second act of the film is extremely convincing and not out of character Now the supporting cast was great as well and no subplot felt out of place This film is perfect example for any writer wishing to make a dynamic character arc work in their work because Andrews arc is better than any I ve seen before The character change from the start of the film to the end of it feeling completely natural yet extremely his personality is completely different If you ve seen the film or not you should go watch it or honestly any Chazelle movie they re amazing,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4487430/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2017,Excellent,The demand for musical jazz excellence is melted with the extreme relationship between the student and the teacher In this movie we are confronted with a situation between the will of the student to become an all time GREAT musician ready to do everything for it and the teacher who wants to discover the new Charlie Parker The great part about this movie is the psychological relationship between the student and the teacher extreme and violent It appears that the teacher seems sick minded about his class threatening the students not to bring his reputation down You sometimes wonder how a student can accept this but it also seems like all the students admire him and especially Andrew the student and his ambition to be the very best makes him forget all the things Terrence Fletcher the teacher is inflicting on him The performances of the 2 lead actors J K Simmons and Miles Teller are really special a great psychological battle between theses two We can really feel the tension and the ambition of each character in this movie And the realization allows us to see all the pain Andrew goes through In a more general way this movie puts in perspective the extreme demands and standards of the highest music schools and all the psychological pressure that theses youngsters have to deal with Is it normal to allow this or does the path the greatness require this,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3739400/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2018,"Excellent piece of acting performance, music and direction !",Whiplash is one of those films with a solid but very specific story The plot revolves around two central characters an aspiring drummer Andrew Miles Teller and his jazz mentor Fletcher J K Simmons Fletcher an explosive hard task master is one of those who believe that best musicians are nurtured only when they are pushed to perform beyond expectations and shall not settle for just good His way of teaching challenges Andrew emotionally mentally and physically almost to his breaking point The movie sticks to it s central plot and characters with no superfluous side plots and thus has the viewer s best attention to Andrew s hardships under Fletcher Both the characters are exceptionally well played out by the seasoned actors Since the movie is based on jazz the movie is full of it no expert here but kind of enjoyed it Fletcher s scoldings and arguments as a music teacher resemble more to those of a military commander Nevertheless some are very impactful and note worthy Like There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job While the methods of teaching music depicted in the movie are questionable especially in the field of art where expression and individuality are essence but movie does well to engage and amaze the audience The ending though might seem a little abrupt with unanswered viewer question of what happened next The movie also does seem to bring forth a crucial question of what real greatness is and does opinion and approval of certain people matter for feeling worthy Watch it for excellent film making story and acting performance by Miles and Simmons,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4239661/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2018,a very intense movie,Whiplash is one of the most intense movie I ve seen of all time the film is very well acted and written and directed the two main actors are great and the music is really good one of the main themes of the film is that negative reinforcement is a good thing and the film leaves many things to interpretation to whatever that a good thing or not the music post production syncs with the music played in the movie a lot well there are times where the music doesn t sync with the music in the movie the third act is very intense and one of the best third acts i ever seen J K Simmons character motivation is left interpretation it s not clear whatever he cares miles tellers character or not overall the movie is a very intense and it s funny and the music is really good,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4239183/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2015,The Sound of Drums,As an avid guitar player I vividly remember watching the amazing Steve Vai battle against Ralph Macchio during the simply superb guitar duel at the end of the 1986 film Crossroads No not the Britney Spears film Soon after watching it I was amazed to find out that Macchio was not entirely playing the guitar during the film and instead the music was performed by Ry Cooder yet to me the performance by Macchio was really happening in front of me Aside from the guitar duel Crossroads was pretty pants yet the knowledge that Macchio must have had intense training regarding where to place his fingers on the fret board when to strum and when to make Vai like facial expressions still amazes me to this day After watching Whiplash I felt and still feel the exact sense of sheer wonder I did the first time I saw that guitar duel yet unlike Crossroads Whiplash isn t pants In fact it s pretty much perfect The plot of the film focuses on Andre Neiman played by Miles Teller a 19 year old jazz drummer who is taken under the wing of notorious teacher Terrence Fletcher at renowned music school Shaffer Conservatory in order to fulfil his dreams of becoming a legend in musical history Much like Macchio in Crossroads Teller is flawless in attempting to present realistic and uncanny musical performances throughout the film and even goes one better by perfectly portraying a character who literally combines blood sweat and tears with total dedication into his musical ability Following him all the way is J K Simmons who surely must regard this as a career best performance with his portrayal of Fletcher characterised by one moment being undeniably cool and calm and then suddenly morphing into this all swearing larger than life musical monster who takes no prisoners accepts no excuses and will literally throw chairs at you for being slightly out of time with the rest of his band Aside from the two actors another winner in this film is surely Tom Cross whose editing within the film allows Teller s performance to propel into greatness and it is good to see that he has been recognised by the BAFTA s for such outstanding work which surely means an Oscar nomination is set to land at his feet Good job Obviously the soundtrack is brilliant with it already being on my wish list but what truly exceeds in this film is it s hard hitting nature in its attempt to show characters whose lives are not only engulfed by their passion and love for the music but will do almost anything to keep that feeling flowing evidenced during the very last performance within the film in which both Teller and Fletcher give a performance worthy of endless applause and shouts for just one more Overall Whiplash is a brilliant piece of cinema packed full with spot on performances not only from the actors but by editor Tom Cross a brilliant soundtrack and a sense of wonder which gripped me from start to finish Can I have an encore Overall Score 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3158874/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2022,My favourite film ever,This is simply a masterpiece of a film there is no other way to put it It is magnificent in every way from the camera views to the story as a whole The tension never fades in the film and you are left hanging on the edge of your seat from the getgo Somehow the director has made a college students drumming life an eventful thriller Simonns fully deserved that Oscar as it is possibly the best performance of anyone ever The way his character shifts from good to bad in your head just from the facial expressions and words that he uses is a miracle beyond my explanation I truly loved this and Miles Teller also managed to show me how one hobby could become your entire life If I could rate it 11 10 I would,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8765157/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2015,wow!,it was like fighting but with no weapons but with music loved it great movie and full of emotion a pity indeed that Mike Teller was not nominated On the other hand J K was so good that he mega deserved the Oscar more movies like this with different type of action go and see the movie please since we should see this type of movies that are definitely no mainstream ones A movie with no real action and just music is really something new and these days we need movies like that Other then comic con one not that i do not like them but there are too many of them I think this will never be a blockbuster but we have to support it since this was great for really movie goers and we should honor it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3192833/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2023,"Terrifying, not sure if I am a fan of the ending",I will never look at J K Simmons the same way again His portrayal of Terrence Fletcher was terrifying I hate all sorts of groups supposed to work by abuse and discipline and this movie portrays the problem well It has amazing acting amazing visuals and brings the intensity amazingly to you on the couch However I feel like the ending glorifies what Fletcher did Fletcher finally approves of Andrew and we see the two sharing a happy moment I had rather wisher Fletcher found his place in the world at the end Not because I wanted a happy ending but because this one made it feel like the message didn t come through,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9298988/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2015,Over-hyped but a Terrific Drama,Whiplash 2014 is a story of a wanted to be top jazz drummer and his teacher at the music college J K Simmons who played the role of ruthless strict master is terrific in his role I had a good 100 minute watch What made me to watch this film is its trailer perfectly cut impactive Watch the trailer and then the film only if you are interested to watch terrific performances The plot is a bit week Film didn t match the hype of critics at various film festivals yet it is fantastic See I thought Miles Teller was playing some real life character That is the reason I say it is Terrific I don t know what drives the jury of those film festivals We expected more out of it yes but only because of the showoff in the trailer ratings shown on posters Ironically its not showoff it is real,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3162136/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2015,Whiplash hit a high note,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3271799/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2023,Jazz! Music for musicians,I was eventually able to separate my hatred of jazz from the story by the third act As biased as I might be and as hyperbolic and contrived as this film feels in parts it was certainly enjoyable Performances impeccable lighting and photography in general For a fairly subdued movie on an action level certainly not dialogue it was incredibly engaging and the use of legitimate musicians was fantastic and appreciated I don t think this movie could ve been done without that level of authenticity Jazz in its traditional sense is a musician circle jerk Technical proficiency time signatures you can t tap a foot to standards recycled and reinterpreted It is music for lifers to nod across a ten foot stage at each other and say I see what you did there When mathematics meet traditions I am rarely moved as a music fan It doesn t mean there is no merit it s just more about the players than the audience That s why I think Whiplash is a fantastic representation of this music genre I am not a career musician nor did I attend a prestigious music school but I m guessing this movie is an embellished portrayal of that world Maybe not Either way the message I received was this it s not about expression it s not about conveying a feeling it s about perfection It is about such meticulous maniacal precision that any level of humanity and nuance is to be removed Fletcher was essentially John Voight from Varsity Blues just much more clever in the dressing down of his team There is a scene in the last act where Fletcher utters this is why jazz is dying To me this moment was the most impactful While the structure and beats of the story fit right in with any movie about sports or ballet or any insular world with rules and traditions it is essentially a study of perfection and ego Do you want to be the biggest fish in a small pond and look at the big lake with contempt because they just aren t up to your standards Maybe it s dying because no one outside of your world cares what your tempo is While JK Simmons if very much deserving of praise for his performance I think Miles Teller deserves a great nod as well They played off each other well and sold the nonstop tension well It took me almost ten years to see this Oscar darling and I m glad I finally got around to it I feel like it is a tinge overrated but definitely a solid entertaining movie,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9422163/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2015,An absolute realization of someone's real potential,By far the best 2014 movie I ve seen At first the movie looks like a typical story of an inspired student who wanted to do great with the help of his teacher But as it progresses the film takes you to something new something more beautiful than it already is Its little twist and turn will make your heart cry laugh and shout for joy all at the same time Miles Teller and J K Simmons were equally great and gave life to their characters I only remember Simmons as a funny guy in Spider Man movies and Juno so seeing him in this film is a 360 degrees turn of his usual role showing the actor s real potential As for Teller he was over shadowed with romantic comedies He had serious role once with Nicole Kidman in Rabbit Hole but this film should get him to wide range of roles in the future hopefully There are a lot of takeaways in Whiplash but perhaps the strongest of all is that you don t limit yourself Pushing someone beyond their capability is an absolute necessity as Fletcher Simmons character said in the film And that must have what writer director applied in making this film as it transpired to every take scene by scene,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3159951/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2016,Excellent !,I accidentally watched the movie by looking at the cover full of awards and I must say I was very impressed by it I m really not a music expert by any mean but the two main actors are seriously phenomenal and makes me think they are genuinely who they are playing Everything is just very amazing the actors are damn flawless Fletcher is so funny yet passionate those shoutings Andrew is truly great despite the fact that I don t really like Miles Teller the directing is also flawless by all means really just like the music in the whole movie the story is sufficiently immersive I recommend this movie to everyone who want to see a true masterpiece Already watched it two times and will again so the rewatch value is pretty high So anyways enjoy this epic movie You 95 sure won t regret watching it D,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3448478/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2018,incredible,I don t even know where to start First of all it is incredibly acted J K Simmons has one of the best supporting performances ever Because of this however the other actors don t get enough credit Miles Teller does a great a job and I honestly think he should have been nominated for an oscar he wasn t as good as J K Simmons though The story and dialogue are both really good most of us have had something we wanted to do and others will put us down This is too the extreme Terence Fletcher J K Simmons takes it to another level with Andrew Neiman Miles Teller he rips him apart The psychological battles between them The insults are almost like ones in a Tarantino movie and i mean that in a very good way The ending is very powerful butt the last maybe minute and the last second was a bit corny but that doesn t matter at all Even though this movie has been out for almost 4 years I still won t give too much away just watch it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4136998/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,Electrifying indeed.,This movie is nothing short of brilliant It is shot written and directed masterfully Same can be said about the score The actors deliver some of the most amazing performances I have seen in a movie J K Simmons towering presence is felt throughout the movie The pacing is brilliant and it keeps you engaged for every second The ending is amazing and some of the best I have ever seen One of the best movies I have seen and definitely a must watch A beautiful blend of brilliant cinematography acting writing directing and overall top tier movie making Really exited to see the other movies from director Damien Chazelle,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8086939/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2015,Interesting and original,In Italy despite its five Academy nomination its widely acclaimed reception and the debate has provoked all around the world Whiplash has been showed in 25 cinemas In ALL Italy For only one week No jokes That s why I had to hurry up yesterday night and go to see it before they took it away I think Whiplash is not exactly an innovation for cinema there is a load of similar movies which have been made about music competition et cetera But I think there are at least two point which are original for it and deserve a remarking The first one is naturally the character of Terrence Fletcher Modern projection of Hartman Sergeant in a conservatory it provides the most inspiring occasions for the screenplay and the most emotional meaning both tears and laughs moments The other one is the direction approach to the music scenes Such peculiarity is given by a claustrophobic editing and by inspiring close cuts on details sweat ears the drops of blood It was an innovative way to make the audience feel the same feelings and fear the same fears than the musician I have a new champion to cheer for at the Academy Awards,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3186764/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2021,A masterpiece,Brilliant story combined with real life drama giving us an unbelievable experience through the pain of becoming a great artist,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7183292/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2015,Where's the swing?,Two things make this movie worth watching the great acting by J K Simmons and the nice visuals and editing These not surprisingly received Oscar awards But I believe the movie fails entirely at its core music The story mixes Full Metal Jacket with Shine to represent a bullying music teacher mistreating young students in some supposedly reputable jazz music academy The whole focus is on the brilliant leading character who becomes obsessed with perfection and on his lunatic teacher pushing him harder and harder The big problem for me is the total lack of credibility Music as it is represented in this movie works like gymnastics where there exists some ideal perfect execution to be obtained by exercising more and more I think on the contrary that good music is more like dance where there is no perfect execution but rather it involves taste sensibility and different points of view An example of this is the song Caravan that is played multiple times throughout the movie As a fan of good ol jazz I have to say I never listened to a worse execution If you do not know what I am talking about please just search Duke Ellington Caravan on Youtube and then compare with this movie Caravan is NOT about super speed and perfect timing it is about mood swing and atmosphere all things that seem totally unknown to whoever run the music department for Whiplash If you are looking for a good movie about obsession for music I would definitely suggest Shine If you look for a movie about music as a way to obtain freedom and elevation of spirit and also some good laugh there s The Concert Or try Kieslowski s Trois couleurs Bleu Mo Better Blues or maybe the TV series Mozart in the Jungle Whiplash does not add anything interesting to the long list of films about music,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3342974/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2015,Full Metal Jacket In Band Class,Holy cow this movie works but only as a comedy I was in stitches throughout the film Full Metal Jacket Drill Instructor decides to run a music school and to teach band class Absolutely hilarious More blood than Full Metal Jacket as well mostly soaking up and covering drum kits The ironic bit is that it is not supposed to be a comedy Perhaps a satire of some sort On that level it works and delivers I m a jazz musician and attended arguably the best Jazz school in the country Berklee and this movie s treatment of jazz and its musicianship is nothing but comedic Under the tutelage of a vengeful demeaning sadistic sociopath who makes them practice until their fingers bleed and have nervous breakdowns and calls the Jewish student Hymie insults his mother calls out gay students etc Totally over the top On a sadder note the movie does not have the first clue about what jazz really is much less what it is like studying jazz and learning to play it proficiently The only explanation for anyone being in that particular school band is low self esteem and a masochism complex The father form the movie Juno plays the perfect bald Nazzi like sadist You have to see this film to believe it Highly recommended,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3180493/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2015,Obviously a remarkable movie,One of the most spectacular movie of the year is Whiplash obviously a remarkable one We can t call Miles Teller s acting performance as a perfect one but what he does deserves respects Teller is weak at representing feelings as an actor but what he does is exactly what Andrew tries to do so we catch all the challenges he faces What J K Simmons does is kicking ass of acting His performance is beyond movie time to time He creates a character that we believe we love we hate and we love again Everybody loves Jazz Jazz is attractive Jazz has created it s own culture exist with it and represent it It is a success story among this culture which is told in the movie but not in the usual way You need to compete with your mentor too for succeed as much as you do it with your competitors You need to give up your life for being better and be ready to face up to blood and sweat and tear It is a war that never been easy to win There are rises and falls But eventually legends are born out of the ashes Supporting stories are not so original but how they are told and how they are finalized are not usual at all such as a clich dinner table conversation the girl friend issue and rivalry for the place in orchestra Movie doesn t take any risk to express feelings that wants to pass on us and uses approved successful methods for it Characters are not solid and backgrounds are not clear We watch Andrew s fight through only one perspective and we are pushed to understand all his twists Fletcher seems to be focused only one purpose We see him in couple of scenes out of orchestra but this scenes are more confusing than identifying his character They are like puzzle pieces that we can t fix anywhere in his background Many pieces feel this way and we can t totally put ourselves in the story Besides everything Damien Chazelle proved himself as a promising director even at his 30 With all deficiencies he presents us a strong movie Some movies are as terrible as they are exaggerated but Whiplash deserves all attention it has and all excitement it brings,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3185497/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,It's about perspective,People will take away from this movie very different understandings based purely on individual perspective I think that is where the genius of this movie lies The message the movie gave me was aligned to the perspective and reasonings of Fletcher s character Driving people to greatness means pushing their limits in every way imaginable to find out what they re made of and to what extent they will go to and the hardships they will endure in order to achieve success Others will see it is an abuser and abusee relationship and that speaks to their perspective and mindset Anybody wanting to achieve greatness needs to find themselves a Fletcher But alas the new generations are too soft to endure this and as such we can only look forward to world full of mediocrity,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8086453/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2021,Wrong message,5 stars out of 5 for the performance and 0 stars for the message There is a huge difference between being strict and being encouraging your students to have more perseverance and that they should give a better work through more training and between being the person who is demeaning his students and insulting them and psychologically manipulating them in the aim that he is trying to get out the best of them Even if he gets at the end one unique successful student the amount of other students who have now psychological problems due to his approach cannot give him an execuse,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6743690/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2017,Bad Movie That Will be Supported by Musical Fans,A movies about a student and teacher relationship that is completely one sided This movie is completely uneventful and unrealistic Nothing actually happens in this movie other than yelling and redundant practicing We are given no background on why this is so important or what prestige this kid is ultimately following by taking abuse by this music teacher To think that a music teacher would ever lay hands on a student in this day in age is ridiculous If it set the context and setting I may believe it Other than that big deal Why this movie has such a high rating is beyond me This movie has motivated me to create a membership so that I can try and turn down the high rate it currently holds Thank you Whiplash,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3624840/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2018,breath taking,This movie is nothing but a breath taking magnificent master piece I actually decided to belong to the jazz circle in my uni because of this movie The most amazing thing to me is that the drummer the hero plays drums by himself no CG Even that there is the scene that the drummer bleeds from his hands and this is his real blood What I want to say is that how devoting this actor is I have never been bleeding from my hand practicing music But this actor did and his drumming skills are literally breath taking,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4236277/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2019,I like the music instructor,The music instructor s story looks hard cruel and only thinks of his reputation on the other hand he is only a perfectionist in his field and I really enjoy his character as an audiophile he can determine quality music it s not about how to teach who is too forced this is how totality in playing professional music the other side of this film is very interesting to bring up messages among other families other perceptions of society someone who underestimates music that actually plays music is not easy and very proud because it requires consistency dedication and very hard training,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4903324/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2015,Baffled,I cannot understand some of the reviews on here So what if you re a jazz player of 30 years or attend the best jazz school in the country what has that got to do with film making This is a FICTIONAL film If this were done to the letter of the law and J K Simmons played a character mirroring a real life music school instructor then it would be the most boring film ever It s called creative license It s what makes a film worth while going to see People expect way too much its almost embarrassing If a perfect jazz band is what you re after log onto itunes and buy one For Miles Teller although drumming from a young age to spend hours a day preparing for this movie and play this well as an amateur player it should be commended not criticized J K Simmons performance as Fletcher is Oscar worthy The editing and sound is phenomenal and credit to all other members of the band It might not be perfect musically although not being a professional like some reviewers on here I cannot comment it seems but to my ears its a masterpiece and as this is a film and not a jazz album I am judging it on how it plays as a film Which to me is sensational I have watched the final scene about 15 times and am still mesmerized by it A huge thumbs up from me and credit to Damien Chazelle on persevering to get this made into a feature form a short 10 10 from me,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3186870/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2015,The Best Film of 2014,Whiplash is probably my favourite film from 2014 it was a 2015 release here in the UK but that s because of the way the award season works No other film from last year drew me in and put me on the edge of my seat the way this film did It is extremely well written directed and edited Damien Chazelle did a terrific job at making me feel the tension and anxiety that Andrew felt The way Chazelle angled and moved the camera around was a bit unusual but it made it feel like that there was someone with a unique and clear voice behind this film and directing it with passion which drew me in even closer Chazelle is clearly a writer director to watch out for in the future But when talking about this film you cannot forget the performances Miles Teller is a great as Andrew He brings to the character the necessary drive and sociopathy but not too much need to make him interesting and watchable The side characters are also great In particular Andrew s dad and Nicole Andrew s girlfriend were characters we do not spend a lot of time with but are well written and well acted enough that they feel like real people who we like spending time with However the real star of the film is J K Simmons who gives a standout performance as Terence Fletcher who looms over Andrew throughout the film Simmons does a magnificent job at bringing the character to life and making him monstrous intimidating and surprisingly funny all at once He is going to win the Oscar And of course there s the finale The climax is probably one of the best scenes in a film that I have seen in a long time This is where Damien Chazelle excels as both a writer and a director It is a non stop thrill ride that it is incredibly nerve racking It is also brilliantly shot and edited I don t think I have ever been more entranced by a film than this ending If you have not already seen Whiplash I highly recommend that you seek it out no matter how far the nearest cinema showing it is Believe me it is worth the hype http boxd it 4SGHF,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3168628/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2023,Breathtaking. Masterpiece,This movie has Damien Chazelle s name everywhere It s a well done and very calculated movie From color camera angles to actors places and specially the music It invites us or at least to me to start listening to some Jazz But that s the second message The first main and most important message it s about obsession and how it can turn against the obsessed Main characters it s a common 19 year old guy from the west coast that s just trying to get a name through music but faces some challenges that change his perspective about what he wants to do and what he s willing to risk to get that Teaches about severe teachers and how the old teaching schools method can affect young people And the end is GREAT,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9351664/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2015,Holly mother!! new favorite movie of 2014!!!,Simply amazing i love everything about this movie The director obviously had a musical back ground and understood exactly what was going on musically as the scenes were shot to the music The tone was great Acting was great A definite must watch and my personal pick for best picture although i doubt it will actually win cries softly to self Miles teller is a great rising star and i look forward to seeing him in other things although I m not sure how Fantastic 4 will go over just yet as it has received almost no publicity other than one decent trailer Any way whiplash great movie I am super conservative with my 10 10 ratings and i have only given about 4 movies that rating out of the 426 I ve watched and whiplash definitely earned it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3185647/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2015,A drumming movie!,My run to the Oscar continues with a movie not released yet in Italy so I haven t heard about it before the nominations The plot doesn t stimulate my curiosity and the main theme looks not very appropriate for a film with 5 nominations So I started Whiplash without knowing what to expect to I have to admit that this is the first candidate movie that awake something more than a cold appreciation in me It is a fantastic mix of music and images with a drumming rhythm that takes the spectator with the eyes on the screen for all the time This dynamic rhythm is reflected also in the acting and in the psychological fight between the two main characters I loved the meanness of J K Simmons remembering me the atmosphere of Full metal jacket In conclusion I found Whiplash a brilliant movie very entertaining and engaging,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3163935/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2015,A Bic Mac served on a Gold platter,I ll start by saying that I enjoyed the movie and in a entertainment popcorn kind of way It has great music nice cinematography and the actors were good taking into consideration of what was asked them to do But this is about it which sometimes is plenty taking into consideration the amount of crap movies that are out there The problem resides on this film being pretentious and flat with not possible depth of it s message in an artistic sense and let s not even go for morale The film s plot is unrealistic in the way the The teacher Fletcher behaves in this particular set up being incoherent in the way he reacts at certain points of the movie Also the way the students react to him or not react in this case being mere puppets That said there is no way in the slightest possible way that this story could be convincing I wont get into details not to create any spoilers One might argue that it is an allegory of reality but that needs to be presented with some real start point which is completely non existent and it would serve a purpose to convey a strong message which does not exists and if it intended to exist it is confusing as hell being a prick pays off or doesn t Does talent only flourishes under extreme and sadistic situations or not Is being professional and always have the music as the main core the answer or your own macho ego should prevail The secondary characters are completely non existing and should not be there to begin with I found this movie no different from a 80s Reagan movie Van Dame and alike only more eye brow and full of nasty clich s,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3184809/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2015,No room for imperfection,I watched this movie last week and Im still thinking about it Unrelenting overbearing narcissistic for both characters the student drummer and his insecure driven instructor It reminds me of the days I spent at boarding school where some of the masters there were just as unforgiving for any mistake and took you down as far as you could go As far as the story carries it is also a supremely done allegory The prot g in this case a young man gaining experience in the face of continual criticism by the teacher The teacher though is way beyond normal he seeks to destroy any confidence that he may have even if the student knows he s good enough But its not enough to be just good enough The young student knowing that he can outperform if given the chance while his unbalanced instructor is determined to somehow bring out the excellence demanded by the medium of music in this case Jazz There are no words of encouragement only extreme criticism and denigration What purpose it serves to do that kind of instruction can only make you or break you to the point of self despising The movie is very well played well acted and will keep you thinking about it for a long time,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3200689/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2015,Intense but somehow incomplete,As a display of emotional intensity and passion for musical excellence I can t recall a better example than Whiplash It s hard to turn away from the on screen drama but it s not always easy to watch As a non musician I can t really relate to the discipline maintained and the pain that the chief protagonist is willing to go through but it is no less believable The mentor teacher is a at once a beast and a proponent of tough love My only frustration is that there is no redemption no justice no perspective at least none that my value system can recognise There is only continuance of obsession from one generation to the next So a little unsatisfying but well worth the time spent nonetheless Exhausting,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3179516/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2021,You probably need to like jazz.,I sat all the way through this as I like to finish films in case I m judging the start harshly and missing a classic After 40 minutes I started looking up reviews which is never a good sign but as they were so positive I was expecting the film to really pick up the pace Unfortunately it was more of the same with characters I couldn t relate to or have empathy for I love music films but this did nothing for me personally,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6516951/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2014,Raging Bull on drums!,The slow pace of a drum beat fills the screen Then it gradually gets louder and faster until you are grabbing the arms of your chair in anticipation as if you were riding to the top of a roller coaster All of the sudden the title card comes up and the next hour and forty minutes becomes a hair standing wide eyed look at two people pushing beyond the boundaries of talent and mentorship The film is Whiplash the story of an overly ambitious drum major Miles Teller at the Shaffer Conservatory of Music in New York who is chosen to play for the Conservatory band under the leadership of a tyrannical conductor J K Simmons and will go beyond any ethical code of conduct to turn his student into the next jazz virtuoso The performances in this movie are flat out amazing Miles Teller was fifteen when he started playing the drums and practiced 4 hours a day to prepare for the movie which was shot in a period of 19 days Teller s passion and drive as a drummer and actor are shown in full view in his performance as Andrew a musician who will sacrifice his blood sweat and tears until it pours out over the drums J K Simmons an actor who has been type casted for his comedic yet sympathetic warmth gives the performance of his career as Fletcher an instructor so sadistic that he would make R Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket look like an agony aunt Both Simmons and Teller clash on the screen like Ali and Foreman in the ring or Ginger Baker and Elvin Jones on the drums Witten and directed by Damien Chazelle he drew from his own experiences as a high school student in a jazz ensemble group in which his band instructor was a force not to be reckoned with His static camera catches the energy and emotional swings with such unpredictability you would think it was a documentary At first glance you might think of this movie as Rocky with drums but if anything it draws comparisons to Raging Bull from soaking a clenched bloody fist into a bucket of ice after an intense drumming session to the dilemma of how one functions off the drum kit when the band stops playing If you re looking for a film that pulls sympathetic punches in the style of Fame Mr Holland s Opus or an agonizing episode of Glee take a hike Whiplash is a film that cuts deep with an intense and visceral edge that will make your jaw drop with amazement,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3122196/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2020,"If jazz sounds like noise to you, avoid this film.",The synopsis of the film mentions jazz band but I must emphasise how jazz heavy and drum heavy the movie is The performances were solid and story centers around a young man s obsession with playing the drums with a very angry potty mouthed conductor at the helm of a high school band but it s still jazz It s like white noise to me so that detracts from acting and becomes purgatory,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6406668/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2023,"The Rhythm of Success: ""Whiplash"" Drums up a Masterpiece",The film is a masterclass in filmmaking showcasing Chazelle s ability to create tension and suspense through both the visual and audio aspects of the film The cinematography is stunning with the camera movements and angles adding to the overall intensity of the movie The music in Whiplash is also a standout aspect of the film with the jazz music adding to the energy and intensity of the story The film s editing is also noteworthy as it expertly cuts between the musical performances and the dramatic tension between the characters One of the most impressive things about Whiplash is how it manages to turn the simple act of playing music into a high stakes high drama affair The movie is able to convey the intense pressure that musicians face in a way that feels visceral and real The relationship between Teller s character Andrew and Simmons character Fletcher is at the center of the film and it is a complex and fascinating one At times it seems like Fletcher is pushing Andrew to be his best self but at other times it is clear that he is pushing him to the point of breaking The tension between the two characters is what drives the film forward and both Teller and Simmons give incredible performances in their roles The film also touches on some interesting themes such as the idea of perfectionism and the sacrifices that people make in pursuit of greatness It raises questions about whether the pursuit of excellence is worth the cost and whether there is a point at which ambition becomes toxic The editing in Whiplash is also a standout aspect of the film The movie s editor Tom Cross won an Academy Award for his work on the film The editing is particularly effective during the music performances where it is able to capture the energy and excitement of the music while also conveying the intense concentration of the musicians The rapid cuts and close ups on the instruments and the performers faces add to the sense of urgency and tension Additionally the editing is used to great effect in the film s climactic scene where it helps to build suspense and create a sense of chaos Overall the editing in Whiplash is a key component of the film s success and it is a testament to the skill of the movie s editor and director Finally it s worth mentioning that the film s climax is absolutely electrifying I won t spoil anything but suffice it to say that it is one of the most thrilling and memorable scenes in recent cinema history The tension that has been building throughout the film comes to a head in a way that is both satisfying and shocking It s the kind of scene that will stick with you long after the movie is over,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8903421/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2014,The journey to pursuing your passions and then some.,Since hearing all the positive feedback this film had received from Sundance and the Toronto Film Festival I had my hopes of checking out Whiplash After my first viewing at my local art house theater Whiplash didn t just met my initial expectations but it also surpassed them by a mile This film contains elements you would expect from a typical musical film and then some First of all the writing by Damien Chazelle showcases a surprisingly excellent screenplay from a sophomoric director Based off of Chazelle s personal experiences he displays an electrifying and intense story which follows college freshman Andrew who is pursuing to be world class jazz drummer who ends up getting more than what he initially bargained for The pacing is solid with enough going on to keep the plot moving the dialogue is engaging yet rich with tension and the direction by Chazelle is simply top notch Of course the biggest praise Whiplash gets on top of it s enthralling screenplay comes from the two main leads played by Miles Teller and J K Simmons Of all the films that Miles Teller has stared in this is hands down his greatest performance to date and boy this guy can drum Teller s performance as Andrew captures the raw passion and pain that his character goes through and its as powerful as acting performance can get Lets not also forget the intimidating J K Simmons as Andrew s music instructor Terence Fletcher Simmons simply gives out a phenomenal performance and he just has an astonishing screen presence every time his character comes to life Fletcher is a character you can hate yet sympathize with at the same time which already a challenge to pull off by any means The cinematography for this amazing film is also executed in a stylish fashion bringing out the raw intensity of the story onto the big screen Plus the tight cut editing adds icing to the cake when bringing out the rich tension throughout every musical performance Speaking of music the lavish amount of jazz and swing just makes this excellent work of cinema that more entertaining to watch and it is a soundtrack worth multiple listening sessions I simply cannot praise Whiplash enough than I had already did in this review and I highly urge each and every one of you to seek out this excellent work of film making whenever it comes to a theater near you With a brilliant script phenomenal performances great camera work top notch editing and some amazing music Whiplash is one of the best movies of 2014 and will probably end up being one of my personal favorites Do yourself a huge favor see Whiplash for yourself and you will guaranteed to leave this film more than satisfied,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3112449/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2017,Great but i have tiny nitpicks,Whiplash is about a young man who wants to be a drummer but when he gets moved to a higher class the teacher is a bully who will do anything to his students to get a good show The teacher is played by J K Simons who is absolutely incredible His performance is intense and will have you fearing for the students but at times he can also be so cruel that its funny That might sound like a bad thing but it definitely isn t the music is also really good and you got see the young man played by Miles Teller get better at drumming as the film went along Miles Teller also gave a very great performance most of the time he was on screen I forgot he was acting he was so realistic There were lots of shots of him drumming were it focused on his face and you could see how much he wanted to be the best drummer ever no matter what Although Miles Teller gave a very great performance after the film had ended i didn t really feel i knew a lot about who his character except that he wanted to be a drummer that may have been intentional to try and show that he didn t want anything but to be a drummer but I felt that his character wasn t all that fleshed out Also there was a love interest in the beginning of the film who was really good but she was only in about two scenes and i wanted to see more of her Also and this is a really small nitpick there s a dinner scene in the film that was probably my favorite scene in the film but it was way to short and I wanted it to be longer I recommend this film cause it has amazing performances and is also incredibly well directed and well shot,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3717139/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2015,Raw Visceral Emotion,I now have a new addition to my top 10 favorite movies of all time I actually had to make an IMDb account so I could rate this film because to not rate this film would be considered in my eyes utter sacrilege It s lunacy to classify this movie as merely a Drama and a Musical but I understand it fits well into those neat little boxes it s got music and it s got drama But the experience of watching this movie the raw visceral emotions this movie unwittingly rips out of you the undeniable fact that it will land you right on the edge of your seat filled to the brim with hope and fear and anxiety and hatred and wishing it will never end right up until the very second it does this film not only demands to be categorized as a thriller but a thriller that deserves a 10 star rating To not experience this movie is to proclaim oneself cinematically ignorant and forever unworthy of any seat in the theater Bravo,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3166836/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2020,Very unrealistic.,Do not get me wrong I watched the movie till the very end because was intrigued what will happen next till the very end The thing is despite the good acting the movie is a pure kind of overly dramatized to feed the thirst of the audience taste fiction that made the majority of viewers take it for serious The way the story being leaves an absolutely wrong impression on the world of making music and the musicians at all depicting them as a kind of ambitious ruthless professionals whose brutality knows no limits thus making an offence to the ones dedicated their whole life to the art Just give me a big fat brake people,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6128723/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2015,"A triumph! No, really. Whiplash literally is.",Gut wrenching Intense At times uncomfortable At times triumphant This is what you can expect from Whiplash If you find yourself easily put in the shoes of sympathetic characters then be prepared This may be an emotional ride J K Simmons plays Fletcher a music professor at a highly regarded music school think Juliard who is very passionate about his work Andrew s Miles Teller talent on the drums soon catches the renowned teacher s eye and he is brought into an elite class of jazz musicians But Andrew couldn t have predicted the price his new mentor will expect for this honor Simmons is more often seen in comedic roles than not but that doesn t stop him from owning the show here as the antagonist He s lean and he s mean Teller is relatively new to the game yet he disappears into the depressed yet willful introvert that is Andrew and shares the screen well with the more seasoned Simmons Paul Riser of Mad About You fame makes a return to cinema here as Andrew s father and Melissa Benoist of Glee fame makes her big screen debut as a love interest enjoyable performances by both If you ve ever felt singled out by a superior or striven for the impossible you just may connect with this movie and be thankful for the ride,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3177677/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2022,Weighing greatness against happiness,The other reviews here do a fantastic job of highlighting the elements that make Whiplash a good film among them excellent acting and a well paced and plotted screenplay Rather than repeat what others have said let me draw out a philosophical message from the film What is the point of life One common answer is to be happy and to flourish Another common answer is to lessen the suffering and increase the happiness of others Friedriech Nietzsche had another perspective For Nietzsche the point of human life is greatness It doesn t matter if Genghis Khan was cruel and left destruction and suffering wherever he went He was also free and powerful and the author of a great legacy His conquests generated an empire that continued a hundred years after his death Better to have all the suffering death and tears rather than lose the greatness of one Genghis Khan This view is abhorrent on its face Should we lionize murderous villains like Stalin or Idi Amin because they were undeniably powerful and free And yet Whiplash makes an insidious case for doing just that The film makes an argument for accepting suffering in the pursuit of greatness even the suffering of innocents if it is required to make extraordinary someone with the requisite ability and drive From the beginning of the film the band leader Fletcher brutally abuses his young proteges If his actions cause most of the young musicians to suffer deeply that is the price required for the production of greatness If we don t agree with him by the end of the film at least we can see the draw of his position Whiplash makes a viewer question her common sense morals Is it always good to decrease the suffering of fellow human beings Forcing the observer to view the world in a new way is what makes Whiplash not just a good film but a great work of art,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8752721/?ref_=tt_urv

Then you'll love him,What a fantastic movie Whether you love Jazz or not it s brilliant The two main characters will draw you in from the start You will undoubtedly root for Miles Teller s character the aspiring musician and despise J K Simmons the villainous music professor By the end of the film you ll love them both J K Simmons does a fantastic job as the music composer instructor pushing his musicians to the the limits of their talents Albeit a quite unorthodox method With today s films being mostly poorly written action films horror movies and rewritten tales from the past it is refreshing to watch something that draws you into the story Any time you can watch a film be emotionally and excitedly pulled down the path the actors are doing what few can do Don t miss this It is one you ll tell your friends about,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3163130/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2015,"A stunning, mindful, witty and directorial debut from Chazelle!",For me it comes down to the writing and directing A film has got to have focus and it has to have that real ness to it it s got it The film also has a witty and funny aspect to it I definitely saw and heard some humour And I won t lie there are a lot of tense scenes too It s quite the debut from Chazelle and in my opinion he can and will go down as one of the greats in the film industry and yes Both as a screenwriter writer and director I cannot wait to see what Chazelle delivers next Do yourself a favour and buy this movie It s out now in Blu Ray DVD as I type this and you will not regret it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3213433/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2015,This is one movie that you must watch this year!,I had never quite expected Whiplash to be a strong and independent film it took me by surprise and swept me off the floor The movie is one of the boldest in screenplay and acting Miles Teller plays the character of a dreamy but perseverant drummer His acting was so good on screen because for a moment there I forgot that I was watching a movie and got involved in his character so much I could feel his pain his loss and his anger to excel JK Simmons is a truly epic in this movie Literally I couldn t take my eyes off him With an exceedingly true portrayal of an abusive teacher and his motive to find the next Charlie Parker JK Simmons pulled off one of the best roles off all time and definitely the best in his career Whiplash never misses the beat there isn t a single moment wasted and every second feels packed with visual drama,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3310508/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2016,Best Film of 2014 and the 2015 Oscars in my opinion,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3431417/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2019,the last ten minutes,This is about a teen drum player and his coach at his music college The guy is picked up as core player in the coach s jazz band but he struggles with tough practice One word which describes this movie would be emotional I think Overall both the lead character and the coach tell their emotion clearly through words facial expression or choice they make Sometimes it is aggressive but it shows how they both are serious about playing jazz which makes me be moved The part I love in this movie the most is the last ten minutes In that scene the lead character plays the drum solo and the coach conducts it Although there is no dialogue I think that it tells everything in the movie and I lobe the ending with this wonderful scene,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4695621/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2015,Boss Drum,Shaffer Conservatory Of Music is not only the best music school in New York but it s the best in America Student Miles Teller newly arrived not only wants to succeed but wants to become one of the all time great jazz drummers He gets his opportunity when he s personally auditioned by teacher J K Simmons and invited to join the school s flagship jazz orchestra Getting in was hard staying in the orchestra proves to be almost impossible Simmons is a ruthless taskmaster throwing insults and chairs if anyone can t achieve overachieve his exacting standards Keep up or get out You want fame Well fame costs and here is where Teller starts paying not only in sweat but in tears blood and his belief in himself Despite a supporting cast there are really only two characters in this film Teller s eager to please student and J K Simmons brutally unsympathetic professor It s the back and forth between these two personalities that gives WHIPLASH its energy its snap its tension Miles Teller excels in his role his character having to endure euphoric heights and soul destroying lows often in the same scene Teller is also an accomplished drummer in his own right and so gives his part the musical credibility it needs However with due respect to Teller this is Simmons film He dominates every scene as the sadistic Fletcher viciously tearing into his students with cutting imaginative insults Yet although he does monstrous things Fletcher is no monster Scriptwriter Damien Chazelle who also directs takes care to ensure Fletcher is not your run of the mill one dimensional hard bastard There are many different shades to the character light as well as dark and Simmons blends them into a convincing believable character You may hate the guy but he s no cartoon Instead feel sorry for Robert Duvall Ethan Hawke Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo There is no way on earth that the Best Supporting Actor Oscar is going anywhere else other than J K Simmons shelf next month It s a surprise to note that accomplished as it is this is only the second film from Chazelle It s a remarkably disciplined piece of work tight as a drum with no unnecessary subplots to distract our focus on the two leading characters There s the kind of creative spark running through WHIPLASH that you find in the best of Scorcese s films Imaginative camera work Razor sharp editing Smart salty dialogue There s a bold confidence to WHIPLASH that never lets up and keeps you hooked As well as script acting and direction a film like WHIPLASH stands or falls on the quality of its soundtrack fortunately the choice of jazz classics and Justin Hurwitz s score are both exemplary There s a danger some will be put off by the j word Don t be Yes jazz runs through the film in many ways its the film s third character but it s great jazz It s sure as hell not the anonymous muzak that masquerades as jazz in bars and lifts around the country This is the real deal Fired up red in tooth and claw and hungry for your attention A terrific start to the movie year,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164092/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2015,Amazing! Hardcore Jazz Story,I was not sure I wanted to watch this after reading the reviews about the abusive teacher but after seeing the trailer I must admit I laughed despite myself at the cruel commentary to the student in that short example Certainly there s more to come if you decide to see the film but it isn t the main issue I have in fact experienced teaching that comes pretty close in my junior high days so it s not all that fictional If you do decide to watch Whiplash I can only say it was intensely amazing from start to finish Starts and ends on a Jazzcore drum roll and knocks you around emotionally for the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes time Many will take offense at the actions of the not necessarily likable characters but it s the music and the feeling of passion that will remain with you by the time the credits roll I think it is not intended to make a statement on the kind of people you see portrayed in the movie it s more about asking questions about ambition in life What motivates you to do certain things If you just sit back and let the story flow you will just realize that this is a movie like no other Sure at it s core it has Faustian overtones and classic themes of struggling for success against all odds but never has it been visually and musically so well presented as in this movie Even the title is perfect Whiplash truly is a performance of a lifetime for all involved and I am happy to have been able to experience it Beat Out That Rhythm On A Drum has taken on new meaning after witnessing this stunning cinematic masterpiece,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172661/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,Intense,The acting can t be faulted the direction is stunning and the message really depends on what you think success is and what are acceptable sacrifices to be great I think the point is to dramatize that question so it sticks in the mind The beginning starts as any dreamer story a young drummer who wants to be counted among the great jazz musicians His interest verges on obsession as is easy to do when you are 19 Every American 19 year old thinks that being eternally remembered is the pinnacle of achievement and they want it He s at a conservatory where he is able to impress the top conductor who instructs an elite band in the first few minutes of the film This sets up the relationship very quickly It devolves from there First it s unrealistic to say the least but the director doesn t even try to ground it in reality There s few other interactions but between Andrew Neiman and Terrance Fletcher or between Andrew and his drumset There s hardly any other teachers present the students are basically background furniture The lighting feels intimate and psychological on purpose This is a film about inner conflict It s about losing yourself to obsession with perfection and artistic glory It s about the moral lines you cross when you can t imagine not being great The jazz rehearsals are mechanical and soulless which as a jazz lover I found as terrifying and engrossing in mood to the acting of both Simons and Teller The music sets the scene Jazz is about partnership and balance it s about the fine tuned knack for improvisation and instinct It s not about whatever is going on here There s a sense of narrow mindedness that overwhelms the soul That s the tone that the story takes us The acting is as good as gets Award winning I felt the aura of powerful emotion and psychological tension radiating from the two leads And it wasn t blunt but incredibly nuanced They made the film as complex as it was They made the values they espouse a legitimate question As the humanity slips away from young Neiman there is a sense of uneasiness and by the climax crisis literally crashes in both in inner and outer manifestion The ending is powerful and it s because it s enigmatic enough to hold the question of the film in tension You decide what s worth it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6921039/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2022,"Blood, sweat, and tears",Attempt 2 at writing this review This film does everything almost perfectly The acting the music the mood the sets and the peak of it all the filmography which is the best I ve ever seen I cried out of the intensity during this film I stopped breathing a few times and got chills in many scenes It feels like we re peering right into the main protagonist Andrew Neemans head as we experience every feeling of happiness sadness betrayal pain stress and anger as he progresses through this music program And this is undoubtedly miles tellers best performance which is saying alot And the antagonist being Terrence Fletcher is done incredibly well And he isn t even really the antagonist ultimately but he does kind of play the role of that And this is jk Simmons best role which is also saying alot two brilliant actors doing the performance of a lifetime all in the 19 days this movie took to film You can feel the menacing and even terrifying feeling that Fletcher gives off in all his scenes he needs to Everyone on the band is terrified of him and are under so much stress being in And you can feel that in everyone all the actors here are good which alot of them aren t even actors just musicians which is far more impressive This movie is very focused on Neemans story and his feelings throughout All the ups and downs feel so real it feels like this is actually a real event happening Infront of you which adds so much to all the pressure With this the camera does the perfect job with main focus of what Neemans focus is If he s unstable or in a bad state the camera reflects that and adds to all the tension If he s doing well it is stable The close ups are perfect for the traditional film style and not done at any point that it shouldn t be And it uses them to indicate either intimacy or claustrophobia And anxiety within that The music also helps paint these feelings even being able to just use the music he s supposed to be practicing to make a scenes mood be more effective This film is very engaging and I was on the edge the whole time Neeman as a character is incredibly relatable to me and helps my total understanding of him But even with that I think anyone could watch this and understand everything about his feelings then and at that moment The soundtrack is incredible and that s due to it being a music film Everything leading up to the first climax is incredible and I love it s close to immediate drop off To whats the next stage of Andrews life which is unfulfilling And that leads to one of the most incredible final scenes of a movie that makes everything about it all the stress all the anxiety all the blood sweat and tears feel worth it Which at this time you also feel Terrence as a better character in his kindness even if that may be fake The sets are great I never felt like it wasn t where it was saying Which isn t hard it doesn t have a range of areas that s hard or expensive to replicate but still they re great And the makeup is as good as needed It s incredible this film was only 3 million dollars in 2014 I love the symbolism of the title it does feel like emotional whiplash at times And also tying that into the song whiplash Also this movie feels like 15 minutes every 3 it feels so tense it makes time pass slower It used every second effectively with a pretty short runtime of only 1hr 46 Overall rating for me is a 9 6 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8257880/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2022,The wildest ride of a film you'll ever experience,This movie concludes in what it possibly the best way you re ever likely to see The entire movie is a psychological rollercoaster about a mental breakdown while also being about music an ensemble jazz social life expectations from family love need I say more It s amazing how concepts for movies can be so rudimentary yet be so absolutely vigorous vivid and flowing with emotion I frankly can t believe JK Simmons can be both this crazy drill sergeant and JJ Jameson His acting knows no bounds and there s a reason he won his Oscar For once Hollywood hasn t spared us from the nitty gritty and has given us probably the best antagonist I ve ever seen in a film although I ve only recently got into them But let s not discredit the main man either he was absolutely brilliant depicting a suburban academic white male beautifully Watch this movie There is nothing I can possibly fault in it remotely,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7798467/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2015,An endlessly exciting and original cinematic experience which will leave you buzzing like a taut snare.,For a sizeable chunk of the film s running time aspiring jazz drummer Andrew Neiman Miles Teller is caked in his own sweat and blood battered and bruised from hours and hours of incessant practise his blood drips onto the skin of the snare and the cymbals are littered with beads of sweat his sweat Perhaps this is the best way of describing the film by no means perfect but uncompromisingly passionate and energetic I won t be too detailed in explaining what happens over the course of the drama as the film revels in its unpredictability Besides you probably know the premise anyway Just in case Whiplash follows first year Shaffer Conservatoire student Andrew Neiman Teller in his quest for drumming supremacy On the way he encounters big band big shot Terence Fletcher JK Simmons who recruits him as a drummer for his formidable studio band What then plays out is almost a battle of wits with Neimen building up immunity to Fletcher s foul mouthed tirades and Fletcher increasingly being provoked intentionally or otherwise by Neimen s ever increasing confidence It portrays the teacher pupil relationship as one of insurmountable hostility rather than encouragement and JK Simmons clearly relishes the opportunity to let rip some R Lee Ermey style ranting If there are any weaknesses it s that first time writer director Damien Chazelle seems more comfortable with the musical set pieces than at the human interaction though even then a meeting between Neimen and love interest Nicole Melissa Benoist is painfully well realised as is a family dinner scene Clearly the film has no qualms with admitting that ultimately it is all about these moments of musical mayhem and what wonderful moments they are shot and edited with a ruthless and ferocious energy It s an endlessly exciting and original cinematic experience which will leave you buzzing like a taut snare BLOG  thepictureinner wordpress com,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164719/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2015,A good kind of stressful,I m fresh from seeing the movie and I have to say this movie is a masterpiece The directing is well done and keeps you tense when needed and vice versa The acting is superb JK Simmons deserves the Oscar for best supporting actor no doubt Miles Teller gave a complete out of nowhere performance proving himself to be an actor this generation will know The writing was perfect Nothing else to say The movie keeps going places you don t think are gonna happen and always keeps you guessing what s gonna happen next The one fault I can find with the movie is that a storyline in the movie doesn t really go anywhere and didn t get the closure I feel it deserved but it did not impact the movie as a whole and even then the storyline was very minor throughout the movie This is a must watch,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3153666/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2023,It was so bad,This movie was okay until the end Throughout the movie it was mildly engaging but not overall a good movie The ending was completely unsatisfactory as there was no real resolution so the conflict was left undisputed Instead of there being retribution from the character who was attacked ridiculed and threatened throughout the entire movie the two teamed up Nobody wants to see a movie where everyone is happy in the end we don t live in a fairytale Overall if I could rate this movie less I would but sadly I cannot Would not recommend to anyone and I can see how it got it s 3 academy awards,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9009557/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2015,An aspiring/must-watch film!,To begin with the interpretation of J K Simmon s as well as Miles Teller s was astonishing Moreover the scenario made me hold my breath until the last minute of the film It was original and so aspiring Furthermore it is an absolutely aspiring and encouraging film that everybody must see It gives you strength and teaches you that if you really work and focus on something you want to achieve you will achieve it and your hard work will be rewarded Finally the soundtrack and the music during the film is great and it gave me the opportunity to look for further information and learn about jazz music and its musicians,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3234290/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2017,Greatness. Is it worth it?,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3778815/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,"The plot is great, but I expected more from the end",The movie story catches you as Andrew works so hard to accomplish his goals But eventually it becomes an obsession and starts to consume all the aspects of his life That s when the movie starts to become so ugly I don t know whether the film wants to criticize or glamorize Andrew s behavior I have a mixed feeling on that Maybe be the idea of seeing someone wearing out your personal life family friends on behalf of the career ruined the film for me It is the portrait of an anxious person who wants to be on the top as fast as possible without enjoying the learning process Or maybe it is just a 21 century portrait It is sad,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6217618/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2017,A Magnifying Glass on one extreme aspect of dedication,Dedication is just one part of being a musician or being anything for that matter This movie zooms in and exaggerates just that one aspect It fools you into feeling like you are in a version of reality because it is so intense but it s like having blinders on There s more to being a musician obviously The bad reviews seem to be from people who expected reality or who believed the intent was to depict reality and the writers didn t know the difference It s Hollywood not a documentary Something tells me the writers knew exactly what they were doing It s very well done Expect an intense ride not an all encompassing view on life,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3770143/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2023,Cinematic masterpiece directed by Damien Chazelle,J K Simmons absolutely nailed his role and I can t even find the right words to describe how incredibly well he portrayed Terence Fletcher Undoubtedly one of his finest performances in his career And let me tell you about the cinematography oh my The camera movements and shots were just so darn beautiful and satisfying to watch When I talk about clean and unique cinematography this is precisely what I mean The focus and bokeh were also top notch The editing danced in harmony with the music and those shots oh boy I can t express enough how much I love the editing and the way the color grading was handled The whole process the artistry behind it that s the very essence of art This movie it s the embodiment of art You should really go watch it and experience it for yourself Trust me this movie is worth your time regardless of whether you re into orchestral jazz music or even if you don t play an instrument you ll thoroughly enjoy this film You know many films leave you hanging with open endings leaving you wondering what would ve really happened next But here let me assure you it s different The open ending in this film was perfect Absolutely flawless Now the most important thing I wouldn t be praising this movie as much as I am right now if the story wouldn t be exceptional Well since you re still here reading my review You can probably guess how highly I regard this piece The story and the two main characters are brilliantly developed Whiplash is a thought provoking work of art that will stay with me for a lifetime no doubt about it You ll probably think the same about this movie after you ve watched it believe me,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9304219/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2023,I want to be a Drummer!!!,Whiplash This movie tells the story of a young drummer who studies First year in the best musical school of USA His dream is to become one of the best drummers and he will work very hard to achieve it In the institute the protagonist will met with Fletcher a great musician but an obsessive teacher The movie goes to what is important it Varely talks about other things than the drums Just the necessary to get some context of how the protagonist s professional carrer that he tries to achieve affects on his social life The main actors performances are great but the best one is obviously J K Simmons who you should know for being J Jonha Jameson in Spiderman but now he has to take a completely different role and he manages to do it perfectly because this professor is very scary He affirmed this after winning the Oscar Prize to the best supporting actor with this movie The genre of this film is not a musical if you were wondering about it This movie has some excellent sparks of comedy which make this movie very entertaining 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8888518/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2016,"Worth to watch, over and over again.",The way the movie connects with us is just delightful It s different from all the movies I have watched and I will watch probably That s why it s worth to watch over and over again I ve already seen it 3 times I definitely recommend it to everyone It s a movie I d watch both alone and with friends or my family Sometimes one needs to be alone and think by himself herself because his her close ones lowered his her motivation And this is a movie just for that It just makes you gain your motivation again and makes you feel that you can accomplish anything in this world if you want enough,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3422816/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,its not just about success,Ive watched again and again but somehow the 1st time always gave me certain one timer feelings Whiplash is going to give you several interpretations but mine will always be POV In other words personal perspectives The fletcher concept of success represents a category of successful people People who say thing about achieving personal goals with their own rules STRICT RULES Imo i do get some motivation sense still after 10th time seeing it The only regret is not seeing in theater Yet they say a perfect movie doesnt exist,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6756101/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,My favorite movie,Not gonna write a long review cuz this movie can speak for itself This is a flawless movie with an unbelivable performance from jk simmons The music is great and it has a message that speaks to me about how it requires pain to make a dream come true,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6078814/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,Well edited,A different movie well edited movie Greatveffor from all actors,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6551966/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2021,Watch it & Boost your adrenaline,Seeking for perfection is good or bad I wonder if you have a great dream you should do your best to make it true even if you have someone pushing you beyond what is expected from you or just leave it to keep your emotional health But if you leave it would you be satisfied with your life after abandoning your dreams But this movie proves if you desperately need something just take it even if it s in the lion s den Every actor mastered his role tightly I felt Andrew s thirst for greatness and Fletcher s scrutiny to be satisfied They made the last 15 minutes breathtaking,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6584401/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,So so,They focused on emotions covered up illogical situations with them I hardly watched this film it is quite specific there is a lot of music in it namely jazz about half of the entire timekeeping is musical excerpts I do not have a love for this musical direction and it greatly prevented me from watching the film The plot is about how a young musician Andrew Nieman literally goes to his goal with blood and sweat how he overcomes difficulties and how much perseverance he exerts His head Terence Fletcher is a real despot sometimes a tyrant which only complicates the guy,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7778300/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,Tension filled masterpiece,This is a film I believe everyone should watch Not just because Damien Chazelle directed it amazingly but for the deeper meaning throughout the film telling you to never give up on something you truly adore I thought the whole film was incredibly thought out with every scene being just as important as the one before Both the main actors Miles Teller and J K Simmons were phenomenal In the scenes where the tension is high you can physically feel it yourself as the emotion portrayed by the characters were great The last scene was mesmerising and definitely one of my favourite final scenes in a film It s such an amazing movie I wish I had watched this sooner,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8683914/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2017,This is what it takes if you have rules for yourself,I rather like this movie It is the one that made me go on IMDb to get rid of my high reviews for movies that were really only a small cut above the norm for their genre This is as pure as it gets for its genre and still leaves tons of room for arguing about in a dessert shop after the movie I know what side of the argument I would be on I really don t even care that some people are self involved for a while It would be pretty boring to realize everything all at once anyway,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3757049/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2019,In my all time Top 10.,Electrifying Non stop energy from the first scene to the last A powerful film about true artistry and the sacrifices one must endure to achieve it The final 30 mins are just sublime,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4971301/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2015,Sheer Genius From Chazelle,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3174540/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2015,Amazing,Do yourselves a favour and go watch it Amazing and dynamic performances strong plot with a unique story I would watch it again and I normally don t watch movies more than once in the cinema So exciting If J K Simmons doesn t win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor next Sunday I ll think the world s gone mad I have to say that this movie is under hyped which is always refreshing Literally my favourite movie of the year It also helped that the type of people that go to watch this kind of movie are mature adults that don t keep talking throughout the movie Such a great experience and left me feeling buzzed and energized at the end of the movie even in the mood to dance to some Jazz music,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3183429/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2015,"Some movies blow your mind, this one shakes your soul",Basically this movie is about an ambitious boy possessing a strong will being driven to fulfil his dream of being a legendary drummer I won t spoil much as this movie is totally worth watching Keeping it short here This movie is for everyone Even if you re not a fan of drums and drama this movie should keep you captivated to the very end From the start the movie had the ability to make your heart stop and race abruptly Its easily as intense as any thriller out there The storyline depicts a boy lost in his dreams and a teacher going to the extremes Throughout the film you ll be kept wondering whether the teacher is being harsh for the sake of the greater good as he claims or is he just being an ass who doesn t want to lose his pride Many people may fall the same way in their lives and start to wonder whether whatever they re doing is worth it This movie would serve as a mirror for this people where they can look at themselves and reflect The first class storyline coupled with top notch acting from the actors especially the coach makes the movie all the more enjoyable This movie could easily have turned out to be an old clich drama about success and all but no things were put right here The ending was one of the best I ve seen in a long time Super intense and concludes the story well Enough said i guess Watch it to see why this movie was nominated for the best picture Truly amazing,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172141/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2014,Simply outstanding,I signed up for access just to share the vote and summary a real treat for moviegoers go take anyone with you and have a great time The camera work lighting audio acting everything down to the last detail are all award winning in my opinion I watch movies at least twice a week for years and years and it s productions like Whiplash that make it worth the dedication The fact that this is a debut for the writer and director leave me excited to see what is store for years to come Thank you to anyone and everyone that made this movie possible One last thing see this movie free from distraction no cell phone alcohol or full bladder to take away from the story,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3107293/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2016,Scaringly beautiful,Everybody has something in his life which makes you want to push yourself to your limits With Andrew Miles Teller it s jazz music He has an almost irrational drive to get better at being the best jazz drummer in history When he gets the chance to come to the class of Terrence Fletcher played by J K Simmons a well known teacher at the most prestigious music School in the USA Andrew sees his future brighten up Only he doesn t know the severity and seriousness with what Mr Fletcher teaches his classes Whiplash is a terrifyingly beautiful film about the things a person is capable of doing for greatness Or as the Joker might say This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object From the first scene of the movie we the perfect impression of what you re going to get throughout the movie great jazz music and even greater performances by Miles Teller and especially by J K Simmons Every scene Simmons is in he draws all eyes to him and he draws every breathe out of you anxiously awaiting his reaction In terms of villain factor Simmons is right up there with Darth Vader Voldemort etc With the only difference that Simmons character is much more realistic The movie does a great job setting up the character of Andrew making you understand where he is coming from and what drives him into the decisions he takes throughout the movie The scenes with his dad are especially powerful Apart from the dynamic performances by the two head roles the other factor that elevates this movie is the beautiful soundtrack Never has a soundtrack impacted me this much from being a jazz enthusiast to an absolute jazz guru Immediately after the movie I went to search for the soundtrack along with some extra jazz songs to make myself my own personal jazz playlist The great thing about the soundtrack of Whiplash is it s necessity to the story every track brings it s own factor to the movie All in all Whiplash succeeds in making a very fundamentantelly impactful film about success desire and motivation and the dangers it brings with it It also succeeds at being the best movie of 2014,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3534171/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2019,Good but over rated,First hour is average for a film the last half and hour or so is above average but I think people over rated the film a little too much Don t get me wrong it s a good watch but the first hour can seem slow and repetitive If your watching this thinking its going to be as action packed or suspenseful as a action movie your wrong There still is some good suspense but not as much as people make out,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4556690/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2015,"the drive, the will",Whiplash Damien Chazelle this is the biggest surprise of the productive year 2014 Relatively young director made from low budget film a hit The plot is quite simple How to successfully skip obstacles and persevere Want to be successful Work practice bleed The film is adorned with incredible dynamics and production It is something different a fresh wind in a world of big bucks rotten industry who Just wanna make a buck more Important are the characters From Juno Jason Reitman he s on my eye but this time he totally rocks at all levels and yes J K Simmons did steal the whole show J K Simmons wow what a performance His mileage comes out big time A respected professor in a music academy you could say almost narcissistic psychopath who requires more from students Nothing wrong if they would not be mentally tortured Also a great performance from Miles Teller who is slowly climbing on a letter to be a great actor Yes we get it so important to show how the main actor is suffering all the time but the pain is a little over the top and to many bloody hands Screen capturing is that important in this movie but the intense storyline and the personification of torture makes it alive alive If you have a spare time just grab this movie from the shelve and enjoy a masterpiece epic To much drama you would say but Nonetheless a great juicy story a nice pedigree of acting and a vivid package movie must see I recommend it big time,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3183274/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2015,"Superb and emotional film. J.K.

3 May 2023,J. Jonah Jameson as a music teacher.,Whiplash 2014 review This is an excellent movie directed by Damien Chazelle who s well known for La la land In a weird way this movie isn t about Jazz or music but the goal of somebody who wants to be great The movie really shows this with Miles teller and his incredible performance and literally drumming till his hands are bleeding but it all pays off when he s finally able to pay the piece of music that Terrence fletcher J k Simmons is wanting him to Some think of Terrence fletcher as a villain or a bully and others think of him as a genius But ultimately he s pushing him beyond his limits so that he can be great He says in the movie I was there to push people beyond what s expected of them I believe that s an absolute necessity Downsides It does swear quite a bit especially with Terrence fletcher but this can be a good or bad thing because it adds so much to his character This is one of the best movies of the decade and it has a Damien chazelle type ending where you don t really know how it ends If you don t mind some bad language then I d recommend this whether you re into music or not 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9031183/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2016,Incredible Acting Performance,This movie is one of the most successful movies of year 2014 and very successful at especially technical aspect But in my opinion the performance of J K Simmons is deserved to speak much more than this One of the his performance as Vern Schillinger from OZ 1997 TV show was the first acting that got my attention After this I watched him at Juno 2007 These two characters are really poles apart Although one of this characters is a wild criminal the other is a meek family man He performed these two opposite characters very successfully and I watched him with pleasure With this performance he really hit the top and deserved Oscar all the way,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3556112/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2022,One of the best films of the 2010s - GOOD JOB!,In a decade which didn t give he much this really stood out for me A fantastic two hander with brilliant performances The perfunctory scenes serve mainly to relive the tension but the film comes to life when the two are on screen For the reviews saying the film glorifies the actions of a Terence I think they are missing the point He gets to put his argument but it is always an unconvincing justification For me the film is always about abuser and abusee and when the two meet as like minds a wielder of power and a lost but driven soul driven for the need of recognition but never truly feeling they deserve it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8082767/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2023,A difficult watch,A tense darkly powerful glimpse in to what it takes to become the best This felt like a debut film full of characters dead and techniques crafted by someone still in the full throes of film school passion as if this was the film he s always dreamed of making J K Simmons is incredible as the Jedi Master instructing his young padewan in the ways of the force and shows us what he believes it takes to inspire greatness Miles Teller presents well as the slightly odd but intensely driven young wannabe who sacrifices small slices of happiness for a chance to become all he can be Brimming with hubris and creative passion he shows us why we never realised our own dreams the difference between what it takes to be happy and what it takes to be the best,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8865257/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2015,Straight Up Whiplash,What does it take to be great There is only one word to describe Whiplash INTENSE It s the story of a young drummer who wants to be great and an explosive instructor who demands perfection Today if you gave me a film fest time machine I m going to Sundance 2014 Why you ask To watch the tour de force that is Whiplash snag the Grand Jury Prize for Damien Chazelle In this picture Chazelle provides a vision for the future From beginning to end it s easy to appreciate his camera and the story it s telling through its lens Teller and Simmons are masterful but it s because their action and dialogue is so robust that they re able to pass along overtones of passion and intensity Despite a limited release it s safe to say Whiplash will turn enough heads with its recent Academy Award noms If you re looking for what I call a perfect storm you ll find it in this movie The script is an A the acting is A the directing is an A Whiplash won t just leave you speechless it will leave you with a healthy dose of adrenaline all day long,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3168343/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2015,Under-appreciated,I just want to say how under appreciated this movie really is and how it has not received the recognition it deserves You have two Oscar worthy performances by Miles Teller and JK Simmons both who acted their butts off and made this an exemplary movie On top of the great scenes with amazing directing and dialogue I haven t seen an ending this great in a movie in a long long time It will be a shame to see this movie nominated but not win much during the Oscars this year but I hope people those who have thought about watching it to do so ASAP you will not regret it More movies need to be made with as much passion as this one,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3163793/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2022,A Solid Mainstream Debut for Chazelle,Music is the foundation of our society or rather the closest foundation visual or musical entertainment can be to being used as one Neyman is a student at a prestigious school who wants to become the best a sort of successor to the greats of the Jazz genre However he encounters a teacher who berates and belittles him even assaulting him during a practice and mocking the tears that follow This is like a sort of meditative piece on how much abuse we will allow ourselves to sustain in the name of self improvement and skill preservation It s a psychological thriller one that plays on the tense relationship between these two characters as well as the prevailing mental deterioration that plagues the young conflicted anti hero at the center of the story Featuring good direction even better writing and a supporting turn by JK Simmons which is a marvel this was by far my favorite film of 2014,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8097291/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2022,Above average,This isn t the sort of movie you want to watch over and over maybe not even a second time and maybe because it s hard for me to listen to lengthy drum solos But it s certainly good enough to watch if you want to spend a little time with something that s different and a cut above most of the drivel that s out there nowadays There were some character and plot weaknesses that made the movie weaker than it could have been It was difficult to develop any affinity with any of the two main characters in the movie partly because they were so thoroughly ugly except for the single redeeming feature of spirit in one and partly because every other character was part of the backdrop against which they were drawn The guru s character immediately becomes obvious and yet the hero repeatedly and stupidly falls in to his humiliating traps which just seems so unbelievable At one point in the movie the guru is shown to have a soul yet when an event occurs which echoes that which haunts the guru there is no believable outcome from him That aside there is good acting at least interesting main roles a sort of a slowly developing duel that crescendos and there is good translation of that horrible self obsessive thing in humans that drives them to excel and be in the spotlight so to be permanently recognised but at the cost of the destruction of all that should be dear to them their character and even that which nourishes them,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8031898/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,When sickos reigned supreme,Exhilarating yet the mentor is a raging narcissist who would never actually be employed for very long in any real university Perhaps if his bona fides had been presented prior to his eviscerating displays the film would resonate more with people in tune with the context of his passion and ruthless enforcement of his standards The film does a good job of exploring the co opting of jazz for the glory of the white man the conversion of a genuine art form into an ego plantation in a perfectly prosaic setting The focus on Buddy Rich as the pinnacle of jazz drumming makes for a first glance justification for all that follows as real jazz remains an illegible footnote Nevertheless Whiplash is a very compelling story indeed,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8564604/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2018,WOW,Whiplash had one of the best screenplays I ve seen in a movie Miles Teller and JK Simmons did an excellent job and their effort is visible on screen The climax scene is beautifully directed and leaves the viewer with a did he or didn t he dilemma,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4391238/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2015,For Inspiration Seekers!,I have always had this feeling that there could never be another movie as inspiring as Shawshank Redemption ever in the history of motion picture production But then Whiplash happened It appears that this movie will always top my list of favorites And here s why The second best thing I loved in Spider Man 2002 after Peter Parker of course was J Johan Jameson played by J K Simmons Having watched him previously only in Spider Man his transformation from a grumpy old editor in chief of Daily Bugle to a hard hearted perfection seeking music conductor literally blew my head off And it didn t come to me as a surprise when he won the Academy Award for the Best Supporting Actor Whiplash Miles Teller equally complementing Simmons was a treat to watch By the time the movie got over I noticed my palms were sweaty and sweat pearls had gathered on my forehead I am enthralled and awestruck having watched a masterpiece by Damien Chazelle and crew This is one movie I d love to watch over and over again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3189709/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2019,It is the wonder of low budget filmmaking,Whiplash 2014 MA TONY SAAD MONDAY 12 JULY 2019 STAR STAR STAR STAR Music is a key to a memorable satisfying film and Damien Chazelle s Whiplash is no exception The energy of double time swing and the spontaneity of drum solos really reflect the nature of this film It is ruthless and at times painful to watch The inspiration and the reality of it all is a testament to how music really shapes our lives even in the slightest of ways At its simplest Whiplash is more inspirational than a raging AFL team on a hot Australian summer day Whiplash follows the story of Andrew Neiman Miles Teller a budding drummer at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York He strives to become a world class drummer like Buddy Rich The Conservatory is conducted by Terrence Fletcher J K Simmons who will do just about anything to push his students beyond their potential This film is all about music and musicians Andrew joins the Shaffer Conservatory with the hopes to become a professional drummer His passion directly impacts his relationship with his friends and family I think Andrew is one of the most dedicated protagonists out there His story alludes to those of many Jazz artists including Charlie Bird Parker and Hank Levy But he is not entirely innocent his relationship with Terence is causing his fall among his friends and family This film is also one of the tensest non horror films I ve seen recently Chazelle took inspiration from old thrillers in developing the story which was evident in the conflicting emotions of the characters A Thriller is not a horror film It is the genre in which no character is innocent i e they all engage in abuse of law Murder theft cheating you name it and they have got few if any allies in their quests For example Neiman is our hero but he intentionally distances himself from his family and breaks up with his girlfriend to work on his drumming Fletcher is pushing his students very far but becomes very violent whenever he has a fit And as a result his relationship with his students is very toxic Throughout the film you cannot help but be on your nerves all the time because Whiplash is just plain aggressive It s as if it is forcing us to keep watching in anticipation of what may happen next who will hurt whom What will cause the fall of our protagonist Of course the highlight of this film is the music Whiplash is not an ordinary musical the characters do not burst into song all the time The songs are sourced from famous Jazz artists like Hank Levy and composed by Justin Hurwitz I just wish I could watch the Shaffer Conservatory play the OST in front of me or even better me playing the drums with Neiman My favourite pieces were Caravan and Too Hip to Retire because I could not stop air drumming after having seen tis film The film showcases the beauty of music better than The Greatest Showman While the latter is grandiose and spectacular it feels like a series of music videos sewn together Whiplash is better than that In fact it is the wonder of low budget filmmaking Even if it was a series of music videos it s a lot more entertaining than The Greatest Showman Through Andrew and Terrence s relationship Whiplash pays homage to jazz and its artists beautifully It is also an inspirational story of how a little bit of determination and commitment can make all the difference in the toughest of times Whiplash Film Review 2019 This film review was produced for the purpose of copyrights in the Lebanese Republic and the Commonwealth of Australia All Rights Reserved,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5072789/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2019,"A movie that doesn't give answers, but puts up so many questions",I hear one group of people talking about musical technicalities of this movie and another talking about bulling Well I wouldn t put it in any boxes but rather pay attention to incredible details I liked certain scenes very much because even though they might show caricature image they also give a picture of a modern world rush for a success I felt like I watched a movie about every good university in the world or anybody who wants to be a real professional It is not just about violence or sadism it is about the sacrifice for a perfection and loosing the passion The scene in a cafe where the main actor talks with its professor gives some interesting topics to think about One of them is his wish to create an extraordinary artist but where he also says how he never made one It is about hypocriticism of the pedagogues who should help students to get better instead of soothing them with that that they are good enough when they can do much better Actually at the end he made one but he destroyed many before him Where is the border What can mildness build And what can roughness How soft can and should we be and how harsh where is the border line Does one work with some and with some the other With whom does which one work Is the one who sacrificed everything and himself for a great purpose actually a genius Does he suffer of a Stockholm syndrome Who is his torturer could it be himself Did he do the good thing Is his sadist teacher a good teacher Why yes Why no What could he do different What could he do better There are so many questions and so little answers I think every one of us should search for his personal answers,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4702921/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2015,This movies don't let you doze off,The film is very intense and dynamic Even though i am not a jazz fun I found it really impressive how the film manages to pass the idea of the struggle of a musician to play a hard music The movies is always surprizing us The main characters are realistic even though the two main characters are quite fanatic about their ideas In truth for me they are like two ends of a stick made one for the other,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3205301/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2015,Rhythm of madness.,First the tittle of my review is the name of the movie in my country translated to English and it really describes the movie My musical taste is a lot different than the music that plays part in this movie but I enjoy the music like it was something that I listen to everyday So don t stop yourself from watching this because your musical style is not the same you ll be missing a terrific film I loved the main actor performance I think I didn t watch him anywhere else scenes where s he s pushing himself to the limit by playing drums are so good and better then some action scenes that would have you all tense and at the edge of your seat I didn t watch many films from musical genre but from what I have watched this goes at the top Didn t expected much from Whiplash but I m so satisfied and all psyched up from watching it You should do it too,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3179007/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2016,Excellent reflection of conservatory extreme anxiety,As a conservatory trained violinist and having played for more than 20 years I can say that this movie apart from being great in other aspects such as directing acting and photography perfectly reflects the extreme anxiety that a musical student can experience Of course not all the cases are like that and this is kind of a parody but it is closer to reality than one could unfortunately believe how teachers project their frustration and complexes on their students under the excuse of getting the best out of them Other than that both main characters performance is outstanding as well as the script One can follow the uprising tension alongside the film until it is almost unbearable Your toes and fingers will be twitched until the very last scene Also if you are a fan of jazz it is a wonder to watch and listen to,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3397021/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2017,A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory,Whiplash Much Like La La Land 2016 Is a Fantastic Film but unlike La La Land is far more serious which isn t a bad thing Miles Teller Is Outstanding in this film probably his best performance yet although it s really unfortunate that his next big movie was the dreadful Fantastic Four 2015 reboot Much like Miles Teller Jk Simons gives it his all and is one of if not the best performance of 2014 The music in Whiplash is outstanding My full analysis of whiplash is that it is an amazing film 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3650034/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2020,More than a musical movie,If you are thinking Whiplash is any other music related movie then I think you are wrong Whiplash is more than just a musical movie it is a movie about pushing limits it is about how far you can go to become something great and don t get me started on how intense this movie gets it literally gave me chills in most scenes J k Simmons nailed his character as a teacher you know how sometimes you get the feeling about your school days and all the cruel things you teacher said to you when you did something wrong and how for a moment you just wanted revenge of the things J k Simmons lived his character like that I could find myself in place of Andrew and wanting to just quit and go home This movie literally lives up with that kind of revenge when you just can t bear anything But in the end this movie is also about not getting discouraged by mistreat or failure cause in the end the one who practices more than the rest gets more than the rest I strongly believe everyone should watch this movie irrespective of the genre because you are nothing without a purpose and to achieve that purpose you need passion and this movie tries very hard to awaken that passion inside you and succeeds,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6025872/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2023,You will not connect if you are not a jazz fan,People would definitely disagree with me They might say even if you are not a jazz fan the movie is phenomenal Well I partially agree The acting of both the protagonist was top notch Bill stellar was absolutely bliss to watch And J K Simmons need no words to describe But I come from a background where jazz is not understood moreover it is not known yet So for me the music of the movie was just different instrument trying to sync together With utter humility I would like to say that I was not able to connect with the movie I am from India we understand classical and we found peace in it but I am very sure it s tough for westerners to love classical as unconditionally as us Same happened to me I was unable to connect with Jazz But utmost respect to the screenplay and editing No disrespect to the genre I am very sure it s one of the great music genres of all time,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9213758/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2022,"Haunting, mesmerizing, reflective.",Much has already been said upon the excellence of this film thus I seek to only offer a seed of opinion that perhaps in the cosmos of hundreds of reviews The one thing that truly appealed to me about this Indie low budget yet gem like film is that within the age of sensationally oriented cinematic production this film returns back to the roots of what film really was all about that being acting script and score As a film about elite jazz music the score is without question already up to par But more importantly the acting A diabolical yet memorable performance from both main and supporting actors I watched this film first around 3 years ago yet the roaring face of Fletcher and the infamous not my tempo with cymbal hurling has almost become an inside joke amongst friends and family who are familiar You can only do that with a very select few classics such as masterpieces like The Godfather Goodfellas Tiffany s Breakfast etc Just as you think the Golden Age of 20th century cinema has died here comes Whiplash POW And you are in love with cinema in its very best representation of what it really is all about The only point of suggestive feedback if any would be that in my humble opinion I would ve potentially wished to gain more insight upon the entire story backdrop as a whole perhaps if it ideally provided an extended cut of sorts As a viewer while I was totally mesmerized in the duel between Simmons and Teller I would ve upon future viewings liked to see a little more about some of the more inferior yet also interesting subjects that the film only had a minimum amount of screen time to address For one Teller s girlfriend For another perhaps a friend classmate of Teller s during his time at the conservatory Nonetheless masterpiece,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8600107/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2015,A brilliantly made film with two incredible performances!,With the Oscars less than a week from today I recently notched another best picture nomination under my belt in Whiplash This film is undoubtedly the most under the radar of the eight nominations receiving very limited release in theaters and netting around 10 million in the box office to date one of the lowest grossing best picture nominations ever but boy does it deliver Whiplash comes to us from the essentially unknown his only other directorial work was drama Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench in 2009 Damien Chazelle Chazelle is a 30 year old Harvard grad who catapulted in to the spotlight with one of the best films of 2015 With edge of your seat drama and two incredibly strong performances from the leads Whiplash tells the story of how far one drumming prot g will go being pushed by his mentor The film opens with a dramatic approach shot that shows the star of Whiplash Miles Teller playing one Andrew Nieman vehemently practicing a piece on his drum kit The soon to be 28 year old actor shows his authentic drum skills most of the drumming you ll hear in the film is actually Teller when he is interrupted by an eavesdropping instructor Terrence Fletcher played by the heavyweight J K Simmons Fletcher immediately sets the tone for the relationship between Nieman and himself in this intimate opening scene that plays out in the rest of the film Fletcher is seen standing in the doorway obviously listening in on Nieman s practice session He immediately tells him to play certain pieces certain ways to assess his skills and from this the film unfolds Nieman looks to Fletcher with clear reverence and respect yet Fletcher while realizing the potential dehumanizes Nieman This back and forth between the two leads and the psychological and physical journey of Andrew Nieman that a brightly shining Miles Teller takes the audience on is terrifyingly fascinating We learn shortly thereafter that Nieman has been without a mother for most of his life and is very close with his father as they are seen together in multiple scenes Fletcher then invites Nieman to start rehearsing with his renowned studio band which is where the film really starts to heat up Fletcher and Nieman begin to clash in ways that make it tough for the viewer to watch at times but in an oh too familiar relatable and dramatic way With dark humor an elegant score with fantastic scenes of musicianship two Oscar worthy performances Teller did not receive a nod from the Academy but Simmons did and leads the pack to win best supporting actor and a plot with character development and an ending that will absolutely leave you wanting more Whiplash is a brilliant film It is profoundly entertaining yet perhaps more importantly it stirs up emotions within the audience as to just how far is too far for one music teacher to push his prot g and how much can or should a student in this situation take to be great Whiplash sees the affirmation of the acting prowess that is JK Simmons and also the breakthrough role for an alarmingly talented Miles Teller An absolutely can t miss film that is more than worthy of a best picture nomination this Oscar season 8 5 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3187220/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2023,Whiplash is right,Whiplash serves as a great character study into the mind of the obsessed artist lead by two career defining performances Whiplash is a rollercoaster of a movie It speeds up and slows down numerous times allowing for the film to build natural tension and keeps viewers on the edge of their seat For a non action film to achieve this is pretty impressive as many thrillers lack the pacing to keep the audience engaged at all times I attribute this most to the incredible performances of both Miles Teller and J K Simmons with each brining their best performance to date and beyond Simmons in particular gives one of the greatest supporting performances in the history of film and steals the show whenever he s on screen,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9201567/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2023,Wow just wow,This was a movie that I always had on my watch list just another one of the mountain to conquer I put it on particularly as a background movie I knew this cast it would do well I was an idiot this movie is not background noise it is a masterpiece you may not like music you may not like drama but you will still love this movie while the bass part of this is about an aspiring drummer it is about raw passion Miles Teller plays his roll to perfection a man dedicated to his craft and will stop at nothing until he gets the satisfaction of doing what he wants Now what makes this so incredible is J K Simmons roll as to describe the petrifying music teacher this man has been in this roll for years with a large senior roll who may elevate Miles character to worlds beyond yet as you may expect he is hesitant This review may never give justice as this film may not be describable textually it is visual and audible art and must be consumed to not watch this movie would be crazy and to watch it would make you crazy about the movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9249879/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2016,Whiplash: 'cause less is never more,Just watched Whiplash and it is very enjoyable Excellent acting and great characters excellent music and flow There are some good quirky unpredictable things and it is very beautifully filmed and edited It is a shame that they overstated so many aspects of the plot making everything too extreme Had they of held back on well everything they would have made a superior production But as happens all too often with American films the director and or the producers feel the need to indulge themselves and the audience beyond what is necessary Unfortunately it would seem that in the land of plenty less is never more,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3548793/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2015,"A genius work of art, that dares to try",Whiplash was not just one of the best movies of the year but possibly one of the best sports movies ever That s right sports movies Whiplash did so many great things but what was truly amazing watching it was not just how good it was but how in this age of movies it was able to transcend genres and portray a truly original and thought provoking theme when most other movies don t even try Never preachy it presented a truly unbiased look at the question How much push and pressure is too much when trying to create talent and when does it go over the line The question itself is not an overtly new or creative one but rather the fact of a movie trying to portray that and doing so so well is The movie follows a not all that great aspiring drummer at an elite music school Miles Teller After being discovered by the infamous top jazz conductor at the school J K Simmons he is promoted to the top jazz orchestra in the school There J K Simmons character runs the class with a beautifully acted satanic cruelty as he attempts to push people past their limits and abilities As Teller s character is pushed harder and harder he falls into a crazed and exacerbated state where everything from his girlfriend his dad and his houses cleanliness falls away as he practices non stop with that dream of becoming the next Charlie Parker What we get is a haunting and genius story that explores with flawless execution how hard can or how hard should a person be pushed,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3194876/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2020,Not quite my tempo!,JK Simmons gave a really good performance He looks and plays the part pretty well I partly agree about pushing people to get their best And the movie is so good to just hear the Jazz band and the drumming I loved being in the environment of music school and their rehearsals In some scenes Fletcher looks more like a military commander which was too dramatic I think Good movie,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5748303/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2015,An Inspirational and Powerful Thrill Ride,I had been hearing that Whiplash was one of the best films of 2014 from many people so I decided to go ahead and give it a whirl Lucky for me I was not disappointed Not in the slightest Whiplash is a powerful depiction of ambition Miles Teller plays Andrew a first year student at a prestigious music school He is a talented drummer with the single goal of becoming one of the greats Right at the start he is noticed by one of the respected teachers at the school named Fletcher played by J K Simmons From here on you experience the back and forth between the student and the teacher as Andrew tries to persevere through the cutthroat approach of Fletcher J K Simmons does an absolutely phenomenal job as Fletcher Throughout the film Fletcher goes to the extremes to motivate and push his students to be better His single focus is being the best and any less than that just won t cut it During each scene you can see the anger and frustration building within Andrew as Fletcher constantly berates him for each and every mistake There isn t a single boring moment during the film The two performances from Simmons and Teller carry the film with their incredible chemistry It s inspirational watching Andrew push through the challenges he faces during his quest to be the greatest At the same time you feel sad for him as you experience during multiple moments of the film how much his dedication and ambition take a toll on his life Whiplash takes you on an emotional ride through success failure happiness sadness and a continually building tension as the two personalities of Andrew and Fletcher clash I would be very confident in predicting some Oscars for Whiplash most notably J K Simmons winning the Oscar for best supporting actor If you are reading this review after the fact and Whiplash has indeed won some Oscars rest assured these awards are most certainly well deserved,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164314/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,Get the Idea Not The Music !!,I just finish watching the movie and read some of the 2 5 stars review many people only judge the movie by the abusive and the non realistic music parts i think this movie speak more than just abusive teacher and only drum centric this movie speak about the ideas how and keep stacking up new goals you need to keep pushing yourself how hard you earn the goal next time you still need to aim a higher goal don t be happy reaching one goal but keep pushing and stack more goals I m not in to Jazz and i don t even like the movie by the title but after 20 min i was stuck i can t believe how the plot is being played The end was epic finally in Tuned The actors was brilliant expression and gestures was really realistic and powerful Screen angle was great,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3197714/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2015,Every once in a while you find a movie that is truly great,watched this movie 5 minutes ago and nothing but good things can i say about Simmons acting the writing and direction of the film This film honestly made me a fan of teller and i don t think anybody else could have played the role better because he really captures that i can do it attitude that keeps you locked into the film The film really does have this build to it that is almost too brilliant and the personalities show within the actors so very well that it inspires you to really examine yourself and your goals and think what drives me and what is my purpose To be honest i chose this film out of random and didn t expect much but now it is at the top of my 2015 movies list Every once in a while you find a movie that is truly great,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3267420/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2016,"A bright spot in modern day films (and yes I said films not movies, this is a film)",I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3406945/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2016,Not bad but overrated,Whiplash may seem like an very original movie but really the story line is very shallow I honestly just don t see where the story is going in Whiplash and at the end there seem to be a meh feeling of disappointment Whiplash however does have its moments and the acting is phenomenal I like the intensity and drama associated with Fletcher but story line wise there really is not much too it Although don t get me wrong because Whiplash is a quality movie is just that the story it s pretty disappointing So my advice to you on watching this movie is that don t expect too much from it because you really won t get anything out of it,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3476183/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2019,Highly Entertaining,I haven t read all 1000 reviews but of those I have read not one of them mentioned the soundtrack for this engrossing film That s a pity because I think the music holds a key part in the story I didn t catch from the credits who was playing all the band pieces but they were a top notch band I would have liked to have heard a couple more charts from them However I am a rehabilitated trombonist and it s been years since I played but it was clear to me that the close ups were of people who weren t actually playing the music that was on the soundtrack But you know what I was willing to suspend my disbelief because the story was so gripping J K Simmons was absolutely a terror and I would love to see him try to sell State Farm insurance in character as Terence Fletcher Just kidding While Fletcher was an extreme caricature of a driven perfectionist I had a band teacher in junior high who would throw small objects and yell at players he thought were lazy or not concentrating I bought Fletcher s behavior and I don t know how many of his stories about Bird were true but I do know that Parker and Miles and other greats practiced their instruments for hours a day every day One of my favorites Don Lanphere was still practicing his scales two hours a day into his 70 s so Fletcher s message about what it takes to achieve greatness wasn t that far off track I think most people even experienced musicians will be enthralled by this movie because of the performances of the main actors the story the interaction between characters I felt Andrew and his father s relationship played by Paul Reiser was touching and the tremendous soundtrack While Fletcher s methods could be and were questionable his objective was not and most people including me have no idea what it really takes to be one of the greats Prodigies like Mozart are so very rare that nearly all greats got where they are by embellishing some natural talent through dedicated and disciplined hard work This move portrays that in a thoroughly entertaining and sometimes shocking way Highly Recommended,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4674838/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2018,Amazing,Whiplash is not a movie about drums or music It s film about dreams goals persistence will power This movie shows us that nothing will come to you and you have to fight for something you believe for something that you deserve Whiplash is the message for everyone who learns who dreams to become SOMEONE Whiplash is also a message for everyone who gives up on his dreams for everyone who fights with depression or anxiety This is modest but impeccable story about not that perfect youngster even more he is in some moments arrogant selfish too proud youngster but he is a youngster who doesn t give up He pushes himself over the limits of his physical and mental state so he could fulfil his dream to become the best drummer in the world His road to becoming best starts when he joins student bend of mentor Fletcher J K Simmons I watched J K Simmons only in OZ where he was the leader of an Arian group in Oswald Prison He was brilliant there brilliant and here he is even better AMAZING ACTING That connection of Flecther and Andrew Miles Teller main character shows us fight for the dream of Andrew Fletcher with his learning methods leads to mental problems of his students but our main character is persistent In his dream but also in every other there will be people which will interrupt it because they are people with their dreams with their story I m really familiar with this and that just gives me a whole picture of the mental state of the main character Mentor Fletcher is an artist and nothing below that A perfect written character with outbursts of rage instability and vocabulary which does not suit the professor But every man who looks outside of the box must respect his work because he tries to push his students in pain blood tears and success Fletcher and Andrew duo that s opposite but with the same goal success and success Great story and my recommendation 9 5 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4027125/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2018,A Perfect Film,While watching a great film you can either be transported to a fictional place or connect with a realistic situation Damian Chazelle blends these two to create the best modern tragedy drama film there is Damian Chazelle uses dialogue and visuals to introduce and explore characters better than many recent directors Once these characters are introduced we begin to make connections with these characters The main character Andrew has a goal of becoming the best drummer of all time Although this specific goal isn t something we can all connect with Chazelle manipulates us so that for an hit and 40 minutes all we want is for Andrew to become the best drummer Fletcher his tyrannical teacher is his main obstacle Jk Simmons puts on a near perfect performance conveying his complete understanding of his character Chazelle focuses mainly on his characters to develop the story Through this he creates stakes revelations and brings out or emotions,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4245880/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2015,Favorite of Year,WHIPLASH Damien Chazzelle s Whiplash tells cinema s most compelling and engaging story of 2014 Despite a synopsis sure to put audiences to sleep Whiplash s amazing performances masterful direction and powerful themes create a movie guaranteed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats Whiplash follows Andrew Neiman Miles Teller a gifted young drummer attending the nation s top music school Neiman struggles to make it into the school s most prestigious jazz band where he encounters a vicious Terrence Fletcher J K Simmons reminiscent of the drill sergeant of Full Metal Jacket Neiman s desire to be the best there ever was and Fletcher s non conventional methods of pushing him to his goals create a friction between the characters This fuels competition and dialogue whose explosiveness are rarely seen in modern film In his pursuit of greatness Neiman must let go of what he loves as he and Fletcher clash in ways that will get your heart pounding Whiplash is a story of true passion start to finish The propulsion for such a driving film is the fantastic performances by its cast namely that of Simmons Simmons becomes completely unrecognizable it took less than a minute of screen time to forget about his portrayal of J Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi s Spiderman no small feat Simmons draws from the tough J J J to create a character whose intensity steals the show Commanding the screen in every frame he s on Simmons energy and sincerity is palpable The depth of his character is shown in the third act where we re introduced to entirely new layers of his mind Teller also gives the best performance of his career elevating a character from a good drummer to a prodigy driven by genuine passion Scenes involving both Simmons and Teller are nothing short of electrifying Their presence and ability to play off of each other converge in scenes that are shocking yet feel natural Teller s best scenes by far are the ones in which the dynamic between he and Fletcher is shown Simmons brings Teller to an entirely new level of acting prowess in their scenes together Images of Andrew Neiman s intense and bloody practices are also well done by teller and provide viewers with pathways straight into his mind The believability and intensity of the acting talent resulted in a movie that engages on many levels I found myself unable to leave the theater for even a second even though my popcorn was in need of a refill Chazzelle s ability to create tension was unrivaled in 2014 Every creative choice contributed perfectly to the narrative as it flowed from start to finish The score an eclectic mix of jazz classics paces the film as we progress The title track Whiplash is incredibly fitting Viewers are pulled back and forth as they progress through this swift emotional ride The music does the job of a film score it fades into the background furthering the visual sentiments passively The cinematography stylistically inventive while technically classical much like many of the jazz greats Neiman attempts to emulate In terms of pacing the film is absolutely perfect Each scene wets viewer s appetites leaving audiences begging for more even until the credits roll Chazzelle propels the story forward with tension that locks your eyes to the screen In his second feature length film Damien Chazzelle more than impresses he astonishes Masculine virtues like tough love and a visceral desire for greatness are explored in depth and treated with real artistic regard The harsh relationship between Fletcher and Neiman especially when juxtaposed against his weak and infinitely apologetic father give insight into raising a child with drive The ideas of fatherliness we gain from both Fletcher and Mr Neiman are sure to appeal to sons and fathers alike Andrew Neiman s pure white knuckled desire to be the best fuels a fire within him burning so bright Fletcher notices it from seeing him play only a few seconds The film explores what it takes to realize dreams like Neiman s and it even touches on contemporary society s over sensitivity and issues with political correctness These themes are well discussed in film and the uniqueness of its messages is certainly one of Whiplash s greatest merits The ability of Whiplash to outline specific commentary without the use of text at the end I m looking at you The Imitation Game is commendable He crafts a narratively subtly yet each point he makes is impactful Although it deals with motifs and ideas with tact and expertise Whiplash doesn t hit as hard emotionally as many other films this year While it is gripping and we become invested emotionally we re not left contemplated the ideas he presents to us The present commentary consists of respectful exploration but doesn t hit hard and doesn t delve into any particularly important topics of the time Perhaps this will prevent it from becoming dated but the movie just doesn t quite stack up to other films of its year like Boyhood narrative wise As a drummer myself some inconsistencies between what was being played and what I heard were apparent When compared to other movies however the film did an incredible job Teller appears to actually be a much better drummer than I am In part the movie the blood on Teller s hands was poorly done and obviously fake These flaws were very minor and didn t ever detract from my experience Unfortunately one scene in particular removed me from the movie Neiman has a conversation with his family over dinner that in an attempt show his lack of regard for those around him ends up awkward and labored Aside from that specific scene there wasn t a weak performance to be found Overall Whiplash has to be one of the best films of 2014 close to I rritu s Birdman The nearly impeccable acting artful directorial choices and thematic weight combine for an immensely and excitingly electric enjoyable film What flaws exist are too small to have a significant impact on my experience,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3186071/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2017,what a treat,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3837934/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2015,Two words: Best.Picture.,I cannot believe how much I underestimated this movie A few month ago friends were telling me to watch it because it would certainly worth a Best Picture winning I was like Are you kidding me It is not even close to worth it How can a film about music be a Best Picture Well I ll remember this evening for the rest of my life I swear to God that at the moment it Cut to Black I cried for almost 10 minutes in my bed Not because it was so sad or sentimental or whatever not at all Simply because it was a Best Picture without expecting it This film is about a drummer who want to be The Great Fletcher his instructor sees some potential in him so he won t stop at nothing to realize the dream of Andrew Throughout this movie you will see the determination of a young drummer who s not trying anymore but simply BE The Great We can see how much our dreams can be important in our life and how much we are willing to sacrifice to achieve them Best Supporting actor J K Simmons Best Film Editing Best Sound Mixing Special thanks to Damien Chazelle to turn the actual short film into a Great Masterpiece Vincent L vesque,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3221124/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2015,Overrated,Isn t it time to review the rating system on IMDb The time factor from release needs to be tweaked to accommodate the fact that newly released titles have tended to become more and more overrated Otherwise one of the fundamental successes of IMDb will be devalued and IMDb as a whole as well With regards to the movie I give it a 6 due to the performance of JK Simmons Even if his characters unrealistic behavior is also the factor pulling down the verdict he manages to make it less unrealistic in some weird way Altogether it is a somewhat feel good movie with scattered story line and worthy of an average rating,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3207562/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,My favorite movie of all time!!,This movie is a complete masterpiece Everything about it is good and the acting is over the top I loved this movie becuase when it finished it really made me think There were about 3 different meanings to this movie One is actually pretty nice and happy but the other two are very dark I am not going to go into detail but you can check it out on the internet In conclusion GREAT film my favorite film actually,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5777648/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,"Dramatic, fun and emotional",Primarily a story of success and how hard is to attain it But it was very predictable It s like i ve already seen a lot of movies with the same message The music theme and J K Simmons make this movie to stand out,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6482152/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2015,Compelling duo,The music the shots the way the scenes were conducted are all fueled by great performances It all adds up to a great and potential food for thought movie especially to those that love music Through out the movie I wasn t quite sure what to expect in the end The complexity of Fletcher is fascinating provided by the fact that we know little about his personal life At a certain point we get pushed to be sympathetic towards Andrew who is striving for success and doesn t back away from his goal even tho Fletcher is such an evasive person The true morals and feelings from which Fletcher lives by still bug me He s a very manipulative person and is blind from his own dream of finding the one not caring for those who are not and get crushed along the way Even tho he strives for perfection I don t think the true passion for music was there He is very ego oriented something that isn t plausible in the long run and in my opinion he will always be this kind of person you know this mean guy Fletcher Andrew even tho he acts by his dream and passion showed that he does have some issues conciliating them with this normal social life that so many swear to be the right way to live by He s young and if he takes time to reevaluate his own mistakes that he makes along the way he will eventually succeed whatever one might think is succeeding in life music should be his I do think the movie has it s flaws They become overshadowed by the the compelling performances but somewhat ruined the dynamic of the movie at some point The final scene is an intense and eye gluing one The twists and turns that happen are very important to the overall judgment of the movie We see something that may not be replicated by words It leaves a lot to wonder in the end and one could wish to see and know more but that s probably why it s so intriguing Miles Teller and J K Simmons deserved Oscar nomination provide great performances that should make one reflect on the morals of teaching and learning and how one can strive to achieve greatness,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3173946/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2019,Interesting and intense!,Really interesting take on a highly competetive environment Rhytmic and engaging the movie plays just like drum solo,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5220009/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2020,I found no real flaws with the film. It will have you engrossed from start to finish.,As a drummer this was an exciting movie to watch and my excitement didn t die out during the rest of the movie I personally haven t had a band teacher as abusive and insane as Fletcher but I know that there are definitely people out there like him who teach this class Anyway point being that this is on my Top 10 movies I ve seen so far It s a must watch even if you don t like movies about music,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5790993/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2015,should watch! Trailer wasn't very good but the movie was!,This movie was a very enjoyable movie the trailer didn t give the film justice however ignore the trailer and watch the film J K Simmons was absolutely fantastic but Miles Teller s performance was lacking is charisma I do believe that his performance wasn t entirely his fault and that it was a hard role to play but you don t really notice when J K Simmons is on screen The story was much better than I thought it would be when J K Simmons was on the screen he stole the whole show and I believe that without his performance the film wouldn t have stood up with Teller s performance Overall I believe that the film was definitely worth a watch,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3176199/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2020,Absolutely captivating,Whiplash is an absolutely engrossing and character driven drama boasting incredible performances from J K Simmons and Miles Teller as the unforgettable Fletcher and Andrew Whiplash asks you questions about true passion and whether violently harsh teaching facilitates of drives it away and the film refuses to give you answers If you think that the point of the film is that Fletcher is a terrible teacher and a crazy psycho you re wrong you still have to wonder if he is a part of why Andrew is as passionate as he is I do not condone his behavior but I posit that his role in success and perhaps failure is massive,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5724008/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2021,FANTASTIC!,I wasn t expected much in this movie but damn this movie is incredible This film is a low budget movie but the frames still look fantastic and beautiful The film is not an action movie nor a thriller but every drum scenes are so intenseful fast paced and exciting just watch the film and you ll know it keeps getting you hooked you ll sweat like the charecters live with the charecters The script is well written It has effective dialogue that drives the story charecters with feelings and goals that they needs to overcome to be the greatest it has such a weight to the movie Every scene is a part of a big picture no piece is useless and they re all fitted The acting is absolutely superb with the cast includes Miles Teller and J K Simmons Miles plays Andrew fantastically especially when he has to act very complicated emotions of this man who will do everything to accomplish his dream But J k Simmons is the best he steals the show and is probably one of the best antagonists in the movies history He s always harsh violent and is a perfectionist I recommend you watching this masterpiece a real movie experience,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6964828/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,Seat-of-the-pants emotional roller coaster,The most hideously abusive teacher I have ever seen a walking catastrophe to be neither tolerated nor emulated I d have fired him the first day he laid a hand on a student The Buddy Rich s and Bird s of this world were internally driven They would have made it with or without a teacher tyrant or mentor But that said this instructor s litany of abuse does put one in mind of Rich himself as the world s most abusive bandmaster This film is a first rate expos of pedagogical wrongdoing one that harks back to an old fashioned and obsolete mantra that you have to be cruel to be kind No you don t If there is one flaw in this movie it is the redemptive ending for Fletcher But I still rate this 0 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6524108/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2015,Favorite Movie of 2014!,Whiplash a powerful and emotional film for first time director Damien Chazelle Whiplash is about a boy named Andrew played by Miles Teller who enrolls as a freshman at Shaffer college aspiring to be the next greatest jazz drummer Andrews journey to greatness is hindered by a non supportive family other than his father personal internal conflicts and most of all his hard knock jazz teacher mentor Fletcher played by J K Simmons The film goes through Andrews freshman year at Shaffer and his battles trying to impress Fletcher to allow him to stay on his jazz band This movie had me feeling all sorts of ways Personally it hit home with how Andrews family never really supported him with his dream that he was very skilled at His aunt and uncle focused more on their sons who played football when in reality he was much better than them and was most likely going to be more successful I think a lot of people can relate to that theme that some passions of yours your not going to get many supporters on and your going to have to power through it your self through all adversity This movie also has the motivational factor of an inspirational sports movie like Rudy Seeing the scenes when Andrew is just pushing himself to his physical and mental limit just to make it in the industry are the best scenes in the movie Watching him play the same beat over and over while his hands are bleeding just to get the pace right and impress fletcher motivated me to go and do something with my life and put as much effort into it as Andrew did He showed that if you put your mind into a passion you can make it even in such a hard industry of being a drummer as clich as that sounds Going into this movie I expected a performance from Miles Teller that would be rather forgetful The only other movies I had seen him in were 3 lackluster performances in equally not so good movies Divergent Project X and the Footloose remake His roles in all 3 had been small parts but he still didn t steal the screen like some actors with small roles do so he had some big shoes to fill After watching this I was blown away by his performance At some points throughout it almost felt like he wasn t acting there was just so much raw emotion coming from him The other thing that astonished me was his ability to actually play the drums If that kid hadn t become an actor he could have easily pursued a career in music he s very talented If he has another good performance in the upcoming fantastic four movie I could see big things from him Now if you ve seen the movie or even watched the Oscars you know where the big chunk of my rave for this movie will be He won best supporting actor in a performance I hadn t seen from a supporting actor in a long time and his name is J K Simmons This guy just kills it in this movie Whoever came up with the idea of casting him is a genius The way his character physically and mentally torments his whole class and the way J K puts all of the emotion to show just how bad of a man Fletcher is is astounding His performance is both hilarious with his creative and crude insults and terrifying at the same time with how how intimidating and scary Fletcher is Watching him made me think back to the drill sergeant in full metal jacket probably the best part of that film Except the drill sergeant only gets 15 20 minutes of screen time when Simmons get a full hour and a half to show off his skills If you had to pinpoint one part of this movie that makes it stand out as one of the best 2014 had to offer J K Simmons is your reason To wrap up this movie is my personal favorite of 2014 even though birdman is a close second This movie thrives on individual performances but also has great writing editing and a stellar soundtrack all of which were nominated for Oscars The movies impact on the viewer is one you rarely find I watched it a week ago and it still is on my mind today Whiplash is definitely re watchable and one I will most likely be picking up on blu ray This movie is on par with some of the best music movies like Almost Famous and This is Spinal Tap My overall rating for this movie a 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3195313/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2022,Best Film This Century!,It was so unexpected to me when I watched it in the cinema that Whiplash would turn out to be one of the most intense thrillers I have ever seen There are a couple of huge plot twists which will leave you speechless coupled with a performance by JK Simmons which may never be bettered IMO the most deserving Oscar in history The way his character turns from nasty to sympathetic to vengeful in the blink of an eye is just breathtaking The music is brilliant and I normally hate jazz and the ending is probably the best I have ever seen Satisfying on so many levels On paper a film about a jazz musician sounds pretty dull but don t let that fool you It really is one of the best films I have ever seen Don t miss it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8393152/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,"Incredible film, with valuable lessons.",Simply this is a film about dedication perseverance grit determination and the trials and tribulations of a young man striving to be a the greatest in a school full of greats Miles and J K Simmons put on the performance most actors actresses wish they could achieve This launched Miles into film manhood and since only earning 8 grand has been a reliably killer actor since J K Simmons character is a harsh teacher with values and expectations that far exceed a traditional teachers which leads him to more unorthodox methods of teaching He breaks his students and sets standards almost unattainable by average musicians and great musicians alike As a massive bonus the music in this movie and drumming is FANTASTIC Overall I give this film a 8 5 10 but will settle at a 9 10 without complaints I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a break from the corporate woke political CGI garbage of today s films,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8700938/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2015,A Powerful and Tense Examination of Some Harsh Lessons,Damien Chazelle s Whiplash follows the story of a young and talented drummer studying at Schaffer academy in New York The film expertly observes the pressures and stresses of working under such a manipulative director Andrew Neyman Miles Teller is a 19 year old student gifted with the sticks in his hand The film opens with him practising his drumming and is a clear indication of how ambitious and determined he is After impressing Terence Fletcher JK Simmons the director of the leading ensemble in the school Neyman is promoted into the band Here is where he discovers the strict conditions of working under the perfectionist Fletcher Insults regarding his mother who ran away when he was young and having chairs thrown at him isn t what Neyman expected However he remains strong and as determined as ever to prove that he can be a great continuing to practise at every opportunity literally playing until his hands are blistering and bleeding Whiplash ultimately becomes a clash of two musical geniuses striving for perfection illustrating the pressures and tensions to the extent where the audience are expecting either one to crack at any stage Chazelle keeps the film strongly in the shadow of Neyman tracking every single strain and emotion with the camera spending a lot of the time behind the shoulder of Neyman Tempo is a major theme throughout the film in relation to the jazz numbers on the soundtrack which all make for an enthralling watch Teller and Simmons both deliver perfect performances Teller who is certainly coming of age manages to truly reflect the development of Neyman not only as a drummer but also as a person Teller spends the majority of the film in all kinds of pain either sweating bleeding or crying and he delivers every possible emotion his character endures Simmons standing in the opposite corner also perfects the role of the cynical terrifying director constantly pushing his band for perfection in the most intimidating approach possible His quips and insults leave the audience wondering whether to laugh or sit in a state shock Whiplash is a dark and pulsating watch which deservedly left Sundance with two awards under its arm With the Oscar nominations just around the corner it would be no surprise to see a number of honours coming the way of Chazelle s creation,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3160474/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2017,"Exhilarating, astounding and electrifying.",So I have seen many great films in the passing years but this was something of a kind There are many other films that would deserve a review but i have decided not to write them This however got me so hyped up that i just had to write this It may not be the highest rated movie in my list but it is really rare for me to give 10 stars This movie will not be joining those few movies but i m still going to give recognition to this one by letting it be the first movie i ever wrote a review about The reason for that is simple This was amazing movie that had incredible acting and a very dark but highly interesting plot The characters had depth in them and the movie itself gave you many ways to interpret it And for me that is a very important thing Many of the movies that give you more than one way to interpret it are on the way to become classics Usually it is the ending but in this one there is many scenes through out the movie In Whiplash i mostly mean the ending of the movie like i just stated but the spark for that incredible ending scene comes through the entire film Which is just great I also have to give credit to the acting in this movie J K Simmons is in my opinion one of the best actors in the world right now I am also not quite sure if this movie would have had that high impact it had on me if he wasn t in this one Just fantastic In my opinion this should have been the academic award winning best picture from 2014 After all this is quite possibly one of the best movies of the decade,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3623993/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2015,Very educative.,What the young director Damien Chazelle proposes us to ponder upon is Is high performance a natural product of talented people or is there at the core of it an unhealed wound that makes people want to demonstrate they are worthy of love and approval The main ideas of the movie are the incompleteness that is experienced when people feel average the absence of one parent leads more often than not to a deficiency of love which makes people strive to fill this hole with professional recognition perfectionism This hurts This is whipping sometimes we accept being persecuted We enroll in the mad dynamic of victim persecutor when we think we need some people s approval http lotuspocusfocus com 2015 01 movie recommendation whiplash,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3173288/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2015,"It is as discomforting and uncertain, as every great piece of Art should be. It is hard.",It is that hard The first thought that comes to mind after watching it It is that hard To be great to be amongst the greatest This is the first and the most obvious narrative line in the film The one that the protagonist antipathetic friendless character who seems to be equipped with an extraordinary drive sets as his ultimate goal In this world purged of imperfections faces are grim and no one looks you in the eye The world is indifferent and you don t matter unless you do something really exceptional Or die There are no Grey zones there is no redemption no one cares It is hard The father and the girlfriend the only two human characters are marginalized for their mediocrity and lack of purpose and therefore are irrelevant We are in the mind of the protagonist whose only drive in life is to be the greatest drummer So this is the price in hundred and seven minutes you bleed with him you get beaten and your spirit crushed to pieces Time and again you get sick of the tension of the pressure of all that bloody jazz Music has never been this hard Director bashes his bat to the beat of the drum so that by the end you have adrenaline rushing and your heart pumping like you re about to have a heart attack It is as discomforting and uncertain as every great piece of Art should be It is hard There is a great moment by the end when the student asks his mentor brilliantly sadistic J K Simmons where do you draw the line This is the very premise of the film and this is what the film is really about It is far beyond the story of success or one man s journey to realize his dreams nor is about the brutal relationship between the student and his mentor though it examines it perfectly The weight lies not in them but in the complete lack of empathy for them The human characters are merely tools of a superior concept They channel an unbridled ambition which is the core of the film its real protagonist For those who hear not the music they appear mad or if you prefer driven But what if they re right Finally it is a movie of our time and for our times For generations brought up to believe they will all be great someday Who think they ve earned it with the birth certificate Well here s the spoiler it is that hard I don t know if the director writer draws from his own experience but he is definitely familiar with the concepts of sacrifice and commitment Great job Damien Chazelle you ve earned it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3162549/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2015,Absolutely the best film of the year and perhaps the past 10,Birdman is the pretentious heap that this film blows out of the water As an artist playwright film maker and writer I went into Birdman WANTING to love it But alas where the acting was good the writing was not Finally when it came Oscar time I got to see Whiplash This This This is a film about art and about struggle JK Simmons is absolutely incredible although his acting career has already proved he can do anything Yes he plays a hard arse teacher and there is the debate that this film pushes that mentality that the only way to push your students is to demean them but I see another side to it For me at least it was about the struggle we have as artists even just to accept ourselves as good enough JK Simmons is the embodiment of the demons all artists struggle with The entire film you are on the edge of your seat It s a beautifully simple story while still being a very complex film I ve seen all the nominees and this film absolutely should have been best picture Anyone that has seen it and gets it knows what we are talking about when we say that It has such passion and fever that it is a classic already I rarely say I have favorite films but this one certainly jumped to my top 5 It s a testament to great acting writing directing and story You d be amiss to deny yourself the chance to see it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3192084/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2023,"Intimidating, powerful and brilliant",I was very excited to see this film and I m kicking myself it took me this long This film drew me in and held me for the entire duration The story was not complicated and it did not feature a great deal of characters though it had me fully engrossed right until the final screen cuts to black The film is a simple story executed beautifully a person who is striving for greatness and will do anything to get there Miles Teller gave a great performance in developing his character Andrew s childhood passion into an isolating and life threatening obsession to become one of the drumming greats almost destroying his own humanity in the process Every experience became overshadowed with the desperation for becoming better Andrew s obsession was fuelled by the torment and abuse of J K Simmons character Fletcher Simmons performance was nothing short of incredible He was dominant in every scene he was in and his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor was very well deserved Fletcher s vision of potential for his students came with dangerous consequences as a result of his brutal methods The brilliant cinematography and sound only strengthened the film s ability to create tension in the viewer and to help understand the character s mind in the scene Tense moments for Andrew were at times fuelled by background drumming gradually intensifying Silence filled scenes with Fletcher to allow the viewer to feel a similar dread to his students 10 10 I was in awe of this film its characters and its story and couldn t recommend it enough,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8919145/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2017,Awesome movie !,The music content of this movie is simply awesome But that is not the only characteristic that makes this movie a great one is the story full of emotion and full of unexpected things I think that this movie has the power of making you to consider how much effort do you spend on your goals It is real that this movie may be going to extreme situations but you will learn lots of things This is my first review so I do not know very well what to write but I hope that you find this useful Enjoy,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633483/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2017,"for a directorial debut, this is the way to do it!",If you ve seen Full Metal Jacket imagine ol mild mannered Sgt Hartmann obsessed with molding his youngsters to a pinnacle jazz musician he may be irreligious too but the Virgin Mary ain t ever there to dump on him about it Terence Fletcher played by J K Simmons is this unwavering perfectionist with a special fondness for one Andrew Neiman played by Miles Teller The significance of the father character is easy to dismiss on the first viewing but he does well in complimenting Neiman s dedicated practicing to mold his drumming skills into something Fletcher might someday deem praise worthy Very few storytelling dichotomies nowadays get as compelling as this and the immense tension which stirs between them feeds into an unforgettable yet pleasantly unexpected climax While Neiman s flaws are very present and almost unshakeable they re more indicative of how talented of a writer Damien Chazelle is His directing of this movie is redolent of how I perceive most David Fincher films sadly no climactic scene revolves around the contents of a box Brad Pitt done maximized that storytelling plot point for all of time It s very hard not to appreciate this film s directing acting or cinematography but even if they re aspects you were underwhelmed by it s a definite film worth an honest viewing,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3789287/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2020,Not sure why this is so highly rated,The trailer showed promise and whiplash looked like it was going to be a great movie However I left the movie feeling as though it was incomplete The film failed to make me connect on an emotional level with main character Andrew and therefore left me feeling like an awkward fly on the wall during most scenes The film also seemed to glorify the idea of putting yourself through physical and emotional abuse in order to attain approval from those above you There was no moment of liberation or growth from the main character and likewise there was no moment of realisation or acknowledgement of wrongdoing from the villain Overall it felt like an incomplete film that almost condoned abuse if it leads to approval,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5832911/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2017,Excellent Music Filled Drama,With the rise of his newest film La La Land I ventured back to what got Damien Chazelle s name in lights Whiplash or Chazelle s starring entrance film that won fifty plus awards nationally and internationally is an amazing film incorporating both music and drama to create an incredible story of one s rise to fame As an aspiring drummer Andrew Neyman Miles Teller lands himself in the hot seat Neyman was put there only by world renowned conductor and musical connoisseur Terence Fletcher J K Simmons at an elite east coast musical conservatory After being placed in Fletcher s top notch jazz band Neyman finds himself constantly at war between being the best drummer and maintaining his sanity In the dark with an absent mother and a poet for a father Neyman wants to make a name for himself and his unforeseen talents From the dialogue of Chazelle there is an uneven yet critical balance of intense heart wrench with additions of disgusting humor that particularly adds to J K Simmons character The plot set in an almost unoriginal light is captured with a dynamic new relationship between teacher and student Broadcast in New York at a prestigious music driven school seems to be a common theme among rising millennials Chazelle took this clich and added in a layer of depth with a fight between choosing one s mental health or being a household name at the hands of one professor In a word Simmons can be described as fearless The portrayal of an elite die hard conductor skyrocketed with his bipolar personality tendencies One minute you are awed and hypnotized by his presence and confidence and next you are wanting to run for cover from the cymbal he is trying to hurl at your head for rushing the tempo The capabilities shown by Simmons to entice beautiful musicians to want to be in his band to the blood of the failures he marks on the walls of the conservatory want to make you pick up a set of sticks while also playing away your mental stability A standing ovation and round of applause to Simmons and a well deserved win for Best Actor in a Supporting Role In a wild change of events our hero seems to be a bit in the shadows or should I say overshadowed by his supporting cast Teller seems a bit shy or timid when delivering a character who is supposedly not going to be scared by one egotistical Satanist conductor We experience the pain and suffering Neyman goes through when constantly beaten down or trying to prove himself by blistering up his hands and cutting off relationships with his loved ones However we miss the cutthroat shocking change in the end by a musical shift in power between the conductor and the musician in his last performance shown on screen As an impeccable duo in a hero villain type of way Teller and Simmons create an entirely vibrant drama that makes you feel alive The work of Chazelle simply cannot be undermined with hit after hit in his musically combative story line and unbelievable emotional content,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3646476/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2023,"Good, then not so.",For most of the of the runtime it s a very good movie well executed but wraps up bringing about a sensation like a dull version of a Black Mirror episode minus the science fiction of course The two main antagonists end up looking entrapped with each other in an unexciting sort of mechanical way I d praise mainly the portrayal of drum playing as action scenes sometimes like duels with even a war like scene once when the guy enters the rehearsals room bleeding and injured after a car crash however you wanna feel about that Yes it could have had him connected to a blood IV line whenever he practices yes it could have had him wearing lead bracelets as well but here s not like that in Whiplash it s venting off or getting off,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9350954/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2015,An intense gem of a film that will be overlooked.,I ll cut through the fluff I am rarely inclined to go out of my way to write a review of a film but after just finishing Whiplash I couldn t help myself Whether or not you are a musician and or into jazz do not let the plot of the film leave you discouraged a theme that pops up repeatedly throughout the film Short and sweet this movie is about a freshman at the best music school in the country who wants to be one of the all time great percussionists Beyond his dream the film shows the physical and emotional abuse he endures in the process It is a true underdog film the only difference here is that the underdog is already incredibly talented beyond his years It is no doubt one of the most tense movies I ve watched in years It left me smiling during certain scenes and with my jaw dropped during others The dialogue is extreme and even was reminiscent of Full Metal Jacket at certain moments The Oscar nominations will be revealed a few days from now and if J K Simmons doesn t get a nomination for Supporting Actor I will be extremely disappointed If he does indeed get the nomination he will be near impossible to beat in my opinion Granted he just won the Golden Globe for this category earlier tonight If you have a free night go check out this movie It might not be for everyone but in the very least you ll be taking a chance on a low budget film that currently is not getting the recognition it truly deserves,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3160747/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2015,Wildly entertaining ride with a young drummer through a music academy makes us think about the meaning of art,Is great art only the product of great suffering And by creating comfortable and nurturing educational environments are we only condemning young people to mediocrity This wildly entertaining ride with a young drummer through a music academy proves neither proposition yet makes us think deeply about both providing fabulous jazz performances and grueling drum solos at the same time That s probably all I have to say if I had to say more it s that movies like this are definitely worth the price of admission I could have gone to the opera that night albeit at ridiculously short notice but I m glad I made the decision to stick to the movies,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3154900/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2015,Tension is built through the entire film.,In order to successfully give tension there must be a conflict worth caring about The conflict must be something of great importance to one of the characters in the film and must be in some way relatable or understandable to the audience so that they care about it In addition it must also create an atmosphere that anything could go wrong at any moment These two aspects of a film combined create tension Throughout the entirety of Whiplash you are in a constant state of tension You feel everything that Miles Teller s character Andrew is going through and you want him to succeed just as much as he wants to Just when you think things couldn t get more intense it throws something completely unexpected your way and this happens with every single scene This is the definition of wonderful writing You feel that each character in the story cares and it is brought to life by the wonderful performances by all of the cast members And those performances wouldn t be possible if it weren t for some amazing directing And that amazing directing wouldn t be possible if it weren t for the wonderful writing It was the type of writing that made my heart beat with every pound on the tension building instrument the drums I recommend it greatly to all those who happened to stumble upon this film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3163169/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2020,Never give up or be stubborn?,A simple film tells of a drummer at one of the leading music schools A young man who is still in the junior bench who is looking for his talent by a respected perfectionist conductor This is where the story of the drama begins A conductor who is known to be a perfectionist and wants everything to be right one of which is the drummer He actually wanted the young man to give his best in playing drums Seeing the potential that exists in the young man The pressure was so heavy by the conductor that it forced the players to bounce Like a double edged knife if it can take its meaning it will end well if not it will not be good We sometimes know that humans need pressure to unleash their potential When humans are depressed usually the true abilities will come out by themselves Back to this story The young man initially felt pressured by the guidance of a conductor Until finally he forced his situation until he bled even though he still practiced Until he got into an accident he still insisted on joining the competition He still wants to play The goal is he doesn t want to lose the competition He wants to strive to be the best Until finally he became the best Can finish a song stunningly in the end A quite interesting simple story about Determination Never Giving Up Stubbornness being one If you start giving up on something watch this movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6255705/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2015,Great movie with quick witty humor!,This movie is definitely something you would not expect from a music related movie JK Simmons makes the movie and Miles Teller does a fantastic job of playing the student pushed to the edge The plot centers around a hard teacher passing his students to be the best they can be but the constant dry and witty one liners make the movie There is nothing intense about this movie at all except the swearing and teaching techniques which edge on bullying Both actors are real life musicians and honestly do a great job If you like crude but hilarious one liners with a music theme then this is the movie for you,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3381428/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2015,"My first review, and I just had to write this...",first of all I have personally now seen all of the nominations for best picture for this years Oscars Some have been marginally OK some have been good but only one has struck me to be truly great and that film is whiplash We must not forget here that this is a film made in 19 days and by the backing of a few million bucks whilst others nominated have cost 20 times that However despite its unusually small budget for the film world we live in today the intensity and passion delivered through the actors and director is simply astonishing J K Simmons gives us a performance to get excited about portraying a brilliant and often volatile music teacher who is seeking a sense of perfection from his new drummer within his band portrayed by the excellent Miles Teller This film is as raw as it gets fast paced and at times tough to watch for all the right reasons and i beg all film lovers to go and see this masterpiece and inevitably recognise that this film proves to us that a 100 million budget is not always needed to create a film that will surely be talked about as a great in years to come And now i hope and expect the Academy to do it justice and award Whiplash with the best picture award come February 22nd,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3172180/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,Whiplash,Whiplash There are no two words more harmful in the English language than Good job Talent is the gateway drug to misery In the most ferociously terrifying film in years a young jazz drummer spends his days working for the opportunity to study under an acclaimed instructor at one of the country s most elite music schools When he finally lands a spot he s dealt a savagely vicious reminder to be careful what you wish for Thus begins Whiplash Easily 2014 s best film this is a cinematic manifestation of the barbarity cruelty and depravity that arise from unyielding ambition The never ending quest to be the best is one that often leaves its traveler with bumps and bruises rather than fame and fortune WHIPLASH is unyielding and unrelenting in its journey of sacrifice and self improvement and writer director Damien Chazelle hits each beat with a confidence and stride of a filmmaker with ten times his experience And then there s Mile Teller and J K Simmons the most awe inspiring cinematic pairing in years Through blood sweat and tears these two tear through the screen with a raw bloodthirstiness that you can neither bear watching nor rip your eyes away from Their embodiment of wicked electricity boils over onto the screen in a way that no two other actors could have accomplished Whiplash is everything movies are supposed to be about high wire emotions acutely fleshed characters and a story that leaves you both exhausted and wanting more That s why Whiplash is the best film of the year So harmful or not I m going to say it Good job,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3164877/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2023,"Meh... It was OK, but also a bit meh.",The acting was very good but the directing was a bit heavy handed There were so many scenes of the guy drumming until his hands poured with blood Seems unlikely And so many close ups of his face as if he was in a boxing ring sweating and blood dripping onto the drum kit It just seemed a bit boring and over the top The kid was obviously driven but it was not clear why he was so driven to be such a good drummer What was his backstory He seemed to be pretty well off reasonable family life divorced parents well adjusted but here he was playing drums like his life depended on it Why was he prepared to cop so much abuse from his teacher What point did he have to prove and to who The story with his girlfriend went nowhere The characters were not at all likeable And the story itself was really simple guy wants to play drums teacher is really mean Then he seems to team up with the teacher in the final scene It all just seemed a bit unrealistic and a bit lame,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9418591/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2015,Pure Brilliance,I was offered to see this movie Didn t think of it much especially after watching the trailer twice as I thought it s rather dull After watching it I can say this The movie was amazing but you have to witness it yourself As the emotions it makes you experience cannot be felt by reading It starts rather slow but it builds up just fine to the finale Why I gave it a 9 Because in my opinion it lacked a conclusion though it isn t necessary at all I d just prefer if it would have one Besides that it was pure brilliance as it got me heavy breathing and experiencing something I have never experienced before,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3186220/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2015,Wow. Just wow.,J K Simmons and Miles Teller were amazing This movie was an experience You really felt for the main character and you could just feel the frustration he felt throughout the movie Probably my favorite movie to date I highly recommend watching this movie I always enjoyed J K Simmons natural representation of being an asshole but he took this to a whole other level There really is nothing like it in my opinion I have seen countless movies with the whole coach tries to mentor his student but I feel that they always come off as forced and fake J K Simmons was able to pull it off by a long shot and it made the movie enjoyable Give it a try and don t listen to all the hipsters saying that it sucked because I almost gave in to it and I would have regretted it had I known how good this was,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3169075/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2015,Energetic,I waited to see this movie on the theater knowing that was a music themed feature I was right in that decision The movie tends to have that short film soul it goes straight to the point from beginning to end the story is simple but well placed and executed we see what we need to see a few main characters and settings in other words minimal but powerful this movie cuts all the bells and whistles we tend to see in an Oscar nominee feature to focus on making us feel empathetic with the story The movie gave us moments of true energy on the screen the tension we felt from the actors was great and real J K Simmons truly delivers that professor that we feared at school but at the same time the one that we learned the most because he drove us to our very limits Miles Teller delivers an excellent use of facial expression he puts us on the spot of what being a student used to be the want to be the best Also Teller gave us an outstanding representation of being a drummer I applaud the fact that 40 of the soundtrack we hear in the movie was actually him The movie lacks of great cinematography and camera direction it s really simple and there is nothing special about it that s why I m rating it a 9 instead of a full 10 I love the fact that it came from a short movie and ended being a full feature film nominated and awarded by the Academy without losing it s soul in the process Damien Chazelle gave us a great story and I am sure I will keep an eye on him,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3190271/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2015,"Crazy, intense and shocking movie about young jazz musician student.",You would never believe that its possible to make so intense music drama movie like this before you have seen it Andrew Miles Teller is a young musician student who wants to be one of the best and fastest drummer Teacher Fletcher J K Simmons has a little bit crazy role again He is known to me from prison series Oz Everything in this movie is very authentic and intense Music hearing and other senses as well are present all the time Shockingfactors in this movie points either bad good or grey area of getting better Teachers methods reminds military Way to be the good is steps that are made of sweat blood and doing again Its just music that really matters,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3179757/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2015,Above and beyond my expectations.,I was commenting the other day that I haven t seen a great movie in quite a while Please don t think I m some kind of film snob because that couldn t be further from the truth In my opinion as long as a film entertains it has done its job However it s been a long time since I ve finished a film with a little voice inside my head whispering Bravo as the credits rolled This is that film I will admit that I am positively biased toward this film because I am a drummer myself but I think anyone with an interest in music or cinematography will enjoy this one JK Simmons really brings it in his role as the borderline psychotic instructor pushing his students to their limit and beyond But the star of this film is the relatively unknown Miles Teller From the moment he hits those drums it s obvious the actor has been a drummer for quite some time in real life Remember everyone fawning over Jamie Fox because he knew how to play some piano notes in his role as Ray Charles in Ray Well take that talent and multiply it by 100 Miles Teller skillfully works his musical talent along side his acting talent to portray the timid yet talented 19 year old Shaffer Conservatory college student with dreams of becoming a legend Does his notorious yet respected Jazz instructor help lead him to greatness or will he buckle under the pressure You ll have to watch this movie to find out which I HIGHLY recommend you do,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3219343/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2016,"Powerful, Kinetic Film",Going into Whiplash I had high expectations mostly because the movie adverts are literally covered in praise Once watched these expectations were met certainly a beautifully done reminder of what makes a move great It makes you illicit many emotions most not particularly wanted but welcome when watching a movie and keeps you thoroughly engaged For the entire 110 minutes you are in the world of Whiplash and never leave due to fantastic writing and dialogue of the two main characters mesmerizing camera work and terrific performances of the leads Miles Teller J K Simmons A dramatic musical marvel whose only shortcoming comes from any scene where Teller and Simmons aren t sharing the screen,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3551337/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2015,How a movie can just grab you and take you on a ride you weren't expecting,I can honestly say that it s the first ever time i ve wanted to watch a movie twice in a row At the end of Whiplash I was so excited and tense at the same time that I had no idea what to do with myself The only thing I wanted to do was watch it a second time Whiplash is by far one of the best movies I ve seen in my life I was captured from the start almost hypnotized by the intensity in this movie It wasn t even the story that was so captivating because any movie could have the same plot and turn it into a will he won t he underdog becomes greatest movie No this movie had so much more to it a depth that you rarely see nowadays It s all about the psychology of the two main characters They are both painfully difficult to understand and are both completely messed up in their own way As soon as they meet something happens Something profoundly exciting but scary at the same time and it s almost mesmerizing I d seen J K Simons play some pretty good parts But with this movie I was praying for him to win an Oscar The level of sophistication he brought to his character is just unreal You completely forget that it s the same guy playing the nice dad in Juno I kept on wondering what the f I would to if I was the one in front of him He inspires fear self consciousness rage and a thirst to do better By the time this movie was finished I was clinging on to my sofa unable to think of anything else than this movie I had so many questions in my head and the kind of questions you have when a movie doesn t make sense I was basically struggling to figure out exactly what had just happened because there were so many different possibilities and ideas going through my head and I wasn t able to stop thinking about it for days Plus the music is pretty awesome,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3261528/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2015,baffled as to how it got the rating,OK I think this is a very mediocre movie After hearing great things on the radio and TV and mentions of nominations we watched this with great expectations Sadly i cant understand how its rated so well It just didn t click with me at all Thought it was pretty predictable and so it lacked depth I even found myself tuning out Most of the acting was fine to good just didn t think the story was good enough The young lad was fine at acting but the character was just not great I didn t connect with the character or acting It was just a wishy washy insipid type of experience Maybe its because it came along with some other good films and I thought how is it even being mentioned Just one of those I don t see what others see Husband thought it was poor too Surely were not the only ones lol,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3279493/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2015,No other word for it: Brilliant.,Having decided to watch this on a whim it turned out to be a fantastic way to spend just under two hours I often found myself surprised at the amount of tension and anticipation that was created from a story that was essentially about drumming It doesn t take a musical background to tap into the sheer passion that all characters exhibit throughout the whole film The chemistry between the teacher student duo of Teller and Simmons was incredible and I found both characters surprisingly insightful with great depth and complexity In saying that all of the characters seemed to have some level that it was possible to understand even the parents and girlfriend It had my attention right from the start and it was definitely the best movie I ve seen in a very long time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3280528/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2015,My own critic,The most fascinating thing about movie is that cruel reality that gives you the feeling that you re in the movie The screenplay is associated to the screenplay of life of each of us so everybody can understand the point and the message of the movie J K Simmons was brilliant acting Fletcher and I enjoyed in every single move that he made in his role Congrads to Miles Teller His role was deserved with so much hard work and patience which who took him to the perfection I rated this movie with 9 because I give 10 to the movies that contains complex and mysterious screenplay No matter what this movie is one of the most realistic movies I saw and I enjoyed,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3344151/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2016,A wonderfully stressful high tempered masterpiece,Whiplash is the definition of a high tempered film This film has a very solid and fast opening with a great introduction to the two main characters Neiman and Tanner where we quickly learn their positions in this film With its fast pacing and its stressful tone created by the almost constant drum music and the easy to understand story this film will have your complete attention from the opening and will have you sitting on your seat throughout the whole film all the way to its perfectly executed third act Unfortnately there are a few quite predictable points in the plot which is why Whiplash is only getting an 8 out of 10 instead of a 9 out of 10 Whiplash is a masterpiece A predictable masterpiece but a masterpiece none the less,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3563673/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2021,"Superb cast, intensely built and a brilliant movie",As a self proclaimed movie buff and a jazz fan the subject of this movie intrigued me from the start Whilst the story of a promising young talent pushed to the limits by an uncompromising mentor is not new there were so many things about this movie that sets it apart from regular ones The performances for a start are brilliant especially the leading two actors Both believable and intense throughout The direction style was somewhat different There was no reliance on emotive music visual flair or any other gimmicks The blood and sweat both metaphorically speaking and otherwise were captured without tricks The dialog was also fresh and subtle The making of a great movie relies on capturing human emotions without expressive words or over acting and this movie had it in abundance The psychological twists completely caught me off guard as well which is no easy task Jazz and rock lovers must see the movie but I think it s powerful enough for anyone who enjoys subtlety and psychology of the human mind Overall I think the movie worked because it felt real and raw I came away a little shocked a little inspired and very impressed Superb movie and hats off to those involved in the making of it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6694043/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2015,Truly an excellent movie,I grew up in an education system that there is almost no top score 10 or 100 As one of my professors said you have to be perfect to get 100 and no one is perfect that is why do not expect to get 100 from me I strongly believe in that This amazing movie reminds the education system I was in and deserves 100 Whiplash is cinematic adrenaline there is not a single moment that you can afford to miss in this movie The music is brilliant Chazelle s writing and directing are something to behold Teller is really good and Simmons delivers one of the most memorable performances of the year Even if you couldn t care less about drumming though Whiplash is a thrill to watch,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3268553/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2015,Thrilling,I think it is the best music feature film that I ve seen so far It had me on the edge of my seat more than once although it is not an action movie The cast does not consist of the most famous Hollywood stars but Teller and Simmons play their roles remarkably Maybe some may see the mentoring in this movie as too violent I think that especially when your family does not support you in pursuing your dream your only chance is to have an objective person who believes in your strengths and who will push you out of your comfort zone The theme of pushing yourself and pushing someone else to the limit and beyond perfection is timeless therefore I hope that this movie will not be soon forgotten I can t even begin to talk about the music It seemed that people were skeptical because it is about Jazz but even a person who hates Jazz will like it The music does not overwhelm the movie it goes smoothly together with the plot I enjoyed it and would watch it again in a heartbeat,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3178922/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2019,"Man, this was like ~",a rollercoaster from start to finish Goes to show you how much movie magic can come from such a small budget The editing and pacing was razer sharp Something about it feels fresh It is like the quick psycho hip hop style established in the nineties with great flicks like Pi and Natural Born Killers but this feels more focused and clean Chazelle s second and in my opinion greatest cinematic achievement to date,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4763600/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2019,Beware of the final scene,Yes the acting and story are good The dynamic between student and teacher interesting Enjoyable film as many microcosmic films are a glimpse into an insular eclectic world BUT the last scene of the movie stretches credulity too far There is no way this could happen in a prestigious jazz setting Yea it gets the message across that the student finally finds his voice in defiance of his teacher who acknowledges it but how By letting the young music student take over the proceedings completely Fun to watch but no setting such as this would ever see something like this happen It was almost laughable Can give this film a six but man I m a musician a drummer and no way could any musician swallow the crescendo of the music and the movie itself without forcing down a gag,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4980965/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2019,Maybe I don't get it,Maybe I m missing something here but this movie seems to be promoting abuse as a method to achieve perfection It is incredibly painful to watch,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4599180/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2016,Whiplash: Drummed Deep Into My Memory,A steadily increasing drum beat mercilessly crashes through a narrow door which sits at the end of a dingy dark corridor where a young man plays his drums with ferocity This is the opening scene of a movie full of harrowing passionate scenes with a plot full of twists and turns J K Simmons depicted the character Terence Fletcher a strict conductor Fletcher is a confusing maze of aggressive and passionate traits and emotions Simmons goes from throwing a drum across the room that crashes directly above the head of a student to encouraging a young girl to continue her dream to pursue music Simmons speaks and strides with the utmost confidence and poise His demeanor shifts from calm to yelling and snarling in a matter of moments He is a very active and reactive author Simmons uses whatever you give him whether a line or a prop and uses it to express whatever emotion he is trying to convey Miles Teller plays Andrew a young drummer who goes to a prestigious university for the musically talented known as Schaffer University In this University he plays for a Jazz Band conducted under none other than Terence Fletcher a much esteemed educator Teller s acting in this film can only be described as very lackluster In Whiplash Teller seems to follow Simmons lead in the scenes which would make sense seeing as this is Tellers first big role He should have taken the scenes and added his own spin to the scene to truly leave his mark This becomes quite apparent in the scene in which he is accepted into the Jazz band His character should have been ecstatic at this opportunity However this was not the case Instead his face served as a blank slate during this important moment The volume of his voice was at a constant low and somewhat shaky even feeble throughout the production As the film proceeded he did become more diverse with his intonation and volume but it was not enough to redeem his performance in my eyes The more he played the role the more he learned to manipulate it The cinematography led by Sharone Meir was stellar The movie was based in three main colors A deep forest green a rich maroon and a bold mustard yellow Whiplash is almost completely doused in these dark colors which really gives the movie a dank atmosphere In the entire movie there was only a single scene of light and for Andrew Miles Teller it was a key game changer The clear control of light and framework helps establish the overarching mood of this film as well as illuminate the internal struggle of the characters Justin Hurwitz the music director did a stunning job of managing the music Throughout the movie key moments were highlighted by a dulled jazz tune played in the background Other times when Andrew is playing for example the music is a bright tangy kind of jazz clear cut and angry most of the time The music alone could have told the story in and of itself Director and Writer Damien Chazelle did his best work with Whiplash While his other movies weren t as well received Grand Piano Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench and more they can be overlooked because of this film Some might decide to avoid this film out of fear that they won t understand the musical lingo Watch it anyways This movie was easy to understand even without a musical background Overall this movie was excellent and deserved all of the nominations and awards it received I am thrilled for Damien Chazelle s future work,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3420827/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2015,Straight Up Banger,I ve seen some bangers in my time but wow now this is a banger My favourite movie of 2014 by far Whiplash was directed by Damien Chazelle who could poss by my new fave director just because of this absolute ripper of a film Miles Teller plays a totes cute aspiring jazz drummer who wants to be one of the greats His drive to be the best he can be is defs inspiring and so much that even non musos such as yourselves could appreciate it Pushed by J K Simmons who plays a big meanie of an instructor Teller s character experiences the highs and lows of what it takes to become a professional musician 8 10 for Teller 10 10 for Simmons 9 10 bangers in the form of musical banter Loved it,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3223321/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2015,My point of view,I don t say that often in fact never There aren t enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema but a thematic experience with layered subtext Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer Terence Fletcher a renowned teacher at said college sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band at the expense of emotional distress This is a brutal character study absolutely savage This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows I ve never been so compelled in a drama ever and this is my 5th viewing The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession there is no right or wrong way to achieve this the question is is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them Fletcher leans towards the latter so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed you can see his passion seeping through the blood sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher s methods A simple story but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J K Simmons duelling in anger Speaking on Simmons the best performance I ve seen in years Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously he deserved every award Teller was near perfect as well conveying innocence and vulnerability Look I can talk about Whiplash forever It s a masterpiece End of review,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3216191/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2021,"Great concept, disappointed by the end",Powerful meaning and film The end needs to be better to really complete this movie After the first part of the film the end really disappointed me,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6480923/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2021,A forgotten masterpiece,I recently re watched this film and forgot about how gut wrenchingly moving this is Though the movie is about a drummer who aspires to be the next great the direction of J K Simmons character is just masterfully orchestrated by Damien Chazelle I honestly think this film was snubbed in 2014 despite that year being stacked with fantastic films and 3 of my top 10 favorites from this decade released that year If this movie was pushed by Hollywood and marketed as well as it was made I have no doubt it would end up being a timeless film It shows the gut wrenching grit of an ambitious man and realistically depicts the ups and downs on the road to success It even leaves us with a surprising finale where we don t really know whether he would succeed or not However I advise anyone who has not already watched this film to not expect anything It is a great film but I fear that the worst thing to do for a film that does not get enough attention is to blow it out of proportion I simply ask anyone who is reading this to give the viewing this movie deserves and come out of it satisfied and inspired It is not a happy film and every scene is full of impact Happy Viewings,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6536162/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,I could watch it a hundred times and never getting tired of it.,Great soundtrack and great performances from JK Simmons and Miles Teller that makes you empathize with Andrew and at the same time being difficult to hate on Fletcher As I said the music is awesome and makes you want to listen to it again and again This movie makes you think how far could you get to achieve perfection but also shows how toxic perfection can be sometimes,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6566798/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2021,"A beautiful and intense chaos that combines passion, obsession, and perfectionism.",Whiplash has become an international success directed by Damien Chazelle who was only 29 years old this exhilarating masterpiece hit the cinemas in 2014 and now at the grand old age of 30 he has already been nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar and looks set for a long and prosperous career all thanks to the phenomenal and success of his drummer Andrew Neiman Miles Teller and drumming teacher Terence Fletcher J K Simmons This fascinating movie will absolutely put you through a roller coaster of emotions Being a classic music lover and an instrument player myself I related to the endless pressure and frustration as well as the ambition and dedication that the passion for music requires It got me completely swallowed inside especially due to the amazing character development and performance throughout the movie This movie made me question what the crazy desire for success can actually do to someone What is life really about Does being THE best really matter Is that what happiness is This movie emphasizes the harsh reality in the music s business what does it take to be THE best Andrew a first year student at a prestigious conservatory in New York City goes through series of pain frustration and craziness and his ultimate goal is to be the best jazz drummer of all times it is everything that matters to him unless we will never be satisfied He gets so absorbed in his pursuit to be remembered that it literally drives him crazy We even have the strict teacher Fletcher challenging him pushing him even more His methods to do this are however questionable Fletcher seems to think greatness is either cultivated or it is wasted Andrew works so hard it literally destroys his hands I can feel however that behind the intense hate and anger they feel for each other there s this part of them that understand one another the same insane perspective of what life is about of what it takes to be the absolute best this understanding develops and becomes clearer throughout the movie Fletcher puts everything on the line to bring out the potential in his students and Andrew stands out as we can see him becoming more and more blinded by his determination to achieve the top This movie showed me how a simple passion can easily consume you how a simple ambition can become an obsession and drive you crazy It is somewhat a toxic relationship between Andrew and Fletcher it really depends on how you see it Despite Fletcher s heartless and harsh methods of teaching we later find out that his intentions are more pure that we expected he wants to intensify the potential of his students We can see Andrew s progress and evolution throughout the movie thanks to his challenging professor however he puts him through hell This is best emphasized in the movie by the use of colours the light made a strong impression This hell metaphor is expressed by warm colours yellow and orange domination when Fletcher and Andrew are in presence of one another enhancing on one side the pain and suffering felt by Andrew but on the other side the controversy in Fletcher s way of teaching This orange aesthetic indeed feels like hell it shows the intensity and hate in most when they are both in direct contact it feels like a burning atmosphere again like hell Andrew even has a moment where he tells Fletcher where is the line When do you go too far and discourage people from playing at all Andrew s rage is also resonates with the strong orange but it can also represent how Fletcher challenges him how his life becomes more complete with something to fight for This movie is basically a pot of water getting hotter and hotter until it boils over What are people willing to sacrifice to become the best I would have liked to have learned why this was so important to Andrew A lot of people are satisfied with the simple things but not him success was his only life purpose A beautiful and intense chaos that combines passion obsession and perfectionism A movie that will make you forget where you are,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6721179/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2021,Extraordinary movie,This movie is quite simply one of the best I have ever seen The movie somehow manages to interest those that are not even fans of drum and bass type music and that alone is a massive achievement As far as acting talent goes this movie did not lack any element of that at all Miles Teller who plays the main character Andrew is an underappreciated actor and this movie quite simply proves that Jk Simmons especially shows us his truly stunning acting abilities and to be honest he is easily the best aspect of the entire movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6904828/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2023,10/10,Whiplash is one of those movies that you could say small and big at the same time Made for several million dollars although at times based on patterns it kidnaps even puts you in a kind of trance And just like the main character they accompany the viewers pain tears and sweat The story presented in the film may seem secondary And while the construction of the scenario based on the formula from zero to hero is actually nothing new the way it is presented is a certain sensation Chazelle s film cuts itself off with a thick line from hackneyed treatises on achieving success and making children s dreams come true Instead of a sentimental happy ending there is an opportunity for an open discussion about breaking human boundaries making sacrifices in the name of professional self realization and the price that comes with it all,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9239254/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2023,What just happened?,That was really bad I have no words I literally thought maybe I was watching the wrong movie after hearing all the good reviews I love JK Simmons too great actor And Paul Reiser another great actor But wow Had to vent after watching that Nothing made sense or had any tie to reality or music which would be fine for the sake of a movie we kept hoping it would have some really creative twist that would make it all make sense but it never came We were left dumb founded and confused and amazed at how this got such great accolades I think that s why I wanted to write this review I admire the writer director for making a movie that takes a lot of effort and stuff But how it was hailed as being such a great movie is truly confusing I never leave bad reviews for anything I just had to share my thoughts here I feel like the world is trying to play a trick on my or something Haha Good gracious Terrible,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9379146/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,So much depth and emotion in a short story.,Such a beautiful movie the music and emotions and acting Miles Teller is AMAZING in this as is J K Simmons It s a short story but includes so much depth and emotion and it really sucks you in It s frustrating captivating and one of those movies where you get so into it you forget about the world around you for 2 hours This is a MUST WATCH,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7763132/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,Had me thinking about it for weeks afterwards! Wow.,This is some of the most powerful acting I ve seen Miles Teller is brilliant as the lead and is outstanding with the way he conveys emotion As well as this J K Simmons truly deserves his oscar with a blistering performance that keeps up the tension throughout The music is also excellent which is expected from a film revolving around a percussionist I would recommend this to anyone and everyone,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8095272/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,The best,Andrew is ready to do anything for success He plays drums all his free time constantly listens to the best musicians in the world and dreams of working in the best orchestra in the country Terence Fletcher the conductor of such an orchestra takes him in Fletcher immediately finds a way to get the guys back on the ground and make them work even harder Debutant big cinema Damien Chazelle made an incredible movie The director managed to create a project in which everything is so convincing and reliable that the picture could be silent but it was still understood and loved in any degree of usefulness of the globe With minimal investment Chazelle made a film about what one wants to talk about endlessly The script written by the same Chazelle gradually introduces the characters and their destinies With each new scene Andrew gets closer and clearer and Fletcher is hated and greeted first from the first seconds of his appearance on the screen The multi station director managed to discover with incredible candor and simplicity about the suspicion of obsession and its consequences while Chazelle does not slip into unnecessary moralizing leaving it to the public s discretion Mizel Teller finally got it in which he was able to show everything he led Throughout the whole picture the actor drags the main stage on himself and fully fulfills all the expectations placed on him J K Simmons just breaks every chain it takes He can not get sick but you can only obey and play along Melissa Benoist is the only notable actress in the project She managed to create a rather memorable image and the possibility of empathy for her heroine was discovered A crazy cast of producers who were able to work on distributing films of completely different quality They managed to give Chazelle the opportunity to realize himself and not drown in the vicissitudes of the studio Sharon Meir made a truly musical picture Because in the case of the emergence of the concept of music and cinema are inseparable the operator further strengthened this understanding The audience became not just observers but full participants and not only concerts and competitions but life and the main characters Composer Justin Harwitz assembled and wrote one of the best soundtracks of the year Music plays one of the most serious roles here along with the actors Obsession is an almost perfect movie The creators managed to shoot a real high quality super musical work for the ages in which everyone will find something for themselves and certainly no one can remain indifferent to it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7774580/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2022,Surprisingly Good!!,I really enjoyed this film and thought the way it was delivered was excellent The relationship between the professor and students was crazy and at time uncomfortable Is this what it takes to be great I wonder how hard I will have to work to create a film like this I wish there was more story lines like this one out there and not worried about offending people It s great to shine light on toxic environments but we don t always have to be so woke in our films Films are there to express freedom of speech and tell a story Great film watch it today and enjoy some popcorn It will make you want to be a drummer,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8594397/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2023,Could anyone be like Andrew?,Andrew is amazing as a drummer but I have a question could anyone be like Andrew He seeks perfection he wants to be the best he has motivation and dedication but I think without Fletcher he would not have been able to get where he is of course Fletcher was horrible and an asshole with him but I think it was necessary for Andrew to get where he got I think the movie would be better if it was bigger because I would like to see and that was more explored Andrew and Fletcher I liked the end I would not change anything in it The point is that I think if it was bigger I would have more time to address more topics and I missed it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8906463/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2022,a masterpiece of the modern day,As the film progresses the intensity and pressure only increase as Fletcher pushes Andrew to his physical and mental limits in pursuit of perfection The tension between the two characters is palpable and the acting by Teller and Simmons is superb with Simmons in particular delivering a powerful and unsettling performance as Fletcher One of the most striking aspects of Whiplash is its portrayal of the cutthroat nature of the music industry and the sacrifices that musicians must sometimes make in order to succeed Fletcher is portrayed as a ruthless perfectionist willing to do whatever it takes to get the best out of his students even if it means resorting to extreme methods of motivation At the same time the film also explores the theme of the transformative power of art and the sacrifices that artists must make in order to create something truly great Andrew is shown struggling with the demands of the music industry and his own personal demons but ultimately it is his passion for drumming that drives him to persevere The film s finale a climactic drum battle between Andrew and another student is a thrilling and emotionally charged sequence that showcases the incredible talent of both actors Overall Whiplash is a beautifully crafted and emotionally intense film that explores the complex relationship between art and perfection The performances by Teller and Simmons are top notch and the film s depiction of the cutthroat world of the music industry is both realistic and thought provoking Whether you are a fan of jazz or not Whiplash is a must see for any moviegoer,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8747373/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2015,Took me back to High School,What an amazing film So powerful in so many ways Simmons was incredible in his role of the teacher I had a chorus teacher in high school and he was just as intense and just as passionate for music This film definitely captured the essence of what goes on in real schools when such passionate professors teach Oscar well deserved for Simmons Miles Tedder is such a revelation in his role It s clear that he allowed himself o be fully submerged in his character What I really loved was how he was able to step to separate himself from his previous roles This was as raw of a performance as you could have gotten In the scenes where the camera was close up on his face and you could see the drops of sweat that was absolutely beautiful It allowed me to see and to feel how much emotional impact the films circumstances had on the character Miles definitely needs an Oscar in the near future because he is brilliant,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3241755/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2014,"Rhythm, Passion and Blood.",There has been an incredible amount of movies about kids who are following their dreams and have a tough couch that they hate This formula has become quite clich luckily Whiplash escapes it Ernest Hemingway once said about his profession that There is nothing to writing All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed This line thought directed at his job as an author is in fact applied to life The movie s main character has this perfectly applied to his talents He isn t a Mozart who was born with the incredible gift to perform as musician He as most out there had to become a good player through practice Sitting down at the drums and bleeding Thought there are a certain number of characters who play an important part in it such as the ones played by Paul Reiser or Melissa Benoist the movie truly goes around Andrew and Fletcher who receive tremendously incredible performance from Miles Teller and J K Simmons In fact the entire crew did a good job with this movie and exactly because of this it is one of thee single greatest masterpieces of the year For anyone who decided to follow something that matters for themselves ignoring how profitable it must be this movie will captivate you For anyone who has a passion towards jazz the drums or simply music this movie will captivate you For anyone who simply loves movies with well done shots and a good screenplay this movie will captivate you,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3124257/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2015,Drive,In this modern times of ours greatness is often seen as somewhat as a given in the sense that is effortless and only for a chosen few Other symptom of that is the dumbing down of the modern society we are always looking in our televisions with a infinite number of channels with an infinite number of idiots that never aspired or never will aspire to do something great but lets talk about the movie or i will never shut up Whiplash is a great movie keeps you on your seat as you look into the struggle of Andrew the lovable main character of the movie as he tries to become great in what he is doing During the movie as Andrew is picked up by his mentor or enemy we learn that becoming great is not something that is fun not something that is rewarding is not something that is gonna tuck you up at night and tell you that everything will be alright if you fail is not The two most harming words of the English language are GOOD JOB We Will have to make choices and this choices will hurt and we will not like them but thats life and in life you can t have it all I personally am always picky about the timing of movies like a great song a great movie should be perfectly timed moments of tension make or brake a movie and in this regard this movie like a good song is right on time The acting is of course perfectly delivered Miles teller makes a likable character J K Simmons a great antagonist and that makes a perfect orchestra of a movie with all the elements that make a good band play and they are all on tune,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3170267/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2023,That Thing You Do had better drumming...,That is the worst representation of drumming I ve ever seen on film That kid is terrible AND nobody that s obsessed with Buddy Rich would set his toms up or choose sizes like that It s hard to take the kid seriously when he s so bad at it I realize that most people don t know enough about drumming to really notice but this is supposed to be a film about a drummer so good he got accepted to a conservatory If you d picked a melodic instrument you couldn t have gotten away with this AT ALL but it s just drums right The drumming in Across the Spider verse was more accurate than the playing in this film,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9285173/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2015,Jazz lovers go crazy,My heart was racing I felt an urge to just get up and clap until my hands bleed That was me 2 seconds after a black screen ended one of the most satisfying and thrilling experiences I ve had The writing witty Simmons s and Teller s acting is Excellent so as to not lose myself in descriptions The plot has a fresh feeling to it I don t feel like I ve seen this story before with different characters or anything like it to be honest The Hero s Journey is definitely not present here The cinematography has a sense of humor to it the writing is great the acting superb Everything in this peace of art was carefully executed BUT all those qualities were overshadowed at least for me by the soundtrack It felt like Buddy Rich and Dave Brubeck were playing for me More than once I ve caught myself syncopating to the songs My ears were grateful for the pleasure of listening to such good tasteful music To my awe the soundtrack feels more organic and integrated than in Tarantino s work I spent the next 10 hours after watching the movie drinking a good beer and listening to Dave Brubeck Yoko Kanno The Seatbelts Odd Ones matches perfectly the movie s ambiance I ve always denied the existence of such thing as a favorite movie but I got to say THIS is my favorite movie,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3169008/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2015,Outstanding film!,I was around a year late to watching Whiplash because I honestly wasn t drawn in by the idea of a film about drumming it didn t seem like my thing After seeing many great things about this film I gave it a go and it was one of the best decisions I made Whiplash has fantastic characters with two that absolutely stand out Miles Teller s character Andrew is played brilliantly and I was rooting for him all the way through without a doubt J K Simmons brings an outstanding and intense performance and for me was one of the best supporting roles I have ever seen The films tension is fantastic and there are so many gripping parts and even near the end I was sat drumming to myself because I was so hyped and excited Overall the film is fantastic with great performances great directing and a gripping story,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3381239/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2015,"Thrilling, emotional, and REAL",I was recommended the film by a close friend who is a professional Blues player I rolled my eyes as he talked about it I thought it would just be a promo for his lifestyle I ve never been more wrong The movie is full of real world worries and troubles especially in the cases where one pursues passion rather than the dollar The movie give you a whole new appreciation for Jazz and the not so dying art of live band The characters are fantastic But what really sets this movie apart from the others is that it dosen t care about the everything turning out just right that other movies constantly barrage us with But that dosen t mean it ends badly There are little tones and scenes that anyone who has ever thought about giving it all up can relate to Whether it be work or passion you can feel it Give it a go I m glad I did if you re still not sure look up the trailer there s a scene between Fletcher the teacher conductor and the drummer protagonist It sums up the feeling of the film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3280770/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2015,Sell Everything You Own And Buy A Ticket Now,I m not a writer I ve never done a review before but I was so inspired by this film that I have to share this with whoever will read it I ve just seen Whiplash exactly an hour ago in fact and I have been utterly speechless since then Everything about it the cinematography the acting the directing and the composing was the most polished and perfected version of itself that it could possible be No film has ever triggered such an emotional and physical response from me I don t think I breathed for the entirety of the film and when I walked out I could barely put one foot in front of the other My whole body was filled with a state of utter shock I don t know if it was shock at how incredible it was or shock at the way it made me feel but oh boy it made me feel something Another thing that baffles me is the overpowering message it leaves What resonates with me from seeing this film is the desire nay NEED to achieve greatness And I don t mean getting 100 on a test paper I want to be one of the greats If you pardon the reference On a more personal level acting has always been my aspiration but after witnessing this masterpiece I have a new ambition I don t care if I act direct produce compose or film I want to make something as good as this I just can t believe what these people have created If you spend your money on anything even before paying rent you should pay to see feel experience this marvel,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3167906/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2015,Excellent Movie amazingly shot in 19 days,Excellent performances all around the drumming and musical backing is top class Was skeptical when sitting down to watch but after a few minutes I was hooked Would recommend to movie goers Just watch out for the younger viewers as there is quite a bit of bad language Ranked very highly because it is so compelling in subject and moral undertones Fantastic performances by Miles Teller who had me convinced he was a musician first and and an actor second definite Oscar nomination in my book J K Simmons who is looking in great shape for his age is perfectly cast in the role of teacher mentor bully and musician A magical performance by both of these actors who dominate every scene To be honest apart form the musicians the rest of the cast were just a minor support as these two went about portraying their characters with commitment and ease all at the same time make sure you watch this one for sure,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3180478/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2015,A true ride,I watched this movie at home one night after a friend suggested it as a very intense movie I ve checked this title out a while ago and was not attracted to the subject or anything about it for that matter After 107 minutes my brain was intrigued my heart was mesmerized and i stopped for a moment just to ask myself what has happened I was drawn into the plot and i lived it side by side with the actors i watched myself fail and get up again die and be reborn This movie reaches out to you and pulls out the inner self that wants more that knows it can do more and keeps you on the edge of the seat for the entire duration I started laying out in bed all covered up ready to fall asleep and ended up on the edge of the bed just 10 15 inches away from the screen Excellent performance from Miles Teller and J K Simmons This is what a movie should be about Passion intensity willpower Best movie i have seen in a long time and one of the few that have ever spoken to me Go watch it It is worth every second of it,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3184477/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2015,Intense and unforgettable,Whiplash is a story of a young musician who will stop at nothing in his search for greatness Intense from beginning to end I was left terrified by JK Simmons performance which is easily the best of his career Miles Teller also shines and shows his talent both in acting and drumming This film will most definitely increase your heartbeat and leave you thinking Not only is the story well written it is an original tale which asks the question how far is too far when striving for your goals It is a unforgettable film of relations and personal struggle which we all go through to some extent There is also the plus of excellent music After seeing this picture earlier this week I am already itching for another viewing 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3184627/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2015,Window on the creative process,There was a lot of human drama here but as one who has had more than a casual involvement in the realization of a music piece or two I was impressed with the film s accuracy of that process And it is a process One reviewer lamented an irony that jazz was supposed to be so free but the film reduced the music to something mechanical Well I hate to bust anybody s romantic notions but when a conductor is assembling a music piece utilizing 10 20 50 100 or 300 individuals it becomes a primary necessity to discipline the mechanics before all else any individual expression belongs solely to the conductor who has determined well ahead of any of the other participants what he wants to hear to make a piece tight This film was all about that discipline the time blood sweat and dedication involved in an uncompromising artistic pursuit of excellence and the people who do it There is always a lot of human drama involved in the pursuit of excellence bloody taped fingers sore muscles stripped out vocal cords the anguish of missing the mark and the joy of overcoming Whiplash is an excellent representation of exactly how a music piece is polished The only weak spot I saw was how the actor portraying the conductor did not seem to grasp the importance of what a conductor does on stage If you are a band chorus or orchestra member your ears are filled with the sounds of the people in your immediate vicinity you absolutely cannot hear what the people across the room are doing So on stage the conductors job becomes essential to keep everyone together and cue sections in or out as needed All members have eyes on him or her at all times for these purposes It is far from an ornamental role and the actor did not quite seem to get that Other than that Whiplash is exactly how music is made Very real,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3192406/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2016,Genuinely intense; Recommend to all,Whiplash is a film that brilliantly integrates film and music and I genuinely loved it The film displays a high calibre of intensity emotion and raw talent in all aspects of the film and I wholeheartedly support everything that comes to it and more J K Simmons performance is spectacular simply put and there s not much more I can say about it The film is worth it just for the performance Miles Teller also pulls a great performance particularly in his ability to drum Nothing looks faked and it is only with excruciating attention to detail that you would notice any errors those with a previous knowledge of music may notice more however The film is beautifully shot and the intensity of the film is fantastic with a third act that will leave you breathless It s hard to put into words how impressed I was by the film but I would recommend to any and all who are looking for a perfectly made intense film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3549764/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2015,There will be blood!,Who said that really good movies these days have to be big budget and star studded Whiplash put simply is the story of a young music student hopelessly enamored with ambitions of becoming a great jazz drummer Andrew wonderfully underplayed by Miles Teller is the anti hero of the film Fletcher played by J K Simmons is his teacher nemesis at the conservatory There are basically two main sets in this movie a dark concert hall and a dark rehearsal room at the conservatory Sound boring and mono dimensional Think again As Shakespeare has proved timelessly the epitome of a good play is something that can still be riveting without car chases fight scenes exploding buildings etc by virtue of its plot and dialogue alone This movie simply doesn t need any of this irrelevant eye candy to carry along what is fundamentally a simple premise masterfully acted The cinematography is dark and brooding and augurs well for the character of Fletcher a complex and nasty man Intermingled with his rages and browbeating we see glimpses of a tender man who suffers for his craft He is a perfectionist and demands nothing less in his students When he spies Andrew and invites him to an audition with the main band we are left wondering if he is just messing with Andrew s mind or genuinely interested in seeking the best talent for the conservatory The question is not resolved until the end of the movie and its resolution is indeed one of the pillars of the plot Andrew is so driven and passionate about his craft that he is willing to sacrifice friendships and love interests Neither pain nor serious injury can stand in the way of taking his rightful place in his mind anyway as principal drummer He wonders if anybody at all really understands him including his sports minded family but the answer soon becomes clear This movie rests on the strength of its characters Paul Reiser plays a very minor role as Andrew s father but the supporting cast becomes almost invisible to the audience as the film progresses It would be nitpicking to say the resolution of Andrew s love interest left something to be desired but that is my only criticism the rest if virtually faultless That being said by the end of the movie we feel that we know a lot about the two main protagonists their frailties their shortcomings their pride There is military grade cursing in this movie but strangely it doesn t seem at all out of place Whether they are mortal enemies or admiring friends is a leitmotif that hangs in the air like a suspended note throughout the entire film There are so many twists and turns in their relationship that we are left wondering until the denouement There is nothing predictable in this movie The pacing is good the 107 minutes just fly by The surprisingly yet satisfyingly abrupt ending has no need for an epilogue A few simple gestures and glances say more than an additional superfluous scene ever could The final scene is both thrilling and inspiring If you want a break from unbelievable car chase sequences and the epic disaster movies that have recently been flooding the silver screen this movie will be food for the soul and a source of wonderful refreshment,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3269827/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2015,One big question for one big film,Whiplash is the best film I ve seen in the last two years It s a story about a guy a teacher and a drum set or more simply it s a story about the human soul and its perpetual oscillation between touching the sky and lying on the ground At the very end of the day what the entire film tries to do is to put a Hamlet like question to the audience it s better to live a simple life without pain free from troubles being an average man or is better to devote every single breathe of your existence to the dream of becoming the best man in the world at doing something no matter what from the pusher to the musician To be or not to be the best one that is the question There are no easy answers to this query the film itself is opened to interpretation but one thing is to say Whiplash gives the best non answer EVER to the questioning The way the film deals with the issue is somewhat awe inspiring So simple so powerful In many ways is possible to say that the film s style is minimal One big topic Two main characters Few locations No special effects Another reason for loving it So clear so accurate A surgery operation to the heart of one of the most intricate dilemma of the history of human beings Does the film move a big criticism to the American Dream to the constitutional and maybe childish right to the pursuit of happiness Who knows Anyway one thing is made crystal clear Epicureanism is not for everybody,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3270390/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2015,Horrifyingly Brilliant,This movie is absolutely incredible I love everything about this movie It manages to turn jazz music into some kind of monster something that brings fear to mind at the mention of its name The acting in this movie is amazing The lead Miles Teller shows an extremely believable portrayal of the young and ambitious drummer Andrew and manages to remain realistic throughout the entire film even in some of the more demanding scenes However nothing can hold a candle to the year s Best Supporting Actor Oscar Winner J K Simmons whose performance is absolutely terrifying and scarring He steals the show with his extreme bursts of anger and intense methods of teaching In fact every single actor on this film manages to be outstanding They all show a great realistic enactment for each of their characters respectively Most of the film is extremely intense and hard to watch and is not for the faint hearted as it shows in full detail the many tortures the characters endure that will leave viewers either on the edge of their seats or hiding behind their hands in horror Overall the film is traumatising yet beautiful and in my own opinion more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar than any of the other films up for nomination that year because of how disturbing yet wonderful the film shows the more torturous side of the music industry,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3289158/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2015,Enticing,This is one of the best films I ve seen in a very long time I did not expect to enjoy it since I went into it without an appreciation for Jazz music or how passionate musicians can be However Andrew s journey was both emotional and psychological and I was very intrigued by how his relationship with Fletcher formed By the time the film had ended I had developed an interest in the Jazz music scene and I had so much more appreciation for the intensity of performance art and the work that goes into it I see the pressure that is put on musicians and other artists to be perfect and that even though music is supposed to be a means of expression sometimes there is no room for error,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3291176/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2015,Movie of the decade! Watch straight away!,This movie was flawless my favourite movie ever The acting was brilliant and J K Simmons scared me for days after watching the film Miles Teller did a great job as playing Andrew The story had me hooked and the third act had me shaking If you re into intense dramas I suggest watching this movie as as soon as you can It s a great music flick showing how determined Andrew Miles Teller is to impress Fletcher J K Simmons and to show that he can be one of the best jazz drummers alive 10 10 I would definitely watch it again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3328932/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2016,"""A story of courage,skills and devotion""",Whiplash is maybe one of the most emotional movies of 2014 It s touching moving and deep It speaks about Andrew a talented drummer and his troubled relationship with a music teacher who expects much and wants to spill out every drop of talent from each young musician All the movie moves around Andrew s ambitions and his struggle with the huge expectations of the teacher which are going to take him into madness The result is an extremely touching drama full of pain physical and also mental and also charming I liked every single moments and i advice it to anyone who wants to spend about 2 hours of his life in a raw touching emotional way,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3595244/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2015,A must watch!,Whiplash is cinematic adrenalin It is a deeply personal and vibrantly alive drama Damien Chazelle has taken a relatively unadventurous subject like the relationship between a music student and his teacher and turned it into a thriller built on a social perspective of what it takes to make it in an increasingly competitive and cutthroat world How far are you willing to push yourself to succeed How far are you willing to push someone else to force them on the path to success Carried by two electric performances Whiplash is as breathless as a drum solo rising and falling just as the hopes and dreams of its protagonist climb and crash A young man named Andrew Neyman Miles Teller is practicing late at night at his New York music school when his drumming catches the ear of the infamous Mr Fletcher J K Simmons the most important teacher at the school and the conductor for its most important jazz band Fletcher pauses listens barks a few orders at the young man and moves on seemingly dissatisfied with what he heard Andrew goes back to his routine class band telling his dad that his opportunity to move up probably passed him by Of course Fletcher s dismissal of Andrew in that first scene is just the first of many examples of what could be called his teaching style Fletcher likes to tell the story of how Jo Jones threw a cymbal at Charlie Parker s head one night when he messed up thereby pushing him to the breaking point at which he became Bird Without that cymbal would music history be the same Would Charlie Parker have gone home refined practiced and driven himself without the threat of not just failure but physical violence Fletcher uses that kind of barbarous technique on his students throwing furniture calling Andrew names playing mind games and physically torturing him with repetitive drum solos until he bleeds on the kit But that blood feeds his musical passion And Andrew blossoms asking out the cute girl he s been afraid to talk to before and taking first chair in the most important band at the most important music school in the country Miles Teller so great in breakthrough roles in Rabbit Hole and The Spectacular Now does the best work of his young career here as Andrew He is naturally apprehensive but he also knows he has a drive a passion a skill that is unique Teller walks that line never faltering by making Andrew too confident while also carefully letting viewers see the spark within that Fletcher fuels Even after the kind of inhumane mind games and physical abuse that should produce legal charges has unfolded on screen we find ourselves drawn to Fletcher He s not 100 wrong when he says that the most dangerous two words in the English language are good job Whether you think it s the right approach or not we re in an era of praise where encouragement is the teaching tool and every kid gets a medal for participation Have true talents been left to wither because they were over watered Simmons perfectly captures the drive of a man who believes his abusive degree of pressure is the only way to produce a diamond While Whiplash would be a notable film purely for Teller and Simmons performances it reaches a different level when one considers the execution of its tempo Editor Tom Cross and cinematographer Sharone Meir often put us right on stage with Andrew and Fletcher It is captivating to say the least particularly in a climax that produces more tension than any action film or thriller this year The title refers to a song played multiple times throughout Chazelle s film It could also refer to that sense of wowed exhaustion you ll feel when it s over,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3347505/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2017,Perfect,I have never related to a character more than I have in this film Like the main character in the film I too am a musician I see the drive and passion behind the character that makes him a successful drummer This movie tells a great story with a great cast AND inspires me to work hard and accomplish my goals This movie was perfect,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3677393/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2015,Exhilarating,The speed of the drumming was the speed of my heart throughout this movie Intense thing to say right The feeling throughout the entire movie is something that you wouldn t want to let go off but once the film finished I had to go back and watch it once more It might seem crazy but this couldn t be anymore true These feelings of intensity and edge of your seat sensation is something that only comes around once in a while but it is derived from the sensational performances of Miles Teller and J K Simmons Miles Teller plays the character of Andrew Neiman who is a highly self driven person with dreams higher than what most people would be able to visualize No matter what people tell him he continues to practice over and over with the end goal of being the fastest drummer he can be It may seem like an easy character to play but it truly takes an actor who can show determination least of all play the drums Without a doubt the performance of Miles Teller is exceptional as it is a rares occurrence to see a person able to show blood sweat and tears so realistically that it makes a person think have I ever worked that hard J K Simmons plays as Terrance Fletcher who is almost a morally bankrupt person He is the brick wall holding Andrew back from achieving great success but without him the movie would have no jazz When the audience is first introduced to Terrance he comes off as a person who gives everyone a shot at joining the best conservatory however throughout the movie he shows his full colours All he was asking for is perfection from Andrew but does throwing a chair at him help Though to fully understand what I am talking about the movie must be watched Overall great movie great cast line up and exceptional dialogue almost unforgettable,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3367608/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2015,"""Not my Tempo"". Unlike Terence Fletcher, this film was at the exact tempo required for 107 minutes of adrenaline fuelled filmmaking.",A brave bold film masterfully casted I ve never taken a moment to listen to jazz and I probably never will do not let the dull sounding plot of the movie stop you from watching this great film I had intended to watch Whiplash for a while but never got around to it until last week and I think I have the beat and rhythm of the film still stuck inside me You ll almost die in anticipation at the final scene some of you might but I did not and it meant I got to watch the whole enthralling 107 minutes of film again the very next day If at least one of your eyes or ears work and you like film this is a must watch Bravo Chazelle,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3368752/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2016,"Whip it, whip it good",Whiplash is by far my most intriguing film of 2015 not only intriguing but highly under appreciated when it comes to popularity and recognition This movie literally gave me chills especially at the end just stunning Miles Teller is possibly a leading man some day but is only sub par here clearly the writing went into J K Simmons supporting character and boy did it show J K Simmons showed me his true greatness in which I thought he never had Was I proved wrong Absolutely Simmons truly is a powerful actor who deserves to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight and Sir take a bow Whiplash is about a skilled young drummer who is promoted to his school s top tier jazz band where he Teller clashes with an obsessive music teacher Simmons and his intense methods A must see film,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3407340/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2017,"Moving, captivating film",This movie was far better than I expected it to be After being told to watch by a few people this isn t normally my type of film I thought no harm in giving it a go Id say to defiantly watch Whiplash its such a moving heartfelt film which captivates it watches I m not one for jazz music but put this aside and you don t necessarily notice The acting was superb from both lead actors and they made it feel like the were generally invested in the characters they were playing I would recommend watching this film to anyone even for the experience,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3723279/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,"Astonishing, Mind-blowing, Glorious.",This movies defines the class of good cinema Utterly phenomenal and simply takes you to hidden world behind the stage,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5583080/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2016,Inspirational movie,This film combined between the intensity of the story and the great performance from main actors The technique that the director and the cinematographer used in the film was a helpful method to tell the story The mobility from static shots to steady cam shots to a dolly and choosing many close up shots to emphasize the specific and important moments in the film I believe because the director was the writer of the story he knew what he exactly wants Moreover the editing in the movie was beautiful and diverse The most significant part when the music starts it becomes the leader of how the scene transport from shot to another Tom Cross the editor was playing a music too but used the editing process as an instrument The message that you may get from the film is whether our dreams are big or small we must fight for what we believe in Never giving up even if we pass through some difficulties and obstacles That seems obvious when we see Miles scarifies his relationship with his girlfriend when he felt that she prevents him from achieving his goal In my opinion the film was very successful according to the clearness of the message the fluent of the story and the great performance I think this film should have won the best picture of the year basing on its message outstanding performance creative writing and the efficient way of using the cinematography to tell the story Also this film encourages the new director to do the same hard work that Damien Chazelle did,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3550990/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2019,Utterly outstanding,I ve never actually written a movie review before but man this film just stands out so well music is a big part of my life and when my friend told me about this film I just had to sit down and watch it and it s just blown me away Everything about this movie is nothing short of perfection the dialogue the acting the chemistry between the two main characters the overall tone of the movie I won t go into the story because you honestly just need to watch it its such an inspiring film for anyone who s ever thought of giving up or for anyone just chasing a dream Whiplash has been one of my favourite films this year that I ve had the pleasure of discovering and you need to stop reading this and go and watch it because when it comes to the close of the movie you won t be able to look away and you ll walk away from this movie feeling something else entirely,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5006664/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,Gets the blood pumping,It s hard to explain the emotion that Whiplash evokes For a film about music the silence is just as dramatic sometimes more so A story about being pushed beyond your limits in order to achieve actual greatness the film manages to challenge not only our emotional understanding of how far is too far but a full realization of the blood sweat and tears it takes to perfect a craft Simply put all aspects of this film had me on the edge of my seat until the last beat that puts you right back at the beginning,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4267115/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2016,An outstanding masterpiece,Incredible with myself being a musician I thoroughly enjoyed this film although I plead that if you do not play an instrument you will still find this film extraordinary Miles Teller did an amazing job with his role as the protagonist but I think the real person who stole the show was J K Simmons His character was one of the scariest villains if you could call him that that I ve ever seen put to cinema I think it was the fact he was a teacher and this feels relateable to most people so people can feel the fear pain and pressure that comes from his character He 100 deserved that Oscar As for the cinematography it was incredible really well shot with intricate details Definitely go watch this film you will not regret it I assure you,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3563059/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,Rising Tempo A real Score!,A beautifully crafted film despite it s visual limitations mostly inside studio it delivers symbolic musical images combined with explosive drama raising the question how far should or can student be pushed to achieve their potential The film sets the mood from the get go like the a drum roll the doesn t let go until the very last cut The cast all deliver a great crescendo along with the direction and editing The music jazz speaks for itself In my opinion a must see movie for lovers of any musical taste,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6438989/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2016,Unrelenting Passion,Some people chose to characterize Whiplash as a sports movie except that the sport is competitive jazz band If Whiplash is a sports then it is one of the greatest sports movies of all time Whiplash is a study on passion and how it can both drive and consume us Andrew Neiman Miles Teller is our protagonist desperately trying to make the team He attends a fictional Julliard knockoff with the intent of joining the schools infamous jazz band and becoming one of the greats Neiman is a bit of a likable geek but can be annoyingly arrogant Teller perfectly balances these likable and unlikable qualities so that we as an audience still feel comfortable rooting for him Neiman has no qualms with putting his literal blood sweat and tears into becoming the best drummer The real star of the show is the director of of the jazz band Fletcher J K Simmons Not for the faint of heart Fletcher does more than wave his hand vaguely guiding already talented musicians he pushes them Fletcher s methods for pushing his students are questionable to say the least Don t be surprised to hear any racial or homophobic insults being thrown around Similar to the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket Fletcher will simultaneously inject fear and humor into a scene in the most terrifying ways Director Damien Chazzelle smartly allowed J K Simmons some freedom with his portrayal of Fletcher telling him he wanted to see a demon on screen Chazzelle and editor Tom Cross deserve a great deal of credit for how the film was shot and cut Every musical note is perfectly matched with accompanied visuals that will have you fully immersed and tapping your feet along,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3574047/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2017,Breathtaking and inspirational !,It is surely one of the rare movies that succeed on almost every level starting with the great performance by the actors the stunning work Damien Chazelle has made I found this movie one of the best musical and drama movies ever because this wasn t just an ordinary movie it was simply a piece of art in this movie you feel the emotions and the ambition to reach your goal no matter the difficulties Neiman a talented drummer who joins an academy to improve himself in order to reach greatness but his dream is controlled by a harsh instructor who doesn t tolerate any mistake JK Simmons did an amazing performance and deserved the Oscar award for the best performance in a supporting role The sound editing was marvelous you feel each and every musical instrument when the musicians start playing Miles Teller who played Neiman was actually a real drummer Neiman showed us how to overcome pain to reach your aim When you dedicate your life for a purpose you won t stop when you re tired you stop when you re done We should thank Damien Chazelle for letting us live inside this film and enjoy every scene of it and learn many lessons that change our mentalities,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3863424/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2017,Whiplash,A tense and emotional film with fantastic performances from Teller and Simmons they are one of music s best chemistry in movie history The script keeps pace with endless and exhilarating tension Damien Chazelle instantly has my respect being this his only second work It is well driven behind pitch point direction,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3644596/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2016,"Intense movie, had me sitting on the edge of my seat",This isn t your typical Hollywood feel good movie I thought teller and Simmons were amazingly cast both such believable characters you forgot this was a movie I wouldn t say this is necessarily realistic in the sense that a teacher would be able to get away what Simmons did nor that great Music is really about absolute perfection I m a musician and perfection doesn t necessarily create great music In any case I don t think that was the point of this movie I felt it was about our own vanity and also at what point does vanity cloud our potential Also if the things that drive us really make us happy and what are we actually sacrificing by only focusing on it Id never survive a day with Simmons for a teacher but he actually made some good points that shock us to see on film In our more and more protected and censored society where any uncomfortable situation or topic is now off limits in schools are we now a bunch of of gummy bears that cant deal with any emotional ordeal before our delicate emotional state is flattened We flee and tell before we stand and fight Im not agreeing with his methods but its true that if everyone is good enough there is not much incentive to do better,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3579992/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2016,a MUST see for any creative person/artist out there.,This movie is by far the best movie for a creative person to see It touches on all of our number 1 goal to be great The quest that we all find ourselves on is what are we willing to sacrifice to be the best at our craft This movie touches on a high staked sacrifice turned to an obsession on being the best It shows us that we will never be the greatest in our own eyes because we are our biggest critics It is such a relevant story because when you are not satisfied with where you are in your career you tend to want to just shut down and shut everyone out Whiplash demonstrates the dangers of doing such a thing This was a great story and shows other actors writers directors musicians cooks dancers singers etc that it is important to practice your craft but it is necessary to take care of your own mind body and spirit as a person too,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3590017/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2016,Motivational for Musicians,This movie is highly motivation for musicians to keep you on track and push yourself and get in car accidents joking about the ladder Miles Teller is an extraordinary actor in everything he does but he makes this movie gold working with J K Simmons who also made a huge dent in making this a masterpiece As a musician myself I understand the roll in being a complete perfectionist I ve never had a trainer Terence Fletcher like Andrew had in this The amount of anger and frustration the two build towards each other as well as the same amount of passion that they have is what builds this movie towards a perfect ending of what you ll have to see for yourself I would rate this a 10 out of 10 as my first review This is a buy a physical or digital copy as it is something you can watch over and over again,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3596368/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2017,Best film of it's year,During the year of it s release Whiplash was up against some fierce competitors like boyhood for example Although Whiplash didn t get all of the awards which it rightfully deserved in my opinion it did get released The performances from both Miles Teller and J K Simmons were so powerful topped with the intensity of those drum scenes For someone learning how to make films like myself Study this one Beautiful cinematography amazing audio and phenomenal writing,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3827404/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2016,Exception,Usually I react the same way to movies by and from and depicting the liberal elite of New York as any God fearing sheep of the Church of Eastern alliance would with disdain and boycott However I am going to make an exception this time as you know that I am a not so bad musician in my own right and as you can see in my youtube videos can rock a mean piano and sing to the audience s delight Heck I am even a martyr of my art since my drummer which rehearsed with me for years in the basement of 24 Sussex Drive drank with me and watched movies with me was arrested for child love reasons by RCMP However since I am a musicians myself and jazz it up for the party for Sheldon or the Kochs I had t watch this film and maybe you should too,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601203/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,A Complete experience,I found this movie to be one of the few masterpieces I have seen in a lot of time It had me totally engrossed and hypnotized The music and direction go hand in hand Incredible and unforgettable performances by Miles Teller and J K Simmons keep you glued to your seat and as the story picks speed you find your heart beats rising with it The movie also introduces you to the cut throat world of music at the same time depicting the social struggles musicians could face as they sacrifice their relations with friends and family in an effort to try and achieve a glimpse of greatness It has been quite some time since a movie took me on a journey so effortlessly as this one I definitely recommend this movie for lovers of movies with a soul,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3608278/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2017,A film with impact,A thrilling drama about perseverance grit and insanity more than about music starring Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman a student of New York s best music academy and J K Simmons as his wayward tyrant teacher Fletcher These two people tailor made for each other will stop at nothing to achieve their goals and it s really amusing to watch the fight the competition between them This is also a philosophical film which does make you think a lot about eternal values of our life Love or dream Life or fame The main character Andrew Neiman made his choice Again it s a psychological movie rather than a musical You just can t sit still because of excitement and strain bursting out Although I couldn t see the character s great love for music I recommend Whiplash for the inspiration and 1 5 hours of enjoyment it gave me,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3834137/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2017,A creditable achievement of the goal to be one of the greatest... or not?,A story of a persistent nineteen year old boy and a teacher who is close to madness Was it just a normal Fletcher s behaviour dependent on his momentary impulses or a tight knit plan of making Andrew a great drummer And if the second answer is right why this plan included so many dangerous moments Fletcher likes to repeat an old story about novice Charlie Parker who was nearly decapitated by a cymbal that Jo Jones threw at him As we see Fletcher shows a similar intimidation but the first situation was only a legend and we can t say the same in Fletcher s case What if Andrew hadn t dodged the cymbal However these two characters turned out to be tailor made for each other as Damien Chazelles himself said and the plot becomes a story of their confrontation Andrew winds up getting into a lather and refusing all moments that aren t connected with jazz So how can we spot it A creditable achievement of the goal to be one of the greatest or just the influence of humiliation by passionate teacher Whiplash stirs up a lot of controversies The only thing we can say for sure it s a really sincere and thought provoking film because it s a story based on Chazelles own impressions and doubts,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3843568/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2020,It's more than a movie,There are no two words in English language more harmful than good job Fletcher said to Andrew This quote deeply dropped into my mind Avoid people who only praises you their words can stop you from pursuing your dream You should always tell yourself that the sky is limit Just follow your dream and don t seek compliments Yeah it should be but if no one gives you critics even not reasonable you won t become great You need work your fingers to the bone as Andrew did He said that he would rather die drunk broke at 34 and have people at a dinner table talk about him than live to be rich and sober at 90 and nobody remember who he was That is definitely a strong trait of his character So happy that this film has won so many awards it s really worth watching,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5393672/?ref_=tt_urv
