15 January 2004,Entertaining and Thought-Provoking.,Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it s all just a giant facade Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization Otherwise they re outsiders Try walking into a job interview without a tie You ll be thrown out That is the power of convention What if I asked you this question What do you want in life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming mantras and harsh self discipline Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s original screenplay is slightly edited The ending is more optimistic Problems aside Sam Mende s debut movie is one of the greatest I ve seen Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas It s an important film for society because there s so much society needs to learn One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because as he said I m not gonna watch a movie with a name like that Look closer 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593815/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2000,An Oscar well deserved.,This film is one of a kind After seeing this film last week I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach It left many questions in my mind and most of them cannot be answered In my view a film that makes me think after I watch it is second to none and this film certainly delivers in that aspect I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie as well as with the symbolism However what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening Carolyn Burnham isn t far behind Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley Ricky Fitts Thora Birch Jane Burnham Mena Suvari Angela Hayes and Chris Cooper Col Frank Fitts only add to the drama of this film I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable yet fantastic at the same time I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film as well as Alan Ball for writing it I don t think it could have been any better Rated R in the U S for strong sexuality language drug content and violence the film obviously deserves its rating However none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing and all of them add to the plot line of this film While I don t think that this is a film for children I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers While billed by some as a comedy drama I don t see anything about this film as funny Sure there are some comedic moments but by the end those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film If you want to watch a light hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama don t see American Beauty But if you enjoy films that make you think and are entertained by an excellent cast excellent directing and an excellent screenplay this film should be at the top of your list My Rating 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0591850/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2001,An American Masterpiece,This is by far one of the best if not THE movies of the 90 s American Beauty stole my vote immediately as I started watching it The idea and concept of American Beauty is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life He has a job that is degrading a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him a daughter who practically hates herself and is judged constantly as a looser But all of a sudden he sees his daughter s friend Angela and something snaps in him to do something with his life He quits his job and takes the dreaded by most Americans a fast food cook job He starts working out and doing some illegal substances Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves the precious moments in his stupid little life You have no idea what he is talking about I m sure but don t worry you will some day Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100 Annete Benning plays Carol Burnam Lester s wife She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale Her image in life is in order to be successful one most project an image of success at all times You can tell she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company Again seems horrible but it helps her in the end Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film The supporting cast Thora Birtch who plays Janie Lester and Carol s daughter is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family Mena Suvari plays Angela Janie s best friend Lester s crush and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town Wes Bentley plays Ricky the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful Some say that this was a very stupid scene but I disagree His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie Chris Cooper plays Ricky s father Col Frank Fits He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end Chris also should ve been nominated The most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits Ricky s mom and Frank s wife She was so beautiful and perfect Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky everything is so quite and she says I m sorry what Ricky says Mom no one said anything When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation Ricky says Mom I m leaving Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better she knows this is best and says OK Wear a raincoat Allison was just amazing and didn t get enough credit for her role If there could have been nominations for every role in this movie they were well deserved This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult It ll make you look again at your life and think What a great movie 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592440/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2000,"A deep, wonderful, penetrating film; extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about the American life.",I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice Everyone saying that it was so wonderful so touching so excited I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes Nevertheless this one was a certain exception It is a wonderful psychological drama a satire about the American community and about the American life dark painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters deep sarcasm on types of people in the community habits of behaviour such as if you want to succeed you always have to seem successful or never stop smiling parasites of the community and most importantly the treatment of people who are different who are freaky to some extent and eventually there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way although we have to wait for the very ending of the film to discover this With very deep and accurate exaggeration most of the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst the darkest sides of their personality while still remaining very human very touching and very involving the observer Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life in the characters described in the film The tragi comical events the little pieces of funny disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty the beauty in life and the way that we fail to find it for all our life the way we hide our feelings and emotions even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre The acting is truly brilliant the episodes are built logically coherently the dialogues are deep thrilling intriguing every sentence and every word is deeply constructed containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors The plot is very intelligently built constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society and an excellent ground for the actors An amazing movie strongly recommended 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593418/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2000,A little masterpiece...,American Beauty is tour de force cinema Sam Mendes brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own American Dream yet in the end only one character truly attains it Having seen Happiness only recently I could not help but draw comparisons both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people in their own unique way all strive to be successful or simply happy But here the similarities end the characters in Happiness undergo a self realisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence and go on to wallow in their own depravity Happiness shows no signs of redemption whereas in American Beauty the audience is offered a sense of hope of salvation though the characters must endure a similar fate or more accurately they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped The pivotal character upon which this theme centres is the father Lester played impeccably by Kevin Spacey He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work Seemingly beyond redemption Lester transforms from being a loser Mendes portrays this transformation admirably well he shows Lester on his path to enlightenment pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence These early scenes are well balanced forming a steady rhythm of TV commercial like vignettes which prove very comical if at times unsettling As Lester reflects in the film My life is like a commercial And how this rings true like in Happiness all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite depressed depraved and desperate Lester s wife played by Annette Benning is the most success driven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film s tone of moral conviction In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success is the maxim she adopts from the king of real estate Buddy King It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film for Benning s pawn life is all about keeping up appearances This is where Lester differs from her his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of normal life and following what his heart desires Lester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit as does his daughter and Ricky or pay the price as does his wife and the Colonel The irony inherent in this film and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life This film left me gasping for air its hyper realism conveys at the same time a portrait of the suburban comedy a jolting shock of realisation and a cathartic sense of hope Mendes depicts a certain people who to varying degrees all strive for a certain American Dream yet so few actually attain it Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the feel good label the beauty of American Beauty is that it sits half way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593291/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2003,Beautiful...,Probably the best film of 1999 This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director both winning oscars for their sterling efforts Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham a man on the brink of a mid life crisis who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari His daughter Thora Birch is as Lester tells us a typical teenager Angry insecure confused And his wife Caroline Annette Bening has an obsession of her own her public appearance Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside As life begins to improve with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms not that you d be able to guess from the tone of this film The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast who are all faultless No doubt Mendes theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L Hall another one of the five oscar recipients for this film All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece Not one person either cast or crew steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is Truly an ensemble effort 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593792/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2007,Close To Perfection,The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place perfectly Kevin Spacey s suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in The Ref and that could only be a good thing Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here Their marriage is a tabloid version of a Who s Afraid To Virginia Woolf Which means very close to someone we know The biggest surprises in the film besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera are West Bentley Chris Cooper Thora Brch and Allison Janney As I m writing this 8 years after its first release the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo I m very surprised that West Bentley hasn t become a major star He is amazing in American Beauty the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands the hardest to face up to and I went where he went Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film I believe is here to say,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1762332/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 1999,One of my faves of the year...simply great.,This movie was a joy to watch I didn t know what to expect when I came into it I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story etc but we ve all heard that before and had been disappointed but not so with this one Kevin Spacey plays this part to a T He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in Annette Bening is marvelous as well I think they both should be nominated The support cast is also spectacular Thora Birch Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled Teenagers in the film Of particular mention is Wes Bentley s performance worthy of a supporting nomination as well This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter s at a cheerleading exhibition he is completely infatuated with her beauty Using this as his inspiration he attempts to change all aspects of his life He confronts his marriage his job his ego and his libido The music in this film is also very well chosen There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion The plot can get rather involved but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go I was simply involved hook line and sinker See this movie more than once and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say trash This should be on the top of many critic s lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine My Rating 1 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592913/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2001,a very well done film that continues to amaze me...,When I first saw this movie in theaters I found it to be very funny When I rented it at home I found it to be very sad and complex Looking at it now I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood To some it may look trite or cliched or maybe too un ordinary to be worthy of its praise but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful After you ve seen it you know you ve seen something A few notable elements stand out The direction is superb this is visually a superior film for the director understands the subtle changes in tone The writing is equally compelling the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie The haunting music is also notable Lastly is the acting Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before and he can add this one to the list He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays but he simply disappears into the role Annette Bening is also fine a less strong role but she is magnificent none the less As the teenagers Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look her typical teenager role is fleshed out completely I enjoyed Mena Suvari s character equally It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim but her performance evokes both innocence and experience and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character And Wes Bentley as the video taping boy next door is easily the most original character At first he seems a little tense but like Spacey he sinks into the role His purpose in the film unlike anyone else s is a mystery thus making him the most enigmatic person Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience but never has a movie been known to move its viewers as much as this movie It truly says something about life no matter how predictable or tacky it appears this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives so therefore when they are over we each have something to remember,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592409/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2016,"Delivers a beautiful, lasting message",Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it s all just a giant facade Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization Otherwise they re outsiders Try walking into a job interview without a tie You ll be thrown out That is the power of convention What if I asked you this question What do you want in life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming mantras and harsh self discipline Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s original screenplay is slightly edited The ending is more optimistic Problems aside Sam Mende s debut movie is one of the greatest I ve seen Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas It s an important film for society because there s so much society needs to learn One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because as he said I m not gonna watch a movie with

14 December 1999,Far and away the best film of the year,What can I say except that this film really knocked me on my keaster I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price Boy was I happy when I left Not only was it worth the ticket I paid to see this film two more times This film is virtually perfect The acting is superb the story is magnificent the narrative is brilliant and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking absolutely loved the last 20 minutes What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done In a small character driven film such as this it is very unusual to have such great cinematography With this film there is something interesting going on in every scene not many films you can say that about In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films Three Kings Being John Malkovich etc Sam Mendes seems to have out done them all Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia I find it hard to believe that either film will out shine American Beauty This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year What s up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592996/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2001,"Look closer at this dazzling, powerful masterpiece of a drama.",Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it s all just a giant facade Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization Otherwise they re outsiders Try walking into a job interview without a tie You ll be thrown out That is the power of convention What if I asked you this question What do you want in life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming mantras and harsh self discipline Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s original screenplay is slightly edited The ending is more optimistic Problems aside Sam Mende s debut movie is one of the greatest I ve seen Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas It s an important film for society because there s so much society needs to learn One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because as he said I m

21 October 2019,My 600th review on IMDb and such a perfect movie for it!,Makes me smile at so many scenes well deserving of the 5 Oscars The writing and emotions are exquisitely powerful yet somber I absolutely love Kevin Spacey despite his personal life troubles and Annette Benning blows me out of the water every time I m delighted to own such a piece of art on Blu Ray American Beauty has been among my top favorites for a very long time I d say number 8 The Soundtrack is one of the greatest things ever to me this film is like a perfect tapestry after using the paint brush and Sam Mendes created it so well Hope my thoughts aren t to over the top I just very much enjoy this movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2010,"Mayn't be the most original movie I have seen, but it is still an outstanding movie",I wasn t expecting to like American Beauty but I did loved it more like The story mayn t be original at first glance but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable maybe so but they are quite complex Lester is a self described loser who is unwanted by everyone Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it I was like that with Vertigo What I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters but also the stylish filming haunting score side splitting scenarios the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar Annette Bening Peter Gallagher Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too Quintessentially American Beauty is just a wonderful funny and brilliantly performed and directed film 10 10 Bethany Cox,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2263717/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2021,Powerful,My name is Lester Burnham This is my neighborhood this is my street this is my life I am 42 years old in less than a year I will be dead Of course I don t know that yet and in a way I am dead already American Beauty is placed in an indefinite suburb somewhere in America there are indications that it is Chicago where a seemingly harmonious and quite ordinary family is going through the turbulence caused by the middle age crisis of both parents as well as the puberty of their teenage daughter A patriarchal family ruled by a conservative father a military man moves next door to them While the daughter of our antihero Lester starts a relationship with the neighbor s weird son and his wife has an affair at work he not so secretly obsessively falls for his daughter s girlfriend This black humor drama is only seemingly extreme and eccentric while in fact it shows quite realistically what many of us go through at various moments in our lives Admittedly most only in their heads and those who dare to take drastic steps usually hide it better But the fact that most of us would never admit such thoughts and actions does not prevent but perhaps only makes it easier for us to better connect with the characters and feel their drama more deeply A strong well written story needs actors capable of bringing it to life before our eyes American Beauty did not fail in that field either The excellent character study on paper makes the job much easier but you can always rely on Kevin Spacey for a really impressive role A man who somehow manages to be at the same time a nerd and a macho slimy and sexy a villain and a victim Sexual and emotional frustration and the middle age crisis are by no means an excuse for Lester s actions and yet Spacey awakens sympathy and compassion in the viewer rather than repulsion and disgust Annette Bening skillfully keeps pace with Spacey in the role of a frustrated woman trapped in a long extinguished marriage A woman who with the last twitches of common sense tries to balance between a family in disarray and a career that she can never raise to a level that would satisfy her There is also Thora Birch an unpopular teen escaping from the collapse of her family home in a relationship with the eccentric Wes Bentley as well as the insecure Mena Suvari who is hiding under the mask of a confident and popular cheerleader Her transformation from Lolita that seduces Lester to one of the most impressive scenes in the film where she is half naked trembling under Spacey does not deserve to remain unmentioned Although her character is secondary to the others I mentioned and only serves as a support for Spacey s Mena s performance is unfairly underrated And last but not least Chris Cooper who convincingly played a homophobic colonel and stole every scene in which he appears For me the two most striking things in this film are the use of red and the unusual disturbing sounds that accompany Lester s fantasies in contrast to the mainstream rock music that fills the rest of the movie And of course the ending is a bit over the top but it perfectly rounds off the story and adds to its strength The film won five Oscars for best picture directing screenplay cinematography and Spacey s performance and was also nominated for editing music and leading female role Each well deserved 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7055110/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2022,Perfectly captures the dystopia of the USA at the turn of the millenia,Greed and hate has destroyed the fabric of society in the USA and this film depicts a broken family that could be millions of families in suburban USA I often think acting doesn t take much skill but movies like American Beauty help me appreciate truly fine acting The film shows how one man finds redemption by breaking out of the cage his life had become Despite a tragedy the film ends on a positive note with the narration of the central character One of my top 5 favorite movies Congratulations to everyone who took part in the making of this movie,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8072108/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2006,American Ugly,Much praised film about a man facing mid life crisis in suburbia dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter s friend There is only one word to describe this film pretentious Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is populated with cookie cutter characters and it superficially touches on what the filmmakers regard as important themes The acting is mediocre at best Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves and awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best described as mugging Benning does not fare much better as his desperate wife,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1445425/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2001,Over-Hyped Movie is a Bitter Disappointment,Enough pro and con comments have been written about this so called Oscar winning masterpiece for me to make this review a brief one but to the point American Beauty took up too much time to tell a relatively uncomplicated story of mid life crisis involving several severely disfunctional personalities If it gives you pleasure to watch Kevin Spacey be little more than sarcastic for two hours or to watch a shallow youth show you a plastic bag pushed about by the wind as a sample of beauty in little things then this movie is for you The only genuinely moving and original character in the movie is not Spacey it s Chris Cooper as the homophobic neighbor who suspects his son is having an affair with tragic results His performance in the climactic garage scene is stunning The symbolism of the rose petals was overplayed and much too simplistic As was the lengthy shot of the floating plastic bag which so many viewers found deep meaning in but struck me as arty pretentious and boring With a rambling and vulgar script this emerged as no more than a sad commentary on the complete collapse of American culture All of the characters are not only weird but unlikeable For me this was an ordeal to sit through the only jolt I got was from the ending which took too long to get to and then mercifully I was able to take the cassette out certain that I would never want to view the movie again despite the fact that it won a Best Film Oscar As someone once said the mirror of life should be tilted upwards more often to make films more inspirational The gutter is not a pleasant place to spend two hours of your life look for true beauty elsewhere A big thumbs down on this one,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592310/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2002,"The closer I look, the worse it gets",I first saw this in theaters back in 1999 I loved it I really really loved it I ve seen it four or five times since and each time I like it less I just saw it again a couple of days ago and I stopped it before it was over At that moment I decided to sell my DVD It has now been excised from my DVD Collection about which I have considerable pride The main reason is that I have come to feel very strongly that this film doesn t know what it wants to say It takes a bunch of characters constructs various relationships between them and sets them loose to run around for two hours at the end of which what have we learned I ve heard lots of people make comparisons between this film and another highly acclaimed movie of 1999 which I hate Fight Club Both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques of materialism With Fight Club the critique on materialism is made by the character who turns out to be the villain of the piece who seeks to replace it with fascism In American Beauty the anti consumerist is first of all a total hypocrite and second of all has a life changing epiphany the moment before his death but never gets a chance to expound upon what that epiphany was On the hypocrisy charge consider the oft quoted scene when Lester Burnham magnificently portrayed by Kevin Spacey yells at his wife Carolyn played in an over the top caricature by Annette Bening for placing too high a value on material things in this case a sofa Fine He makes a good point No one else seems to have noticed however that this is precisely the same scene where it is revealed that Lester has bought a 1970 Pontiac Firebird Since we at no time see Lester enjoying the use of his car the implication is that possession of the object is a good in itself which is the very apex of materialism There are lots of other things that we don t see and I never noticed until I looked closer how conspicuous they are in their absence We never see Angela or Jane don a cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene They never make any reference to being cheerleaders The whole concept of cheerleading then is merely a mechanism and quite a contrived not to mention cliched mechanism at that to introduce Lester to Angela I also noticed when I looked closer how painfully bad much of the dialogue given to the younger characters is Lame o Geekboy Take a whizz It s just horrid And why exactly was Jane looking at a breast augmentation website First of all her breasts don t appear to need augmenting when I saw this in theaters I thought she must want to reduce her breasts but upon looking closer the computer monitor clearly says augmentation which means a process of adding to The worst flaw of the film by far is the fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice in the space of minutes in the final act The homophobic marine turns out to be a repressed homosexual and the slutty cheerleader turns out to be a virgin For the love of God who let those two howlers slip through Bad enough that either made the final cut but both It defies understanding The scene that made me turn the film off this final time that I watched it was the scene were Jane and Ricky decide to run off together I was never very comfortable with this scene because call me conservative I m just not thrilled about a girl dropping out of school at the tender age of seventeen or so and running off with her drug dealer boyfriend But what really got my goat was when Ricky ridiculed Angela by calling her ordinary Fair enough Angela had it coming But for Ricky to not only accept Angela s principle that ordinariness is bad but to use it against her that bothered me Ordinariness or lack thereof is not a valid criterion for judging the worth of a human being Ricky having been set up clumsily as a heroic character shouldn t have descended to such a twisted and hateful principle The whole film has the feel of having been made up as it went along It is radically different from how it was originally planned to go The prelude sequence and the scene later in the film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since the removal of the subplot about Jane and Ricky being blamed for Lester s murder Now that subplot is a bit ridiculous and was cut for a good reason I agree But why leave the set up if you re cutting the payoff Notice that Ricky shuts off the camera before Jane says You know I m joking right The sequence where Col Fitts spies on Ricky and Lester is straight out of Three s Company Fitts sees just enough to draw the conclusion that the writer wants him to draw and nothing else That s a classic example and the most blatant I can recall from any film of bad contrived plotting What exactly was up with Mrs Fitts Presumably her scenes meant something in some previous unreleased version of the story The initial meeting between Lester and Ricky is built on numerous coincidences Ricky just happens to be working there and he works there just long enough to meet Lester And what self respecting drug dealer would give a man 2 000 worth of merchandise on the assumption that he d be willing able to pay for it later It would have been more contrived if Lester happened to have 2 000 in cash while jogging but I know you re good for it isn t much better This film is ambitious There are lots of individual pieces of greatness in it There are a lot of really good ideas But on a fundamental level it just doesn t work,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592555/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2002,"""I Know I Didn't Always Feel This ... Sedated.""",Hmmm Let s just take a cool objective look at a few of the comments made by IMDb users who have reviewed American Beauty Haunting Riveting Brilliant More than meets the eye Uplifitng Never contrived By far the best I have ever seen Makes you think Exceptional Never gives stereotypes Classic masterpiece Movies don t get any better than this And that list is by no means exhaustive Now let s contemplate the actual film that these people have been watching Lester Burnham is Suburban Man An unremarkable individual not valued by his employer and ignored by his family he has wasted his entire adult life by succumbing to the routine of work and home and failing to indulge his own individuality When two key events coincide the loss of his job and the dawning of a crush on his daughter s friend Lester is suddenly free to beat his drum slough off years of conformity and be his eccentric self Yes that s right yet another dull cliche ridden suburban situation comedy hinting at inchoate unease deep in the soul of bourgeois America All the predictable bases are touched during this smug box office home run petty snobbery keeping up appearances repressed yearnings for Bali Hi and that profound American lament I ve Never Been To Me And what does Lester do to express his newfound rebellious individuality How exactly does he challenge the suburban world which he has rejected Form a witches coven Invent a world language Assassinate Castro Reproduce indian cave art using bison dung as paint No He drinks beer in front of the TV set and gets a job in a hamburger joint Can America s big budget Dream Factory come up with nothing more exciting than this Before dealing with the wider themes I would like to tackle some details which bothered me What is a gun doing in this story Are Hollywood s screenwriters so bankrupt of ideas that they can t construct a plot without relying on the dreadfully overworked device of pistol packing The opening shower sequence was embarrassing Adult jokes are fine by me bawdy humour is great but this was unnecessary and degrading It simply didn t belong A narrator who announces that he is dead isn t a clever touch it s just sloppy work Is Mena Suvari REALLY the embodiment of American beauty I find that hard to believe And what about the total loss of nerve surrounding her character Isn t this brash film supposed to be proud of its handling of adult issues So why does the temptress have to be revealed as a trembling little virgin We hear a great deal of American trumpeting of feminism as a cause Can t anyone see that this moral cave in is profoundly anti feminist On a similar note what was Thora Birch s topless shot all about It defines the term gratuitous And so back to the broader picture American Beauty isn t any of those amazing things that people have claimed it to be It isn t even mediocre It s a tired self satisfied deeply unimaginative rehashing of a format which was outworn by the time My Favourite Martian hit the TV screen Challenging the regularity of suburban life isn t clever and isn t funny It is gut achingly DULL The question which arises then is why so many people are sincerely convinced that American Beauty outshines Citizen Kane I offer this for consideration they feel that way because they are told to It doesn t work every single time and sometimes it misses spectacularly but Hollywood knows that as a general rule advertising pays dividends Tell people often enough that they need to see this mighty film and they will accept the premises both that they need to see it and that it s mighty Barnum said that nobody ever went broke by under estimating the public There s truth in that Just provide the bread and the circuses and the docile populace will take you at your word that the bread is delicious and the circuses thrilling The public wants what the public gets,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592543/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2007,Spec-TAC-u-LAR!,Okay so I don t think there s much left to be said about this masterpiece American Beauty is one of those rare instant classics a landmark of the 90 s and one of the best debut features ever which is both a blessing and a curse for a director let s hope Sam Mendes doesn t end up like Orson Welles This bittersweet tale of ordinary suburban lives about an average husband Kevin Spacey his ambitious wife Annette Bening their unhappy only child Thora Birch the weirdo next door Wes Bentley his severe father Chris Cooper his catatonic mother Allison Janney and a certain blonde cheerleader Mena Suvari reaches a heavenly level of authenticity and poignancy thanks to a witty pitch perfect script by Alan Ball who would later create the brilliant TV series Six Feet Under a wonderful cast Spacey and Cooper especially Mendes s sensible directing Conrad L Hall s beautiful cinematography and Thomas Newman s unforgettable score which has been copied ad nauseam since then by the way American Beauty is as thought provoking and sad as it is in a weird way uplifting To realize the mediocrity in your life to try to change it or let it be that s the question Whichever s your choice there ll be a high price to pay thus no one s a complete hero or villain in this story Lack of communication character flaws and hypocrisy all add up to what happens to these people we feel bad for them despise them and root for them for they all ring so true That s because they re real and great writers like Ball have a special talent to expose the good the bad and the ugly in human nature My only problem with this film is that it came out in 1999 one of the greatest years for films ever just like my all time favourite Magnolia which was almost completely snubbed by the Academy which gave American Beauty 5 Oscars including Best Picture and Director Naturally I d have liked Magnolia to win but AB is a more than acceptable replacement since the Academy actually awarded a great film that year American Beauty even without being the best film of its year still manages to be a masterpiece It s just a couch Lester Spacey yells in one scene This isn t life it s just stuff And it s become more important to you than living Well honey that s just nuts And isn t he right look closer 10 10,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1771297/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2010,Sam Mendes Gets It Wrong -- Again,Sam Mendes entire film career has consisted of woefully misguided attempts to dissect the many ills of American culture without remotely understanding them Perhaps he should spend some time slinging his arrows at Britain s problems before jumping across the pond American Beauty is a movie about American suburban malaise set in a version of suburban America that simply doesn t exist Its characters are either gross and grotesque caricatures or mere vessels for regurgitating Alan Ball s pretentious screenplay forced to utter lines that never sound like things people would actually say Kevin Spacey gives the consummate Spacey performance one note snideness delivered in a sardonic monotone that he gives every time he s in front of a camera while poor Annette Bening is unwatchable in a frenzied performance that I have to believe was forced on her by the director since she s never again been as bad either before or since The worst of the film s dialogue is reserved for all of the angst filled teenagers and most conspicuously for Wes Bentley a tortured and philosophic youth who reads a ridiculous soliloquy about the beauty to be found in a plastic bag as if he s reciting Shakespeare The film has a weird preoccupation with homosexuality that doesn t really fit and makes itself most manifest in the character of Chris Cooper a closeted ex serviceman who true to the film s form is depicted as a goulish representative of conservative America What is the point you ask of all this glib satire Hell if I know Grade D,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2270594/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2011,I can't really say it was a classic at all.,Don t get me wrong I have heard about it being critically acclaim by many critics and viewers except I just don t accept it to be a classic A movie about a troubling family where the mom is an unsuccessful real estate agent and the dad has problems with work and his relationship with his wife Their only daughter is struggling to find the right boyfriend as well The dad then decides to change his life style after encountering with a girl who is friends with his daughter The plot get complicated when a military family moves into the neighborhood where the son is a drug addict and the dad is military strict Parts of this movie was funny I give it that much credit However there were parts I found very hard to watch The misunderstandings and the military dad were one of the reasons I don t consider this film a classic at all Would I ever watch it again No I wouldn t This is one of those rent it before buying it type of movies Cause it s a movie you might like or hate it all depends on what you consider to be a classic,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2365330/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2011,"Provocative, unique and well-crafted....but not exactly pleasant viewing.",Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it s all just a giant facade Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization Otherwise they re outsiders Try walking into a job interview without a tie You ll be thrown out That is the power of convention What if I asked you this question What do you want in life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming mantras and harsh self discipline Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s original screenplay is slightly edited The ending is more optimistic Problems aside Sam Mende s debut movie is one of the greatest I ve seen Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas It s an important film for society because there s so much society needs to learn One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because

18 February 2019,Hollywood derives entertainment value from mental illness....,Here we have yet another highly polished Hollywood flick that seeks to derive entertainment value by depicting two suburban families loaded with mental illness and or behavioral disorders Yet the subject of mental disorders is not addressed and therefore no meaningful message is given Instead the mainstream audience not fully aware of signs of mental illness are led to believe that characters with all the signs of mental disorder are merely quirky eccentric and at worst dysfunctional Not a movie I would recommend and no meaningful message given Hollywood just doesn t get it,6,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4671345/?ref_=tt_urv

exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream

life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming

starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s original screenplay is slightly edited The ending is more optimistic Problems aside Sam Mende s debut movie is one of the greatest I ve seen Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas It s an important film for society because there s so much society needs to learn One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because as he said I m not gonna watch a movie with a name like that Look closer 10

10 April 2004,"A bit pretentious at times, exaggerated at others but will still touch a nerve with those of us that look at our `stuff' but wonder where our happiness went",Lester Burnham is stuck in a rut he is having a midlife crisis alienated from his wife and daughter sexually frustrated and longing for a feeling that he had as a young man that responsibility robbed him of as an adult When he meets his daughter s best friend it kicks off a realisation that his life needs to change starting with quitting his job and acting less responsible Meanwhile the lives of both Carolyn and Jane Burnham begin to change in different ways as they also try to deal with the empty days that they seem to live When this film came out it jumped almost to the top of the imdb top 250 list much as many films that make a big audience think or feel something do Also it gained award after award and was basically held up as a generally great film I saw it at the time and was very impressed by it as it touched a nerve in some regards Watching it several years later I still am able to take some thinks from it but am more open to the faults that are within it The actual plot is exaggerated in terms of it not fitting in with the average audience member s experience However it s wide wings will mean that it will speak to a large section of it s audience The points it has to say are very broad but are delivered in a reasonable manner i e not overly veiled but not rammed down our throats I like to think I am a few years off a midlife crisis but I can see my life in Lester s feelings as many of us can hence the film s success This is not to say that the whole plot is perfect for it is not The film is slightly arty and sadly a bit pretentious I almost dare not say it as I know many audience members were very touched by the bag scene but I did think to myself that the film must be very good to be able to carry off a scene that is so full of cheese and pretension This happens at several points throughout the film in different ways and does take away from the film somewhat Likewise the film s lapse into whodunit towards the end doesn t really work either Happily the central plot and the classy delivery from director Mendes makes for a great film The cast greatly helps and were appropriately rewarded for their work Spacey may have been in the process of losing his edge by this point in his career hopefully he ll get back to his best but he hasn t at the time of writing Here he is great and his semi comic delivery helps smooth out some of the unlikely edges on his character Bening is given a lesser role in terms of not being central to the story but her character is actually more emotionally real than Lester she has to deal with life like the majority of us whereas Lester flees from it Birch is good and underplays well while it is nice to see Suvari in a film that isn t average Bentley has the least role of the film as his character is the most abstractly drawn and least realistic He is OK in the role but he is limited by what he has to work with Janney s role is small and one dimensional but her performance is great it is hard to believe that this is the same woman that plays the super confident and talkative CJ in West Wing Cooper is as good as ever and small roles are well done by Gallagher Bakula and Robards Overall this is a very good film but I find it hard to accept that it has been consistently as high up the critics amateur and professional lists as it has been It has a good plot that has broad enough characters so that most viewers will find something to relate to but this stretch also opens it up to problems that serve to weaken the film somewhat That said this is still a film that is thoughtful artistic character driven and moving and when a big Hollywood film manages to do that then it is a cause for praise not complaint,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593832/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2008,One of the 10 best films I have ever seen.,This is a masterpiece perfect in every way It has completely changed the way I view films and the way I look at life The acting is excellent especially with Spacey and Bening The directing by Mendes is one of the best I have ever seen in a film The cinematography is so beautiful with the strong contrast between the red and other colors Aside from being visually beautiful the story itself is this film s best feature It is original with hints of humor noir drama and sadness Overall it is thought provoking in a way very few films are It is hard to watch what these characters are doing because we know that they are only leading themselves to their own demise Ball s screenplay is one that should be required reading in film schools and the final sequence is perhaps the most beautiful thing ever filmed It is a stunning achievement deserving of every award it got It is in my opinion one of the 10 best films I have ever seen and the best film of the 1990s after Schindler s List It is so real so poignant so heartbreaking Powerful and serene this is why I love movies They can change your thinking,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1811275/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2004,Anti-American Beauty,They live in the suburbs therefore they are losers That is the sum total of the wisdom imparted by this dreary pointless and joyless satire of middle class America circa 1998 The amazing thing about the film is that the filmmakers and apparently many in the audience think this film is bursting with original ideas and deep insights When in reality this is a tired retread of antiestablishment cliches from the sixties The only difference is that films as diverse as DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE to THE PRESIDENT S ANALYST to THE GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN to I LOVE YOU ALICE B TOKLAS knew how to instill the material with pathos despair and anger and still show a flair for the wickedly funny and bitingly satirical AMERICAN BEAUTY is a mean bitter and shallow examination of people who are mean bitter and shallow While those films were daring and fresh BEAUTY is stale and dirty Kevin Spacey plays the overworked under appreciated middle class corporate drone who drops out of the rat race due to a severe case of the middle age crazies Unfortunately he may be out of the race but he remains a rat As played with smarmy snugness by Spacey the character of Lester Burnham seeks not inner peace but self gratification After resorting to blackmail to get his corporate freedom he spends his newfound leisure time lusting after his teenaged daughter s cheerleader friend berating his wife experimenting with drugs and just generally being obnoxious Spacey s much praised performance is largely without nuance or heart a less sympathetic depiction of an everyman would be hard to come by Despite the film s supposed antiestablishment slant and vaguely pro drugs attitude the film hardly embraces liberalism The film is not only antifeminist but anti woman as well portraying Lester s wife played by the otherwise wonderful Annette Benning as a shrieking materialistic shrike How dare she find capitalism and the suburbs to her liking The other women are mere sex objects And despite the fact that several of the filmmakers are openly gay the film is condescendingly homophobic as well The gay guys next door are used as a joke and when a villain is needed for the finale out trots the neighborhood closet case Good satire says This is us aren t we something Bad satire says This is them aren t they pathetic AMERICAN BEAUTY goes beyond bad satire The filmmakers make no attempt to conceal their contempt for the American middle class a group they obviously view with no respect no sympathy or even a shred of affection They do however seem to respect their moviegoing dollars The film s tagline was Look closer A bold invitation considering just how little clothes this emperor is wearing,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0591880/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2000,Cool Reaction,American Beauty frankly left me cool unmoved and repelled by its essence There seemed something sickly about its basic conceit something off balance and disturbed While the quality of the acting and production was at a high level the core of this work seemed unhealthy exploitative and overbaked While there is room for exposing the homogonized and more sober aspects of suburbia American Beauty in a quest to make itself more competitive with other versions of the truth tended to exaggerate its own emphasis The result is a film which can be more appreciated for what it tries to accomplish than what it actually does,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593467/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2001,This film is a fraud...,American Beauty is excessively praised as a great piece of American film when in reality it isn t even good enough to be a decent rip off of better films Unfortunately many viewers have fallen for it Moonspinner55 and tubist38 have good reviews Note that one person who initially praised the film reviewed it again a year later and said What was I thinking Mendes wastes some excellent actors in these meatball scenes for example Spacey throwing the asparagus who couldn t do that well A lot of this film is some snappy one liners or clever scenes strung together with nothing Everything that happens is almost laughably predictable And the crucial scene where an empty plastic bag blowing in the wind is supposed to impart some deep meaning on the true nature of existence in the phenomenal world Right Finally I must comment on Annette Bening who is one of the better actresses working today being cast in the role of a cartoon what a waste This film is a 1 and should in fact have a turkey symbol next to it American Beauty is the perfect symbol of the decline of the serious American film Ordinary People Out of the Blue and The Sweet Hereafter are much better films,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592377/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2012,A quick look at perverted normalcy.,Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by

6 November 2012,Beautiful!,The first time I saw American Beauty was when I was around 8 years old so it s a hazy memory Unfortunately I had to go to bed about 40 minutes in but some scenes have stayed with me since I m 17 now The second time I saw American Beauty was on the eve of my blonde friend s birthday party I must ve been around 15 and I was totally gripped Unfortunately I had to force myself to bed as it was on late and left 40 minutes in in order to be awake looking for the early morning start the next day Yesterday I finally got the chance to see American Beauty the whole way through And it was amazing Those first 40 minutes hadn t really left my head before They were just absolutely gripping full of incredible visuals cinematography and absorbing writing and character development Thankfully the rest of the film doesn t disappoint either and accumulates to being one of the greatest films I have ever seen I wasn t expecting to give it a perfect 10 as I only reserve that for the most special films but this really is an incredible and outstanding film It thoroughly deserves its best picture award What makes American Beauty works is its well observed characters At the centre of the film we ve got Lester Burnham who is fantastically played by Kevin Spacey another throughly deserving award winner and is going through a mid life crisis We can highly sympathise with him and his childish rebellion You feel sorry for him and his loveless marriage his ill relationship with his daughter and unforgiving job You re almost rooting for him when he rebells However his acutely observed character is also wonderfully flawed by taking drugs and having vivid fantasies about his daughter s which are beautifully filmed The other characters are also as gripping and never shunned We ve got his controlling wife also going through a mid life breakdown his moody daughter and her sexy friend as well as the weird family who ve moved in next door with their strange son and awful army dad The film would need very little plot at all to keep it entertaining as all the characters are memorable and well crafted which means American Beauty never has a dull moment Right from the startling opening which confesses that Lester is going to die the film never loses its grip on the audience as we re all in suspense as to who kills Lester and why The playful screenplay by Alan Ball is incredible It s also philosophical and very deep at times as well as being consistently gripping and entertaining There are some hilarious moments as well as some emotional and touching ones As flawless as the script is the directing by Kate Winslet s ex There is some breath taking cinematography and striking visuals which add fuel to the already high burning fire About every single shot is perfectly framed making the film even more involving and seductive American Beauty felt hypnotic at times sucking you into the world of the film like Black Swan and The Artist achieved so memorably American Beauty builds up to an incredibly powerful and emotionally charged ending Bringing together all the characters and leaving some ambiguity so we don t feel at all patronised Lester s final narration is very touching memorable and rounds the film off perfectly American Beauty is an amazing achievement in film making It s a beautifully observed drama about family life and the baggage which comes with it There s great use of humour superb writing Oscar worthy acting and sensational directing American Beauty is the full package and is quite simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen It was worth the 9 year wait,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2700271/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2015,"Where's ""The Beauty"" (or storyline for that matter)?",I have to agree with those IMDb reviewers who simply cannot understand how this movie won the Best Picture award or for that matter how it is even considered a good film It s nothing more than an overblown exaggerated view of a dysfunctional family set to the backdrop of a suburban lifestyle that for the most part seems totally unrealistic While Kevin Spacey usually turns in consistent performances although he always seems to play rather offbeat characters I felt his performance here was very weak He plays a middle aged man going through his midlife crisis period but to me just seems unconvincing Even Annette Benning s performance seemed way below par Quite frankly definitely not worthy of Best Picture and not one that I would want to own,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3200025/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2000,"Can anyone say ""Rip off""?",Take two infinitely more superior films called The Ice Storm and Happiness and mix them together in a bowl Add a touch Just a touch of Alan Ball s imagination and you have American Beauty The most over hyped and over praised film I ve seen in my life In one measly little sentence this film is NOT new I ve seen it all before and better in the aforementioned films While I do think that the cinematography and color design was the best thing about the film the absolute worst was the rest There is not any film out there that can be as pompous and self serving as this garbage It may be well cast and the actors my ravage their roles with unholy relish but it just isn t new It s been done already I rank this with The Insider as one of those movie people only see the good side of and give good reviews to without realising they have been brainwashed by other peoples opinions before seeing it If this is not the case they only give it a decent review out of respect to the filmakers actors previous work I m not kidding For both of these movies this is the conclusion I reached after pooling many peoples opinions American Beauty is VERY VERY overhyped and NOT original See it and make up your own mind Don t listen to anyone elses voice but your own If you still like it then I still respect you,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0591863/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2013,Brilliant drama,American Beauty is a brilliant drama so powerful and moving Having read roughly what the film was about before I started watching it I was pleasantly surprised by how multi dimensional it turned out to be There was much more going on than I expected and all the story lines were interesting in their own way The plot goes much deeper than I imagined and it really is just a brilliant drama It also has its comedy moments which help the film to flow The cast in this all delivered very strong performances and made it seem so real especially Kevin Spacey Wes Bentley is also deserving of a mention for his portrayal of the very mysterious neighbour The way it ended won t be to everyone s taste but for me it makes it more memorable Overall it is a brilliant drama that I would highly recommend and I would certainly watch again Top marks from me one of the best dramas I ve seen 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2852967/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2021,Dark and depressing,Dark and depressing film unfortunately Great acting but very dark I ve mentioned that the first half of the film was somewhat slow and ponderous The second half was much better The second half of the film has a darker edge to it and it finally seemed like the film was starting to make an attempt at social commentary The character plot twists admittedly were somewhat predictable I still liked the way that many of the characters became sort of an anti cliche in the end This is a tough one for me as the film does have a mix of good and bad If the first half of the film had been as good as the second half then I would have enjoyed it a lot more but the lack of focus and general cringe inducing first half meant it wasn t an easy ride getting to the much more enjoyable second half I m on the fence on this one There is good and bad in equal measures,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7532592/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2005,My extended review of the film,American Beauty is a film about people and how they live At times it is a biting satire with sharp wit and acute observations at other times it is a deep drama about unhappy individuals in American suburbia but all the time I found it an enjoyable film to view both because of the things it has to say and the high cinematic quality of the production The best part of the film would probably be Alan Ball s original screenplay It is alternates from amusing and touching perceptive and funny and the characters are all very well developed and feel real A common complaint I hear about the film is that the characters are thin but they are just the opposite We acquire an understanding of what makes each character tick and what each characters wants out of life Some are motivated by the idea of success and luxuries while other are prepared to settle for a simpler lifestyle Some of the characters also have their own individual secrets that are revealed towards the end and by watching the film again one can pick up their insecurities about their secrets Another complaint I often hear is that the film is too literal and straightforward This however is quite a subjective judgment as where does one draw the line between a film being too complex and not complex enough If a film is overly complex and too hard to extract meaning out of sure some people would look deeper but others will be put off I feel that American Beauty has quite a good balance between how much it blatantly states and how much you can extract by closer examination and what is said out loud is not unnatural It is in that way a film that can be enjoyed by almost all people casual moviegoers and avid film buffs alike There is not really much else that people tend to complain about and really there is hardly anything at all to not like The types of flaws that one might find in the film are what you expect to find if judging whether one of two films in an all time top 100 list is the better of the two They are not the type of flaws that should affect one s viewing experience unless of course one expected to find something more in the film than it offered But that again is subjective The technical aspects of the film are wonderful Thomas Newman s score is very low key and simple when needed and more zapped when required Conrad L Hall has meticulously set up every single shot His use of out of focus backgrounds and foregrounds high and low camera angels and swooping shot is perfect The film all flows very well and some jump cut editing is perfectly woven in The set d cor and art direction paint a colourful picture of suburbia but yet they also manage to bring out the monotony of all the individual places Plus the use of the colour red in the film basically speaks for itself To compliment the film s other virtues the cast give it their best with good results Each actor and actress perfectly suits their characters and it a shame about the lack of acclaim given to many of the performances Spacey and Bening do some brilliant stuff as a discontent couple who are learning individually to enjoy life but yet are still full of anger and Birch is perfect as their insecure teenage daughter But the often unmentioned great performances come from Chris Cooper as the army type new neighbour Wes Bentley as his teenage son and Alison Janney as his wife who seems just a little too detached from life Then of course there is Mena Suvari as Birch s school friend who values her looks above everything This is a film that touches on many different human concerns Beauty as in the title is a key theme and ideas about different perceptions of beauty run throughout the film Bentley films a number of sequences on his camcorder and we are shown the digital pictures There are also the windows that everyone uses to spy on one another People see things in many different ways because we are all different yet we are all striving for a common goal of contentment and the film tries to show this American Beauty starts off as a mystery thriller because we know that Spacey has died and that Birch has asked someone to kill him but the mystery is the end is how we all function and how we are able to find happiness in life,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1067790/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2011,"Very-Very-Very ""American Ugly"", If You Ask Me",May Contain Spoilers Critics be damned American Beauty has got to be one of the most despicable depictions of male mid life crisis that has ever been filmed If Kevin Spacey s character Lester Burnham was supposed to actually represent an average 42 year old American male in mid life crisis then I believe that our society in general is in even more trouble than I had originally thought Burnham was basically nothing but a big self centered baby I was truly astounded to see just how utterly slimy that Burnham was in his day to day dealings with other people For starters to terminate his employment at the advertising firm Burnham actually stooped to threatening his boss with blackmail and exposing him as a homosexual even though the guy wasn t even a homosexual at all Lester Burnham a low life pedophilliac bugger who lusted like a grunting pig after 16 year old girls deserved the crappy job that he chose for himself at MacDonalds Being a crummy little burger flipper was so him Even though I don t condone cold blooded murder I certainly felt no remorse for Burnham when he was gunned down by Frank Fits In a sense he bloody well had it coming One can only shudder to think of how many other people s lives that Burnham would have eventually contaminated had he continued to remain alive At the rate that he was going I m sure that he would have inevitably resorted to exposing himself in public or molesting very young children or something as equally vile as that I find it very very peculiar indeed that American Beauty actually struck such a unanimously positive chord with a vast number of the movie going public I guess that these many viewers must ve strongly identified with the screwed up characters and off kilter situations that were presented in this movie I surely didn t feel that way All in all I certainly saw nothing in American Beauty that even slightly resembled that of beauty above or below the surface It was all looking pretty ugly to me What more can I say,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2517586/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 1999,One of the Best films of 1999!!,A definite addition to my Ten Best List for 1999 is AMERICAN BEAUTY which is sure to earn Kevin Spacey Annette Benning robbed in the past for her work in BUGSY and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT and Alan Ball most original screenplay to come along in awhile Oscar nominations It is the story of what suburban life and the pursuit of the American Dream can do to an American Family But unlike the critic s darling from a few years ago ICE STORM which left me freezing this film is genuinely funny and moving at the same time The ideas projected by director Sam Mendes literally leap off the screen Spacey s edgy performance as the ad exec pushed over the brink by the pressures of having to have it all and his passion for The American Beauty he missed when he was young enough to enjoy it offer a visual feast Annette Benning as the Queen of suburbia Spacey s wife is a sort sexy gorgeous Martha Stewart gone mad convinced if she has just one more motivational seminar she will reach nirvana She is in a word wonderful The boy next door is sort of cross between Timothy Hutton in ORDINARY PEOPLE and Benjamin in THE GRADUATE He deals drugs observes life around him through a video camera and convinces almost everyone that he is the straight arrow next door We know immediately that like everyone else in this movie he is not as he appears AMERICAN BEAUTY peals away layer by layer this oh so imperfect world of suburbia and those in denial who live there If you have already seen NOTTING HILL you NEED to see AMERICAN BEAUTY,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593323/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,"The harsh consequences of our contemporary society, shows how fear is the main culprit of trying to keep up appearances and not accepting ourselves as we really are",American Beauty is a chronicle about ordinary people living through relatively ordinary dramas and that in a way end up reaching equally ordinary conclusions Perhaps this is precisely the secret of the film which at the end of the projection manages to lead us to curiously intense emotions the fact that its message is universal How to avoid identifying with a man as normal as the one played by Kevin Spacey Directed by Sam Mendes following the routine of a group of ordinary citizens the plot portrays a family in the process of breaking up Lester Kevin Spacey and Carolyn s Annette Bening marriage is a sea of coldness and arguments Suddenly he starts fantasizing about Angela Mena Suvari a teenager who is his daughter s friend From then on the protagonist makes major changes in his life that end tragically Sam Mendes cinematographic debut American Beauty has extremely symbolic moments that visually express the concepts inserted in its plot skillfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L Hall The first and most important of these elements which should be visible to any viewer are Mendes framing that insistently highlights the presence of roses in the environment in which some sequences take place These are not simple roses but American beauties Present in the original name of the film and in its literal national translation american beauty is a variation of rose that is very common in the United States visually perfect but without smell or thorns The subtlety with which Mendes presents them makes a parallel with the American suburban families that star in his story and that apparently perfect with their beautiful homes cars and smiles are emotionally and evidently empty The main couple composed of Carolyn and Lester has so many facets that their characters added to the fantastic interpretations of Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey can be analyzed from multiple perspectives The apparently controversial relationship that the two share extremely maternal is what stands out the most It is enough to notice Carol s corporal imposition on Lester who is constantly bowed before his presence or the childlike treatment he receives from his wife This dominant dominated involvement is evident to the point that a sequence with sexual content between the two appears to be almost incestuous The fact is Lester is unhappy Ignored by his wife and daughter he has worked for over a decade at a magazine that confines him to eternal servitude and the betrayal of all his youthful dreams An existence where Yes sir is as common an expression as Excuse me That s when his entire perception is altered by a magnificent vision Angela his daughter s teenage friend Swept away by this new passion Lester wakes up from the coma he s been immersed in for years and decides to give himself a new chance His goals are humble he doesn t want to be rich or elected President He just wants to respect himself and be happy How not to be moved by a purpose so simple and at the same time so complex Initially a defeated guy who can t even express his opinions aloud Lester gradually regains his self esteem through small victories One night for example he has an argument with his wife and manages after years to say what he really thinks His huge smile right after the fight highlights the importance of that apparently ridiculous situation And his next sentence is a little pearl of common man wisdom It s great to realize that we still have the ability to surprise ourselves But Alan Ball s beautiful script is not just a midlife crisis the story is a small revolving machine gun that does not bother to spare some of the most deeply rooted values of the American way of life and of any reasonably industrialized civilization read itself dedicated to consumption From the gay neighbors apparently the most balanced in the film to the family that lives next door to the Burnhams everyone has something to hide the great truth is that keeping up appearances is an art to which we all dedicate ourselves and the film in turn is dedicated to exposing this little hypocrisy that has become the norm in today s world The film has a multitude of details and symbolism that at first may go unnoticed by the viewer The house where the families live reflect what they aspire to be perfect and symmetrical Inside Lester s house all the furniture is symmetrically placed has cool colors and has a specific function and at a given moment it becomes clear that they are more important to his wife than himself The garage where he becomes his refuge is a messier place colorful and open to novelties Which reflects directly on the couple s relationship where Carolyn has much more space and much more power than Lester Nor does Jane s room bear any resemblance to her personality which ends up making the film incredibly fascinating as it talks about appearances about projecting an image of something you are not And the Burnhams are far from a happy close knit family Kevin Spacey however is largely responsible for the success of American Beauty there is not a single moment in which Lester s saga rings false despite the absurdity of some situations His initial lethargy is convincingly replaced by hilarious cynicism finally giving way to absolute serenity The expression on the actor s face when teenage Angela reveals to him that his daughter is in love represents in itself one of the most touching moments seen on film in years When he finally says Good for her the last movement of his transformation takes place Lester finally realizes that happiness has always been within her reach his frustration is what kept him from realizing it The other characters however minor participation some may have in no way can be considered disposable or supporting as American Beauty is a work of many protagonists Jane Burnham played by Thora Birch has the usual problems of adolescence that add to the upheavals that her family suffers and she doesn t quite know how to behave in the face of it When she meets Ricky Wes Bentley her new neighbor she sees in him a possibility to put aside her fragility Furthermore newcomer Wes Bentley surprises by portraying a young man whose apparent madness is mere disguise for his poet s soul Contrasted with the passivity of Jane s father Colonel Frank Fitts Chris Cooper Ricky s father is extremely disciplinarian and castrating and throughout the film one understands the reasons that made him that way Probably partly to blame for his wife s sanity the colonel also makes his son s life untenable The apparent one dimensionality of Chris Cooper s character turns out to be a clever mask of the true complexity of his feelings Almost everyone in American Beauty seeks something but ends up giving up or getting frustrated Jane wants new breasts but she gives up when she realizes that what she has is enough for the boyfriend she finally finds Angela builds a sexually active persona to be accepted a kind of search for otherness in pre internet times but when confronted with who she never was she reveals herself as just an insecure little girl Carolyn wants to achieve material and professional victory but she does not have the competence to do so The colonel wants a world governed by order and discipline but fails when trying to do this in his own home exposing how much his family is a failure In the case of the colonel the failure is even greater because he does not fall alone since he does not even realize that his biggest defeat is far from his son his catatonic and lost wife Only Ricky and Lester in a sense by giving up the materialistic pursuit and acceptance of others supposedly find their happiness Ball s script builds a side shadow announcing the protagonist s death and developing a series of small arcs that can open up countless possibilities to the public regarding the author of the murder the recording of Ricky and Jane Ricky with the keys to the gun cabinet of the father Carolyn learning to shoot It is a well made primary narrative resource but it is built through a script that develops so much thematically that many years later little or none of it is remembered The basis of multiple themes and the acidity on which the who s going to do it of Lester s murder is based is much more perennial and striking American Beauty shows the consequences of a completely dehumanized and materialistic society that contrasts with the most intimate concerns of being It seeks a critical look at our reality in which we play roles we constantly put on masks to try to fit into patterns Our society is like a great masked ball which changes over the years son father grandfather etc All this to form a lifestyle an aesthetic based on appearances and artifices which began to take shape after the Second World War with the promotion of the American way of life It is interesting to see how these masks are lost when sex appears on the scene when individuals allow themselves to be carried away by these passions From Lester to Colonel Fitts passing through the teenagers Jane and Angela Jane s friend all succumb to desire and let their authentic yearnings and insecurities show through Sam Mendes film presents the harsh consequences of our contemporary society shows how fear is the main culprit of trying to keep up appearances and not accepting ourselves as we really are We deny hide and use a multitude of masks in order to adapt and survive the established patterns Undoubtedly appearances are deceiving,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8763372/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2007,Look closer...,With some of the best writing characters and scenes ever put to film American Beauty is simply a luscious and beautiful movie It has so much substance in it that you could watch it thousands of times and never get bored In all honesty I wasn t exactly the biggest fan of Kevin Spacey before I saw this movie My overall opinion on him was that he was a so so actor that had his good movies and his bad movies This film changed my mind all together Spacey s performance is heartbreaking perfect and most importantly realistic The entire time he is on screen he literally is just magnificent Wes Bentley was also captivating to watch and it s really a wonder that he s not a bigger movie star His performance in this film was just flawless and incredible He is quite the scene stealer and often outshines some of the other actors Overall American Beauty was a fantastically good film with some of the best writing around The movie was moving realistic and though provoking could one really expect any less from the genius Alan Ball who is also responsible for the amazingness that is Six Feet Under Don t miss this film under any circumstances as it is by far one of the most excellent films I have ever seen,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1746521/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2018,Make more movies like this todayyy,Oh my gosh I forgot how great this movie is Kevin Spacey nailed his character with remarkable performance Camera work is amazing and it shows everyday problems in marriage and society Ending is perfect and the movie deserved all the praise and Oscar,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4434314/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2020,Still the best after 2 decades,I had watch this when it premiered more than twenty years ago I just watched it today and still be able to blows my mind and gets a laughs every time spacey and Benning having an argument I watched a lot of old films that cannot withstand the test of time however this isn t one of them it s truly an American beauty,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6374291/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2000,LOOK CLOSER at this BEAUTiful AMERICAN film.,Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it s all just a giant facade Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization Otherwise they re outsiders Try walking into a job interview without a tie You ll be thrown out That is the power of convention What if I asked you this question What do you want in life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming mantras and harsh self discipline Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s original screenplay is slightly edited The ending is more optimistic Problems aside Sam Mende s debut movie is one of the greatest I ve seen Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas It s an important film for society because there s so much society needs to learn One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because as he said I m not gonna watch a movie with a name like that Look closer 10 10,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593332/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2005,The Antithesis of Beautiful,I am afraid I found this movie appalling The characters were cruel unpleasant bitter and twisted The central male character has fantasies about the teenage school friend of his own daughter I m sorry but that is disgusting and in an age where children are being groomed to be adults frankly irresponsible His wife was a bitter shrew you are supposed to feel sympathy for Lester he s such a rebel Forgive my sarcasm but as rebellions go chucking up your corporate job to work in a fast food restaurant yawn Smoking dope yawn All his rebellion was about himself He couldn t even rebel and do something worthwhile What Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning were thinking when they signed up for this I cannot imagine I respected them as versatile and talented members of the Hollywood acting fraternity they have definitely lost points with me for this twaddle Virtually every action every word every look and every nuance in this film was unpleasant If you want to look for rebellion and suburban angst watch the infinitely better and wickedly funny Desperate Housewives you will be amazed,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1051286/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2002,Pointless endeavor with no redeeming qualities,Quite possibly one of the least deserving Oscar winners of all time American Beauty simply spikes a hot iron into my hide every time I hear praise dished out to it I will admit I thought it was pretty good the first time around but then I realized my lack of insight proved to be poorly developed Like a bad wake up call I realized how stupid and idiotic this film was kind of like enjoying a video game from 1986 then seeing how poorly it has aged compared to today s standards American Beauty accomplished this in a matter of months The characters except for Lester had no point The kids were poorly drawn characters excessive moot that could have been edited out of the film This film had no idea what mood it wanted to be no semblance of consistency and no reason to be made in the first place A film I will continue hating until I m six feet under,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592608/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2006,Obsessions can be deadly,Ahh the joys of middle age I remember a day at work when a customer referred to an old gray haired guy who had waited on him I didn t know who he was talking about then it dawned on me he was talking about me Middle aged men like Kevin Spacey do have these fantasies from time to time The girl in question is so unapproachable and so unconquerable it should never have been an issue In the meantime we have the guy next door with the hangups and his sexual identity issues It s a sick mix It s intriguing but who would want to be there Of course marriages begin to fall apart people begin to try to be what they are not and the dominoes start to tumble with great dispatch Someone is going to get hurt someone may even die Like Gene Wilder in The Woman in Red if our lives ended right now it may be worth it Unfortunately tomorrow is another day What were we thinking Is this bravery or foolishness or madness or hormones or what The sense of betrayal that filters through everything puts a pall over the ether The acting is excellent This movie is so intense and so absorbing you can t take your eyes off it like a traffic accident I don t feel better for having seen it but it s a sign of our time in life,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1329041/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 1999,One of the year's finest,Watching American Beauty is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order This is not your average social commentary it has something most satires lack poignancy On one hand this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly perfect suburban family displaying what it would be like if everyone s true colours emerged as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by One the other hand American Beauty is a thought provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow American Beauty shines in almost everyway from it s stunning imagery of beauty fused with violence and tragedy to it s darkly hilarious script this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life Wes Bentley Chris Cooper Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances A truly remarkable film,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592742/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2000,My wife called it a stupid movie,I agree with her and after the hype is over no one will remember this film 3 years from now It will drop from the 2 spot within time trust me Had some sort of political message try to figure it out but more weird then anything else It s about mid life crisics and how one individual relives his youth inorder to escape the rut of his personal and work life,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0591818/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2002,yet again the critics and the american academy get it wrong,a film so up its own end it hurts after a promising start this slides into cliche and over the top melodrama trying to be funny all good actors are put to no good use by a mediocre script and flat direction how the guy got an oscar for this is amazing or maybe not the academy has not been know to vote for the best in any year they always seem to vote politcally so all the directors probably thought that no one esle would for mendes but of course they did its funereal pace and obvious gags make it hard going to sit through and the confused and lets be clever ending leaves you feeling that it really has been a waste of time,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593544/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2000,Suburban nightmare for America,STAR RATING Unmissable Very Good Okay You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead Avoid At All Costs American Beauty follows pretty much in the outline of Fight Club the best film I have seen in a very long time in it s themes about commercial fulfillment the barriers constricting the boredom of life and human emptieness The best scene to reflect this I found in here was when the films main charecter Lester played by Kevin Spacey has a go at his wife after she makes a quip to him about not spilling any of his beer on an expensive new sofa she s got This scene quite brilliantly reflects how the commercial value of our possessions has become our main cause for concern rather than concern for each other Or maybe this is just the suburban situation in America Whatever the wake up call was aimed at whoever it s targeted towards ought to take note Though the main character is initially seeming quite intent to accept his boring life we learn that underneath the kind of easy going exterior he puts on a lot of people are actually taking advantage of him his boss his colleagues his daughter his wife This movie remarkably portrays how glamourous and satisfying breaking free from a constraint on your life can be Aside from the main character all of the other characters are pretty sad cases as well His wife is a self obsessed over expectant career woman who only gets sad about what s bothering her His daughter is a distant stubborn teenager who does nt give any clear indication of what she wants Her friend is a narrow minded pretentious and stupid slapper who prides herself on how sexually explicit her shenanigans with other men are And as for the new neighbours well perfect example of how American families are supposedly losing the ability to communicate understand love and heck even know each other This film perfectly captures you in each of these shallow people s miserable lives and gets you caring about their various outcomes All the performances are obviously excellent and Sam Mendes provides unique insightful direction into a film which requires these new touches Overall having seen it I m glad American Beauty won all the oscars it did For once they gave them to a film that truly deserved it,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592020/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2005,"Excellent, Thought Provoking Movie",American Beauty is a modern masterpiece and rightly deserves it place in the top 250 The cinema has been producing a lot of terrible movies lately This one stands with the great ones such as The Shawshank Redemtion The Green Mile Pulp Fiction The Usual Suspects Se7en and the list goes on There is nothing wrong with this movie The acting directing score mood cinematography are all superb Lester Burnham Kevin Spacey is suffering his mid life crisis His bitchy wife Carolyn Annette Bening is annoying him His moody daughter Jane Thora Birch isn t helping Things start to change when he sees Jane s cheer leading friend Angela Hayes Mena Suvari at a school function He starts having fantasies of a naked Angela covered in red roses His actions that follow change his family for the worst Sam Mendes has created something that will stick with the viewers of this wonderful movie We witness are family that looks perfect on the outside crumble into to something horrific How one person s actions can effect everyone around him Kevin Spacey is superb in his role as the unstable husband father He portrays him so well his character is disturbing and we kind of feel sorry for him but at the same time we don t Annette Bening is great as the wife mother who we really don t like but feel sorry for Thora Birch is also great as the daughter who has developed a crush on her neighbour The supporting cast is great 5 5,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1168497/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 1999,The more I see it the more I hate it,Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it s all just a giant facade Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization Otherwise they re outsiders Try walking into a job interview without a tie You ll be thrown out That is the power of convention What if I asked you this question What do you want in life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming mantras and harsh self discipline Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s

30 January 2023,American Beauty - Capturing the American Dream?,Kevin Spacey was one of the hottest actors in Hollywood before he ran into his period of decline There was no film nor role that he could not handle He was versatile had a sense of humor and could play deadly dramatic roles with the greatest of ease He excels in this film about the alienation of a middle aged man with his unfortunate lot in life He wants to be successful but he hates being a yes man a man who has no substance merely form In other words his two faced insincerity begins to gnaw at his inner self His hypocritical behavior is temporarily halted by a pretty young thing but eventually his true character comes to bear and that is not in any way shape or form like the pretty young thing There will be millions of middle aged men who will be able to relate to this film,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8839095/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2000,This is what won Best Picture?,I know I m a little outnumbered here but this is one of the most boring and overrated films I have ever seen This is the winner of Best Picture along with being said that it is one of the best movies of all time How exactly is this possible When I had seen the trailer for American Beauty I immediately wanted to see the film I m the kind of person who waits for the movie to come out on video so I can view it at my own speed because I usually like to watch parts of it more than once to get the full understanding of them I had heard so much about the movie and after it racked up the Oscars I was forced to rent it I did and boy was I ever disappointed What is so great about it So it s a tale about a man who is unhappy with his life and decides to change it in many ways My life isn t exactly the most perfect and at times I too would like to change something about it Everybody probably does If I wrote my thoughts down on paper along with some characters and intelligent writing do you think that I could sell it to a production company Let s discuss this movie in sections The actors did a well job with the parts they were given I ll admit that Kevin Spacey portrayed Lester Burnham in an excellent way and deserved the Oscar that he earned Annette Bening made a disaster of her character Carolyn I thought that in every scene she was in she tried to steal the show Her character s story and problems were kind of bland if you compare them to Lester s I was so glad to see that the Best Actress award didn t go to Annette for her ridiculous role Thora Birch who I have always liked did a very good but not terrific job as Jane Burnham Her character is complex and that was about the only thing I liked about this film It does a pretty good job of describing what a teenager is like The stuck up Angela Hayes played by Mena Suvari was the worst part of American Beauty All I wanted to do was slap her which was good because the character really spoke to the audience I didn t like anything about the lines or actions she said did Wes Bentley was all right but I didn t like his character and thought that the movie would have been a lot better off without his story line I realize that it would have left out a ton of significant situations and plots to each character but I don t know it really didn t fit into the Burnham s problems Why was the plot and main idea given such rave reviews Hard times after another came for the always depressed and suffering Lester Burnham Yeah yeah the poor guy realizes that his life is pathetic and then his wife and daughter also have some problems ALMOST everybody goes through mid life crisis but for some reason this guy really stood out Why The different problems that the characters go through are quite interesting yet very odd Carolyn s affair Jane s encounter with the boy next door Lester s obsession with Angela smoking pot working out etc etc etc were all amusing and entertaining to watch Perhaps the thing I liked most about American Beauty was the conclusion The whiplash ending happened fast and probably caught everybody else off guard Finally American Beauty was put to rest Well in my house anyways,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592194/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2020,"""I rule!"" Do you? Do you though?",Suburban life isn t all rose petals jail bait cheerleaders and gay neo nazis in the closet Something much darker lies beneath the veneer and whatever it is it s not only dark it s beautiful American Beauty is a mid life crisis tale that s heavy on the men s lib message Spacey gives his I m so bored drawl and every word he utters conveys the cynical sarcastic disdain he feels for the world But his performance is not without levity Watch him as he says I rule It s fantastically subtle Subtle in a look at how funny that is way When he finally begins to assert himself it is remarkably poignant Watch him throw asparagus against the wall No it s not a potential precursor to domestic violence It s a declaration of independence whereupon you happily applaud Spacey s descent into me me me world Meanwhile his daughter Missy Miserable played by Thora Birch is committed to the dead stare demeanor Her only guide as she navigates the teenage wasteland is blonde bimbo Jenny Jailbait Thora is a disillusioned youth in need of a more thoughtful peer Enter the eccentric and creepy Ricky Fitts As far as Ricky is concerned Mena is a bland blonde and Thora is a glowing angel of tortured teendom Ricky is an immediately endearing character for the fact that he appears to have been born with a paralyzing birth defect the inability to blink Ricky s sole purpose in life is to mock the stuffy suburbanite pursuit of perfection This is something he can do simply by standing in one place without blinking Observe his psycho killer stare as he balances sincerity with pretentious existential insights The epic plastic bag dance is so stunning that wide eyed Ricky feels like he might pass out from its beauty For Ricky a plastic bag is a bigger tearjerker than Lester s morning grip in the shower As cinematic as this film is visually you still get bits of that late 90s staple digital hand held technique You see the only way you can catch the raw truth of life is through the seemingly cold and impersonal lense of a digital camera Yes this came out the same year as Blair Witch American Beauty is a cul de sac of tragedy and sickly stirring dreams where one s ambition and desire supersedes any responsibility to anyone else Well at least that s what it is if your name is Lester Burnham,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6177742/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,American Beauty,A wonderful movie that presented the midlife crisis beautifully the acting in the movie was great from all the actors especially Kevin Spacey who gave a great performance in the movie but Brad Pitt deserved an Academy Award for his performance in Fight Club more than Kevin Spacey the story of the film was fun and interesting I liked most of the characters in the movie but I didn t like Jane Nor did Carolyn I recommend watching the movie,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6845234/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2000,American Beauty isn't,At the end of this film Kevin Spacey s character talks about the idea of one s life passing before one s eyes at the point of death If such a phenomena is true then I fervently pray that at the moment of my demise the two plus hours I sat in the theatre watching this dreadful movie will be omitted by the Great Film Editor in the Sky I knew as I left the theatre long before the awards that this movie would win the Oscar for Best Picture It s EXACTLY the sort of condescending self important tripe that Hollywood likes to honor Both The Insider and The Sixth Sense were superior movies I m no genius but I demand that a movie be smarter than I I knew every plot twist five minutes before it happened only erring on when Lester would be killed but not by whom Unbelievably stereotyped characters Not particularly funny I guess that because Lester beats off in the shower or lusts after an underage girl we are supposed to think this movie is worthy of praise I wonder how many people would praise the movie if Lester had lusted after an underage BOY The ONLY good scene was the film within the film lovely and poetic But one scene does not a good movie make let alone a Best Picture American Beauty is nothing more than an extended sitcom though one that would only be shown on HBO An utter waste of time The Hollywood marketing machine has pulled off another cultural coup,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0591678/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2013,An American Tale,This debut film from Sam Mendes won the Best Picture Oscar A quasi comedy drama about middle America Kevin Spacey stars plays Lester Burnham who has a mid life crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter s best friend Angela Mena Suvari Annette Bening is his materialistic wife who has fallen out of love with him and is having an affair Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter who at first plays second fiddle with the more beautiful and forward Angela but later finds solace with their new neighbour played by Wes Bentley At first she finds Wes strange as he keeps trying to photograph her Chris Cooper is his militaristic father who is a stern disciplinarian but seems to have deep personal issues of his own When I saw American Beauty upon its release I did not think much of it and I note its reputation seems to have declined over the years Like a lot of Best Oscar picture winners in recent years some people think it was undeserving of the top prize Strangely after re watching this film after a number of years I have revised my rating upwards Maybe it is because I am now older along with now older children I viewed this film differently and interpreted the story with differing nuances Spacey is probably in a rare role where he is likable He realises that his life is in a mess besotted by a nubile college girl trapped in a loveless marriage and lost his job However he is trying to improve himself working out and staying optimistic but fate has a different story for him The themes in this film will vary at different points in your life If you are middle aged with teenage children it might even be unnerving,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2909381/?ref_=tt_urv

criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by

12 July 2020,american beauty,American beauty is a well good shown and represanted life of family that has a lot of problems in it and how they are trying to work around them and somehow trying it to fix them i would say this this movie had some strong messages in it also about how fast life can past fast and how regret about making some decisions can have a big mark and effect on us in a future and take a big toll on us spacey for me give performance of lifetime here and for me he may be one of those actors that are able to put them selfs in a very difficult roles but somehow act like that is the easiest mission in a world rest of cast werent on his level except chris cooper but they were solid in their roles american beauty was sometimes depressing movie but it had some really strong staff and messages in it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5900521/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,EXCELLENT MOVIE,An excellent movie with everything great about it be it the direction acting screenplay or editing This is one of Kevin Spacey s best performances movies 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7975561/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2020,"Perfect, in every sense of the word",If I had to describe this film in one word it would be brilliant Nothing has truly captured the mundane and inner thoughts and demons surrounding people and their human natures quite like this before nor has any film been able to play it off in such a unique manner It s a timeless film that somehow manages to be incredibly insightful without ever feeling a slight bit dull or boring It s interesting entertaining cleverly shot well written and fantastically acted There is little to say the film didn t do right Kevin Spacey gives one of if not the best performance of his career and he is well deserving of his Oscar win His portrayal of the character Lester Burnham can often be imitated in many aspiring filmmakers works today but even though it is often imitated none can replicate the brilliance that Spacey puts into the performance His acting is not only realistic but also endlessly enjoyable to watch and you won t want to take your eyes off the screen when he steals every scene he possibly can The other actors in the film are quite great as well Annette Bening gives a wonderfully poignant performance as Carolyn Burnham and provides a greater glimpse into the struggling suburban wife we have all come to know at some point in our lives Her performance isn t just an advance on a stereotype however and neither is the character but rather a fresh perspective on how someone so mundane and yet trouble filled can be living throughout their own life Though no performance in the film shine quite as notably as these two Thora Birch Wes Bentley Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper all give quite notable performances on their own with somewhat less screen time to let their roles shine The film is written beautifully and its incite and story is so incredibly down to earth and yet so wonderfully magical all at once It s direction is perfect with it being Mendes first effort it truly shows how impressive he is as a filmmaker The film is also shot beautifully and is well deserved of its Oscar win for cinematography with its endlessly perfect and interesting shots that truly help the film to keep up its amazing stature The one flaw I can see the film being ridiculed for is it being slightly predictable at times but even with this small flaw American Beauty seems to make it not just a flaw but a quirk of its story by providing such realistic values and lifelike scenarios that you can t help but feel like if you were in the same situation you could predict it yourself In the end American Beauty is a timeless effort from all those involved filled with some wonderful writing by Alan Ball and wonderful direction from Sam Mendes Spacey s performance as is the film is timeless and all in all both go in my personal favorite moments in all of film history My Rating 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5799643/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2005,The Image of Success,The Burnhams are a typical upwardly mobile family a father with a well paid job in advertising a mother who is a driven real estate sales agent an angst ridden teen age daughter who is at an age to despise her parents They live in a lovely home with a white picket fence lovely roses and a red door Everything about them projects an image of success And yet Lester Kevin Spacey hates his advertising job which makes him feel like a prostitute selling second rate wares to stupid johns Caroline Annette Benning is frustrated at being second best in the real estate business Daughter Jane Thorah Birch finds both of her parents vapid and doubts her own validity as a person particularly when compared with her beautiful sexed up best friend Angela Mena Suvari Their lives like the lives of so many others rushing to get ahead in the world have become less about actually living than about maintaining and improving upon the appearance of success so prized by society What is most astonishing about the film is its complete believability Speaking as one who has worked a great deal in advertising and sales I was amazed with the accuracy with which Ball s powerful and darkly funny script captured the lives of those whose values rest exclusively upon external achievement Lester s growing and barely concealed hatred for advertising and Caroline s constant use of self help tapes and personal success mantras are truly commonplace in the business world Now if American BEAUTY were merely this and nothing more it would still be an astonishing film But it goes considerably further than that for Lester suddenly motived by a lust for his daughter s friend Angela realizes how completely unenjoyable keeping up appearances has become And he explodes the status quo in such a way as to bring every one s petty materialism and mask like personaes into a sharp very funny and pitch black focus as the shallow and meaningless things they are And in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever The cast is astonishing throughout with Kevin Spacey the ultimate I Can t Take It Any More man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet a woman determined to project an image of success at all times even if it kills her Thora Birch is a remarkable young performer as is her boyfriend Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari is perfectly cast as the youthful beauty for whom Spacey develops an unexpected passion Mendes direction is flawless here and he navigates the both the complicated appearances of success and the personal shallowness it conceals with tremendous clarity never overplaying his hand in either direction Perhaps the most telling bits of the film are among the most subtle as when the film posits the tiresomely yuppie but nonetheless considerably more honest gay couple next door as more genuine than the Burhams Caroline s eternal efforts at ego building through motivational tapes and the way in which Angela in time honored teenage fashion naively attempts to use sex as a weapon to conceal her own insecurities The film is extremely funny but it is also ultimately devastating A great many people particularly those who equate an image of success with successful lives will despise the film But like it or not American BEAUTY s take on the failure on the failure of the American dream is easily the most successful and deadly accurate satire on life in these United States since the equally wicked NETWORK This is the real thing people and it may be too close to home for many Watch it at your own risk Strongly strongly recommended Gary F Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1065966/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2011,American Beauty is a pure masterpiece.,American Beauty A Masterpiece Directed by Sam Mendes Written by Alan Ball Starring Kevin Spacey Annette Bening Thora Birch Chris Cooper Allison Janney Peter Gallagher Mena Suvari Wes Bentley Sam Mendes first feature presents an affectionate and satirical look at American life in the suburbs centering around a dysfunctional family trying to find the meaning of life amongst all the chaos of their lives Spacey is trying to relive his teenage years which leads him into domestic professional sexual and financial difficulty Bening is his uptight wife and looks for sex from other extramarital sources Birch is their teenage daughter who is attracted with a kid next door obsessed with his video camera and whose family troubles involve psychological disorder and sexual repression Mendes develops characters for his satire not caricatures and keeps the perception of society reasonable and believable The characters are certainly not role models but they are likable Spacey our protagonist is sexually attached to a teenage girl quits his job and smokes pot What s heroic or likable about those qualities That is where Mendes along with Ball s genius comes into play The members of society we normally look down upon are the film s heroes mostly it is because they are the normal characters of today s society That is the piercing honesty that makes this film so acidic in its delivery Cooper s character a homophobic marine a man society would most likely look up to is the film s antagonist This reflects cultural shifts and the irony of the proposed American lifestyle over the true perception we have over our lives That is the poison this film holds to our heads and refuses to let go until it forces an honest reaction over all the programmed reactions we force ourselves to have for the sake of being well liked and appreciated in our communities The romance between Birch and Bentley is the only relationship in the film that is driven out of love and not sex or status Bentley s character is the most ironic point Mendes makes within the film because he appears the weirdest and most perverted but he turns out the most honest and beautiful This further emphasizes Mendes point that life is different from the outside looking in rather than the inside looking out Mendes changes the way we look at each other and the way we look at ourselves He questions appearances and frames of mind much like Todd Solondz s Happiness Though that film s mastery is evident this is the most connectible American drama satire released in years,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2474841/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 1999,"A really fine, unique movie about life, but not for youngsters.",Please don t get this movie confused with another 1999 movie American Pie which was a funny but rather crude movie about horny teenagers all trying to get laid American Beauty is about real life about dysfunctional families who don t realize why they are crazy Until Lester Kevin Spacey figures it out Quits his job quits pretending he is something he is not and learns to really begin to deal with life There are lots of laughs but also lots of drama Make no mistake this is a movie about Lester s life and death American Beauty has the courage to look at us It does so through the eyes of Lester Burnham who tells you at the beginning that he will be dead within the year Interesting concept There are several other stories in the movie but they are there only as they relate to Lester s In some spots it would be easy to walk out of the movie because of where you think it may be going But stay watch the whole thing see how it all fits together and I think you ll agree it is a rare movie among all the special effect mega blockbuster that seems to be turned out like beanie babies Although this one is totally different the way its messages come through may remind you of movies like Fargo and A Simple Plan If you didn t think those were fine movies skip this one Kevin Spacey gives an award quality performance Most middle aged men will quickly identify with his character But turn the roles around and women should just as easily identify The reason I say this movie is not for youngsters is because they have not lived enough to comprehend and identify with the characters But the sex and language are not nearly as bad as some mainstream movies There is nudity and graphic discussion of sex acts and body parts among teenagers in this movie but it probably was necessary within the overall context I give it 9 of 10 a must see for any adult who enjoys examining his or her situation in life 2009 edit I have watched this movie several more times and have enjoyed it as much as I did on the first viewing 2014 edit I upgraded to Blu Ray for this movie it is worth it,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592707/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2001,The misinformed Hollywood idea of typical American life,Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it s all just a giant facade Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization Otherwise they re outsiders Try walking into a job interview without a tie You ll be thrown out That is the power of convention What if I asked you this question What do you want in life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming mantras and harsh self discipline Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s original screenplay is slightly edited The ending is more optimistic Problems aside Sam Mende s debut movie is one of the greatest I ve seen Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas It s an important film for society because there s so much society needs to learn One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because as he said I m

14 March 2022,"""I feel like I've been in a coma for 20 years, and I'm just now waking up""",This film alongside Fight Club marks the best film of 1999 It s deep complex and enchanting The film explores themes such as the definition of beauty the dangers of obsession or the delusion in denying who you are amongst many other themes At the same time it s just an excellent film with a brilliant story that can be watched without trying to analyse it Kevin Spacey s character is very well written His life has turned docile and he no longer has anything to live for In a situation like this it makes perfect sense for him to be obsessed with a girl It s not particularly the girl that matters it s finding something to live for in a life that has nothing to offer him anymore Anyone who has ever obsessed over someone can properly connect with this film You build up an idea of them in your head only for that idea to erode away slowly until you re faced with the ugly reality of who they really are It s possibly to go on and on about the complexities of each character The only criticism of the film one could argue is that apart from Kevin Spacey s character none of them are particularly likeable However this could be argued that it was deliberately written this way as stereotypes of modern America Regardless this film is a masterpiece and the ending is very impactful,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7958877/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2020,Damn good!,This was really good I don t care about Spacey s personal life so that didn t bother me The movie is done extremely well back in the 90 s they were still putting effort into those things Now movies are just a money making machine for Netflix so they re pumping them out like hot cakes and they don t care that they suck This isn t the case with this one True classic Still very relevant even today The only thing that bothered me a little was how strong the stereotypes were and at times it also felt like too many storylines going on at the same time but they do tie in nicely together at the end Overall a solid movie Not sure it was worth Picture of the Year but I guess back then it was Good for it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6125042/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2014,A beautiful film,American Beauty is the epitome of perfect emotional cinema It boasts great direction screen writing and performances all round making it in my opinion one of the greatest films ever made The story follows Lester Burnham a man who seems to have lost all hope in life as he is stuck in a joyless marriage and has trouble connecting with his teenage daughter This all changes when he meets Angela his daughter s best friend From then on Lester decides to take back control of his life The question is how will it affect those around him Kevin Spacey gives a career defining performance and once again nails it as Lester a man so fed up with life that he needed a radical change The evolution of the character is done to perfection and Spacey s Oscar winning work is the proof All other actors do their parts in great fashion as well and make the movie even better With inspired performances like these the film only gets better with a magical combination of Alan Ball s script and Sam Mendes debut as a cinematic director Among other things I love about this film I can t go on without mentioning the heart wrenching soundtrack that pulls out a wallop of emotions American Beauty is a wonderful yet ultimately tragic tale of how people can hide their true selves However they choose to change one thing is certain it will affect everything in the status quo Lester s story is the example of that and it is one that I will heartedly support every time I watch this movie Rating 10 10,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3102741/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2015,"In Mendes' Curdled 'American' Dream, 'Beauty' Runs Deep!",An acerbic darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false sterile and emotionally stunted lives American Beauty is a real American original Something s rotten in suburbia and it doesn t take long to get to the source of the stink the Burnhams Lester Burnham Kevin Spacey is a middle aged burnout who is a marginalized husband to efficient well scrubbed Carolyn Annette Benning and a disregarded father to sullen teenager Jane Thora Birch and whose everyday life has degenerated into tedium Browbeaten Lester is rejuvenated by the vision of a blonde Lolita That the object of his obsession happens to be his daughter s best friend a calculating sylph named Angela Mena Suvari matters not at all he leaps into his fantasy like an enflamed teenager Unhappy Carolyn undertakes an affair of her own while Jane repulsed by her dad s hormonal attraction secretly welcomes the attention of Ricky Fits Wes Bentley the strange self possessed boy next door And just when things seem to be falling in place for the Burnhams it all comes crashing down If this sounds too depressing guess again Although it s difficult to believe that humor can be found in this toxic portrait of superficial suburban values predatory sexuality and domestic violence rest assured it earns its laughs at every turn Screenwriter Alan Ball gives the viewer a brief horrific tour of crossed wires inchoate longing dashed illusions and resentment that wells from poisoned hearts with staggering self assuredness Sam Mendes in one of the most promising debuts in cinematic history whips the audience around from humor to horror to something poetic and humane He suffuses the proceedings with a palpable sense of danger keeping film goers unsettled until the very end as to what exactly motivates these complicated characters But he never loses sight of the humanity behind even the most reprehensible acts a balancing act pulled off with unusual acumen American Beauty turns out to be emotionally satisfying thanks in large part to a remarkably nuanced performance by Kevin Spacey He commands the screen with a performance of subtlety vulnerability and supreme confidence in which he expresses mordant self mockery and poignancy in a single gesture He brings flawless comic timing to Lester s self absorbed infantile and rapacious behavior while holding on to the pathos of Lester s rage Benning turns in her finest performance to date and all three teen players give sturdy and courageous portrayals in roles that would daunt actors twice their ages Visually daring dramatically astute and beautifully acted American Beauty is a tart funny and tremendously sobering movie about the deepest recesses of personal unhappiness There s a sense of poignancy at the end but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly realized characters The result is the kind of artful defiance that Hollywood is usually too timid to deliver a jolting comedy that makes you laugh till it hurts,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3219411/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2000,A masterpiece. A shocking look at personal collapse.,I can not compare this movie to anything I have ever seen before Well written and superbly directed The acting was so good it made limit pushing activities look some what normal Kevin Spacey is fantastic as the man trapped in a miserable life Annette Bening is so real as the work obsessed wife with no time for her husband Thora Birch is pedestrian as the daughter lacking self confidence Talk about a show stopper Mena Suvari plays the flirtatious tart with zest She can make any man go to the garage and start pumping iron A man making haphazard choices in trying to recover his life is not so much out of the norm True this is a sad look at a family that is set on self destruction Sometimes it takes witnessing the likes of this to help you realize that your own problems are very small in comparison Fantasy situations are part of real life This movie will rank among the great ones Also in the cast are Wes Bentley Peter Gallagher and Scott Bakula,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592169/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2000,A HOLLYWOOD PUZZLE,AMERICAN BEAUTY is a shot list of anecdotes about self centered people who oftentimes speak in surreal dialog This pretentious poorly structured feature that swept the 2000 Oscars is one of Hollywood s enduring puzzles How a boring film that has nothing to offer but pretense makes it this far is a complete mystery to me Its industry popularity and critical acclaim is utterly astounding to me No doubt Kevin Spacey is a fine actor but the 2000 best actor Oscar if there really is one clearly belonged to Denzel Washington for HURRICANE Here we see visuals that have no real meaning but are conjured for effect that simply deepens the meandering We hear meaningless dialog that is nothing more than teenage angst This hodgepodge is nothing but a mishmash of oddball misfiring scenes altogether not making a half baked B film scenario But hey it takes all kinds of ballplayers to make up a ball game Those who enjoy quickly forgotten tongue in cheek films this might be for you,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593480/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2020,A weird everyday family story,With 5 Oscars best movie director actor leading role cinematography and writing and 3 more nominations actress leading role film editing and music it is listed as one of the leading films in the history of cinema Weird film with Kevin Spacey being the only character in the play that played more as a comedian and much less as a drama an element that sealed the film s weird character The film is powerful a mirror of relationships in a modern family A family broken up inside where its members seek communication joy love esteem outside the family context Just the opposite of what the family window showcases that is And all this is embedded in the social context with its anchors its distortions its exaggerations its impositions but also its instability To conclude that the family self destructs itself which is ultimately the only element on which she could find support,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5501154/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2005,A Triumph,In the world of Lester Burnham Kevin Spacey everything truly sucks Lester is a mid forty magazine writer His wife is an unsuccessful Realtor and his daughter is secluded strange girl planning on running a way Soon Lester finds himself in a midlife crisis his wife in an affair and his daughter in a relationship with the pot smoking neighbor Ricky Fits Wes Bentley But instead of Lester becoming depressed he blackmails his boss and quits his job goes to work for a fast food chain and buys the car of his dreams lester is having the time of his life But after a while Ricky s father Col Frank Fits Chris Cooper begins to notice somethings up with his son and Lester The movie intertwines all the characters introduced into a well rounded drama comedy masterpiece Spacey is excellent as a mid life crisis father in love with his daughters best friend and trying to take hold of his life Benning does a fine job as his wife and Bentley as the drug lord teenage neighbor The movie is a little different and your say after seeing this Wow or What the f The movie holds a very deep message one that can only be seen when watching it American Beauty Starring Kevin Spacey Annette Benning Wes Bentley Chris Cooper and Thora Birch 5 out of 5 Stars,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1046207/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,End of the nuclear family,Timely film that tracks the disintegration of the nuclear family amidst mid life crisis sexual confusion and identity breakdown all too familiar to those in middle age Spacey and Bening deliver career best turns as Lester and Carolyn Burnham while Birch Suvari and Bentley are very good as the junior brigade tiptoeing around the alarmingly dysfunctional parents Intriguing entertaining and beautifully made American Beauty is also weirdly uncomfortable on rewatch in 2022 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7888185/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2020,A disturbing abstraction,This is art that presents a stark and disturbing image It is most definitely not a film for the average audience and those who pan this film all say more or less the same thing which when translated into the absolute basics is that they didn t get it There s no reason why they should This film is not for them For those of us who have had to deal with extreme relationships and who have had to deal with blind angry people whose existence is intractably anchored to things that are ultimately meaningless this film most definitely strikes home The challenge is to be able to extract yourself from such dysfunctional people before you yourself are destroyed by it Spacey s character is that person destroyed by the soullessness but with a tiny if perverse ray of hope Some get this film Other do not It s up to the viewer My rating is not based on the notion that it makes me happy or fulfilled or anything like this I rate the film on what it is what it does and how successful it is at doing it If a person leaves the theater feeling torn up that is the point It is intended to make the viewer take a look at their own life to recognize the artificialities and to extricate themselves from this,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5380412/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2020,great!,The middle class is the most suitable for people who lie They can always be superficially noble Their true hearts have long been concealed by illusions Even if they are seen by the bystanders they will not admit that the truth may only be known by themselves The point of telling a story is the most brilliant and there are always people who know it who can understand it freely and add more aftertaste People you have to live for yourself for a real life there is nothing shameful,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5635812/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2016,Trouble in suburbia,Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes In American Beauty Angela acts like a total slut as many girls seem to be nowadays In the end however she is not what she makes herself out to be Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man yet in the end it s all just a giant facade Civilization is but one giant movie and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization Otherwise they re outsiders Try walking into a job interview without a tie You ll be thrown out That is the power of convention What if I asked you this question What do you want in life Most people would say happiness But is happiness worth deluding yourself for Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive thinking philosophy a philosophy of self affirming mantras and harsh self discipline Positive thinking may help you attain your goals but positive thinking also blinds you from reality Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie Self help is just a euphemism for self deception All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life whether it s religion money or even love In spite of American Beauty s greatness there are problems Characters are stereotypical but viewers will hardly notice unless they re ultra critical Anyway exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers Furthermore Alan Ball s original screenplay is slightly edited The ending is more optimistic Problems aside Sam Mende s debut movie is one of the greatest I ve seen Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas It s an important film for society because there s so much society needs to learn One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because as he said I m not gonna watch a movie with a name like that Look closer 10 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3421131/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2015,Middle America in a frame,Few people will be able to completely uproot their lives and begin it again but that Lester Burnham s journey in American Beauty he wipes his hands clean of his pitifully ordinary life and lives life how he wants with his own goals And to see it is thrilling Of course there s a little more to it than a hasty decision to turn it around Several factors converge in this extraordinarily tight drama Lester discovers his daughter s friend Angela a 90s Lolita He also finds his bland job to be on wobbly ground and lastly he gets new neighbours a military family with a strange boy Ricky These together create a change in the meek Lester and create a magnificent film The real question I had after seeing this film was What s wrong with American Beauty and then I couldn t answer my question I ll start with the most well known aspect of the film its acting The entire cast is sharp as their respective characters Led by Kevin Spacey as Lester original Yes Man I rule you will find something relateable in at least one of the characters good or bad Their personalities and actions are entertaining their motives are all there and if a character is intended to be likable you will like them It s just as a good film should be honest and unforced but with just an edge to help you in the right direction I ve briefly mentioned how tight American Beauty is The plot is wonderfully self contained but also organic it feels very plausible There s a reason things happened as they did when they did I can t find any plot holes Much credit has to be given to the script and writers and bonus points for being an original idea when so many excellent dramas have Based on in their credits But more than characters plot and script American Beauty is also visually wonderful While much of it is observed as life is Lester s fantasies have a brilliantly symbolic and colourful side making them stand out as more than dreams This leads to the deeper aspects of the film such as recurring symbols numerous metaphors the bag and of course the moral For a film concentrating on failure I found a very positive message out of the film and that was to enjoy life and all the beautiful things in it and to never trap yourself Like the tag look closer find yourself looking past the black and white into the red and see beauty It all sounds cheesy but unlike Spacey s later work Pay It Forward it doesn t come off the screen that way From a cynic to seizing the day American Beauty is a dark film with a big smiley face over it that blends until its climax An engrossing fiction that for many isn t too far from real life I think this film can speak to people differently as you age and that power to draw different meanings from different viewings is a sign of a true film A full film and a fantastic way to close out a millennium 9 4 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3250829/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2000,staggering,An amazing and sad statement about American values about having the courage to change your life totally when you feel you have nothing to lose about finding out what s important just as it s too late A wow of a movie with so many dimensions amplified by sensational performances How can something be so depressing yet uplifting be about parents who have screwed their lives up so horribly and yet give you hope that the young people have a chance to evolve I guess that s true genius,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0591853/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2002,Didn't deserve all the credit it received.,I don t know what the big fuss is about American Beauty Its one of those movies that virtually shouts at the screen i m an epic gimme an oscar Very much like Driving Miss Daisy I m an old lady gimme an oscar Or maybe even Boys Don t Cry I showed my breasts on screen gimme gimme gimme Whats more American Beauty also tries to suck so much sap out of you you ll be blowing your nose with a pancake The plastic bag blowing in the wind scene was another pathetic attempt at winning an oscar There were so many better movies that year that should have won an oscar or even the best picture American Psycho Dogma Fight Club Not much can be said about the acting Kevin Spacey s skeptical portrayal was overrated it didn t deserve the oscar The rest of the acting was bland basic and with bad range Annette Bening was probably the only good actress although Geena Davis or Madaleine Stowe would also have done well for the part The films only saving grace is its directing and soundtrack which are very good but the movie didn t deserve all the credit it received 6 6 out of 10,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593592/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2003,Is That All There Is?,I waited a long time to see this as nothing I heard about the film seemed interesting Now I am glad I waited and went to the less expensive matinee I am left feeling that America has an awfully short memory There is nothing in this film that hasn t been done story wise before A lot of the themes seemed to be left over from an earlier age Vacuous teens and the pathetic lives of the materialistic middle class were done to death in the sixties and seventies with better sex too I had hoped to see something more original but I guess a lot of very young movie goers will never see all the old films so this is their introduction to some very tired overworked old themes That left me wondering out loud what all the hoopla has been about so I tried to find something redeeming here The director did a good job with the material he had Not too hard to stand above that script music costumes and sets were mundane nothing striking but well executed for the setting The acting was the one saving grace Spacey and Benning played characters I have known They gave realism to the pathos Their portrayals with the material they were handed was excellent The real standouts because of their newness were the younger actors and actresses ladies there is nothing wrong with being female Wes Bently showed real talent in his restrained portrayal of the edgy otherwise stereotypical young rebel He saved what could have been a joke There has been a lot of talk about Mena Suvari in this film She was OK but nothing to live up to all the hype foul mouth notwithstanding Note I am fully aware that hoards of young girls now talk like this character It is not cute or funny it s kind of pathetic which was the point I suppose The real shining talent here was Thora Birch as Jane She managed to breath what little life there was into this film while managing to look much better than Suvari doing it no mean feat She is stunning in both talent and beauty and there is a great future for this fine young talent as well as the others Chris Cooper s portrayal was true to the script I am sure but it left me with Huge Hollywood Stereotype running through my mind His acting was excellent the script wasn t up to what he brought to it The character was disappointing in the least Allison Janney as his very disturbed wife was a little over the top too It left me thinking the screenwriter and director were both really straining to paint villainy with these two characters It smelled Has no one heard of originality Nicholson did the last credible evil Marine Colonel There may never be another That about does it for me I know I sat near the rear of the theater and saw four couples leave shortly after the garbage mouth scene from Suvari I think she did it well though Too bad this is what we have degenerated to She doesn t represent some far out rebel but a main stream young woman How sad As for the film s theme decadent America has been done to death so forget it and look for something new will ya I would have even liked to see Benning naked more than Suvari at least that might have been more real and seemed less crude crass exploitative and pedophiliac Besides she s every bit as beautiful as the younger girls in this film,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593742/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2020,Please love your life,The film American Beauty expresses the meaning of life and the search for beauty through different problems faced by two generations The two meaningful lines in the film may clarify the theme There is a life behind things a force of compassion All the beauty washed me like rain making me grateful for my humble and stupid life every moment,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5771190/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 1999,Not Worth a 9.3,This is an expertly filmed acted and directed film but the script is lacking Why Because the movie is a complex tale about a group of people living in suburbia A simple setting is ideal for showing the deep underlyings of society but we should care about the characters All the characters in this movie are freaks They re violent or mean and you really don t care for any of them You don t feel sympathy and half the time you re afraid one of them is going to just flip out and kill everyone The movie is too graphic for it s own good The violence and non stop sex related material are enough to get the point across without the excessive drug use as well This movie has tremendous performances and the best filming you are likely to ever see but don t expect a nice movie to see a Sunday afternoon Instead plan to see a disturbing and brutal look into the lives of a bunch of basically horrible people,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592734/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2021,Depressingly realistic,Great performance by Spacey perhaps he s just playing himself in a way Amazing performances all around really Indeed Cinematic masterpiece also Great use of colors The music is perfect as well Everyday normal life can look perfect on the surface But be a living hell For those people trapped in mondane unfulfilling lives In a subtle but clear way we see how the characters are victims to themselves The characters live their life like they re inside invisible cages It s so very depressing even disturbing like a sort of psychological horror More so because it s also relatable to so many All the characters starts on their own personal journey to in their own way break free from this prison They need different things and go about this change in different ways But all these different characters progression blend together beautifully and comes to a compelling and satisfying climax I think this movie truly is beautiful but also scary It s very depressing A sort of cautionary tale of how you can die before you die if you let your life become a routine and deny everything inside you that tells you what you truly want and need It can happen to anyone It s not uncommon at all What brings the movie down a bit is that it s a bit boring and pretentious But the message isn t wrong Sure we should appreciate the beauty of small things in life and be present to them in the moment to be able to be aware of this beauty It s just that this message is a bit of a clich by now,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6731225/?ref_=tt_urv

closer An individual s behavior is not independent of his environment Humans are conformists by nature and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned he is shouted down and ostracized No one can resist the urge to conform so why bother Everyone is nice in public yet on the streets they blare their horns scream and swear Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a chick flick They force themselves to watch gory horror movies

6 July 2000,Is someone out there afraid of what I am about to say?,For the life of me I cannot understand all the acclaim over this movie It s message if one could call it that is little more than a bad joke Contrary to what you may hear this film is not I repeat NOT a social commentary on current day life in suburban America mainly because it has absolutely nothing to do with life in the suburbs Believe or not most suburban fathers do NOT lust after their teenage daughter s friends do NOT try to blackmail their employers do NOT obtain drugs from the youth next door and do NOT quit decent jobs to flip hamburgers and ride around in sport cars Another amazing fact is that most suburban mothers do NOT cheat or cart their lovers around in their SUVs for a quick bite to eat after having wild sex at the local motel You ll probably be surprised to learn that the vast majority of suburban daughters are NOT plotting to kill their fathers that they do NOT expose themselves for the camera of a voyeuristic boy next door or that their friends do NOT try to seduce their fathers with the skill of a street hooker I also daresay that the welcome wagon is NOT likely to be led by a local gay couple and I wouldn t be too concerned about the macho military man next door letting loose with his repressed homosexual tendencies and kissing his male neighbor And last but not least most suburban fathers need NOT worry about someone sneaking into their homes and blasting them to eternity All of this incredible as it may sound is what this film asks us to accept Do you want an accurate portrayal of the life and problems of suburban America Go rent Parenthood which came out about 10 years ago but is still infinitely more realistic sensible and intelligent than this highly overrated nonsense,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0591946/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,Essential viewing,We get to see all that goes on in Lester Burnham s neighbourhood Every character gets their fifteen minutes of fame in this cinematic life cycle Serious issues are dealt with tenderly and comedically A wonderful film Monologues music and mood are exquisitely recorded,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7559528/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2001,Hollywood is making movies less believeable than ever.,I don t understand this movie I watched most of it and I don t find anything that was interesting in it They try to make it more interesting by showing naked girls but the acting is very bad The main character smokes marijuana and is inspired when he sees a girl to work out Obviously the film makers don t know anything about working out and Kevin Spacey is a dumbass,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592473/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2002,"Yes, it really is as good as everyone says. One of the finest movies of the last ten years.",I have such low expectations of contemporary Hollywood that if I go and see something and I manage to keep my lunch down afterwards I m happy So to actually be able to sit in a theatre and watch a genuinely inspired and original piece of film as this is a very special occasion these days Way too many current movies are aimed at 16 year olds and have more care and attention lavished on the media promotion and merchandising rights than the movie itself so it s a real treat to see a movie aimed at adults with characters you can empathize with a witty and complex script first rate acting fresh direction and splendid cinematography Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career as suburban rebel Lester Burnham He is the obvious focal point of the movie but I was also impressed by relative newcomers Thora Birch Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari and also the seriously underrated Chris Cooper Lone Star The only minor quibble I have with the movie is Annette Bening s character which to me doesn t have the depth of the others and often just comes across as a stereotypical shrewish wife Apart from that it s difficult to fault American Beauty A recent second viewing on DVD was just as enjoyable and impressive as my first viewing on its original cinema release Yes this is one movie that really does live up to the hype A modern classic that cannot be recommended highly enough Bravo,,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593607/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2004,Kevin Spacey and Sam Mendez at their Best,I think that it s safe to say that American Beauty and M Night Shyamalan s supernatural thriller The Sixth Sense were definity the sleeper hits of 1999 Here Kevin Spacey shows the amazing form that he s been showing for the last ten years in films like The Life of David Gale K PAX Pay it Forward L A Conifedencial and Swimming With Sharks It s also funny that this is called an American Classic when the director Sam Mendez Road to Perdition is in fact English Spacey stars as Lester Burnham a loser who hates his wife Annette Benning The Grifters Mars Attacks and whose daughter Thora Birch Patroit Games Ghost World hates him whose life changes when he black mails his boss falls for his daughters best friend Mena Suvari Atomic Train American Pie 1 2 The Musketeer and is introduced to the world of drugs by his neighbour Wes Bentley I know wrote in a previous review that I see To End All Wars as better film making triumph and I still stand by that but you just can t help but to be drawn in to this wonderful movie by the amazing Academy Award winning combination of Alan Ball s screenplay Mendez s direction and Spacey performance,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0952232/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2020,Excellent,Of the 250 films I ve seen and rated on IMDb only one other Schindler s List is as good as American Beauty A film like this not only entertains while you re in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality After watching this movie viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can t really grasp American Beauty reminds us that like Lester we really have no idea what we really want We re not rational creatures as economists assume we are Our instinct might lead us to perform one action yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite We may lust after material belongings yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them Lester may lust after Angela yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality an entirely different feeling comes over him Ricky Fits the drug dealing boy next door is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non promiscuous solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind When many criticize the movie they say Where s the beauty in a plastic bag And that s the point We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism What one person finds attractive another may find repulsive yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism It s just a plastic bag How can there be beauty in it Well a human being is just an aggregation of tissues bones and blood How is that attractive It depends on how you look at it Reality is shaped by perspective Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn t actually experience them But time moves inexorably in one direction Time cannot be stopped In a physical sense the past and the future don t exist We are only conscious in the present Everything we do everything we achieve every bit of happiness we experience they are all eventually buried in the past by time Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty If you don t believe me walk into a pre school and then walk into a nursing home Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line look closer An individual

21 October 2012,"""A little too overrated.""",The film is the showcase of American people lifestyle However I do believe that films do present things with a little exaggeration and that they are mostly not true Unless of course based on true incident But considering that 40 of all is true I pitied while watching the movie because of the sad lives of the American families The story of the film is good and is told from the perspective of a Man named Lester He is having trouble holding everything together and especially when his family doesn t show much respect to him There are interesting things too when he gets attracted to one of a friend of his daughter and even fantasizes to have sex with her While the film does not offer anything great in the story but there is a little feel of reality in that which might make you curious I have always loved family dramas because they are the best source of information about the middle class people of that country To be really true I felt like laughing after watching the film Having watched a lot of dramas in various languages we have the portrayal of American family which is so sad PROS The film has emotional dramas mixed with a little humor at appropriate places There are misunderstandings also There is a hidden message present in the film I feel happy to say that the director was able to portray a very important thing Happiness When you will focus on the characters you will found out that no one was happy in reality All of them were hiding behind a sense of misjudgment Sometimes even this is conveyed through dialogs when the characters say to each other s that you are just a sad old man The movie wanted to convey that you have to really find happiness somewhere otherwise ultimately you will get frustrated Then this frustration ultimately leads to a lot of further problems CONS While everything including the story and the acting of the cast was perfect I felt like some kind of energy was lacking in the film It will give you instances to laugh or feel bad but all comes too slowly and have a dull demeanor MESSAGE Find Happiness VERDICT A recommended watch,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2691994/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2000,Don't beleiave the hipe,This movie is nothing special just very weired Maybe it reflects the depressing times we live in How messed up people are and the phoney masks they wear in there every day lives Well the problem with this film is the lack of direction or point well there is a point but it s very hidden The theme in this film is what one man acts outs when he is tired of these phoney games and just does not care anymore,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0593399/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 1999,"Great, but certainly no masterpiece",I am shocked at the great reception American Beauty has gotten on the IMDB 2 only behind the Godfather Come on It was great to be sure but all of the film s sentiments have been expressed before and better The decaying family relationships were stated in the better film The Ice Storm The idea that even in terrible situations life is still beautiful was brilliantly shown in what else Life is Beautiful The one thing that the film did succeed in doing extremely well is the composition of shots Watch the scene where the neighbor boy records Thora Burch with his video camera We see the boy on the far left of the screen staring at her offscreen Burch stares out at the audience from the television That is one perfect shot There are several great scenes like this The part of the film which truly bothered me though was the way they handled the inevitable shooting Throughout the film we watch every important character talk about killing Spacey and we see them all next to guns This set up reminded me of the Who Shot Mr Burns episode of the Simpsons I don t know about the rest of you but I thought it was rather obvious who the killer was going to be I think Mendes put way too much emphasis on the murder which he set up at the beginning and by the way did he have to tell us all this at the beginning in the first place No one could have screwed up the amazing payoff at the end of the film though i believe the main reason this film touched so many people must be the last scene It is truly remarkable to behold,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0592932/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2018,"An odd movie that, in its final moments, manages to be almost transcendent.",American Beauty 2000 is an odd blend of comedy and drama which come together to successfully compliment each other and make the whole experience more impactful It s film which isn t afraid to get dark and cynical but which also has a real optimistic heart and positive outlook at its core It s an experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll The fantastic screenplay mixes with the amazing acting to create a seamless sort of imagined realism that allows for a true cinematic reflection of real life The haunting ending is both truly tragic and strangely happy all at once Oddly the juxtaposition of these elements works brilliantly allowing the final moments to be almost truly transcendent 8 10,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4160354/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2000,Come on Folks!,In a year that brought us such magnificent films as The Straight Story Topsy Turvy Being John Malkovich The Insider The Sixth Sense and Boys Don t Cry why WHY did this sensationalist piece of garbage receive such adoration I shall take that question with me to my grave Although I will admit to finding the film s performances impressive I make no apologies for saying that Kevin Spacey did not deserve to win best actor by a longshot Both Denzel Washington and especially Richard Farnsworth gave performances of far greater depth and difficulty and I can only thank the rising sun in the East that Anette Benning did not garner a best actress nod for her performance Everyone talks about how deep and profound this film was in exploring the hollowness of American materialism but in truth all themes covered in this picture have been explored time and time again For a fine example of this check out 1997 s film Happiness that though disturbing sheds away from Beauty s gratuitous excess Years from now people will wonder what all of this film s hype was about as it will not stand the test of time,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0591681/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,Simply sensational!,American Beauty is one of my all time favorite movies for so many reasons From the excellent cast to the beautiful photography and cinematography this is a very special film and a motion picture masterpiece American Beauty features interesting characters and fantastic character development This film can be used as an example of character study as every single character undergoes character development It simply is sensational Kevin Spacey stars as Lester who is viewed by his family as a total loser With a new outlook on life after meeting his daughter s girlfriend Angela very well played by Mena Suvari he decides to change his life completely These drastic measures affects everyone around him including his neighbors The blend of humor and drama is seamless with the dry humor being very effective and funny Kevin Spacey steals the show and gives an incredible performance And he is looking mighty fine too American Beauty is a film that deserves numerous viewings and needs to be watched alone at least once to allow all your senses to open up to all the different elements while you ponder about how relatable this is possibly to your own life,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7755955/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2019,Philosophical and Ironic - every film student needs to study it,I just read a long review of American Beauty on Wikipedia and it stated that film critics opinions of it had declined over time and that it was overpraised when it was released I cannot agree This film is deeply philosophical it is about the meaning of life with particular attention on the lives of middle aged middle class adults and their teenaged children American Beauty is also very funny in a sarcastic dark comedy manner that I find very appealing How many films have you seen there the narrator who introduces the film and concludes it tells you he is dead but that this is not important to the story he has to tell By the way Wikipedia did not note this key fact the American Beauty Rose the hybrid flower that is displayed symbolically throughout the film is known to be very beautiful but it is also prone to infestation by fungus so it often has a very bad smell Even a flower can be ironic,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5237813/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,Creep & Cringe,A friend of mine knowing I watch a lot of movies couldn t believe I hadn t seen this one Looking back at the year it was released explained why it had fallen through the cracks so I was very interested to see a supposed gem that I had missed And so I sat down today totally ready to be entertained Sad to say I was not This script is awkward uncomfortable and creepy However unlike most bad movies I didn t abandon it or force myself to finish it I actually wanted to hoping there would be some redeeming quality to boost it into positive territory There wasn t I realize due to the high ratings and people seemingly falling over themselves to write glowing reviews that I m in the minority Frankly I just don t get it,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8512661/?ref_=tt_urv
