12 November 2011,I enjoyed it.,Three months ago I watched the animated movie that covers essentially the same story that of the hot shot sometimes irresponsible American test pilot that gets recruited into the Green Latern Corps the several thousand who each have a sector of the universe to protect Here we get real people telling the story Ryan Reynolds is the focus as test pilot Hal Jordan He is flying a test mission to help demonstrate the advantages of a new fighter plane when he pulls a very risky move and ends up destroying the plane Soon after he is pulled into the presence of a dying Green Lantern who tells him the ring has chosen you When he is transported to the secret location in a far corner of the universe he is met with much skepticism All the other green lanterns are from races much older than the human race and they doubt that an Earthling human has what it takes This of course provides the drama for Hal s quest to prove himself and become what our comic books refer to as the Green Lantern A large obstacle is the evil monster of sorts that is absorbing the energy of others and in the process growing more powerful Unstopped it would destroy the universe as we know it Hal needs to become the hero that stops the monster and in the process earning his status Good movie I enjoyed it,0.0,48.0,55.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2517306/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,It's not that bad from the viewer pov,Seriously it is not that bad from the publics point of view it still entertaining to watch on a boring afternoon Ryan hated this film a lot had a poor working relationship with director BUT one brilliant thing did happen he met Blake and had a happy family that is one good thing,7.0,26.0,27.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8249225/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,Introduces Character,The movie starts with a CG background science fiction origins of Green Lantern The power of the Green Lantern is given to those who do not know fear Parallax is introduced as the evil force which is fear As a Green Lantern lays crashed he releases his Green Lantern ring force to someone who doesn t know the meaning of the word fear Clearly that is Hal Jordon Ryan Reynolds who thinks he is Tom Cruise in Top Gun as he defeats 2 High tech pilot less air craft by using a maneuver from Ironman The movie spends a lot of time building background and lays the foundation for a multiple sequels This is mostly an introduction of the character While the Green Lantern is flying around impressing his former gf mad scientist and son of a senator Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard has been experimenting by injecting himself with microbes which happen to be alien creating the super villain for our super hero They spent a ton of money on special effects The ring may never make a mistake but the casting director did They should have gone the extra expense to get some real box office stars Ryan Reynolds didn t hack it No sex no nudity and no F bombs Good for kids,8.0,21.0,24.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4075617/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2011,Underrated Comic Flick That Deserves More Praise,Comic book adaptations are quickly becoming one of the most popular movie genres of the modern era With high speed action a good story and some great acting who could blame it however there is one film that is constantly battered by fans and movie goers alike Yes this is my review of Green Lantern Note I do not believe in Millions of years so i m just going to leave it out of this review I ignore usually these kind of references The plot goes like this Somewhere in the universe a mighty force of nature called Parallax who feeds on the fear of the universe escapes custody by a green lantern warrior known as Abin Sur Parallax fatally wounds Abin but he narrowly escapes instant death in an escape pod He contacts the rest of the green lanterns and tells them who he encountered and that he will die His pod lands on earth and at the brink of death he is met by a man who was brought there by his power ring He passes on the ring to the man Hal Jordan and tells him to speak the oath He does and becomes one of the green lanterns It eventually falls on him to save the universe from Parallax and defeat him once and for all While this movie doesn t live up to the standards of Captain America The First Avenger or the Nolan Batman Trilogy this film is still quite enjoyable I ll admit the acting wasn t that great There was no real character that stood out for me as being well acted but it was still watchable As for the characters themselves they were quite interesting Although the human characters were interesting to an extent It s the green lanterns that stole the show Their is one scene were all the green lanterns are having a conference of some sort There are so many green lanterns that sometimes all you see is green Each one looks different and unique I actually pause at this part to see what other strange beings i missed inn the first viewing Props to the designers for creating some brilliant looking creatures The story isn t to special but it is interesting It s nothing more than the normal super hero origin story with a couple of unorthodox plot lines The movie s ending tells you that there is another movie coming I won t spoil But green Lantern fans will like it If they didn t like the movie itself The villain I thought is what brings the film down a notch Halfway through the film a scientist gets infected by the power source of Parallax corrupting him into a monstrous creature that can control objects with his eyes I wasn t too fond of the guy His motives for his actions were uninteresting making some of the intence scenes a little tedious but this is a minor fault Parallax is more impressive There are some scenes were he is tearing through the city eating everything in his path However like the other guy Who s name escapes me Parallax lacks motive for what he does other than the fact he needs fear to become more powerful One of the most interesting things about the green lanterns is the power to make thought reality For example you can think of a massive artillery gun and it would appear right beside you This is an interesting concept and is far more diverse to other superheros Although there are plenty of scenes of this power I thought it was under used Sometimes all they did was fire balls of green energy at their enemies which I thought was a waste Don t let that put you off though There are some impressive action scenes to sink your teeth into The battle at the end with Parallax is definitely worth seeing It didn t have as much action as i thought it would have or would have liked but it still was satisfying All in all a great summer action flick Not everyone s cup of tea but if you just like watching movies and are willing to bypass mistakes this is the film for you With over use of CGI ad badly created villains it wasn t the best way to start a franchise but it is still enjoyable none the less,7.0,72.0,78.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2540272/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2011,"Not bad, not good, just mildly average",I like superhero movies as much as the next person having grown up on the likes of Superman and Batman Green Lantern is not the worst superhero movie but far from the best either For me it was just a mildly average and somewhat bland movie that didn t live up to the potential it had Getting the good things out of the way I did like the cinematography settings and costumes very much and while they weren t among the best or most detailed I ve seen the effects were better than average apart from Parralex The score soundtrack by James Newton Howard compliments the film very nicely Martin Campbell s direction is assured and there are classy turns from Mark Strong Tim Robbins and Peter Sarsgaard On the other hand Ryan Reynolds didn t quite work for me Now don t get me wrong I initially found him an ideal choice in the title role The problem is not that Reynolds is bad actually he is quite spirited in the role it s just that the character himself like a lot of the characters in the movie is irritatingly bland Blake Lively is cute and lovely but her performance goes little beyond that The story starts off well with an intriguing idea being an origin story and all but is bogged down by too many characters tedious pacing and too thin a story for such a running time consequently some scenes seemed as though they were going on longer than they should ve done However though these problems are pretty trivial compared to the script which to put it kindly was an awkward clich driven mess Overall neither good or bad but very average and bland 5 10 Bethany Cox,5.0,20.0,24.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2456311/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2011,"It wasn't that bad, why the hate?",I saw Green Lantern with my son because it looked safe enough and I used to collect the comic books when I was a kid I felt like I was the only guy over 20 at the theater which I guess isn t surprising anymore Did think there would be more adults however because the Green Lantern was something we read in my generation Not sure if it s even around anymore Being a fan of the comic book I had to go see it and I was intrigued with the movie After I got home I jumped on the computer and read the reviews I was very disappointed with the professional reviews that cast stones at it while at the same time regular folk like myself thought it was a pretty good stab at the DC comic book version I guess I look for something different when I go to the movies I go to unwind and enjoy myself for a couple of hours and Green Lantern worked for me,0.0,308.0,342.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2499287/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2015,What A Nice Surprise,I avoided this film for for a long time because I thought that many didn t like it a la Daredevil but was I wrong to avoid it I loved this movie and have now seen it many times I barely remember reading Green Lantern as a kid but who cares this was a fun exciting and impressive movie Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Hal Jordan and everyone else was fine also Special Effects were top notch The film still made an impressive 116 million domestically which shows that many people ignored the ignorant critics Parallax was a superb creation I intend to see this film many more times in the future,8.0,101.0,117.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3154758/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2012,A Likable Comic Book Movie,I know a lot of people didn t like Green Lantern but I don t know why It was a fun movie with a good solid lead in Ryan Reynolds It was not as dark as The Dark Knight or V For Vendetta but that is not the nature of Green Lantern The special effects were good and the casting was fine Tim Robbins was well cast as Hammond as was Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond Kudos to Mark Strong as Sinestro I do hope they do a sequel with him as Sinestro was one of my favourite villains All up it was a solid film and one I enjoyed immensely Pity some people were disappointed but to be honest I don t know what they were expecting as the film stayed reasonably true to the character and the tone of the comic books,10.0,61.0,78.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2616874/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,Watchable,Even though Campbell made it so easy for many to hate this film I still think it s watchable Reynolds came in again to save th day This guy cracks me up If I were ever to switch sides on the sexuality scale it would be because of the dazzling Reynolds,8.0,9.0,9.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7982727/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,The critics are way overreacting.,Now let me begin by saying this film is not an amazing film It is definitely not an awful film like most critics are saying I think critics might have raised their expectations due to Thor and X Men First Class They should not compare the Green Lantern with those films It is ranked now 24 on Rotten Tomatoes which is way too low It would probably be in the high 60s if it was released before Thor and X Men First Class The acting in the film is good and not terrible at all Ryan Reynolds is great as Hal Jordan and extremely likable He definitely fits the role as Hal Jordan really well Blake Lively is great and extremely sexy she s not just a pretty face as most are suggesting Peter Sarsgaard is a great actor and he plays the villainous Hector Hemmond really well and interesting Overall everyone tries their best and at the end of the day do a really great job certainly no Oscar worthy performances though The special effects are pretty superb and extremely worthwhile to say the least Although it sometimes feel a little CGIish but it doesn t get too big of a distraction I have to say I was a little disappointed how Parallax looked like it felt a little fake at times but it is not horrible in any sense of the way Also the film did not take itself seriously which is kind of refreshing Which could be the reason why critics disliked it so much They want another sad personal and serious story Unlike Thor and X Men The Green Lantern is more kids friendly The main problem of the film was that they were trying to cram stuff in from the comics and the personal lives of the other characters It seems that there could be so many sequels for the other characters It did kind of focus on too many characters Also the editing gets to be a little distracting at times they certainly needed to have done a better job but the editing is mediocre at best Overall the Green Lantern was a fun summer flick Although it is nowhere near the realm of The Dark Knight it didn t need to be The 3D was actually really good and the special effects were memorable No doubt the critics were extremely tough on the Green Lantern and it is unfair At the end of the day don t listen to the critics Make up your mind and see this film At the end of the day it should be only your opinion that matters to you You might agree with the critics or you might not However don t skip this movie because of the low Rotten Tomatoes score,7.0,587.0,760.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445627/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,"""In Brightest Day...""",I have the Green Lantern Comics Numbers 49 51 circa 1993 where Hal Jordan goes crazy and smashes the main power battery on OA and gives up his GL status to a new Green Lantern But Hal Jordan has always been Green Lantern to me even with other people putting the ring on over the years This film accounts the story of how Hal Jordan was chosen by the ring as the dying Abin Sur sends out the ring to find a successor Not to get into too much of a spoiler here so I won t say how that happens in the film which is slightly different than the original Origin or Green Lantern stories I have read when I was a kid suffice it to say the people who made this film had 5 decades of Green Lantern stories to get into a 2 hour film And they did it good I saw this in 3D and it was adequate 3D the look of Green Lantern was sort of a blend of all the different changes in costume he had over the years Ryan Reynolds was a very good Hal Jordan and Blake Lively a very very good Carol Ferris A lot of the characters from the comics are in this there is a Pieface but he is not Asian there is an appearance by Sinestro who in this film is the head of the Green Lantern Corps which includes veteran Green Lantern Tomar Re voiced by Geoffery Rush and Micheal Clark Duncan voicing Kilowog all much loved GL characters and the appearance of the Green Lantern Corps was a very good idea The Guardians of OA looked much like they looked in the comics they named none of the Guardian Actors save Warren Burton and Salome Jens who was the main Shape Shifter in Star Trek Deep Space 9 the rest of them are well they are just Guardians the evil entity Parallax was voiced by one of my favourite actors Clancy Brown As far as Production some great names popped out during the credits James Newton Howard did a very good score on par with his King Kong score and the whole production was designed by another who worked on King Kong Oscar winner Grant Major who had that same job in Lord of the Rings trilogy And the costumes were done by another Lord of the Rings veteran Ngila Dickson another Oscar winner As far as the director I had never heard of Martin Campbell except for Casino Royale and Vertical Limit but one name did pop out Stuart Baird a veteran Editor who has edited some great films all the way back to the Donner version of Superman II Gorillas in the Mist and of course he directed Star Trek Nemesis which I rather liked Green Lantern being one of my favourite comic books when I was a kid I was very gratified to see this film They really did not take very many liberties with the stories which they cultivated to make this film so I give it a 10 Mostly because I can care less what anyone s lame gripes about this film are I thoroughly enjoyed it it was done very well,10.0,67.0,93.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450139/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2017,I don't understand the hate for this film,As I have mentioned at the top I honestly don t understand the hate for this Personally this is one of my favorite DC live movies of all time I have to admit as well Green Lantern is my favourite member of the whole Justice League When this movie was released I had no interest in DC but in 2015 I actually sat down and watched the whole and I liked it The movie had good effects story acting and costume for the lanterns I actually liked Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern considering he was very cocky but he is better as Deadpool at least I also liked the woman who was Carol Ferris in the movie Temura Morris who was Abin Sur he also played Boba Cody the clones and Jango in star wars and he will be Aquaman s dad in the Aquaman movie Also Mark Strong did a good Sinestro it is a real shame this movie never got a sequel because I would have been interested to see how he would have handled the evil side of Sinestro I also think Clancy Brown did good voice work as Parallax the whole fight with him was the best part Overall it was an awesome movie don t listen to the hate if you are a green lantern fan then you might like this I just hope DCEU find a better Green Lantern for The Green Lantern Corps 2020 and Justice league 2 movies,10.0,9.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3864768/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2011,Movie could have been so much better,As someone who s followed Green Lantern a little bit of a decent amount not big but fairly decent for DC character I liked some things about the movie but I definitely say that it could have been made better both for casual fans non GL fans or hard core ones Good points 1 It stuck fairly consistently with the mythos of the origin and Planet OA 2 Ryan Reynolds did decently as Hal Jordan though he fits more with the Kyle Rayner Guy Gardner type than Jordan but I wish he was more serious though non GL fans couldn t care less about this 3 Blake Lively was eye candy super hot but not much else 4 Green Lanterns Tomar Re Kilowog and Abin Sur were damn good but didn t have enough screen time to be significant 5 Mark Strong s Sinestro was excellent 6 Hector Hammond was well portrayed by Peter Saarsgard though it lacked a proper finish 7 Good supporting cast from Tim Robbins Sen Hammond to Angela Bassett Amanda Waller 8 Green Lantern s costume was wicked 9 Visual CGI effects were pretty good Bad Points It tried to fit too much into one movie moving back and forth from Earth and outer space OA thus there was no proper flow like when there was a build up of momentum things go slow or boring or from serious to funny without proper pacing too many stories were crammed into one movie Humor was misplaced at times good peg is Thor which had it in the flow rather than contrived forced Parallax looked comical scary at times but only a couple of times Like Iron Man 2 I wish the fight scenes were so much more they spent too much on the set up that the fights were short and could have been so much more and elaborate Some scenes and even some characters were not necessary Hal s best friend even some scenes with Blake s Carol Ferris were not needed they should have added more action instead Summary visual effects actors GL base story good But the way the writers and director put things together were a mixture of various plots and subplots crazy glued into one movie for pure entertainment Kids will enjoy it but adults likely will not This is a summer of superheroes with 3 down and one more to go well technically 5 with Transformers if you re thinking comic book stories so it s quite impossible not to compare them to each other The director is known to direct good flicks like Goldeneye and Casino Royale two good movies but I wish he did more studied more had split up more stories to be more single minded and not work on a cluttered material,6.0,147.0,198.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446265/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2018,Underrated,Not the best superhero movie of all time but this was a lot of fun Ryan Reynolds is hilarious and a lot of the action is great You can also tell that the people who made this film were actual fans of the character and his history staying relatively faithful for a movie to the source material and comics I wish they had done another one,9.0,32.0,38.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4107357/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2020,Movie came 5 or 6 years too early,This movie became a meme when it came out Even using it for punch lines and promos for Deadpool Its light hearted approach would fit perfectly into MCU I know its DC The reason this movie really got slated on release is down to timing We just had the Dark Knight in 2009 I think and in 2012 the Dark Knight rises So that dark and serious Nolan style was all the rage I remember complaints like its too cartoony Not sure how else you can show the Lanterns power without it Recent reviews with this being on Amazon are much better averaging at 7 out of 10 Thats where I d put it Its better than a lot of the marvel stuff in recent years Maybe DC will reboot it who knows,7.0,10.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6093284/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2013,Not as bad as Critics say,There are some good and some bad The CGI is too dark lighting wise and the green makes it look too fake cartoon like It s watchable but it doesn t inspire The Green Lantern manifestations make the action rather random I could tell they spent lots of money on the CGI I m just not certain it was the most compelling creations Parallax also look very much like a cartoon instead of something menacing Ryan Reynolds is a good actor He s making Hal Jordan a jester It s in Reynolds DNA and I don t think he could stop anyways Blake Lively is not my favorite actress She does slightly better than I expected Basically she does a girlfriend role without much heat Peter Sarsgaard is also functional as the weaselly Hector Hammond I can certainly see others who could do the villain role much better There may be too much going on for a single movie But it could still be followed quite easily I m just not sure if all the elements are given enough attention I do like the theme of fear and the will to overcome those fears It s a little ham fisted but it still works Overall it s an average superhero movie with some minor flaws,6.0,6.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2926037/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2011,A World Of Overreaction,While I admit this movie had it s flaws I do strongly believe this movie has been vastly underrated by the public Unfortunately Green Lantern came at a time when comic inspired novels have been done almost to death While most done quite brilliantly most being the operative word here Green Lantern I believe did not live up to the expectations we now have of comic adaptations Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan was a great choice for the role of The Green Lantern the character arc while helping you to understand the character of Hal Jordan was sufficient I do believe they could of well exceeded what they did For a story as immense as the Green Lantern I believe that the close to two hours was to short to completely describe and help understand the Green Lantern universe The length I believe to be the biggest drawback in this movie In my opinion the movie should of been closer to the length of The Watchmen to completely illustrate the complexity and brilliance that the Green Lantern universe really is For me I believed the hype going into this movie I had a completely closed mind and fully expected this movie to be as one critic described it Green Lantern The worst comic book movie ever made Honestly I have to say that I m glad that I read that review before viewing this movie as it made it all that sweeter when the movie went beyond all I thought it would be and greatly impressed me I m sorry that this movie was received so badly because the chances of seeing a sequel have dropped and in a universe where anything is possible I think we will miss out on all that the Green Lantern franchise could be,7.0,138.0,152.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2498656/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,It's Not Easy Being Green.....,I went to see Green Lantern because a friend of mine was boycotting DC for such a long time because there has been no release of a Green Lantern movie Sure there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman but where s Green Lantern Someone out there listened to his plea and the result is this A mess I will go on record to say that it s at least enjoyable Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening I would say that during this movie I had a hard time finding a bathroom break I was at least interested to see where the movie is going Let me try to explain this movie There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro well played by Mark Strong who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax So when their alien friend who s name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies his ring is sent out to choose a new victim and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds Mr Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability and that he is the earth s only hope but he can t handle that until the end of the movie Not only that but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which I guess is controlled by Parallax and Ryan has to stop him too I must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father Tim Robbins and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield Earth I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed and not only did scenes felt random but events turn random too Like the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring It just happens out of nowhere One minute he s talking to this kid which never served much purpose to the film and then all of a sudden he s walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude This happened in more than one occasion Also the CGI was all over the place even on Reynold s outfit and it s rather distracting It s very vibrant and colorful which is good but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight Heck even the love interest felt underdeveloped By the end of the film I felt like I barely knew the characters with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds However Green Lantern isn t boring just purely average I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much I already had groups of people telling me that this film is awful before its release so I ended up getting a little more than I expected Just a little It was still entertaining to say the least,5.0,102.0,157.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445636/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2011,Not another green movie...,Another in a long line of comic book films released this year Green Lantern unfortunately doesn t compare to Thor X Men First Class or Captain America Had I seen Green Lantern before seeing those other three films perhaps I wouldn t be as critical of it But those previous movies set a high standard that this latest comic book movie doesn t quite reach I feel a large part of why GL isn t as successful as the films before it is the pace and editing A film about aliens space police and a ring that can transform thought into reality should all come together to make one hell of an interesting film but somehow the movie suffers from a seemingly sluggish pace in the beginning thanks to a rather snore worthy voice over explaining things that we need to know before anything really interesting happens Starting movies with prologues exposition can be interesting but this one manages to make everything that should be interesting somehow dull It s actually very disappointing given that director Martin Campbell was behind two of the best Bond movies ever Goldeneye and Casino Royale Those films never had a dull moment in them whereas GL seems to have too many I m one who hadn t known the first thing about Green Lantern having never read the comics before seeing this movie Having heard the name a while back I figured it was just some dude who liked the colour green and walked around with an old timey lantern Luckily it s a bit more interesting than that It actually involves a ring and a human Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds who the ring chooses to join an intergalactic military police force known as the Green Lantern Corps Turns out I wasn t entirely wrong as there is indeed a lantern involved but thankfully it s not old timey and he doesn t just carry it around with him wherever he goes Though he does swear an oath to it one of the lighter moments in the film Reynolds wasn t apparently many people s ideal actor to play Hal but I think he serves the role of the jet fighter test pilot turned universe protector well Yes he does play a bit of a jerk and he does have some funny lines but he s also believable in the more serious moments When he recites the oath for the second time you know he s grown as a character Reynolds is convincing in his portrayal of Hal s flaws as a person and by the end you re on his side The lovely and very aptly named Blake Lively is a breath of fresh air livening things up and injecting some much needed energy into the otherwise kinda dull proceedings As Carol Ferris she s not only a fellow pilot with Hal but also someone with whom Hal has a history Not just another ordinary boring love interest she s able to stand up to Hal not take his crap and can handle herself admirably Best of all though She s no idiot Most awesomely Hal s lame Superman in glasses like attempt to cover up his identity with nothing more than a small green mask doesn t work on Carol As she says she s known him her whole life and not being able to see his cheek bones isn t going to fool her She immediately recognises it s him Other superheroes love interests would do well to learn from Carol take note Lois Lane The scene where he tries out his best Batman voice on her after having earlier rescued her in public from a crashing helicopter by creating a race track for it to land on is one of the best in the entire film Carol s reactions to seeing through Hal s mask are really quite good amusing It s one of the more unique things about the film where most tend to have the love interest remain in the dark or look stupid for not having figured out things early on I liked how Carol wasn t just giving Hal crap nonstop but also encouraged him saved him Lively and Reynolds have decent chemistry and share some good moments together Though the rest supporting characters both human alien are all rather average This lack of character development lets the film down It also doesn t help that the villain s of the film are among some of the most non scary laugh worthy villains ever to appear in comic book films up there with Green Goblin Parallax is nothing more than a big angry dust cloud that zaps people with yellow You know you re in trouble when this is the Big Bad of the movie The film s Little Bad is hair sniffer Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard who becomes infected by Parallax and gains telepathic telekinetic abilities as a result but also literally gets a big head doesn t really seem like a fair trade off Our fat headed villain is gross to look at but other than that he s not particularly effective He s just another poor sod with daddy issues and bad luck He shares minimal dialogue with Hal and Carol and yet we re supposed to buy them as people who know each other well The only real tense moment I felt involving them was was when Hector s threatening to make Carol like him something no SANE person would want to see happen What I felt really let the film down was the pacing Things seem to be shown to us in a strange order a lot of the time and it just feels off I will say that the movie did allow for some interesting uses of CGI the constructs Hal forms with his mind the ring are pretty exciting creative The flying was also good And it makes sense his costume looks the way it does since it s created out of energy This isn t a bad film as such it just isn t all that it could have been Still here s hoping that a sequel improves on it Despite all the flaws I do wish to see Hal Jordan and Carrol Ferris again Until then go

28 October 2011,Traditional For A Super Hero Movie,I just watched this new Green Lantern film on VCD just a few days ago and I figure this one has pretty much everything people can expect from a super hero movie For instance there are a couple of times where the title character gets into near death experiences but was able to get out of it a very essential theme for films of this genre Another great theme used shows how the hero went from being a misfit to someone worth being part of the fighting force There s probably a number of explanations why this film did little in the box office But I figure the most logical reason might be that the title character isn t as famous as those other DC Comics heroes I mean I ve been hearing about Superman and Batman when I was a kid As for Green Lantern I never heard of him until the Justice League series appeared in Cartoon Network Anyway I do find that green guy cool to watch,9.0,10.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2509741/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2011,Excellent,I m not sure why so many people disliked this movie Perhaps I like it so much precisely because I came to it with VERY low expectations In general superhero movies leave me cold But this one was better than most and Ryan Reynolds was charming in his role I thought it was as good if not better than x men and MUCH better than Thor which was terrible I loved that when people who knew Green Lantern IRL met him they RECOGNIZED him because that has always bugged me about superheroes Take a massively built 6 foot 4 guy with distinctive bone structure and eyes and just pop on a pair of glases or a cowl and suddenly nobody knows who it is Thank god this movie avoided that Also I loved the look of the myriad races as they appeared on Oa very cool Great flick and it s too bad there most likely won t be a sequel now,0.0,15.0,18.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2463193/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,The Green Cheese,We are getting decent and compelling superhero movies these days which is a great thing that happened to the genre Now Green Lantern is one of those films that also needs to be powerful but it ends up being a generic cheesy cinema Green Lantern is not perfectly horrible or the worst superhero movie ever but it s just too much exposition and a whole lot of green cheese Green Lantern has a great concept Just like the other superhero films the storytelling also needs to be compelling Unfortunately the film gets lazy to tell the story so they just threw a lot of narration and even the ones that are not quite necessary to narrate The action is not very amazing it s just showing us how eye candy the effects are At least the movie is loyal to its corniness Hal Jordan s wacky imagination and the aliens zany looking faces The CGI is pretty The performances were entertaining enough Ryan Reynolds is doing his same old thing Mark Strong didn t appear so much which is disappointing but still he s awesome It s disappointing because they re making the interesting villains into uninteresting Example Parallax should be terrifying and menacing Instead he s a scrambled egg who eats fear Not really terrifying nor menacing Peter Sarsgaard s mad scientist performance was pretty good but the only thing he did in this film is crying in agony and use his telekinesis powers in a lame way Green Lantern just wanted to show its beautiful visuals It s not a very bad thing but the filmmakers doesn t take its storytelling so seriously It can be entertaining for some reason but it can also be forgettable It s good to see it in the big screen for the visuals but you don t want to see it again after that This might be the weakest superhero movie of the year Even The Green Hornet is better than this Thor might be the best superhero film of 2011 so far in my opinion because even though the action isn t great at least there is a compelling storytelling The sad thing is both the action and the storytelling are not compelling in Green Lantern 3D Very dark,5.0,141.0,225.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445849/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2011,Nowhere near as bad the critics made out,Look you don t come to a film like this expecting Citizen Kane This was a great popcorn flick Unfortunately these days too many professional critics have an intellectual bias whereby they feel if they dare give a film like this a decent review they ll be laughed out of their silly little jobs I ve watched a good few films this summer and some of those the critics have lauded I ve found to be OK ish but riddled with plot holes and average acting Hanna anyone the problem is with superhero films is that they come with an already built in audience i e the fanboys These guys will immediately dismiss any film adaptation of a beloved comic book hero if it doesn t stick religiously to the source material Then you have the other guys film fans who will try to pick holes in anything that doesn t fit the superhero movie archetype Essentially you ll NEVER please either of these groups and unfortunately they are the most vocal I however am a fanboy and a film fan so I skate the middle line This gives me an advantage as I realise that comics cannot be 100 adapted to film and that film must be adapted to comic books as much as it can Green Lantern was a victim of both these parties However they have done it an injustice This was a thoroughly enjoyable well acted even for Ryan Reynolds slice of fried gold Yes it has it s weak points it takes it sweet time to get going and the romance angle felt tacked on but it was easily on a par with other comic book adaptations of this year Thor and Captain America and really did not deserve the drubbing it got My advice don t listen to the critics or the fan boys or even me Watch the film and make up your own mind I m sure you ll be pleasantly surprised,7.0,15.0,19.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2492795/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,"Jumbled, confused, dim and threadbare. Really, it's just stupid.",This film is inoffensive in a way Nothing hateful or terribly gross or upsetting about it But it does have at least two major problems that had I known fully what they were beforehand I would have saved myself a bit of money and my time and done something else One this is yet another in the tiresome line of uninspired movies based on a comic book You d think the collective hearts and minds of what we call Hollywood could come up with an original idea Spending 150 million on a gimicky re working of some other person s idea that is ripping off the comic book writers really seems stupid There are many talented artists out there whose work not only deserves to be funded but whose work would be a lot more interesting Maybe even exciting And maybe in at least a few cases uplifting or inspiring in some way that actually contributes something to all of us which is the true purpose of art anyway right And two this wasn t very carefully thought out or written You ve heard criticisms of previous special FX movies where the reviewer bemoans all the slam bam frenetic FX shots one after another I promise that if you are unfortunate enough to sit through this movie your jaw will drop at the sheer amount of literally non stop whiz bang FX not even one after another so much as one continuous blast of the CGI cartoonist s most hectic product The plot points were not self evident at least not to me Jet races were followed by jump cuts to kitchen scenes and then inter galactic scenes then space then what appeared to be Hell then mysterioso councils of wizened old cartoon yoda types etc A virtually indestructible space warrior we find out later he was the strongest bravest most clever the final hope of the Universe etc yet he somehow got shot in the shoulder and is in the process of flying his broken spaceship around earth looking for a place to crash and die Oh wait he doesn t die until he tells his green ring to choose well and then somehow Ryan Reynolds shows up ready to be amazed and enlisted One question if the magic green ring is clever enough to find Ryan Reynolds amidst all of earth and not just ID him but go get him place him in a protective green bubble then whisk him 100 miles to the dying space warrior in instant why couldn t such a nifty ring fix a wounded shoulder Scenes reminiscent of the covers of 1950s sci fi paperback books showed vague and ill defined landscapes of rocks and cliffs and rubble That kind of thing is OK and might fit into some stories but nothing was explained nothing was set up nothing was logical Not even artistically logical I like Ryan Reynolds Tim Robbins has always been a sturdy enough character actor and a few of the other secondary characters here were played by good actors as well But dang I had no idea what they were doing What s with that creepy doctor guy What is the evident long term relationship between him and Ryan Reynolds What was he doing in the movie anyway except to turn physically hideous and provide a bit of senseless peril to the Pretty Girl I don t know none of that was established Bottom line this was just plain stupid And not because it was fantastical or weird or sci fi Rather because it was simply not good work,2.0,77.0,139.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445054/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2011,A Great DC Comic Adaptation,Green Lantern is without a doubt one of the greatest comic book series of all time with great creativity and originality filling the pages of the comics Now a live action film has been released and it truly captures that creativity The film is centered around the character of Hal Jordan a pilot who fears failure since his father s death who crashed after a malfunction in his plane s engine Hal is chosen to join a galactic peace keeper force known as the Green Lantern Corp after one of its finest members was killed Abin Sur But to be a Lantern one must be without fear and Hal believes the ring made a mistake in choosing him as he is afraid of his destiny Many people have said that Ryan Reynolds was a bad choice for Hal Jordan but he truly wasn t he captured Hal s fear courage and cocky attitude perfectly Plus Martin Campbell was a great choice as the director but Zack Snyder would have been a good choice too He knew when to have action and when to give detailed story Another thing everyone is complaining about too much CGI but the thing is how do you re create a sci fi story into a movie where a galactic police force travels the universe to protect its inhabitants from true evil You have to use a lot of CGI to capture the sci fi settings and creatures that are part of the story as well because even robotics can t cover it all But overall Green Lantern is a great origin story building up the story of the Green Lanterns and Hal Jordan s destiny to become a Lantern as well Don t miss this incredible comic adaptation 9 10 Stars,6.0,9.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2461309/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2011,"Maybe it's because I had low expectations for this movie, but it's not that bad",To start with I wasn t really a fan of The Green Lantern in comic books or was hyped to see the movie when I saw the trailer for this superhero He does have a pretty cool super power and all but just didn t find this character all that fascinating Maybe it s because I had pretty much low expectations of this movie since I heard many negative things about this movie But it wasn t all that bad even the script had been better and less predictable it would have been much better But this is a decent superhero movie that has some fun scenes and I actually enjoyed watching this movie to some degree This isn t a great superhero movie but for the most part it really is passable The main flaw though is how predictable most of it is and some parts just seemed kinda lame the script just wasn t all that interesting The action sequences however and the special effects were well done for the most part and the acting is decent as well The way it shows the superhero and villains powers was entertaining because it s actually sort of creative and fast paced This is basically the origin story for Hal Jordan aka Green Lantern Ryan Reynolds and it s a decent start if this becomes a franchise 6 9 10,6.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2455017/?ref_=tt_urv

18 July 2011,"Well, I loved it.",This film is a highly underrated masterpiece fast paced fun and true to the comic The cast is almost right though they should have used somebody more serious for the lead than Ryan Reynolds Sam Worthington perhaps Blake Lively makes a sexy helpless heroine and Peter Sarsgaard does a fine job as a creepy bad guy albeit one covered in makeup All in all this deserves to be up there with Superman II Dark Knight and the first two Spidermans I really do hope they ll ignore the critics and box office revenue to make a second one as I feel one of the reasons its flopped is because many people who have watched it had never read the comic beforehand meaning it was harder to pick up some parts of the plot,10.0,40.0,55.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2460516/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2012,"In Brightest Day, this movie will still be mediocre.",There is a reason why Ryan Reynolds flunked drama class in high school He s just a lousy actor in some roles other roles he might be great It shows in Green Lantern which just disappointed comic fans Most people will see this under fan boy attitude and some people will come in with their own idea of how the movie should Some people will complain that it s isn t John Stewart known as the Justice League Green Lantern or Alan Scott the original Green Lantern Hal Jordan is probably the most famous of both of the Lanterns character and really reboot the character during the Silver Age of Comic Books in the 1950 s This movie fails to reach that normal theater watcher casual audience cause it s throws so much information at you in a short period of time For the smart nerdy fans it didn t do enough So most people looking into this film might be offensive by it Some people will think it had too cheese and some people will think it s too meaty For those who don t read the comics the plot go as this Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds a test pilot is selected to become the first human member of the Green Lantern Corps when Abin Sur alien Green Lantern dies from his wounds during a crash Hal is given a ring that grants him superpowers He reluctantly at first takes on the challenges these superheroes face Putting his self doubts aside and spurred on by his sense of duty and love for his beautiful intellectually equal colleague Carol Ferris Blake Lively and must confront the evil Parallax who threatens to upset the balance of power in the universe In depth the movie plot isn t as clear as that with plot holes endangering Green Lantern more than Parallax The biggest plot hole in the story is the word fear Parallax gets his power by fear Hal Jordan of the film shows no fear when fighting two prototype airplanes goes past 50 000 feet knowing that his plane will stall out and he will most likely die but he d stall the other planes out as well No fear of death at all However after making the heroic two kills identical to the Top Gun jet wash scene he s in a tail spin because he now for some reason is overcome with fear with the cut away flash backs scenes after his father dying that play no part later in the film later on They have to show balance within the character fear levels to give the character depth He can t be too powerful as people can t relate to him without flaws or a sign of weakness The way they show him having fear is badly written At moments he shows great courage doing something dangerous then another moment while doing the same thing show that he can t due to fear How do you believe that Hal Jordan has a fear of flying when first off he s flying jets and second off flying off in the lantern suit Due to this Parallax can t be taken serious as a threat to him as the movie builds him as being a cloud So the movie went to Peter Sargarrad as Hector Hammond a child hood friend who turned into a horrible creature due to the power of Parallax The climax without spoiling it was over quickly for a big battle between good and evil Now to the acting of the cast Ryan Reynolds was OK but it was just Ryan Reynolds being Ryan Reynolds He plays the down of earth fellow but I don t dig the brash and cocky that is so unlike Hal Jordan of the comics The character in the comics is more a Chuck Yeager type of a man Hal Jordan in the comics isn t wacky and he s really is a fearless test pilot I understand it might be a bit stiff but it s would work better Blake Lively is once again eye candy just seeing her acting like a pilot running a company at age 23 is funny because it s seems so unlikely in the real world Tim Robbins is Mr Hammond whom did a horrible job in this movie with over the top expression goofy and bad dialogue Mark Strong s role as Sinestro was great Peter Sarsgarrad was OK but the make up was bad as you can tell it was a wig There were huge changes from the comics to the movies and even pull characters from other comics in this movie Amanda Waller Angela Bassett s character was not from Green Lantern The CGI wasn t that great some of the aliens and action scenes look so unbelievable First off Abin Sur didn t look right in the dying scene a bit picky but no sweat no anything how in the earth was I supposed to know he s dying besides the wound on his chest Two the planet Oa it looks so computer rather than a city While Sinestro looks great the other aliens look so weak as shown in many scenes In the end check out the movie yourself and give it and try It s not a bad movie it s just not that good too Fans of Green Lantern can t excuse the editing and weird sub plots that never went anywhere The over use of exposition and inconsistent chopping at scenes drive it down The film should have left behind the earth stuff and just focused on what was its selling point is i e he s a space cop but the whole space stuff is reduced to just a few awkward scenes These problems must be solved in the sequel,6.0,4.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2693994/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2017,Lacked Intensity,After witnessing the death of his father in an aircraft accident Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds grows up trying to be as fearless as he presumes his father was This leads him to test his limits and accept risks that most normal people would not attempt Then one day an alien from another galaxy crashes his spaceship and upon realizing that he his death is imminent allows the essence within a powerful ring in his possession to seek out a worthy recipient who has the courage to face his fears Needless to say the essence immediately finds Hal and brings him to the alien who proceeds to give him the ring and some final last words before dying And so begins the life and adventure of another member of the Green Lantern Corps Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this could have been an excellent superhero film if it had a more serious or coherent plot Unfortunately the director Martin Campbell apparently couldn t focus on what kind of movie he wanted and the result was one which had some rather bad CGI along with some heroes and villains who belonged more to a children s matin e than a prime time movie In other words it lacked the necessary intensity Yet despite some of the negatives it wasn t necessarily a total disaster as it still remained fairly interesting and for that reason I have rated it accordingly Average,5.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3732757/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,At least there's a happy toy manufacturer out there...,To preface this I am a Green Lantern fan and have been for as long as I have read comic books so on with the review Some movies are made just to sell toys and this is one of them Underdeveloped characters underdeveloped relationships gaping plot holes and a movie in a bad need of a good rewrite plague DC Comics first cinematic foray outside the Batman Superman franchises making Green Lantern possibly the last DC movie other than Batman or Superman we will see for a while The Green Lanterns are intergalactic police officers and Earthling Hal Jordan just so happens to be the first human chosen to join their ranks but alas an evil is brewing in the farthest reaches of space and Hal must learn how to master his newfound powers or else You probably know what will happen next Green Lantern wants to adhere to the superhero movie formula but it does so with little charm little wit and not a lot in terms of flow from one scene to the other Not to mention characters come and go with no sense of where they came from or where they went when not on screen Should we care about Peter Sarsgaard s villain Hector Hammond His character is not even introduced till the second act and by then it is like Who is this guy and why should I care when he becomes the psychotic villain Then there is star Ryan Reynolds who obviously cared about the source material giving Hal Jordan his all but when you re in a movie that simply wants to try and get to the next action set piece as fast as possible so that they can satisfy the seven year old who is going to buy the toys it is hard to have much to toy with like that pun The action is impressive but when the story is just a bullet point cliff note version of the larger more expansive mythology that this comic book character boasts one can see why Green Lantern suffers in translation I give Green Lantern a 4 out of 10,4.0,33.0,63.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445584/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2011,"Lazy Writing, Directing and Action Make This One to Avoid",Back in 1977 when George Lucas told a story in the frame of Joseph Campbells Heroes Journey it was unique When Sam Raimi told a super hero story with the same structure in 2002 there was still plenty it added a new filter And when Jon Favreau did it again in 2008 he added enough unique touches to the tale to reinvigorate what was becoming a tired formula The writers of Green Lantern felt it was enough to skim cliffnotes of Campbell and write the film based on their notes of the reading and half remembered recollections of reading comic books when they were 12 There is nothing new in this film A man is given a magic ring which takes him out of the world of the ordinary and makes him a hero We don t grow to care about him because he doesn t grow or change he simply goes through the motions because the script tells him to Ryan Reynolds tries his best with a weak and contrived script but he still comes off too snarky to be the overconfident jet pilot he s supposed to be It s not all his fault as the script is much more content to tell us what the cast is feeling or thinking instead of letting the actors convey it through their actions inflections or looks It is as if the writers had no faith in their cast or direction let alone their audience and dumbed the entire affair down below even the cartoon portrayals of the character The visuals are nice but never have weight leading to the effect that Ryan Reynolds head if occasionally floating through a video game It s sad to think it s been six years since Gollum and this is the best Warner Brothers can offer us in a tent pole film It s also a shame to think this is the best they could do with only 37 million dollars less than Avatar Again it just shows that the production staff was lazy never pushing it to look better and instead setting for the they ll think it looks cool effect We should demand better from comic book films After having Dark Knight and Iron Man in a single year we should not be subjected to subpar outings like this Fun is one thing mind numbingly dumb and lazy is another Skip this in the theater Wait for it to come to NetFlix and then forget to put it in your cue You ll thank me,0.0,147.0,260.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449490/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2011,"Visually impressive, a good jump start, unfortunate reactions",Green Lantern was guaranteed to be really big or a complete miss Unfortunately according to box office numbers and majority of reviews it seems to be a miss Green Lantern is one of those super heroes that just didn t seem to translate well for most people on screen It was a risky endeavour no doubt about it I thought considering the concept it was done decently It was better than Thor but fell short of other similar super hero films and there were plenty in the summer of 2011 Green Lantern just belongs in the comics and animation rather than live action Still for what they had to work with I think they did well The film s special effects are stunning the scenes in space are well done the original story is solid and the performances of the cast are decent Everything in the film is decent The problem is that a superhero film nowadays needs to be better than decent it needs to be outstanding I don t know what they could have done better but I think if you go in without enormous expectations you ll find an entertaining fun film which is what is most important I love Ryan Reynolds he s young hot talented and a versatile actor I m not sure he would have been my first choice for a serious superhero like Hal Jordan but he does well in the role He has no shortage of chemistry on screen and he makes the character come to life Blake Lively lacks a certain chemistry on screen the opposite of Reynolds The two of them together are good but Lively is just too dry and really doesn t have the range to impress on screen She is downright laughable as an airforce pilot as she looks too prissy Peter Sarsgaard is terrific as Hector Hammond I even think she is underused in the film but he does make an amazing villain to the story He is probably one of the strongest performers in the movie Mark Strong would be a close second and he too is underused in the film but he is excellent as Sinestro who is a good guy in the film but Green Lantern fans will know his ultimate destination I think more time spent with Sarsgaard and Strong would have done the film well because they truly are the two best characters and very strong actors all around As an afterthought I also think Sarsgaard could have even played Hal Jordan Director Martin Campbell is a great action director His past experiences make him a good choice for this film and he does hold it together I think if not Campbell behind the camera and a solid cast Reynolds Strong and Sarsgaard as well as a solid supporting cast including Tim Robbins Jay Sanders Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan to name a few the film would have really fallen apart and been far worse than what they gave us The film wasn t a complete flop it did make money but as often is the case it cost so much to make that it didn t succeed the way they had hoped A lot of people did enjoy the film and I am one of them in fact I encourage you to check this out but don t expect a Dark Knight or a Superman film because the Green Lantern is just different If they decide to put together a sequel I think they need to tread lightly and not spend so much money on special effects and go for the human live action qualities Still worth seeing 8 10,0.0,2.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2517967/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,true to comics,First I see that this movie has been getting negative reviews However it is the first superhero movie of its type As an avid green lantern fan I have to say that it does exactly what it should do set up the character I would not have chosen this particular plot line as the basis for the first movie I would have gone with an approach more like the DC animated cartoon Green Lantern First Flight That would have appealed to a much wider audience However I can assure you that if they make sequels this is a good starting point Give the movie a chance see if you like the character I guarantee you Hal Jordan s stories only get better from here Case in point Geoff Johns has won numerous awards for the comic book series Green Lantern Anyway my opinion see the movie then watch Green Lantern First Flight You will appreciate the movie much more that way As a side note Green Lantern Emerald Knights is not really important to the general concept It is more just background information on a few of the other lanterns and the only important segment you get the full story in Green Lantern First Flight,10.0,63.0,83.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447621/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2011,"Struggling to balance gravitas with self-conscious irreverence, this is an utterly mediocre comic-book superhero movie that fails to live up to its hype",The intergalactic league of superheroes known as the Green Lantern Corps is DC s answer to Marvel s dominance in the comic book superhero genre and given the 70 years of history that the Green Lanterns have you d think that they would stand a pretty good chance to give the incumbent a run for their money Alas that is sadly not to be as Martin Campbell s adaptation turns out to be at best a mediocre attempt to launch a major fantasy action hero franchise To be sure Campbell had the odds stacked up against him from the beginning Like Iron Man or Thor Green Lantern was a second tier DC character unlike Batman or Superman for instance so there was the unenviable task of introducing the Green Lantern Corps to many like this reviewer who had not read a single page of the comic books This first movie was going to have to be an origin story and that alone explains the lengthy exposition at the beginning explaining the origin of the power of the Lanterns the planet Oa on which the Lanterns gather as well as the Lanterns arch enemy Parallax Into this universe enters the first human Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds a cocky test flight pilot following in the footsteps but still haunted from the death of his father during his childhood days Hal has been chosen by the ring worn by one of the Lanterns top fighters Abin Sur Temuera Morrison unsure though he may be of his own abilities I Hal Jordan pledge allegiance to a green lantern that I obtained from a dying purple alien Hal says in a dubious voice He won t be alone in his disbelief you ve got to admit the very premise sounds cheesy especially in assuming that a person would so readily believe what an extraterrestrial creature tells him And one suspects that it is the precise reason why the glib witty Ryan Reynolds was cast in the role just so his own smart alecky attitude would reassure the audience that Hal understands the absurdity of it all Its tongue in cheek sensibility reminds one of Iron Man which so beautifully pulled it off for a rip roaring adventure The same however cannot be said of Green Lantern which wavers uncertainly between irreverence and solemnity The latter is apparent when the film emphasises the size of the threat a recharged Parallax poses not just to the Corps but also the rest of the inhabitants of the universe It is also especially sombre when elaborating on the difference between will the power of the Lanterns and its diametrical opposite fear the power of Parallax Campbell struggles to balance the tone of the film but never quite succeeds either way The result is a mixed bag that doesn t quite convey the same gravity in the proceedings as Thor or X Men First Class and yet doesn t quite achieve the cheeky fun that Iron Man and its sequel delivered In fact a lot of what takes place on the planet of Oa comes across as hammy from the Lanterns leader Sinestro s Mark Strong inspirational speeches to the rest of the Corps down to their supreme Guardians of the Universe with Martian like oval shaped heads and fishbowl helmets It s not as though Campbell and his four writers Greg Berlanti Michael Green Marc Guggenheim and Michael Goldenberg are unaware After an initial visit to Oa followed by some Lantern training 101 by the fishlike Tomar Re voiced by Geoffrey Rush and the porcine like Kilowog voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan they confine Hal to the planet Earth for pretty much the middle third of the movie pondering over whether to accept the fate before him While on Earth there is a tepid love story between Hal and his childhood friend cum wingman Carol Ferris Blake Lively livened only so slightly by Reynolds and Lively s chemistry There is also a human villain in the form of Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgard the son of a politician Tim Robbins and a brilliant and nerdy scientist called in to examine Abin s body The reason for Hammond s madness is his exposure to the energy of fear left within Abin giving him a gargantuan skull with bulging veins in addition to telepathic powers Sarsgard may play his villain role with gleeful menace but that can t disguise the fact that his character as well as the strained relationship between him and Hammond Senior is superfluous Lively s character is unfortunately confined to no more than a love interest leaving Reynolds to do all the heavy lifting himself as Hal Jordan And despite the initial fan reaction to his casting Reynolds is easily the best thing about the film he has enough screen charisma to carry both the sober and droll aspects of his character Besides casting Reynolds in the lead role Campbell also gets the action sequences right He exploits Hal s ability to conjure up any weapon or object to stage some inventive showdowns especially the climax where Hal comes face to face with Parallax Yet even this doesn t go on long enough to satisfy audiences hungry for some loud large scale action and there are surprisingly few of these for a summer action blockbuster the climax is also the first full fledged battle Hal engages in after accepting his destiny as a member of the Green Lantern Corps But the action is little consolation for a movie that can t quite find the right balance in tone and boasts a middling script with half baked subplots It lacks the awesome sense of adventure and thrills that a summer audience looks for in a superhero movie as well as the depth that some have come to demand from such fare Especially when it has to differentiate itself from a surfeit of comic book superhero movies Green Lantern just doesn t shine brightly enough to make its presence felt,6.0,40.0,84.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444021/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,"The ""Iron Man"" of DC Entertainment!!!",Just came back from the theater and now I m going to give my two cents on it After reading the negative reviews that were posted by the mainstream critics If I should dare call them critics I actually had my worries but I decided to stick to my guns and go forward with what my opinions were going to be and to my surprise everything turn out exactly as I predicted And that was the critics were wrong Possibly exaggerated The film was as good as it s worth and actually lived up to the trailers and hype that eventually lead the film up to Of course it did had it s flaws aleast just a few but could easily be over looked and one of the flaws was that it was abit grounded in which I don t find that a bad thing since I for one was expecting it to be since this meant to be the first among many films to come It s understandable that viewers and fans were expecting a more space opera like theme but I believe we might get more of that in sequels since thats what there for I for one started enjoying it as the film goes on till I finally come the conclusion that after the end of the movie that I had three words lurking in my head and those words were I LIKE IT The Good Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan the visuals the action the other Lanterns Abin Sur Tomar Re Kilawog Sinestro Hector Hammond Parallax and the forge of the yellow power ring The Flaws It s slightly grounded not much screen time for the other Lanterns especially against Parallax and short of a space opera like theme This is one film that even hardcore fans would should enjoy and appreciate for what it s worth and the execs of the WB should be patting themselves in the back for actually taking the time from keeping their heads inside their asses to actually taking them out and do what they should have done in the first place and that is giving other DC heroes Aside from Superman Batman their chance to shine on the silver screen and hope the same can be done for other DC heroes to come,6.0,11.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2491940/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2011,A Nutshell Review: Green Lantern,Directed by Martin Campbell Green Lantern fell into the formula and burden of having to tell an origin story and this one here just did it by the book weaving in the iconic scenario where Abin Sur voiced by Temuera Morrison crash lands onto Earth and Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds got selected by the green ring to bear it as the Corps latest recruit and in this film version much against his wishes since it called for great responsibility We get presented the concept of the Green Lantern Corps during the voice over introduction quite lazy in a way and spend only a brief amount of time getting to know the thousands of peers from around the universe fragmented as can be to try and show off what a Lantern can do so long as he possesses fearlessness and an iron will to conjure anything limited only by his imagination Green Lantern the movie suffered from having too many writers sticking their thumb into the pie and this lack of narrative flow shows where I can t help but to chuckle at some of the blatant let s move on attempts which seemed to impact the romantic angle between Hal and Carol Ferris Blake Lively the most with each character seemingly pulling their punches through inexplicable character behaviour Little depth got shed into the various characters introduced so much so they all look like unwanted cameos and caricatures there to pad the story There was this sense of hurriedness with the narrative in wanting to get onto the next scene soonest possible that what I thought to be milestone sequences such as the training turn out to be nothing not already seen in the trailers which is a pity because the story now becomes the ring being able to impart everything to Hal Jordan through some form of telekenesis Reynolds is certainly no stranger to comic book films but here s one that he can finally marquee by himself although story wise he s just become the generic amalgam of his previous roles and still maintaining the wisecracking ways coupled with an extremely whiny attitude about an irresponsible man thrust into the limelight with powers far exceeding his responsibility no thanks to baggage brought about by father issues This of course is in contrast to the Hammonds where the Senator Tim Robbins is estranged from his son Hector Peter Sarsgaard and the former due to an infection develops psychic abilities that actually spiced up expectations of a face off between hero and villain not It would have made a powerful contrast between the two men fighting over the same woman and about how Fate delivered unequal opportunities that is Life and its unfairness but again this angle wasn t exploited deeply making it all seem rather formula that the villain must have the hots for a hero s girl and is envious of his abilities what more looking uglier when standing next to an underwear model whose figure hugging suit only makes the envy a lot worse Parallax as a villain also was quite the disappointment for what it could have done given its abilities and turned out to be nothing more than a Galactus equivalent from Fantastic Four s Rise of the Silver Surfer where it s all flash and little substance and intelligence And we all know that a hero s stature gets elevated by the quality of his villains and here the latter is nothing but lacklustre which is a pity Battles are uninspiring and wasted the tremendous amount of CG put into the film as a whole with rip off moments coming from films such as Superman recall how a helicopter was involved in introducing our hero to the world and that balcony fly in to try and steam things up with the lady love which Blake Lively played to flower vase perfection having little to do at all in the entire film One can imagine the kind of possibilities tossed up during a fight sequence involving a Green Lantern but alas the filmmakers ironically lacked that one quality that a Lantern should possess with fights degenerating into plenty of energy bolts coming out from the ring and our hero conjuring up some of the most inane items for all his ring s power ok so granted he s a rookie Perhaps it tried to bite off more than it could chew and frankly I thought would have been better if this origin film cut down the number of side characters involved and focused on one main villain instead because Mark Strong s Sinestro is brewing at the side to become what would be Green Lantern s most powerful adversary in time to come That and giving the characters more depth would have made this an unforgettable boost of a lesser known hero to the silver screen rather than to skim the surface of its rich mythos A decent effort that could have been great Do not head out the door just yet when the end credits roll as it will be hinted though very obvious already during the film proper who the villain in the next film will be if it indeed does get made Sure it ll be the inevitable fan favourite but hopefully by then Hal Jordan would have mastered his powers and live up to his reputation of being one of the greatest Green Lanterns there ever is This is but the rookie attempt so the real Hal Jordan should stand up in the next I m keeping my fingers crossed,6.0,14.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444363/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,Green Lantern: The Average Joe of the Superhero Movies,They say that if you ve seen one superhero movie you ve seen them all That s not entirely true but if every superhero movie were like Green Lantern then it would be true Green Lantern is your typical superhero movie so if you ve seen quite a few superhero movies like I have you ll know what s ahead This is the problem with Green Lantern it s too predictable and does nothing new to make it stand out from the crowd That s not necessarily a bad thing though but it s not a good thing either There are 3 good things in this movie One Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond is delightfully hammy and fun to watch Two the SFX are cool and what they do with the Green Lantern ring is also cool and Parallax s design suits its evilness Third the fight between Hal and Parallax is the best scene in the movie Other than those things it s average If you ve never seen a superhero movie and or are a Green Lantern fan this movie is worth seeing Everyone else should see X Men First Class,6.0,73.0,120.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447712/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2011,A worthy summer sci-fi,Help me save my planet Help me fight it Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds If green is like growth then Green Lantern suits the simile The green growth is Lantern s franchise possibilities because the concept of a human chosen to be one of the universe s guardians can be new enough to be carried through several iterations I can see a few summers waiting for the next installment A comic book based sci fi thriller with a titular hero played casually if not blandly but engagingly by Ryan Reynolds in the Superman Spider Man Iron Man mode Lantern has the clich s of flawed hero who has worlds to save demons to tame and a girl friend to complicate his mission And unnecessarily but not obtrusively in 3 D Director Martin Campbell who guided Daniel Craig through a slick Casino Royale helps Reynolds be manly enough to save the world yet vulnerable enough to care about the humans he guards The thematic focus on the power of the will to achieve is good for all ages at a time when achieving anything great seems out of everyone s grasp The antithesis fear is also a powerful motif for the enemy of the Green Lantern Corps is Parallax an evil force feeding off its yellow energy Although the depiction of this evil is pedestrian the notion of forces in the universe that oppose good is always useful to the dramatist As a worthy summer blockbuster Green Lantern has the usual CGI spectacle of exotic kingdoms in deep space and immortal leaders like the gods on Mt Olympus why they are shriveled sages just isn t logical All this eyewash is worthy of Hollywood technicality but leaves me longing for more dialogue in other galaxies and less romance here on earth Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself FDR s First Inaugural Address,0.0,10.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444324/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Ryan Reynolds provides the right mix of arrogance and compassion for his role in Green Lantern,Just watched this DC Comics based superhero movie featuring Green Lantern with my movie theatre working friend which we both enjoyed As the title character s alter ego Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is the right mix of arrogance and compassion with a wonderful sense of humor As the beautiful brunette Carol Ferris who is the heiress of the Ferris aircraft not to mention one of its best pilots Blake Lively brings such a lovely presence and a great can do attitude that proves more than a perfect match with Reynolds when the latter expresses some doubt about his new abilities Then there s Peter Sarsgaard as the eccentric Dr Hector who has his own transformation from someone likable to someone really creepy when he gets possessed Other interesting characters were Sinestro Mark Strong who becomes GL s mentor and Kilowog voice of Michael Clarke Duncan in his second stint in a comic book inspired movie after playing The Kingpin in Daredevil who trains GL s battle skills In summary Green Lantern was just the right mix of the fun and serious action that probably could have used a slightly longer running time but it was still enjoyable enough as it stood thanks to the script and Martin Campbell s direction So on that note it s well worth a look P S If I didn t read about it already I wouldn t have known this movie was partly shot in New Orleans which is just a two hour drive from where I currently live Also when a reporter on a TV screen was identified as Melanie Hebert she looked liked the same woman I once viewed several years back in the last decade on WVLA TV 33 I guess New Orleans is her beat now,8.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447160/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2020,"Not Bad, but the CGI was a bit Different",It was pretty okay I kind of liked it But I think I prefer more of Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool Which makes sense on the last scene of Deadpool 2 The CGI was a bit weird and not have that realistic feeling to it Then again CGI technologies are pretty hard to get it to look real and all I still like it The comedy was pretty good I may be wrong since not many critics liked this movie I am not sure if it was because of CGI or the story line was horrible I viewed it in a different perspective so I kind of liked it Others may see it as horrible,7.0,3.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5561236/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2012,"Movies are for enjoyment. The Critics were kind of harsh, This isn't batman people! It's harder to pull off",I enjoyed this movie it was not bad and despite all the criticism I really liked it If you go in giving it a chance and just looking to enjoy it you just might It s a bit harder to get into than the usual hero movies but other than that the only fault might be that it was a bit ambitious It s kind of a strange story for those not familiar with green lantern but give it a shot First of all I am not the worlds most hardcore green lantern fan but I do love heroes and green lantern is an awesome one It s to bad though that green lantern is not quite as iconic outside of the world of big comic book and hero fans I think that was the first problem with this movie People know and love heroes like batman and spider man but they are huge and easily recognizable icons outside the comic book world too So this might make it hard for this movie to be so successful then there s the fact that this was never going to be quite as easy to pull off as other movies Hal Jordan is not bitten by a crazy bug he s not a troubled vigilante and he is not just some rich guy heroing for the hell of it in a really expensive suit What s my point The point is This is not your usual simple story of some Joe gaining super powers Possible Spoiler This is the story of Hal Jordan who gains powers from a ring that shows him a whole new huge alien world and a universal police corps Obviously that is not your typical hero movie It is not easy to do and there is still a lot more packed into this story than that Iron man had an easier time because it was an easier story to understand for audiences maybe it was easier to put on the big screen in comparison to green lantern anyway To recap this was a certainly a cool project that got the fans hyped but not everyone who goes berserk over spidey bats or Mr stark It s a crazy awesome story but it might be hard for newcomer to understand lastly it is ambitious in that it tries to pack a lot of good stuff into a limited time space That is my only complaint The CGI was decent and I liked the costume if you know the story the choice makes sense Critics are as their name implies people looking to criticize sometimes unjustly over the top and sadistically even To be fair not all of them are unfair I enjoy Roger Ebert s reviews but the point is to just try and enjoy the movie,8.0,18.0,21.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2716394/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2011,The critics are talking s*** (Spoiler Alert),Green Lantern is a great film it so didn t deserve the critical thrashing that it got I loved it not the best film of the year but non the less great The performances were OK Mark Strong as Sinestro was a fantastic as ever his performance reminded me of his performance in Sherlock Holmes as Lord Blackwood which is a great thing Ryan Renyolds did better than expected as Hal Jordan but Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond was down right awful whenever he was on screen it detracted from the experience and which is why I can t give this film any more than 8 10 i m just glad he dies so he cant be in the next one Oh and by the way if you stay after the film has finished there is an extra bit which strongly hints towards a sequel so watch out for that,8.0,22.0,32.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448878/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2011,Green Lantern: Loved It. But Were Our Expectations Too High?,Green Lantern is one of DC comics most popular characters and its role in the DC universe is prominent enough that it is considered by DC as its space epic So the anticipation for GREEN LANTERN is so much high that satisfactory is not good enough The story begins with the death of Abin Sur who is a Green Lantern a warrior entrusted with a power ring in order to protect his sector in the universe from the wickedness of evil Abin Sur s ship crashed to Earth and there he let his ring choose his successor The ring chose pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds to become the new Green Lantern But Hal s assumption of Abin Sur s ring could not have come in a worst time as an entity known as Parallax is set out to destroy the Green Lanterns specifically the one who bears the ring that once defeated it Hal Jordan I love the universe of the Green Lantern as created by DC comics and I did love the movie But inasmuch as I wanted this to be flawlessly good and wished to be blinded by love for this movie I could sadly point out that it was far from the perfect movie I wanted it to be It is also noted that the director of this movie Martin Campbell rejuvenated the James Bond franchise twice by directing the first Pierce Brosnan Bond movie Goldeneye and the first Daniel Craig Bond movie Casino Royale not to mention that he directed The Mask of Zorro so it played with all expectations It made me wish that I never knew this because even though that I did love the movie I could clearly point out its many flaws The characterization and the explanation of the villain Parallax for instance was not given sufficient detail and clarity Even though there was a flashback about him it was still unclear as to what this creature is and what its true motive is It quickly becomes this one dimension cardboard character that generates very little impact The scenes in Oa and the process of getting to know the aliens felt rushed and gravely insufficient The universe of the Green Lantern storyline is indeed complex but not impossible to capsulate and explain with sufficient clarity within a few scenes I think the shortcoming of the film was its failure to ensure that its audience flawlessly understood the world it tries to create in the film What is more surprising is that it did not invest on a long running time Epic summer movies of late have been gradually standardizing the practice of extending the running time of movies well beyond the less than two hours a regular feature film has It was sad that Green Lantern did not do this as it could possibly have made the overall film better It suffers from the same flaw as the Transformers movies had that which it gives too much weight on the human focus and less on the alien aspects but that human focus was not compelling enough impressive enough or worthy enough to waste too much time on On the other hand the Transformers movies are too extreme as a lousy example But I do dread to admit that the animated movie Green Lantern First Flight tells a better Green Lantern origin than this In this movie the story dwells too much on Hal Jordan s self pain and lack of self confidence to become the hero that is expected of him The movie dwells on his feeling of failure of his painful memory of his father s death and his romantic relationship with Carol Ferris Blake Lively It was difficult to appreciate Reynold s performance as Hal Jordan because I felt that he was not funny when he intends to be and whenever he is serious I am not sure if he s kidding around I still think he was gravely miscast for this role and believe that he s more fit for The Flash Despite Reynolds as usually a great performer and Campbell as a potentially efficient director the characterization failed to be impressive and emotionally effective The failure was more on the script and the sequences of the story While the movie starts strong somewhere in the middle it felt like it got messy and awkward There were sequences that felt like they should have been cut off the movie and there were also instances that felt like it needed several missing sequences An example of that is when Hal went to speak to the Guardians a scene which felt like Hal was in an entirely different character mindset from the scene directly before it On the other hand I did love the movie despite its shortcomings It is the magnificent visuals that make this movie shine like the Green Lantern that it supposed to be the aliens the backgrounds the overall visuals that surely blow audiences especially ones that are not yet familiar with the Green Lantern mythology I may have enumerated things that make this movie less than perfect but there s no denying that I still am going to watch it again Additional Note Yes there is an extra scene in the middle of the end credits,7.0,31.0,56.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444230/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2011,Green means stop!,Don t listen to the negative remarks This is a great movie This movie is even awesome There is so much CGI right from the beginning that you might wonder if there was any camera on the set Reynolds looks awesome in his CGI suit and you might imagine that he had to be bare naked while filming all the motion capture stuff in front of a blue screen or maybe it was a green screen WOW But this little green eye mask piece which looks like he s coming just from stage of Johann Strauss opera a night in Venice makes him the sexiest superhero ever The CGI of parallax looks like its done with some particle FX by Andrew Kramer in an 30 min After Effects tutorial But parallax is such an a hole he does not deserve better CGI so that our hero can shine here too And he is so cool Instead of generating some superior weapons like rockets or so with his ring he makes a WW2 antiaircraft gun throws a fuel tanker at parallax and blows the tanker with the gun W O W And there is a lot of wouldn t it be cool if stuff going on in this movie For instance parallax has teeth but not the teeth of T Rex or so no he has the teeth of a plant eater And this already gives a hint why this s o a b is so dangerous he likes green stuff most Now I may seem to be giving this movie a hard time but I enjoyed it I like this kind of mindless CGI trash The goofiest superhero movie of the year Awesome,0.0,18.0,30.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446253/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2011,Better than expected,I didn t go to see this when it was released because some reviews were so negative So I have just watched it on DVD It was actually a very good film and I thought it was well paced and enjoyable to watch Of course there are flaws but it was better than recent DC superhero outings such as Bryan Singer s Superman or even the Dark Knight I have to say as a youngster I was always more interested in DC comics than Marvel ones And I have always felt that the Green Lantern would lend itself well to the big screen This was really a very good film and unfairly criticised As I mentioned there are flaws but these can be forgiven because of the movie s spirit and also as some have already mentioned because it doesn t take itself as seriously as other superhero flicks So ultimately we trust the major reviewers but it seems they can get it wrong And now I am sorry I didn t see this in a movie theatre,9.0,13.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2527488/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,A True Green Lantern Fan with More Than a High School Education!,I just have to do it I just have to correct all the haters out there No summary no spoilers just points on what makes a movie Storyline 8 10 Was it award winning No but what super hero movie is The becoming a Green Lantern of Hal Jordan follows the original comics perfectly If you know the comics you know the beginning If you never read them then you learn a lot real fast The story introduces only characters necessary to the plot and nothing more Hal Carol Senestro Parallax the Guardians Abin Sur Tomar Re and Kilowog They easily could have introduced way too many guardians way too fast but they didn t Parallax s origins are changed a little but it works out for the better remember not everything that works in a book works on screen All in all storyline was good it kept a good pace Always remember it is an origins story so the 2 hours isn t completely filled with action but neither Casee nor I got bored Acting 8 10 No Ryan R did not screw up Hal Jordan Alright I ll admit Hal may not be as witty as Ryan played him but Hal was sure as hell a smart ace in the comics I thought it fit I went in thinking This is going to be great or really going to suck Luckily casting was very well done Carol Blake did a fine job I do agree with another review that said they wished someone a little more intellectual mature would play Carol but in the long scheme of things Blake didn t get a terrible amount of screen time to prove herself Maybe as Star Sapphire she may pull out Lantern Corp Sinestro 10 10 Tomar Re 10 10 Kilowog 10 10 Abin Sur 10 10 I can t say much else besides that these characters lived up to the comics perfectly I loved them all Graphics CGI 8 10 Why 8 Eh there were a few just a few I tell you parts where the graphics pulled the cartoon look of Spiderman 3 PLEASE don t be afraid by this all in all the graphics were awesome Oa was beautiful just a couple notches below Asgard in Thor Green Lantern Ring effects were great all around solid Costumes sets 9 10 First short and sweet Live action sets average Skylines just like any other city Ferris Airforce Base good enough Nothing spectacular but it wasn t the center of the movie Costumes STOP HATING ON THE CGI COSTUMES Even the the comics the suits were made from energy and that is what the movie did A powerful ring of willpower isn t going to POOF put anyone in spandex or rubber armor The mask appears when the identity of a Lantern needs to be protected and eye color changes as well PERFECT to me Length 7 10 Although as I said before there were a few slow parts I would have liked to see the movie for a few minutes longer Towards the end yes a little rushed but it didn t ruin the whole movie 10 15 minutes longer to put it just at the 2 hour mark would have been perfect for an origins story to me Took off a couple points here Overall 8 10 By all means it is not as bad as Catwoman or Daredevil as some are writing Those who make that comment are probably the ones who think Transformers is somehow an epic movie Anyways it is a good solid super hero movie Maybe not one of the greats like Batman Begins Dark Knight and Thor but still a great movie that wouldn t be bad to take the mature enough younger kids Parallax is a little scary and there are a few curse words but by all means this is not a racy film Remember Stay after the credits,8.0,349.0,544.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446819/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2011,Bloody terrible !,I m of a forgiving nature especially when it comes to sci fi special effects driven blockbuster movies I enjoyed the Star Wars prequels i even enjoyed the last Indy movie i gave G I Joe a decent review G I Joe yeah that G I Joe I cant go easy on this film because Warner Bros deserve this they are currently at the bottom of a deep pit when it comes to what is arguably the most popular current genre at the summer box office super hero movies Marvel are wiping the floor with them Superman had muted return yes the Batman films are superb yes Warners DC turn out fantastic animated movies But this Green Latern movie was going to show they can do more than just Batman well it was going to be hopefully a step towards a Justice League movie one day a less well known DC superhero introduced to the non geek public to open the floodgates to the larger DC universe than just Superman and Batman Well with all that riding on it if this is the best they can do then don t bother This was one whopping mess of a film Batman and Robin made more sense and yes i really have considered that statement its nearly two weeks since i saw the movie so this is a considered opinion not a knee jerk one in the heat of the moment The characters were characterless they were nt funny engaging sympathetic there was no emotional resonance in their situations eg When Hal returns to Earth after his initial visit to Oa the scenes just drag where we are urged to feel his sense of dissonance with himself at not excepting the challenge he has been presented with I felt nothing no sympathy no empathy nothing it was all intercut at this stage with the origin of the Hector Hammond character The scenes of Hal moping are set against the scenes with us finding out that Hammond already a creepy sullen character before his head swells doesn t get on with Dad who himself is grease ball politician Remember Spider Man 2 where Alfred Molina s Doc Ock had a pathos to his story which created a sense of sympathy for him and how that made for such a layered and involving villain none of that here thank you very much The entire i hate you dad routine is old old hat but something fresh or dramatic could have been made of it but instead the i m sensitive and dad s overbearing tentpole is hammered into the ground aided by awful dialogue and choppy scene structure The editing amazing considering it was Stuart Baird in these middle scenes was staccato in tone and numbing it earned no sympathy for either character and therefore sabotaged any hope of an emotional pay off at the end of the film Superman s first appearance on Earth in the Donner version had you cheering as Superman saves our feisty likable damsel in distress Lois Lane from a nasty helicopter crash in front of a diverse social cross section of the good people of Metropolis Green Lantern s first appearance on Earth leaves you cold as he saves an already established grease ball politician from a nasty helicopter crash in front of a gathering of over achievers and posh knobs who frankly you couldn t give a tinkers cuss about My abiding memory of the entire Hammond sub plot is Peter Sarsgaard holding his head in his hands and moaning which is ironic as i joined him in this action at numerous points Most unforgivable of all even the action scenes were flat and lifeless and when considering what Hal s character can do with his ring thats just not acceptable On the up side Oa was very impressive there are some good effects and Ryan Reynolds and Mark Strong do their best to carry it off but they are let down by other badly handled elements Mum always said If you ve got nothing good to say say nothing at all and mum s usually right but in this case it cost me 15 so sorry Mum i m speaking my Brains,1.0,33.0,64.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451247/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2011,"It has great effects, but is incredibly disappointing even with low expectations",After its absolutely atrocious trailer debut late last year I had very little faith in Green Lantern It had been well over forty years since the debut Superman The Movie on the big screen and years and years of Marvel hero debuts sequels reboots and on going franchises surely the goofiness and complete ineptitude of this trailer was not the most obvious of suggestions as to why Warner had never gone back to the DC well outside of Batman Superman and their cooky band of misunderstood villains The second trailer was a significant improvement but did very little to alleviate my initial thoughts of how terrible the film looked Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is a cocky fighter pilot who tends to test the limits of just about everyone He is chosen by the ring of fallen alien Abin Sur Temuera Morrison to become the next in a line of universe wide heroes called the Green Lantern Corps Hal is obviously reluctant to join but as evil starts to descend on Earth he must quickly decide whether or not he will become the hero he was chosen to be Earlier this summer I sat and was almost completely underwhelmed by Thor It had infinite potential including an amazing choice for a lead but it felt like all we got were a couple of awesome scenes on Thor s home planet of Asgard a nearly unwatchable 3D post conversion more of a push toward The Avengers and a whole lot of Earthbound melodrama Green Lantern fares a little better in the 3D department but practically mimics every single one of Thor s problems It saddens me to say but some of those problems are even worse Green Lantern is an origin story but one that feels disgustingly incomplete The film spends its majority paralleling Hal s ascent to becoming a Green Lantern and scientist Hector Hammond s Peter Sarsgaard descent into villainy While this was an interesting way for the film to truck along I felt cheated because it never really takes the time to tell us who either of these characters really is There is no rich storytelling here just actions and reactions They even throw in a few backstories with hints and elements that never come to fruition including a rather important one about a deadly accident involving Hal s father Most do not even have a reason to exist in the first place It seems like they left it all out so they had something to fill the holes in the eventual sequel It makes for a lot of boring exposition and very little excitement outside of the action sequences While the badly cobbled together storyline is an issue that looms over the film like the plague it seems like the acting is just as much at fault as well He may have charisma and a well sculpted body but Reynolds is totally wrong as Hal He brings his usual wise ass routine that has worked well for the better part of a decade but it only works for the first half of the film The moment he gets the ring it almost instantaneously stops working He ends up spending the entirety of the second half looking like he wandered onto the set of another film He looks physically unable to rectify and align the comedy with the drama and ends up going through the motions and phoning in the performance Same goes for Blake Lively who plays love interest Carol Ferris After seeing her nearly unrecognizable turn in The Town I expected a performance that was a little more than just a damsel in distress Sadly outside of a bit of yelling that was all I got and a pretty awful one at that The less said about their chemistry the better While Mark Strong is just as reliable as he always will be even with less screen time than I imagined the other standout is Sarsgaard He seems just as badly miscast as Reynolds and Lively but attempts to salvage what he is given as much as he possible can Yes he spends one scene just looking at the camera with a sad shifty look in his eyes and spends countless others just uttering bizarre screams When he is not doing either of those he spends his time chewing scenery left and right He is clearly the best actor among those with a lot of time on screen and he makes it clear that he deserves to be in something better The only thing that saves Green Lantern from total oblivion is the awesome effects it employs from beginning to end A lot of effort went into making them great and just as fantastical as the comics have dictated for so many years Shots on Oa are amazing and the creatures that inhabit it are just as good if not better Even seeing Reynolds interacting with the likes of Tomar Re or Kilowog voiced impeccably by Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan only proved greater as the scenes moved along The creativity and detail in the many different items Hal possesses on the fly are all visually stunning And somehow despite my early concerns of how silly his suit looked the designers did an excellent job of making it just as realistic as physically possible and even made the mask look half decent I really hoped my initial trailer analysis for Green Lantern was horribly wrong but am incredibly disappointed that I was right on the money The movie is a letdown even with the lowest of expectations and only has very few reasons to shine But with everything that goes wrong in the film it just feels like it was destined for failure from the start And with that in mind what was the point of even bothering in the first place 5 10 An extended review also appeared on http www geekspeakmagazine

18 June 2011,Green Lantern Excellent - the NY Times critic is wrong! *SPOILERS*,What is up with professional movie critics like the dick at the Times who said Green Lantern was bad It s not bad on the contrary it s really really good especially for such a cosmic concept Sure there were some script issues but mostly trivial unless your expectation is in the way but these in no way impeded my enjoyment of this film adaption of my favorite comic book superhero series from my childhood The Times tool also said something cynical like Are superheroes relevant in today s world or some such tripe and the fact that he makes such an insipid comment demands the answer YES because in our cynical world kids need positive role models as do their parents and Ryan Reynolds does a great job delivering one for us Especially the idea about the most powerful force being will if only we d embrace that the missing component in today s effed up world is in such idealism offered in this entertaining visually stunning cosmic and cosmically beautiful scientifically accurate and exciting film I am certainly looking forward to a sequel which is implied so make it so Without giving much away I can say that the film moved a little too quickly for me perhaps because some of the visuals were so compelling that I wanted the camera to linger there instead it occasionally lingered in the wrong spots a few times for example in some scenes that were tangent to the main story but again the errors were forgivable when the end result was so enjoyable The Green Lantern can manifest anything he can imagine and my main criticism would be the writers didn t go far enough exploring this when one has an infinite blank slate in which to create it can be a challenge to find new ideas that folks can relate to I get that but the writers could have should have spent a bit more time on the aspect of training ones mind to the discipline of harnessing thoughts I can imagine yoga like mental exercises and let the fun begin But these can be explored in a sequel I hope the box office grows fat enough to convince the idiots in Hollywood to continue this franchise I want the idealism and the valiant heroism of the Green Lanterns to inspire my son more than the hedonistic Tony Stark although he can too a little So check it out I saw the 3D version but it should be good in 2D too See if you can imagine a universe that looks out for the rest of us where the good guys win and superheroes exist That s a place where I want to live,9.0,17.0,28.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445575/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2011,Decent flick. Not half as bad as some of the critics have been making it out.,A decent comic book adaptation of the DC comic book character Green Lantern It s certainly not as bad as some critics have made it out to be It s fun the action sequences are flashy and exciting The acting is all top notch and the humor is done really well Green Lantern is unpretentious probably even one of the most unpretentious superhero movies ever made It embraces its inherent goofiness and excludes much of the angst and over seriousness that we seen in other comic book movies like Batman and Spiderman The after credits scene is awesome A real fan pleaser and hopefully they will make a sequel,8.0,328.0,528.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444879/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,So much potential ended in a incredibly flawed movie,Green Lantern is a character with so many good stories which universe have a rich and unique lore and they deliver this to the fans The film feels like a B tier TV series pilot with mediocre performances although a good casting inconsistent visual effects sometimes beliveable sometimes horrible bad to look at this film is inconsistent as a whole a bunch of good ideas with a poorly done execution both in the script and in the bland directing This film is realy ugly the gray filter the absence of vivid colors and the bland shots give us a uninspired cinematography resulting in a bad movie unfortunely There is good points some designs and moments but overall this film is bad and it had so much potential now the way is wait a worth Green Lantern adaptation,3.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5440990/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,My thoughts on the movie.,After using IMDb for about 10 years this is my first time writing a review so here goes I am a big fan of DC Comics and Green Lantern is definitely one of my favorites as I even own quite a volume of comics of him I wasn t really looking forward to this movie since every time I do I always got let down My first thought after hearing Parallax being in the movie I was wondering if they would do it like in the comics But that didn t make sense because this is only the first movie and the studio would make it as an origin movie not something else The whole thing seemed a little tad slow and I think they tried to do character developments and get the story going but even for a fan I kind of found it hard to follow It wasn t engaging enough I suppose There were some action scenes but that also didn t really live up to expectations I thought they had the right director and actors for this movie but something was missing from the comics If they ever make a sequel to this movie I do hope they hire someone from DC to write a script and have the sort of impact Iron Man did back in 2008 I do have a feeling this is going to be another Superman Returns though,5.0,72.0,118.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444822/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2023,Lame. Not one pitch crossed the plate.,Unfortunately this really was awful The biggest problem is that Hal Jordan nee the Green Lantern is a tool and there is little about him to root for He s got looks the coolest job in the world and a girlfriend whose looks could stop a charging rhino The only flaws he needs to conquer are a lack of focus and a normal amount of fear Frankly I don t think a person can become a test pilot without loads of focus and a minimal amount of fear but that s beside the point The movie is dreadfully slow He doesn t confront a villain until an hour and twenty in and the whole mutated friend thing added nothing I can only think that that character was part of the comic book Ben Affleck s Daredevil had more emotional depth The Fantastic Four 2005 had more interesting powers Captain America was more admirable Even The Green Hornet was funnier Unfortunately a fighter jock who is given unlimited power but needs to focus a bit more made for one lame movie,3.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8829046/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2011,Interesting misfire,Let me begin this review by mentioning where I stand on comic books I rarely read many anymore but in the past I have dipped my toe into a few series and enjoyed them even forming limited attachments to certain characters and as such I have feelings and opinions concerning how they are portrayed on screen Green Lantern was not one of these characters I was aware of the basic story had some sense of what his powers were and I even had a Green Lantern action figure as a kid But I never read the books and so approaching Martin Campbell s Green Lantern I really had no idea what to expect What I saw in the trailers looked cool enough that I was excited by what this film could be but my usual gut feeling about how a movie will turn out was absent After seeing Green Lantern this morning I m still at a loss to describe how I feel about it The film features some of the most interesting and stunning visuals I ve seen in a while certainly streaks ahead of this years previous comic book offerings X Men First Class and Thor but regrettably the quality of the visuals can t make up for the muddled plot and dreadful pacing issues particularly in the film s conclusion There is a lot that Campbell gets right with Green Lantern Firstly the casting always of utmost importance in a superhero film is solid All participants make the most of their roles with Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan a particularly inspired choice This is the type of role Reynolds was born to play and he clearly understands the journey Jordan takes over the course of the film Bringing his natural charm to elevate the character above the by the numbers troubled hero Jordan could have been he s the best thing about the whole film Supports are good too with Peter Sarsgaard wickedly creepy as Hector Hammond and Mark Strong as Lantern Corps leader Sinestro making the best of smaller parts It s also nice to see Campbell keeping it Kiwi with roles for Temuera Morrison and Taika Waititi although both are underused Campbell also nails the look of Green Lantern and the delicate but masterful use of colour perhaps unsurprising in a film with a colour in the title shows his visual expertise as a filmmaker Freed from the restraints of a realistic setting Campbell really lets loose with his great visual style in scenes that take him away from Earth Too often superhero films are hampered by the perceived need to keep proceedings grounded in reality to give mass audiences something to better relate to and much like Marvel s Thor the sci fi heavy sequences set in far off fantastical locations offer refreshing variety It is however spectacularly geeky and as much as certain core fans will undoubtedly be crying for more of this style in future comic adaptations conservative studio thinking is likely the reason we ll never see a Green Lantern movie set entirely off Earth Green Lantern despite all it has going for it visually falls down at the story level perhaps an effect of having four writers working on the script at various times Adding originality to an origin story is always going to be a challenging task and the story spends too much time on build up before rushing to a conclusion which ultimately seems a touch too easy Obviously Warner Bros are counting on the success of the film to launch a new franchise so therefore Jordan s triumph was a foregone conclusion but Campbell doesn t spend enough time developing the threat presented by the film s villain and as such when the confrontation comes it never feels like anything is really at stake It s an exciting sequence while it lasts despite its overly obvious terrorism parallels but it s just over much too quickly and the colossal visual scale of the villain which Campbell reaches for is unmatched by the battle itself There s an uneasy balance between the small scale human story and the epic overarching plot and unfortunately Green Lantern comes off as unsure of what exactly it wants to be So here I sit unsure of what to make of Green Lantern There s potential in it elements we ll hopefully see explored in the inevitable sequel As an introduction to a lesser known character at least for mainstream audiences it s passable and for the wow factor of the visuals alone it may be worth seeing in the cinema Personally though I think Green Lantern will be filed under interesting failure,5.0,38.0,80.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444173/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2011,Bland,After costing his company and the US government thousands of dollars by being reckless in a jet test after which he s attacked by flashbacks ripping off Top Gun Hal Jordan is fired and you have to wonder why that hadn t happened sooner as it didn t seem like it was the only time he did something like that from his pilot job He s then recruited for the Green Lantern corps wait if they re all called GL s how do they tell them apart Between themselves they use their real names but they have secret identities so what about in public This does at least comment on the mask not being a good cover although you d think with how ridiculous it looks in this it s supposed to distract people from how obvious it is and he takes it remarkably well Not because it s a trait of his it s one of the many results of the poor script Anyway around that same time Parallax the terrifying force of anxiety using the power of fear that manifests in telekinesis for some reason and hearing negative thoughts directed towards oneself and the ability to absorb memories through physical contact making even less sense infects a human scientist and is headed towards Earth and it s astonishing how little we care that would be zilch In general this doesn t get you emotionally invested It plays it far too safe hitting all the notes and Hollywood clich s for this kind of thing trying to get itself an audience instead of trying to be well done it will get attention if it is This is visually impressive and the 3D can be pretty nice and that s about the full extent of the positives Well a few of the constructs that the Ring produces from the willpower of the wearer are somewhat clever Our villain plays like a low rent Igor Some scenes are there to show off things and have no consequence The music is forgettable as are many of the characters I swear the lead has a friend and I couldn t tell you one single thing about him Personality name nothing Ryan Reynolds his way through the entire thing dude I know you can play a role seriously and I m certain you can be spot on in a superhero flick just start reading the material before signing on Mark Strong as Sinestro is great as the only saving grace Lively s part is meant to be a strong female I would think only she comes off as annoying The will vs dread conflict is interesting and there are points made about both This isn t boring I didn t constantly want it to end it just never got me engaged The action has its moments and the brief climax is cool and relatively epic I recommend this to fans of the silver age Nah most people shouldn t bother 5 10,5.0,5.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2476195/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2011,"Terrible Script, Good Characters- Verdict: FIRE THE SCRIPT WRITERS!",For a comic book movie Green Lantern had the potential to be great If the writers of the movie even watched the animated movie First Flight they would ve been able to come up with a better script than what they did I think the cast did the best that they could with the corny lines and terrible writing Ryan Reynolds was believable as Hal Jordan Blake Lively was exceptional in her role which primarily involved looking pretty which she is good at and Mark Strong as Sinestro was flawless Though I thoroughly disliked what the writers did to this movie I do hope the GL series isn t written off There is still enough in the story of Green Lantern for a sequel but for the love of Oa the old script writers need to go and a brand new team needs to bring something to the table Mark Strong is an acting powerhouse and as we have seen in the Dark Knight it is the villain and not the hero that makes an exceptional comic book movie Sinestro has to do for GL what the Joker did for Batman Thats my 2 cents,2.0,137.0,222.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451867/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,This Green Lantern: Dim Witted and an Even Dimmer Wattage,This film is not recommended In brightest day In blackest night No evil will escape my sight Let those who worship evil s might Beware my power Green Lantern s light The Green Lantern Oath Now if only they would also promise not to make another comic book sequel Based on the 1950 s DC Comics the latest big budget blockbuster The Green Lantern has arrived and should exit very fast Beware its power or lack there of The story goes like this The Green Lantern Corps is an intergalactic army of elite warriors who defend our universe against the forces of evil Each trained soldier is equipped with a ring that imbues its chosen owner with superpowers The latest enemy is Parallax a spiraling ball of energy with dirty mop like tentacles and a major bad ass temper Parallax is becoming stronger each day as it preys on its opponents fears and will destroy anything that gets in its way for total domination The latest recruit to join the Corps is a fearless humanoid named Hal Jordan a test pilot in the best Hollywood tradition of Top Gun s Maverick a handsome manly specimen overflowing with cocksure smugness and admittedly self assured recklessness in short a manly man type Enter People s Sexiest Man of the Year 2010 in the predestined role of The Green Lantern Mr Ryan Reynolds Reynolds is well endowed with talent and a big personality to spare The actor fills out his role rather nicely bringing a boyish charm that impresses the female audience members and some male moviegoers as well He even is more impressive as eye candy as he fills out his form fitting uniform to maximum effect one of the few perks that helped to get me through this debacle Much has been made of the CGI suit that followed the contours of Mr Reynolds physique rather than using a real costume to showcase his toned musculature If less time and energy were spent on his costuming design and more on a cohesive script and just a few funny one liners sprinkled here and there the film might have somewhat succeeded at least to the comic book s fan base As it is now the only humor in the film is completely unintentional and campy fun Blake Lively plays Carol Ferris Jordan s childhood sweetheart fellow test pilot and love interest The actress may be lively but she s a blank in this role She is mere eye candy for the male audience members and some female moviegoers as well but it s a serious step backwards for this actress after her strong work in The Town I hope she chooses her next film more wisely Director Martin Campbell cannot unify his characters plot or any pleasing visual style to his film There are so many missed opportunities to advance the storyline or develop any characters beyond their one dimensional trappings The film has no energy or rhythm It s stillborn inert and inept Perhaps some of the fault must be shared by a dumb script submitted by a committee of four hack writers The guilty parties are Greg Berlanti Marc Guggenheim Michael Goldenberg and Michael How Ironic Green Cheesy computer generated imagery is everywhere in this loud and crass movie fantasy Proportions of the alien warriors are inconsistent to their backgrounds and jarringly off balance Some of the alien forms and make up seem to be inspired by the muscular systems found in The Visible Man model kits of the 1960 s or cadavers on display from the current Bodies The Exhibition tour Add to that the boneheaded decision to supply the voice of Michael Clarke Duncan for Jordan s trainer Kilowog giving that character some racist undertones with a bowdlerized ghetto jargon and an imitation Barry White deep basso Shades of Jar Jar Binks Campbell also wastes the talents of such fine actors as Tim Robbins Angela Bassatt Mark Strong and especially Peter Sarsgaard in supporting roles Just when Sarsgaard as misfit scientist Hector Hammond starts to become one of the few interesting characters in this debacle minus the laughable Eric Stoltz s Mask make up his bad guy turn is sacrificed for more clumsy special effects that do little to add any real excitement or suspense The Green Lantern is a major disappointment Its producers main goal was indeed the color of green as in money rolling into their deep pockets But the film has no redeeming value and is a worthless waste of your time and your hard earned green However the film does finally prove that it isn t easy being green especially for the studly Mr Reynolds and the hapless movie going audience that endure this dud Lights out GRADE C NOTE Which brings to mind another leap of logic in this silly movie At one point Carol seems actually surprised to discover Hal s secret life Can a tiny mask the approximate size that Arlene Francis used to wear on the old time quiz show What s My Line really hide The Green Lantern s true identity At least Batman was fully disguised from head to toe 10 down and we go to Bennett Cerf NOTE Visit my

2 July 2011,What a mess,Green Lantern has a backstory superpowers and villain so convoluted and uninteresting that you immediately understand why he remains a 2nd tier superhero Ryan Reynolds has quite a body not sure how much of it is fake but he still can t carry a movie Admittedly the script is a real mess Most superhero movies these days choose 1 of 3 types of antagonist you have a the corrupt congressman or business man b the arch villain or c the giant ball of evil moving through space to devour Earth Yep It was used before in The 5th Element This one features all three Some of the sets look like what you d see in a softcore cable movie The female lead s office all cgi with no glass in the windows Reynolds still trying to make us like him shows not an ounce of depth here He s so needy flashing that chipmunk face and puppy eyes over and over We like you Ryan now would you stop being cute and learn to act There were portions of this dud where I just tuned out And I saw it for free the barrier to me liking it was zippo I daydreamed about how to get bigger calf muscles and passed the time swirling my feet around Green Lantern is elaborate shallow tacky outlandish,1.0,10.0,22.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2452394/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,I have waited a long time for this movie to come out!!!,Finally a DC Comic character I have always enjoyed reading since I was a kid We had Superman on the big screen Wonder Woman on TV seen SuperFriends and Justice League in cartoons Well Green Lantern has come and I enjoyed it very well Ryan Reynolds plays the character Hal Jordan a test pilot who happens to be the chosen one the wearer of the Power Ring which the Green Lantern wields to uphold the laws of the universe The predecessor was Abin Sur who was attacked by Parallax a off world menace who feeds on the fear of others In the Green Lantern Corps there are lots of other members Killowog got a lot of attitude Tomar Re shows kindness and Sinestro shows a lot of arrogance Back on Earth Hal shows his skills to Carol Ferris Blake Lively a fellow pilot and encourages Hal on being more responsible as a Green Lantern I liked the way this movie was made The special effects and the graphics are totally awesome This movie is best seen in 3D The die hard comic fan must see this movie you wouldn t be disappointed 2 5 out of 5 stars,8.0,6.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445025/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,"""The ring's limits are only what you can imagine"".",For DC Comics first foray into a super hero universe outside of Superman Batman I was expecting big things Green Lantern was probably my favorite Justice League character while growing up besides that duo so I have some affinity for GL and his alter ego Hal Jordan For some reason however the film Green Lantern misses some of the spark I was expecting relying way too much on a shotgun approach to an origin story that took years in comic book history to develop Yes it was cool to see all those characters from the GL playbook show up Sinestro Kilowog Tomar Re Abin Sur Carol Ferris but all together at one time gave little opportunity to digest what the planet Oa and the concept of The Guardians was all about The villain Parallax is a relatively recent entry in the Green Lantern canon and might have been better left for the intended sequel which this film obviously sets us up for The thought I had while watching the movie was how doubtful it would have been for Hal Jordan to be selected as the first Earthling Green Lantern It was repeatedly referenced that the ring seeks out it s own master but in this case the ring chose the very first human it came in contact with Really is that the criteria There was not much yet at this point in the story to suggest that test pilot Jordan Ryan Reynolds had the character and fearlessness to be chosen as a future GL Even as Green Lantern he expressed obvious doubt about his selection most notably to his presumed fianc e Carol Blake Lively You know in my recollection of the early comic book stories I don t believe Carol knew the identity of Green Lantern but it was no secret here I m sure it won t bother modern viewers with no GL history to go on I don t know if I m sold on the idea of Ryan Reynolds as a super hero Then again I m not in tune to the current crop of new young actors from which to field a costumed champion I guess he was competent enough in his own way but there seemed to be an understated quizzical nature to the way he came across as if to say what am I doing here Hal s moments with Carol didn t really move the romantic angle along and maybe for the best as his future as a Green Lantern would require exploring new worlds and new adventures without a partner to keep him tied down As for the film s special effects all of the GL constructs emanating from the power ring greatly reminded me of the early comic book stories I m thinking of the early Sixties era A giant green fist for example to knock out an over sized opponent of immense power The roller coaster car befuddled me a little because Hal was trying to bring the runaway helicopter under control and the concept didn t seem to mesh As others have mentioned on this board the final battle was over almost before it got started you ll have to form your own judgment Well we ll have to see where things go from here There didn t seem to be as much emphasis on the negating effects of the color yellow against the green will power of a Green Lantern s imagination but it was reinforced at the finale with Sinestro s change of uniform Of course that just seemed to come out of nowhere given the character s unifying mission throughout the story to put Parallax in his place A hint as to why he turned to the dark side would have been helpful another reason why the picture was just a bit off the mark for this viewer expecting greater character development to supplement the action,7.0,7.0,17.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445206/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2015,First full length feature film based on the classic Green Lantern Comic starring Ryan Renyolds as Hal Gordan who becomes a galactic guardian.,I don t know why some people don t like this movie I found it to be very enjoyable What I like most about this movie is how they explored the green lantern mythology I love seeing the power ring the old guardians and the other green lanterns like Kilowang and Sinistro My favorite part of this movie is Mark Strong as Sinistro Sinstro is one of the most iconic comic book villains of all time So I loved seeing the first live action interpretation of this great character and Mark Strong was perfect in the role and I like seeing him before he went to the dark side Phalax works well as the villain although they probably made him more complex then they needed Ryan Reynolds is good and likable as Hal Jordan although he s not who I would ve picked because Reynolds is always a clown and Jordan is a pretty serious guy I like Blake Lively as the love interest she s a pretty good actress and she s hot looking I like the movie s theme of over coming your fear it works well for the plot The special effects are good and while this movie is not particularly dark it has a dark look to it that I like I also like how the green Lanteran suit looks This is more of a sci fi adventure then a superhero movie They did a good job at explaining the back story and I like the tease at the end with Sinistro putting on the yellow ring which will turn him bad Overall I think Director Tim Story did a pretty good job in bringing us the first live action movie based on the classic comic,8.0,2.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3244812/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2011,"Loud, Messy, loud, boring, loud, confused... and loud!",I should probably start by stating few facts about my position with Green Lantern and superheroes in general First of all my only little knowledge of Green Lantern came actually from an episode of The Big Bang Theory other than that I didn t even know there was such a comic until I read that Martin Campbell was going to make a movie In other words I wasn t really a fan and let me spoil you the surprise I m still not one However I always try to be as open minded as possible in fact I was quite excited to learn something new about a new superhero The fact that I hardly knew the existence of Green Lantern had nothing to do with me not liking the film I wasn t a fan of Thor either and yet I did manage to enjoy the film for what it was here s my Thor review and as far as the X Men I knew next to nothing when the first Bryan Singer movie got released and still liked it Finally I should also point out that I have nothing against comic superheros either in fact I still consider Spiderman 2 one of the best action movies of the last few years Green Lantern opens with a very confusing prologue visually unoriginal and heavy in exposition characters and soulless CGI And as it got louder and louder more and more frantic the whole thing got even more confusing I must confess the film lost me right from the word go but I decided that it didn t really matter It s a comic How hard can it be I said to myself Thankfully I was right and when finally the action cuts to planet Earth I was able find my bearings again though never fully comfortable Once we are finally introduced to our hero played by Ryan Reynolds I realise that I wasn t the only one who didn t really know how to take this film Reynolds seems to be just as confused as he plays the character sometimes with a complete straight face and sometimes with a smirk irony as if he knew that the whole thing is just preposterous He s likable enough but sadly lacks of any emotional depth The only thing left to marvel at is his perfect body which only made me even more annoyed and jealous in fact it distracted me even more as my mind started to wonder when was the last time I actually went to the gym Director Campbell never really seems to be in control of what s going on and instead he decides to cram the film with as much noise as possible hoping it might distract his audience from thinking that this is actually all a bit of a mess The result is that sometimes even some of the dialogue gets lost though I m prepared to bet that despite those 4 writer being credited I didn t really miss much Campbell clearly feels uneasy with this universe and doesn t quite know what to make of it The whole philosophical side is just ridiculous the action scenes are too messy the special effects underwhelming and the love story is so flat that it becomes redundant The pace is completely off and for a film of this kind which last just under two hours I found myself looking at my watch way too often The editing is just as uncertain as the rest of the film as Stuart Baird seems to be randomly cutting to wide shots and close ups irrespective of what the action would require and not taking into account that a film in 3D should really hold its shots for much longer otherwise the 3D effect is lost on its audience But then again who cares about 3D This is another of those films that s been converted into 3D after it was filmed and my God it shows and I suspect will have a very short life in this form many people will probably watch it on DVD or on TV anyway so why bother cutting it for the 3D format Those action scenes particularly at the beginning are so fast that you really have no idea what s going on It doesn t really help the fact that there are way too many characters obviously introduced to us because of a possible sequel clearly set up in the end credits with a silly plot twist after all today it s all about franchises isn t it Bloody hell Warner aren t you happy with your 8 Harry Potter films and your never ending Batman Do you really want to embark into another franchise Peter Sarsgaard plays a sleazy over the top baddie without a proper script to allow him to actually be one of those really good baddie Mark Strong is pretty much wasted not to mention Tim Robbins in what is possibly his most forgettable role in years Angela Bassett plays is as if she s been told you re not allowed to show any emotion in fact deliver those lines thinking of something else Even Geoffrey Rush who probably had a couple of hours spare in his schedule was just happened to pass by the film set lends his voice for one of the character sounding pretty much like one of those Owl from that film by Zack Snyder Finally James Newton Howard s film soundtrack who I usually really like is as derivative as all the rest Not bad but certainly unremarkable just like the film itself In the end this is probably out there with some of the most disappointing comic book movies of all times Elektra Daredevil Spawn The Avengers Its main crime is that it thinks is a lot better than it is and it must have cost a lot of money too One positive note I did like the costume,4.0,36.0,79.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444110/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,It out-classes the X-men.,Indeed I ll even go so far as to say that it blows them out of the water Ryan Reynolds does a surprisingly good job as test pilot Hal Jordan Both before and after his recruitment by Green Lantern Abin Sur voiced by Temuera Jango Fett Morrison This includes portraying the subconscious fear he has of literally crashing and burning like his father who was also a test pilot And Blake Lively is also a pleasant surprise as Carol Ferris Hal s on again off again girlfriend who can switch from tomboyish jet jockey to pragmatic businesswoman to seductive old flame like a chameleon changes color But the biggest surprise of all is Peter Sarsgaard who I confess to never having heard of before As Hector Hammond the mutated super psychic he does a great job being equal parts pathetic sympathetic and downright psychopathic Those of you who are second generation fan boys like me should not expect anything remotely similar to the 1960 s comic book stories authored by Gardner Fox et al Carol Ferris is a redhead in this film not a raven haired brunette Hector Hammond wasn t mutated by a meteorite the two of them were apparently childhood friends with Hal Jordan and Krona the rogue Guardian though not explicitly mentioned by that name has evidently been amalgamated with the fear eating Parallax In short this movie is based more on the literary reboot GL was given by DC Comics in the late 1980 s early 1990 s And it has been 100 faithful in transferring that version to film Thank you Warner Brothers for giving us the best superhero movie of the spring summer season thus far,10.0,9.0,19.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445029/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2012,Once you go green,You ll never be mean I actually have no idea but if you find something to rhyme this with be my guest and use it While I m not sure about the 3 D in the movie I do know that I liked the movie overall Despite its flaws and faults The female lead seems to have too little to do and the family subplot seems almost irrelevant But you never know unless it s in the comics which I only read a few when I was a kid if some of those things might get interesting in the inevitable sequel The effects are pretty good and our main guy is likable There is the funny goofy friend and other things like our hero s arch and the actors obviously have fun with it all Captain America was way better though and might have gotten bad reviews because people were starting to get fed up with comic book movies which might be partly Green Lanterns fault One other thing After the credits start to roll stay put A couple of minutes into the credits there is a tag scene that s all I m going to say well that and the fact that after that when the credits start to roll again this movie is over,6.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2548705/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,The Green Lantern goes by at a fast pace.,Here we go again they release a fun super hero flick and everybody complains about wanting a darker film critics bash it relentlessly and one is left feeling almost bad if they enjoyed it I am such a person I found this movie to be a fun summer film featuring a comic book hero comics the form of literature aimed at kids but for some reason people want it to be dark and disturbing to the highest degree I begin to feel we have to many darker image people out there this is evidenced by the fact that I read a review here for Kung Fu Panda 2 and the reviewer said he liked it better than the first because it was darker because hey a movie about a freaking giant panda that performs martial arts should be dark eyes rolling The critics I am guessing hate it because Warner Bros forgot to mail them their check Yeah I said it how else to you explain a film series like Twilight getting better and better reviews as it progresses and its movies grossing more money hence more money to bribe cause at the film s core is a gal that has all the charisma of paper a dude whose other films get released directly to DVD and a dude who is simply a slab of beef This film does deserve some criticism I was not fully impressed with it myself and feel it could have been better but it is not the end all worst comic movie of all time Neither is Batman and Robin like a lot of people say I give the crown to that Captain America movie of 1990 A film featuring a man with a gal going one place to the next for 80 percent of the movie Seriously one review seemed to put down the film simply based on the Green Lantern s powers at one point criticizing the size of the fist he uses to take out the people attacking him The film has a creature being awoken and escaping its prison the creature is called Parallex This creature devours the inhabitants of planets feasting on their fear It goes after the green lantern who imprisoned him a being named Abin Sur This battle is brief but so has the feel of a comic book to me He is wounded and must pass on his ring he makes it to Earth and a test pilot named Hal Jordan has the ring passed to him He must learn how to use the powers of the ring in time to fend off the threat of Parallex and must battle a man who ends up infected by this evil creature when examining Abin Sur s body The effects are rather good I liked the planet of the Green Lantern s The final battle was also enjoyable I like Ryan Reynolds and I thought he did a good job as Hal Jordan however if you do not like Ryan you will most likely not enjoy this film Of course not liking the movie for this reason is much better than the it isn t dark enough reason Seriously not all super heroes are Batman as he should be portrayed in a more dark and serious tone Green Lantern is not one in my opinion and this is only my opinion I chuckled during the scene when he is the Lantern checking up on his childhood friend and love Now on to the negatives of which this film has a few In fact I was close to rating this one a six but thought it went by to fast and entertained me to much for a six but a couple of the flaws are great One is something I absolutely agree with the one critic who mainly bashed the Lantern s powers and that is the character of Hector Hammond the human villain of the piece Not saying Peter Sarsgaard did a bad job in fact he did a good job portraying an obviously lonely man whom has few friends his dad wishes he was Hal and is in love with a girl he can never have The problem is how do you pull against a man like this I have never felt so bad for a villain in my life add to that they make him grow more and more deformed until he is finally in a wheel chair for the final battle The man also gets upset because his father pulled strings for him I am guessing we as Americans are supposed to dislike him for this reason cause in our country it is not what you know but who but this only made me sympathize with him more Every scene he is in I feel pity I mean I can understand where a villain like Magneto is coming from but I do not feel sorry for him because his powers are great and he commands great respect even from his enemies the guy here at one point cries in pain in his first battle with the Lantern and I felt terrible for him You are supposed to go Yes when the hero hits the bad guy not poor guy Another problem is the fact that the Lantern s powers do not work on yellow is never really looked at This is a major thing in the comics and all the cartoons I have ever seen here it is not really touched on all that much except that yellow is the color of fear and such The Lantern s training session seemed to come out of nowhere and his first appearance should have been a bit more spectacular as well However despite these gripes overall I enjoyed the movie more than most people apparently and I am saddened by the fact that this film is not going to do enough to warrant a sequel in all likelihood meaning I will never get to see Hal Jordan fight the man everyone associates as being his greatest adversary,7.0,4.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447696/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2015,"Lean, Green, Pudding Machine.",Green Lantern does an efficient job for someone like me who was after a colourful bit of noisy entertainment No expectation levels are set other than to not be insulted so by and large this does a job This falls more in line with a comic book adaptation that has no desire to set up a broody and conflicted hero no hidden agendas or metaphors in the villain ranks so yes It s got a little campy flavouring to it Which is fine if that is what you ordered The effects work is very effective though the sequences involving one of the villains Parallax are hindered by it being quite simply a very silly looking being The story has some credible complexities about it but the writers strain to keep it simple enough for a younger audience which is both a blessing and a curse since it becomes uneven and corny whilst still retaining a watchable fun factor The acting is only fine but again this is because the script is never sure when to give emotional heft to the characters or when to add some dramatic vulnerability It s a safe superhero film a creamy desert to satisfy the sweet palate maybe one that is flavoured with Chartreuse In other words it fills a gap for a while and is then quickly vanished from the memory 6 10 Footnote Extended cut recommended as a preference since it puts more flesh on the human bones,6.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3315981/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,REVIEWS - Don't waste your time!,I noticed the suspicious amount of 9 and 10 star reviews posted which few movies let alone comic book superhero deserve Upon closer inspection one can see that they re almost ALL by generic usernames and this just happens to be the ONLY movie they ve reviewed When was the last time a movie or product was SO GOOD you felt compelled to create a username and post a rave review for it This movie is certainly not one I didn t look to see how many were duplicates or suspiciously similar but I m sure they re there Sony does it a lot but I don t know which studio produced this tripe Far too many people have given a recap and summary so I won t bore you with that I ll just say that I was bored one weekend so I decided to spend the 1 50 and rent this from Redbox and even then felt like I wasted both my time and money I like superhero movies even if they re kind of silly as long as they re fun and entertaining and this film is neither I watched and love the Justice League cartoons including Young Justice and both are BY FAR better than this mess Bad writing bad directing and bad acting Ryan Reynolds doing his same old schtick basically portraying himself and Blake Lively breathing and blinking she s really not a strong actress she s just pretty and lucky Anyway I primarily just wanted to point out the bogus reviews No matter how good or bad a movie is there are going to be people who love it and people who hate it You know your taste in movies and with this one trust your gut There aren t any pleasant surprises It s been out long enough I m sure it s on TV from time to time If it s on and you have nothing else to do leave it on while you re doing something else but don t go out of your way to watch it You ve been warned lol,2.0,6.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5488849/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2011,"Style Over Substance; It's All About the Action, Action, Action!",Green Lantern is an example of a movie whose importance does not lie within the story but lies within the action scenes It has a very thin plot but has tons of action scenes with a heavy arsenal of special effects This movie is a great example of movies who don t care about stories plots scripts acting but care about action action action The plot is simple Hal Jordan is chosen as the new Green Lantern some sort of cops who guard the universe Dangerous creature Parallax escapes from prison in space and is on the run to destroy the universe Hal Jordan and the Green Lanterns must stop Parallax Let s start with the special effects Yes the special effects were awesome cool and great The weapons that can be created by anyone who wields the Green Lantern ring are quite awesome But it s too much of green The design of Oa planet of the Green Lanterns is cool but seems lacking of something And the creatures in the film it makes Green Lantern more like Alice in Wonderland Green Edition Despite the green the special effects were the upside of this movie The fighting scenes were entertaining Of course they were If not this movie would have gotten a rotten 3 The action sequences were awesome and definitely the reason why I watched this film No need to worry about the action scenes No problem with it Now the downsides The plot is thin and there is nothing special about it It s not compelling and is uninteresting It seems that the writers didn t give much time in composing the plot of this film But first films in a series have to be good and a good movie needs a compelling story Maybe other first films might not have a good story but they might have great subplots The subplots here are also simple Hal has a girlfriend in danger an ugly professor related to Parallax becomes Hal s nemesis So much for the plot The acting It wasn t really bad but wasn t really convincing at the same time Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan wasn t that bad but wasn t that good too The other fellow actors not far behind Possibly the best acting was Mark Strong s portrayal of Sinestro While it wasn t the same level of Oscar standards it was quite better than the others acting But one man s great acting doesn t mean the acting of this film is good Now the 3D 3D isn t necessarily needed here Although depth in the picture can be noticed mostly the film just feels like 2D with the exception of wearing 3D glasses as not wearing them would make the film blurry It looks as if the 3D was rushed or basically the 2D version of the film is blurred and can only made clear by using 3D glasses So for 3D lovers I wouldn t recommend the 3D so much here As other films Green Lantern also had some amusing things The strangest and possibly most magical thing that happened in Green Lantern is that how being a Green Lantern can transform Hal Jordan from a jokeful unserious person into a solemn and dedicated savior of the universe Plus it s only done within days or at most weeks That I say is an impossible thing to do This makes me think of naughty children all around the world If we give these Green Lantern rings to these naughty children can their behavior transform in just a matter of days I d love to see it In terms of recommendation I would recommend Green Lantern to moviegoers who love fighting scenes regardless of the plot or script The fighting scenes were really entertaining but the plot Nah But overall I think Green Lantern is an average comic book adaptation who targets on teenagers who love watching sequences of intense action 3D is not necessarily recommended though Despite the use of style over substance I do hope for a sequel which I hope improves from the first one in terms of plot script dialog and in portraying the color green Prince AJB s Rating 6 10 Average Thanks for reading my review on Green Lantern I do hope that this review is useful for you,6.0,12.0,24.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450374/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2011,I think we have a new superhero franchise,All I can say is that I was extremely impressed with this film Based on the trailers I was expecting this film to be mediocre I was wrong In my opinion for a superhero film to work it all narrows down to special effects and the acting For this movie both are great This movie may not have been as good as X men First Class or The Dark Knight but it is an above average superhero movie Ryan Reynolds is good as always and Mark Strong delivered a strong performance as well This movie is heavy on special effects and they are SPECTACULAR The dialogue is nothing new but don t expect it to be excellent given the fact that its a superhero movie Overall this movie was very well done and I liked it a whole lot more than I thought it would Hopefully this may be the first of many Green Lantern movies because this has the potential to become a great movie franchise,6.0,165.0,317.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2442768/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2011,Brightest Review from a Comic and Non-comic Fan,I m comic book fan who s read Green Lantern since the late 80 s and was privileged to see this movie early with a friend who is a non comic book fan in general So what you re getting in this review are 2 fan perspectives STORY The story was told very simple Those familiar with the comic it follows very closely to the Secret Origins 2008 arc written by Geoff Johns more so than the original Hal Jordan story back in the Silver Age revival The film is 90 story setup and 10 action sprinkled throughout the film most of them at the end with a short and uninspired final battle a gripe similar to Fantastic Four film in 2005 This film could ve used a LOT more action most of it already revealed from the trailers believe it or not The pacing felt unbalanced My friend thought the movie tried to fit in a lot of plots and stories like Spider Man 3 did with the transition from earth to space back to earth back to space back to earth a little foreboding when the better space scenes were few and far between There s a post credit scene too SPECIAL EFFECTS This film is very heavy in that department It s a hit or miss It works but some may think it s a little silly A gripe we had was that the CGI on some of the movements of the characters were so outdated like almost 10 years aka Spider Man 2002 You would think after all these years we could see better CGI animation especially when it transitions from live action Hal Jordan to CGI Hal Jordan Also Hal Jordan s constructs in this movie were a little too cartoony He basically created everything from a flamethrower gatling gun artillery gun a SWAT shield catapult jetplanes and even a cadillac dragster complete with it s own green speedway to drive on to For a live action movie just felt a little over the top silly Not even the Justice League TV animated series John Stewart ever made these kinds of constructs Also my buddy made a point in that the power of the ring was too godlike for non comic book fans to grasp the McGyver of rings Once Hal Jordan completed his short training yes short you knew he was just going to be unstoppable No problem with comic fans but it might be a little bit of a turn off to the casual viewer since it made the villain look pale in comparison especially in the anti climactic final battle which the trailers actually gave a hint to on how it would end I mean how else would you kill off space tentacles ACTING Mark Strong definitely was the best cast of the film He played the cool and calculated Sinestro better than I d imagine Although they were not really buddies in the comics a missed opportunity I thought was that it would ve been better if they had played more on the relationship between Hal Jordan and Sinestro as something a bit more than just mentor to student in order to build up a stronger emotional bond when the inevitable heel turn happens to strengthen a sequel i e think of Peter Parker and Norman Osborne Yes every 9 year old kid can point that out Senestro will be evil just based on the name Peter Sarsgaard who plays Hector Hammond was average nothing really memorable in terms of acting Another missed opportunity I believe was the fact they could ve played more of the Norman Osborne Spider Man as Peter Parker identity relationship on this one too will not spoil the film so I ll leave it at that Blake Lively played the typical bossy childhood girl friend who plays hard to get but changes her heart once the hero saves the day One of my least favorite characters in the film actually with some of the most corniest lines The romance almost felt like it was just there to give the film a romance plot that really could ve been done without Don t expect anything too deep like Peter Parker Mary Jane chemistry wise or even that of Thor Jane Foster Ryan Reynolds was a mixed bag My buddy thought he was okay as Hal Jordan not knowing anything about the comics while I thought some of the inner monologue jokes from him were more appropriate coming from Guy Gardner another Green Lantern or even Wally West the Flash Actually most of it was simply Ryan Reynolds just being Ryan Reynolds see Van Wilder and made me wonder how much ad lib he had in the script Overall I wasn t impressed but not disappointed either But unlike what Christopher Reeve brought to the big screen as Clark Kent Superman or what Hugh Jackman brought as Wolverine Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark and even Chris Hemsworth as Thor Ryan Reynolds didn t quite bring it as real comic book fans would know Hal Jordan SUMMARY All in all this movie was a decent summer movie The pacing was off and you don t really have any emotional pull for the characters The final battle ends before you knew it even started It s not as good as this year s other comic book predecessors in X Men 1st Class and Thor Don t come expecting deep character developments or you may be disappointed as the movie doesn t take itself way too seriously as it should For a 105 minute movie the best parts were near the end in the last 15 mins of the film The real winners in the audience are definitely the kids because it is a good kid s movie Green Lantern may not be the best summer movie of this year but this movie may brighten your day RATING 6 10,4.0,114.0,202.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2443804/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2016,Strong first half hampered by a weak second half,Released in 2011 Green Lantern is the story of maverick test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds who is chosen by an intergalactic corps of guardians and granted an alien ring that bestows him with the green essence of willpower Blake Lively plays his babe Mark Strong an alien member of the Green Lantern Corps and Peter Sarsgaard a scientist who seems to go mad Tim Robbins Jay O Sanders and Angela Bassett are also on hand Everybody seems to lambaste this movie so I was surprised by how compelling and entertaining the first half is Unfortunately the second half fails to capitalize on the solid set up It s hard to pinpoint what exactly goes wrong but the weak secondary villain Hector doesn t help nor does the nigh amorphous main villain Parallax Sinestro Strong would ve made for a better villain but the writers were obviously saving him for the sequel which will never manifest since the movie didn t do too well at the box office it cost a whopping 200 million and only made back 219 million worldwide Nevertheless there s enough good here to give Green Lantern a mild thumbs up if you re in the mood for an imaginative and colorful superhero flick The movie runs 114 minutes and was shot in California and Louisiana GRADE B,6.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3440404/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2012,"Not a terrible movie, but kind of flat",I have to confess that I know next to nothing about the Green Lantern comic book character having never read any of the comic books But I have a strong feeling that many Green Lantern fans will feel unsatisfied by this cinematic adaptation To be fair it s not a terrible movie It s never boring and it boasts some pretty good special effects But as I said in the summary line the end results are kind of flat The movie more often than not doesn t go the extra mile The lead character is kind of bland the alien menace isn t given enough time and there are a number of times when it seems that key or linking footage is missing and I watched the extended cut I think that if the movie had been an extra half hour long a lot of these problems could have been solved But as it is it s only a movie to watch during a rainy Sunday when you can t find anything better to watch,0.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2613576/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2015,Green Shines Plot Doesn't.,Green Lantern 2011 Dir Martin Campbell Cast Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Mark Strong Angela Bassett Average superhero movie that doesn t pack the punch that it should yet it still maintains entertainment standards for action fans It regards a power source where a powerful green ring is charged by a green lantern thus rendering its wearer its power After their planet is attacked by an evil power source one of the lantern wearers escapes and crash lands on Earth where the ring seeks out test pilot Hal Jordan as its next wearer Jordan is seen as irresponsible living in the shadow of his deceased father When the ring suddenly nabs him up in a green glowing mass it makes little sense and that seems to be one of the film s key issues Director Martin Campbell has made Goldeneye Casino Royale and Mask of Zorro so his skill is needed here but much of the story makes no sense Ryan Reynolds as Jordan holds his own as someone who constantly disappoints yet ends up being the one being who can face the mass evil force heading to Earth Blake Lively as fellow test pilot and girlfriend is fetching yet totally reduced too the standard romantic clich s expected Angela Bassett plays the second female role in this film that amounts to nothing Peter Sarsgaard steals scenes as a sinister scientist brought in to examine the alien body that crash landed He becomes infected with evil and wrecks havoc Mark Strong plays another Lantern in what amounts as a useless cameo Its bright green presentation will entertain genre fans while others may blow it off Score 6 10,6.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3269087/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2011,Get Past the Razzle DazzleSpecial Effects and Find Worth Lessons,GREEN LANTERN is a spectacle to watch much technicolored etherized air visits to other planets transformations of aliens into humanoid forms and vice versa lots of derring do on part of the newly hewn superhero etc such as in all of these comic book turned films that are so popular but at its core is a rather sensitive story that for this viewer redeems it It is a tale of how to overcome fear and to believe in dreams in order to make life in this world livable that for the audience of youngsters for whom these comic books were created presents a challenge and a possibility It also brings some insight into the topic of filial competition and the role that parents play in fostering this unfortunate sense of worth Is it a great film or a revelation of philosophy No but it does entertain on a different level than most other movies of this nature and that is in large part to the fine performances of a cast that takes the film seriously in a good way A really fine synopsis of the story is here A cocky test pilot Hal Jordan acquires superhuman powers when he is chosen by the Ring the willpower fed source of power of the Green Lantern Intergalactic Corps He reluctantly at first takes on the challenges these superheroes face Putting his self doubts aside and spurred on by his sense of duty and love for his beautiful intellectually equal colleague Carol Ferris he is soon called to defend mankind from Parallax a super powerful being who feeds on fear He is the universe s last chance as many Lanterns have been killed and the Corps is weakened And he might just be the right Lantern for the job of keeping the world safe from harm Martin Campbell directs the solid cast of seen and unseen characters Ryan Reynolds shines as Hal Jordan our Green Lantern Taika Waititi is Hal s best friend Tom Blake Lively is solid as Carol Ferris Peter Sarsgaard morphs as Hector Hal s brother Tim Robbins is the father figure Mark Strong is the Spock like Lantern from another planet Angela Bassett steps in as the secretive Doctor Waller Temuera Morrison is the lantern space alien who passes the ring to Hal after succumbing to the evil of Clancy Brown as the ominous Paralax there are some fine voiceovers for the creatures of the Planet AO Geoffrey Rush as Tomar Re Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowog and Warren Burton and Salome Jens as the Guardians Ryan Reynolds has such a strong positive screen presence that he is able to make us root for his flying sculpted body Green Lantern Though the film had bad press and failed to create box office accolades it is a strong movie for this genre Seeing on Amazon Instant Video gives it a full screen treatment to try before buying the DVD It is better than expected Grady Harp,0.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2504908/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,Sad Ryan Reynolds regrets this role,It s a shame Ryan Reynolds really regretted playing green lantern I like many others truly enjoyed this movie I understand some of the gripes like lack of character depth but had they spent more time on that they would have had to make the movie longer or cut out other things The movie already stood at almost 2 hours long I thought this was a fairly decent introduction of the character and was really looking forward to a 2nd installment which eventually never happened I would really like to see him and his wife come back for a 2nd movie if at the very least to finish the story they started here With Ryan Reynolds super stardom it could really help propel this franchise forward Wont hold my breath but will never stop hoping for a sequel Since WB is basically wiping the DC slate clean and starting over with the franchise I doubt Ryan would even be able to get a green light for sequel from the new heads If your looking for a light comedy family friendly super hero movie I would definitely recommend,9.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8770402/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2011,Better than I expected - some unique differences from other superhero movies,It s rare that a movie surpasses my expectations but this one did As perhaps one of the less known less popular superheroes Green Lantern s origins added a lot to the story and the noble theme to his mission endears the audience and perhaps strikes a chord when the battle between fear and will is articulated throughout the movie Blake Lively of Traveling Pants fame does an outstanding job of being the beauty and brains while still being the vulnerable maiden in distress The personal struggles of the novice superhero strike a chord with most every viewer and keep you rooting for him until the end The graphics are a bit cartoonish at times but this is a superhero action movie so anything goes The almost unlimited powers possessed by the Green Lantern keep you guessing during the intense conflicts with the bad guys both of which are reaaal bad Very enjoyable and my 23 yr old son who watched it with me was very impressed also he s usually very particular about the movies he watches Fun and entertaining,9.0,9.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445643/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Spectacular escapist fun,When I was a teenager in provincial England back in the 60s I discovered super hero comics Superman was already on the radar of course and the Batman TV series meant that Batman was up there too But my favourite was always Green Lantern this particular incarnation written by John Broome and drawn spectacularly by Gil Kane I always thought that the character would make a great movie but a they would never be able to make it look right and b they would have to miss out 95 of the stuff I loved in the ever increasing mythology of the character Well they finally made a Green Lantern movie and they got everything in it which I never thought they would and they got it all pretty nearly perfect Reynolds is fine either Blake Lively is miscast or Carol Ferris is miswritten the alien GLs are brilliantly realised and Mark Strong s Sinestro is the stuff of Wow The costume the subject of so many on line misgivings works like a dream And much of the 3D particularly in the action and effects sequences is spectacularly effective Here are my reservations and they contain spoilers The worst thing about this film is the plot which is an absolutely generic origin story but it is a perfectly satisfactory plot for the purpose of the film Parallax is possibly too much of a galaxy wide villain and is possibly defeated by Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds too easily maybe something a bit lower level might have worked for the first movie leaving Parallax as a threat cliff hanger to lead into the next However a mid credit teaser gives a good indication as to what s up next assuming a sequel is green lit ho ho bet I m not the first one to say that The score is unmemorable and contains too many quotes of John Williams Superman fanfare There is relatively little humour which is ironic given the reservations about Reynolds with his comedy background playing Jordan And there are relatively few Yes moments although I loved the fact that they used the comic s logo as the film s main title I recognise that I am coming at this from the point of view of a committed GL fan so how does it appeal to those who say Green Lantern who Well my mother who is in her 80s loved every second of it It is good old comic book escapist nonsense and it is absolutely true to the GL comic book Don t expect it to make vast amounts of sense and you ll find it to be spectacular fun,8.0,6.0,15.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445176/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2011,A Very Good Movie!! I am Impressed,It was Awesome and IMO a very good movie I liked the Story the acting was good CGI was amazing and the movie was very fun There were a few flaws I thought the villain Hector Hammond as Parallax s Minion was rather weird odd and i really don t think he was needed I don t know anything about the comic books so if I seem misinformed of information please let me know The 3D was great IMO There were some scenes it felt like it wasn t even converted well but overall the 3D was good 3D was my only option because the last 2D showing was late at night regardless my 3D showing was 80 Full I really hope WB gives Green lantern and Ryan Reynolds another chance at a sequel because I see so much potential in future installments I also hope to see a compromise in WB s current plans with the justice league movie because I want to see Christian Bale Henry Cavill and Ryan Reynolds reprise their respected roles I recommend the movie to others you should definitely check it out In 2D or 3D their both great I hope it makes a great sum of money because i personally think it deserves to Again these are just my opinions I expect people to agree with me and people to Disagree with me but thats the fun point in talking movies we bring our thoughts to the table and just talk film anyways GO SEE GREEN O LANTERN,10.0,19.0,31.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445117/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2012,A beautiful movie not afraid to show the humanity of men and has fun while doing it,I have never read the comic that this movie is based on yet after seeing the movie I am strongly tempted to read the comic Personally I think this movie was far better than any of the professional reviewers thought it was Perhaps the bad reviews are because our society is still indoctrinated to think that men must have no fears men cannot doubt themselves men cannot admit to their own weaknesses and men cannot say I m sorry without somehow losing the essence of what it is to be a man In my opinion this movie portrays at least part of what modern men should aspire to I think this is why many reviewers do not like this movie as it presents a foreign concept that is currently out of the reach of many Reading at least one famous reviewer s review of this movie I have to wonder whether he even watched this movie because the movie he saw does not sound like the one I saw and that review gets lost in pseudo religiosity in my opinion This movie is about Hal the main character discovering and recovering himself and in the process finding his true strength his inner strength something the ring saw all along even when Hal was unable to see it himself As I see it this movie has fun with the superhero concept and does not take itself too seriously It lets the softer sides of humanity and men show through something which many superhero movies seem like they deliberately shy away from for fear of being unmanly The scenes between Hal and Carol were wonderfully played and played without pretentious male domination In fact Carol helps Hal better understand himself to me this represents a true partnership between Hal and Carol the type of relationship that propels a couple to their greatest heights And just as touching is the scene with Jason Jordon Hal s nephew If you are the type of man who is not afraid to cry and be emotional because you understand that doing so is part of being a healthy man then you just might like this movie as much as I did I cannot however guarantee that you will like this movie as much as I did I thought that this movie is one of the best superhero movies ever made a masterpiece I can only hope for a sequel,10.0,5.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2596895/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,This movie is what I've been waiting for my entire comic life!,I have been reading the comic for over 40 years and I was blown away by this I understand that they can t make the movie exactly like the comic and I am fine with that I want to say that the entire cast was superb except for the part of Hector Hammond the growing forehead was just a bit too nasty for me Mark Strong as Sinestro was a perfect choice Ryan Reynolds was also superbly cast I think that the special effects for the movie were done very well and I applaud the movie makers for making the aliens seem very lifelike Too many times they seem to get lazy with this or give the aliens very poor makeup Do not go in with a closed mind on this Give it a chance and I believe you will be well rewarded I like the concept for this movie and thoroughly applaud the effort,10.0,38.0,59.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444697/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2021,It wasn't bad,This movie took a lot of heat but with the plethora of super hero action movies it is hard to compete As a Reynolds fan I enjoyed it Without spoiling anything I think they had to spend some time explaining the history of the Green Lantern which took up valuable time I felt like it was over too soon If you are going to compare it to Iron Man you will find fault with it It was a thin plot Reynold s textbook humor made the movie and probably set him up for the Deadpool role Blake Lively kept my eyes on the screen too,7.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6886986/?ref_=tt_urv

Reynolds pulls it off in popcorn comic book actioner for fanboys.",THE GREEN LANTERN 2011 Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Tim Robbins Mark Strong Angela Bassett Tamuera Morrison voices of Geoffrey Rush Michael Clarke Duncan and Clancy Brown DC Comics cult superhero s origin story is given the big screen treatment with better than expected results with cocksure Reynolds nicely cast as hot shot test pilot Hal Jordan who is reluctantly chosen by an intergalactic police force known collectively as The Green Lanterns enlisting him to stop a soul sucking planet devouring entity Parallax scarily voiced by Brown from destroying Earth Director Martin Campbell gets out the big guns with the visual and special effects and not too shabby in 3D either for the popcorn crowd fanboys while a game cast including Strong as alien Sinestro an uncanny resemblance to a Vulcanized John Waters and particularly Reynolds doing the heavy lifting of going from callow fratboy to genuine underdog hero while Sarsgaard gets in touch with his inner John Malkovich as the villainous Hector Hammond whose icky transformation from a close encounter has him looking like a combo of John Merrick AKA The Elephant Man and John Carpenter Echoes of Richard Donner s SUPERMAN a nifty helicopter set piece with its blend of humor heart keeps the right direction for a blossoming franchise,8.0,3.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449880/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2015,Green Lantern Corps comes to Wide Screen,IT IS INDEED hard to imagine but this film is the adaptation of the second GREEN LANTERN character This new version is at the time of the movie s release 52 years old Even more disconcerting to this graybeard is that he was a 13 year old when test pilot Hal Jordan became GL in the late summer of 1959 THE FILM DOES an excellent job of incorporating the essentials of the origin into the movie Being some years even decades later it is no shock that there is some updating but very little of what we do hate so much namely revisionism THE STORY BEING born and even immersed in Science Fiction is naturally subject to a dependence on the Special Effects department Those present are excellent in their treatment of GL s flying use of the Power Ring the aliens and the interplanetary settings AS FOR THE casting we find that it is at least satisfactory even for a grumpy old guy stuck in the 1950 s comics scene Original illustrator Gil Kane 1926 2000 had said that it was Paul Newman who inspired Hal Jordan s facial looks and appearance of physique WELL MALE LEAD Ryan Reynolds may not be a Paul Newman he s close enough for us Ain t that right Schultz,9.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3153595/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Not a blockbuster by a long shot,Where do I start Okay lets start with the acting since most people think the actor makes the movie instead of the movie making the actor Blake Lively please make me understand how this person is even allowed in film She can not act and she certainly is not enough eye candy samantha fox to warrant making me suffer through two hours of her bad acting and misshaped facial ticks I love Ryan Reynolds in everything but feel that he over cheesified the character The movie itself wasn t a total waste but is reminiscent of the first Hulk Great actor playing the Hulk but the movie was inferior Same thing with Green Lantern the CGI wasn t exactly on par with what we are used to seeing in the theaters and therefore I do not recommend that you go spend twenty something for your time and money not so well spent,2.0,19.0,41.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445309/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,Your're enemy is not going to play fair....,I m going to get a few knock backs for this but this is one of those movies that comes around once in a while gets slated and then garners a cult following a few years down the line Directed by the man who revived the Bond franchise twice Green Lantern is like a cross between Hudson Hawk and Flash Gordon It s an oddity of a movie I liked it but for the life of me I don t know why Reynolds is every person he has ever played in any movie in this but the difference being he doesn t know whether to play it straight or go for tongue in cheek Hal Jordan is a man with issues as are all superheroes and doesn t like to play by the book One night he gets chosen by an alien to be the next Green Lantern and has to help defeat a gigantic villain by the name of Paradox Also for some reason there is a villain on earth who looks like Timmy from South Park who can move things with his mind in an evil way There is no explanation for Timmy s motives but that is sidetracked by Jordan going back to the Lanterns planet doing some training by possibly the most offencive named character ever and Geoffrey Rush as a chicken The film makes no real sense and it s poorly edited bu one cannot help but enjoy a film where the hero is instantly recognised and saves a helicopter by turning it into a car The set pieces are good if not spectacular but the character development is missing and you end up feeling nothing for anybody which is the films main flaw Otherwisem it s THAT summer movie the one that will be lambasted for a while but you secretly enjoy like the already mentioned Hudson Hawk and Wild Wild West It s going to hurt no ones career it will eventually make it s budget back sometime in the future and will gain a following It s pure summer pap watchable and enjoyable for all the wrong reasons,8.0,3.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447497/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2011,I fell asleep.,I saw two horrible movies this weekend one being Green Lantern and the other being Super 8 I ll be reviewing that next I was trying to decide which movie to see after work btwn this and X Men I checked out the time length and that really should have been a clue How much of an origin story can be told in 90 minutes As a disclosure I have never read a GL comic but I am a huge fan of the superhero movies I was fully prepared to like it so much that I would buy an anthology of comics The patheticness of this movie makes me want to check out the comics to see what the real story is about but forget about ever adding this movie to my collection I had a few problems with this movie As much as I love Reynolds as an actor I did not see him as this character I felt like I was watching Ryan Keeping it in genre RDJ IS Iron Man HJ IS Wolverine CB IS Batman Christopher Reeves RIP IS Superman It s as though I was always conscious of him As for Blake Lively I am a casual viewer of Gossip Girl so I know who she is But in this movie she felt like a gimmick As though the producers said which hot young starlet should be in this movie Again to compare w in genre in both the Hulk and in Iron Man neither Liv Tyler nor Gwenyth Paltrow can be classified as the next IT girl they ve had that moment but they WORKED They had chemistry with the hero that was very organic I felt that Ryan and Blake had no chemistry Some people IMO just don t fit this genre cough cough Katie Holmes cough cough Their kiss at the end made me cringe In the beginning when she was in pilot mode I was surprised and thinking oh OK so she s gonna be different from all the other distressed damsels again I ve never read the comics So I was disappointed when she ended up in the super tight dresses and heels I am not a feminist at all but just found it to be a clich when I thought the movie had other plans I mentioned in my title that I dozed off Well the last scene I recall was Peter Saarsgard in pain in his bed and then I woke up and Green Lantern had formed some race track or something I have NO clue what I missed and only just now figured it out based on the plot summary Lots of wasted familiar faces here Tim Robbins Angela Bassett total surprise and Mark Strong The battle scene with Parallax was over so quick And I m no scientist but how did Hal get so close to the sun w o getting singed I could keep typing but other posters have given some other good criticism I fully expect this movie to be shunned in a way similar to the Eric Bana version of the Hulk Although this movie does seem to be given a bit more credit than that one it will always be overshadowed by the incredible superhero flicks we ve had since about 2005 I never listen to critics when deciding which movies to see I prefer the opinions of either friends family or regular IMDb posters I really wish I had looked at these reviews first,0.0,4.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2452016/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2011,Good movie delivered but many room for improvement,Before reviewing Green Lantern I would like to give reminders of DC movies and as a major comic book fan it is also important Let s begin with Superman I II and Returns was very well done and by well done we re talking about characters portrayed well story reflecting the comic and importantly bringing the comic book to life Christopher Nolan s Batman did exactly that also and perfected it Green Lantern however missed the spot on character Ryan Reynolds was picked for Hal Jordan specifically for being one sarcastic person which is how Hal Jordan is suppose to be but in the movie sadly Hal was not that in fact Hal was also pretty scared and we all know Hal Jordan is the ultimate fearless person or able to over come it which is kinda what happens at the end of the movie you can say that Hal was only learning on how to be a true Green Lantern then at the end learnt how they are suppose to be Hal Jordan lacked his playboy womanizing recklessness and ego in the movie which is pretty difficult to tolerate but Ryan in the end did well and hopefully should continue as Hal Jordan Other then character placement things are in order but the ending was quite out of arc the only problem this movie will be facing is it s a little draggy not very exciting enough lacks the action doesn t focus a lot on the space part which is what sci fi and comic fans are looking for so you could be a little disappointed Also the movie barely shows kickass action of the Green Lantern Corps which is what every fan or audience is looking for but keep in mind this is the 1st movie of a series so we could be getting a better movie and as mentioned earlier Hal Jordan was learning to become a Green Lantern only to perfect it so have some hope a good movie was delivered,7.0,16.0,32.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444090/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2020,NO OFFENSE BUT I THINK EVERYONE IS INSANE HATING THIS!,Okay so this movie is an ORIGIN movie Ryan Reynolds turned his back on this movie later and makes jokes about it because for some unknown reason comic book junkies trolled enough to create hate on it and critics didn t get it PERSONALLY I LOVE this movie and the music score is one of my favorite James Newton Howard scores In my opinion the reboot has a high standard to go beyond Okay so the CGI suit might come off CHEAP to some but it looks fantastic Like I said this is an ORIGIN movie and it was never given a chance to try a sequel with more action etc I rate this movie a 10 because the production quality SHOWS and it s a very heroic film nonetheless Sorry Ryan buddy Have to disagree with your hate against your own movie You looked great buddy and will miss you as the Lantern,10.0,4.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5806553/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,Better Than People Give It Credit For,DC Comics has not had much luck in the live action film business Unless it s a Batman film made by Christopher Nolan they just can t get anything off the ground Superman is going on his second reboot in the ten years The Justice League idea keeps crashing and burning And Wonder Woman can t get anything going no matter who s working on it It s pretty sad when Swamp Thing has two movies while top tier heroes like Flash and Martian Manhunter haven t seen the light of film Since Marvel has been for better or worse adapting every hero they have DC WB needed something to get back in the game Green Lantern seems like a terrific fit for a summer blockbuster Big flashy effects epic stories and just two years ago the GL centered Blackest Night event took the comic book world by storm So how is the movie itself First things first the movie s biggest problem is the story It s not a bad story on its own It s biggest fault is that it s the exact same origin story we ve seen dozens of times in the past decade Man with problematic life tragic accident gets powers overcomes personal weaknesses fights bad guy love interest thrown in just for fun and set up for sequel usually in that order Superman Spider Man Daredevil Punisher Fantastic Four Batman Begins Ghost Rider and Iron Man have all used that same basic set up For comic book readers we re just glad to see our favorite heroes on the big screen But for the average film goer who don t know their Doctor Strange from Hawkman this can be quite repetitive and boring Audiences can only take the same story so many times Superman and Spider Man came out before it got old while Batman Begins and Iron Man were intelligent and fun enough that it didn t seem like the same thing over again Sadly Green Lantern fails to elevate itself outside of the visuals The story is an adaptation of Geoff John s Secret Origins It s the same basic story but the changes make it more of the clich d origin film I m not saying they needed to do a Snyder s 300 style adaptation but they didn t seem to grasp what made Nolan s adaptation of Batman Year One so lovable If they stayed a bit closer to the comics it would have been able to stand out more from the crowd It s mostly minor stuff like Hal s history his relationship with Carol and his connection with Carl Ferris that added some dynamics to the story that the movie misses out on I saw the movie in 3D and it looked terrific I wouldn t expect less in this day and age From the constructs to Oa to alien species everything looks terrific All of the characters look spot on and there are many cameos for long time readers I never did like the CGI suits and still don t but they look fine in the movie My only complaint is that there are a couple shaky cam shots that in 3D can make you nauseous But if this film doesn t get a nomination for Best Visual Effects I will be disappointed Green Lantern has much in common with this year s earlier Thor Both comic characters are very powerful have large expansive universes that are often separate from their fellow heroes and are little known to non comic readers However Thor spent a great deal of time in Asgard whereas GL only spends what seems like a day on Oa Also Thor spent time developing side characters like Sif and the Warriors Three GL has Kilowog Tomar Re and the Guardians but they re mostly cameos for exposition The characters are pretty much spot on with terrific acting all around Reynolds is great He s a little more of his usual comical self than is right for the role but he isn t goofy or just a Green Deadpool However Hal is a bit inconsistent making me believe that restored deleted scenes would make the movie better Blake Lively is fine and works well with Reynolds Though her character most of all should have been more like Secret Origins Sarsgaard has fun with Hammond both before and after his mutation Though it s Strong who steals the show as Hal s mentor and future rival Sinestro He nailed the personality and there are certainly hints of his eventual fall from grace I just wish that like the other Lanterns he had more to do The rest all do fine jobs It s not bad I ve read a lot of bad reviews many of them downright hostile but I don t think it deserves the beating it s getting It s certainly not a great film like I just have to see it again in theaters But it s a good film that I ll gladly buy when it comes out It s one of the better middle ground movies neither bad nor terrific but entertaining nonetheless,7.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446550/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,Sorry folks you're WAY off it's a decent film phenomenal CGI and 3d!! Basuc comic story but BETTER than a 5!!!!,1st off all the hate people were giving ryan Reynolds was WAY off he did what he could with a VERY basic script and a pg 13 death trap for him Imagine Eddie Murphy in his prime with a pg 13 film WONT work or Bill Murray not using improv in his film That s where Ryan Reynolds shines a rated R action film that let s him use lots of improv Also a film like free guy where he can be himself Green lantern was extremely entertaining we ve seen it multiple times and we LOVE the phenomenal 3d and CGI it looks great on our huge tv The story is basic but it s a guilty pleasure film Ryan Reynolds is not at his best but his average is better than most actors best But a 5 NO Way Its a solid 8 people please judge based on a movies merit NOT what other people tell you to think I wish hed make a sequel with a R rating and use a LOT of improvisation get a better script and watch it do 700 million,8.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7899345/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2020,This is great. Ignore the critics,I keep coming back to watch this every few years as its a light hearted DC Comic film Perfect for escapism and Ryan Reynolds is excellent in it Great CGI It hints at some amazing other GreenLantern world stories such as the immortals but keeps the film running time short ish If you look at lists of the top 50 superhero films this one is never in those lists Sure its not as good as The Mask or Ironman or Blade or Guardians OTG But its better than many of the sequels on that list,7.0,3.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5764059/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,"A very well done Green Lantern movie, even if it's not a classic.",This movie was very enjoyable It provided a faithful adaptation of the Hal Jordan Green Lantern comic book character and other characters from the comics The plot was appropriate for a Green Lantern story The visuals were stunning and there were plenty of scenes with little or no effects or CGI I particularly liked how Hal Jordan s character was portrayed and developed as I felt it was unique for a superhero character Here we have a guy who is NOT Superman i e gifted with an enormous array of superpowers nor do we have Batman who is a trained professional In this film we have a superhero who s greatest strength by far is himself especially his will That is what drives the character through challenges and to victory by the end of the film not superpowers alone not fancy gadgets not elaborate fighting skills just who he is and believing in himself and in winning I like it Not an original concept perhaps but as far as mythology goes this movie tells a great tale and gives us another great hero s journey one that occurs as changes from within not just changes physically Go see this film if you like superheros or if you want to be inspired to have courage and believe in yourself a little more Don t listen to the critics This is not a one star movie It does not suck As I said it is not a classic film but it is very good and worth seeing My only real issue is that the dramatic elements were a bit too long although a condensed version of the drama would still be entirely necessary Also a superhero who s greatest power is believing in himself and in success takes some getting used to compared to a dude who just has amazing powers or fights like Batman Anyways enjoy,9.0,21.0,31.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445139/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Horid Disappointment... Just A Bad Film,The sense of disappointment most DC fanboys felt with Catwoman or Superman Returns or Jonah Hex or Steel or well you get the point That profound non Nolan DC disappointment will deepen with Green Lantern which now lands in theatres with a resounding thud This rather silly premise of a movie is simply terrible on most levels and average in others Minor attempts at bad tongue in cheek humor mixed with crazy alien CG and worst of all the limited action was heartless action It delivers nothing but a bloated and self important waste of film even though the running time is short That s a tough thing to pull off even if they were trying to do it Talk about caught in no man s land It doesn t give you wild popcorn action and it doesn t come close to delivering deep character or plot It does remind me of the swing and a miss that was Fantastic Four simply because nothing really happened worth watching Hopefully this slide into ponderous absurdity means DC will hire Nolan for life and make him director of non Batman material Someone needs to stop this madness This asinine collection of computer graphics and insane dialogue is just a disgrace to the fresh and revolutionary source material To non comic book readers comic books themselves really aren t this dumb and cheesy Don t judge the source material based on crap films like this one,0.0,17.0,33.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445038/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2011,Out of Sight: Green Lantern's Might,The Green Lantern is one of those movies some people will love while others really want to love but can t because of its numerous flaws starting with its script The script is not a horrible comic book adaptation it was just undertaken in a lazy and cheesy way Even so Martin Campbell Casino Royale has directed an average action movie with a lot of spectacle and no substance Ryan Reynolds Buried stars as a hotheaded pilot named Hal Jordan destined to be a part of a universal peacekeeping brother hood known as the Green Lantern Corps The power of the Green Lanterns comes from the power of will wielded by the use of a ring and a special green lantern they each receive This allows them to produce anything that they see in their minds as long as they are strong willed and fearless However after years of peace a new evil plagues their ranks called Parallax whose power comes from fear Parallax has begun to kill Green Lanterns causing a big weight to rest on Hal Jordan after he is chosen to be the first human Green Lantern by dying alien In order to succeed Hal must learn from his past with the help of his love interest Carol Ferris Blake Lively The Town and the Green Lantern Corps Sinestro Mark Strong Kick Ass and Kilowog Michael Clark Duncan The Green Mile to harness the power of Green Lantern s might to defeat this new evil that has taken hold of Dr Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard An Education on earth itself Ryan Reynolds was correctly casted as Hal because of his charismatic acting ability However he would have been off if he had a script to support him that didn t make a mockery of his character Consequently the best parts of the film occur when he uses his unique abilities conjuring colorful visuals consisting of various manipulations of green light This makes his alter ego the Green Lantern a more fulfilling character than Hal especially when he is in the realms outside of earth Peter Sarsgaard struggles in this film with a script cueing him to scream every five minutes and poor character development making him one of the worst villains to ever be in a superhero movie Also the fast pace and weak transitions between earth and the realms of space makes this film seem as if it is made up of two separate movies forced together into one jumbled mess Another indicator of this can be seen with the indecisiveness of the scriptwriters mixing comedic jeering with dramatic action sequences in awkward fashion The Green Lantern doesn t bring anything new to its genre and feels like a recycled superhero film covered in green However Ryan Reynolds s charm and the visuals of the film s action sequences makes the film a watchable summer flick,4.0,9.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445598/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2011,"Disorganized, over-thought excuse for a movie",I am beginning to feel overrun with super hero movies but Green Lantern is only the 5th this year out of 6 I guess 6 is a lot when you think about the money that s gone in to production advertising and distribution For something so loved popular and I m assuming here well written these movies have been typically quite bad I must be stupid or something I wander in to these movies all excited and leave with shuffling aimlessly with no will to live It s like digging in to delicious vanilla pudding only to find it s Miracle Whip The movie opens with lovely CGI of what we wish we were getting back from the Hubble telescope We also get a riveting explanation of the origin of the rings and their power See they use an ancient power harvested from across the universe It is called willpower Willpower Will Power Hollywood will take creative liberties with EVERYTHING but they won t make take a teeny bit of liberty to make this more something I still can t put my finger on how this made me feel but I will tell you it s hard to laugh when your face is buried in your hands The movie doesn t get any better with the immediate in your faceness of Ryan Reynolds and his over hyped star status paired with the detestable Blake Lively What ever happened to the days when Reynolds was cocky Van Wilder trying to get with Tara Reid Purity of art is forever lost Action flies across the screen in constant snippets of nearly unrelated action backed by little musical medleys that sound like bumper music for a metal themed sitcom There should be a clear villain but we get a huge misdirect and find that the wicked cool bad guy is just a disposable lackey for Galactus er Parallax noun the apparent displacement of an observed object due to a change in the position of the observer Makes sense After one and a half grueling hours of nothing Hal Jordan suddenly becomes fearless and a perfect gentleman Parallax finally reaches earth and Hal Jordan quickly defeats him while looking incredibly constipated The trailer is the entire movie go watch it again IMDb trivia while a dubious source claims that Green Lantern was originally scripted as a comedy starring Jack Black That makes more sense now that I saw the movie A magic ring Skadoosh Ham sandwich Couldn t have been any worse than the disorganized over thought excuse for a movie I suffered through in 3D no less,0.0,5.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2478775/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2011,"Oh, I guess it was all right - 8/10",To say that I m giving Green Lantern an 8 10 says a lot coming from this viewer As a reader of the original comics published by DC Comics I had extraordinarily low expectations for this big budget update of the Silver Age character who made his current debut in Showcase 22 back in 1959 there already was a character named the Green Lantern who appeared back in 1940 Instead of a lengthy review I m just going to list 21 points about this flick 1 Green Lantern is a much better film than I thought it would be 2 I was heavily against the casting of Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan Green Lantern from the very get go I thought they could have found someone so much better for the part Reynolds is actually one of my least favorite actors of the moment so you can understand my ambivalence to his casting because I was sure he would doom the picture 3 To his credit Reynolds sells the part of test pilot Hal Jordan quite well He looks just like the DC Comics golden boy and carries off the part in good faith 4 Hal Jordan is selected by the dying alien Abin Sur to be the next Green Lantern the first human to become one and join the Green Lantern Corps an intergalactic police force that patrols the galaxy as it attempts to maintain universal peace and stability 5 Each Green Lantern is given a power ring which is pretty much the most powerful weapon in the universe With it the user can create almost anything out of his her imagination Apparently its only limitations are the willpower of the user and anything made of yellow will render it powerless due to an impurity in the ring itself 6 And since Jordan has certain daddy issues each of the film s three main characters each have daddy issues he witnessed his ace fighter pilot father burned to death in a plane crash as a youth he has to learn to overcome his fear if he is to become the Green Lantern corpsman assigned to patrol the Earth sector 7 I feel that Green Lantern was 14 that was well spent 8 Martin Campbell has directed a nice and shiny enough adaptation of a beloved DC Comics superhero that will certainly fill the void left by Marvel Comics DC s rival adaptations X Men First Class and Thor and to hold off audiences until the arrival of Captain America in a few weeks 9 Here is where it gets personal for a little bit 10 I m mostly a fan of Marvel Comics characters Spider Man is my favorite superhero of all time followed very closely by the X Men 11 In the DC camp however Batman is my favorite character followed by Green Lantern Hal Jordan John Stewart the first black Green Lantern corpsman and who first appeared in Green Lantern Green Arrow 87 volume two is my personal favorite Green Lantern 12 The movie itself had a pretty pointless and boring opening and closing narration by actor Geoffrey Rush one of the film s biggest weaknesses but it did have a cosmic opening credits sequence 13 In the Green Lantern comics there are actually many Green Lantern characters each of whom is prominent in their own right such as Kilowog Tomar Re and Sinestro played here by Mark Strong the latter of whom in the original comics eventually becomes the Green Lantern Corps greatest enemy 14 These characters are fairly short changed in this film and only appear in a handful of scenes throughout the picture as do the founders of the Green Lantern Corps the gnome like humanoid extraterrestrials the Guardians of the Universe 15 Hector Hammond a screaming mad Peter Sarsgaard also seems under used here and is understated and loony from the get go and thus goes into a murderous rage after becoming infected with the yellow element from primary movie villain Parallax while inspecting the remains of Abin Sur for the U S government and his condescending politician father Tim Robbins He eventually becomes a madman with telekinetic powers which he uses to get revenge on his father Hal Jordan and their mutual love interest Carol Ferris Blake Lively And boy does Hammond do a lot of screaming in this picture he s got such a set of pipes on him it really seems to be the one thing he s consistently good at in this during this film s 105 minute running time 16 I thought Parallax was actually quite frightening here his appearance in this flick brought back memories of the planet eating Galactus from Marvel s Fantastic Four title 17 I think we know who the next movie s villain is going to be if Green Lantern succeeds enough to spawn a potential franchise if the formation of a yellow power ring in the middle of the picture didn t clue us in as to who it is probably is 18 I think Ryan Reynolds did do a good job here even if most of his attempts at humor fail miserably In his stead however it is Jordan s love interest Blake Lively s Carol Ferris who seems to get the best joke in the middle of the flick after she accidentally discovers his true identity and he takes her on an impromptu Superman inspired date atop an airport traffic control tower 19 Martin Campell who also directed by personal favorite James Bond feature GoldenEye 1995 did a good job directing this flick even if it s all just flash and glitter and we ve become so used to the superhero origin flick in 2011 since there is no shortage of superhero flicks coming out of Hollywood these days 20 I was proved wrong by this movie because I thought it was good and really nothing more Ryan Reynolds proved me wrong he s an effective and charming Hal Jordan Green Lantern 21 Green Lantern 8 10 from this

17 June 2011,Nice adaption of an amazing comic hero,I ve been eagerly anticipating a Green Lantern film since I was a child in the 80s and this film delivered a pretty faithful adaption The Cons Despite all the critical bashing this was a really ambitious film probably too ambitious for its meager running time I can only hope that Martin Campbell releases an unrated director s cut on DVD for surely more had to have been shot It seems that they wanted to cover a lot of territory with Oa the Guardians the Corps Ferris Aircraft Hal and Carol Hal and his Dad Parallax Hector Hammond etc The problem is is that to cover all of that you need a much longer film So instead we get very rushed explanations on all matters and no one gets enough screen time For example Hal has this moment with his family and nephew that is meant to be meaningful but as soon as they are introduced we never see them again Though it is faithful with the comic Hal does have a big family it was maybe not necessary to introduce them quite yet and then the film could have made room for at least one more action scene The ending comes off a little anti climactic with the final showdown between Hal and Parallax but I did enjoy that the solution did arrive through Kilowog s suggestion which he humbly takes credit for Unfortunately the trailers showed an awful lot of the best scenes in the film which left fewer surprises when watching in its entirety The Pros I thought Ryan Reynolds did a nice job playing Hal which was sarcastic cocky funny and troubled Deep back story concerning his father and his lifelong friendship with Carol Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively have nice chemistry together and though Lively s acting isn t Shakespeare worthy she looks great and seems to connect with her character I thought Lively was quite good as Carol Mark Strong was a natural as Sinestro and if a sequel is made I d love to see him have more screen time next time though I suspect that Campbell only ever meant to wet our appetite concerning Sinestro anyways Peter Sarsgaard was creepy and funny as Hector Hammond though in all honesty SPOILER GL and him should have had a major showdown which never happened because of Parallax It was nice to see Oa and some of the familiar Lanterns like Kilowog and Tomar Re but I m glad that the majority of the film was on earth because Hal did spend a lot of time there in the earlier comics I was actually worried that too much of the film was going to be in space sacrificing Hal s earthly issues I found the CGI to be top notch with actions scenes done in an exciting manner without resorting to shaky cam shooting with confusing fight scenes Credit should be given to Campbell in his ability to handle action The music score was decent which was reminiscent of Superman and John Barry I swear I could here elements and strange guitar moments I enjoyed the hell out of this film and it was a real surprise especially after all the negative buzz and I look forward to seeing it again in the theater I really hope the producers make enough back from the film to encourage an even better and more confident sequel I even think Martin Campbell is capable of making an even finer follow up with GL battling Sinestro and possibly Star Sapphire Finger s crossed,10.0,8.0,15.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444869/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,The Worst Superhero Film Of the Summer.,Let me say I ve never read the Green Lantern comic when I did read and collect them I was never really interested in DC comics The just didn t have compelling characters outside of Batman and I only started reading Batman after I saw the movie back in 1989 Right now I can t name any of the major hero s from DC outside of Batman Superman and Wonderwoman I can name Flash also but that s only because of the TV series that came out back and 1990 which was a good show I think that s the problem with DC comics as a whole their hero s aren t as well known or recognized outside of the big two Batman Superman while Marvel has many likable and recognizable characters like Captain America Spiderman Wolverine Daredevil to name a few and even a lesser know character like the Punisher is probably better known than the majority of the hero s Villains in DC comics So I don t think there will be many who truly enjoy this movie outside of the ones who read the comic Now I don t want you to think this is the worst comic book movie out there but it is the worst of the this summer by far But there have been worst The Fantastic Four movie that was never released I have a friend who has a VHS copy of the movie and the movie is the worst comic book movie I ve seen Jonah Hex Catwoman Ghost Rider Punisher War Zone to name a few of the terrible ones No I d but Green Lantern on the level of the first newer Fantastic Four movie which was bad but not horrible I liked that DC and Warner Brothers took a chance with this character Since reading into the back history of the character he has to travel to other planets and fight in space So this is the first comic book movie I can think of that takes place much of the film in space It s a risk I don t think many movie studio s or Marvel will risk right now So I need to give DC and WB credit for taking a chance on some levels it worked well For example in taking us to a alien world and introducing us to alien Green Lanterns I ll get to what I didn t like about this later on in my review Next I liked Ryan Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively Ryan Reynolds Hal Jordan is a good but not great actor who has done mostly comedies He does bring life to Hal Jordan but the writing and script didn t help him much After seeing this movie I d have preferred if he had done DEADPOOL I think he was born to do that character but I don t know if it s going to happen I hope after this movie bombs which I m pretty sure it will studio s will still give him a chance to star Then there s Blake Lively Carol Ferris who plays Hal s love interest Again she is hampered by the bad script but she still brings her beauty and charisma along with her acting talent to this film to brighten it up She s one of the few bright spots in the show Gossip Girl and was outstanding in THE TOWN Sadly these are the only two characters who are the least bit interesting Finally there s the special effects which were good but not great Going into this movie I thought from trailers this would be the worst part but I was wrong the effects were pretty good The worlds I saw were believable and the alien characters looked alive There is the story writing of the movie You won t understand anything if you haven t read the comic Outside the Narration in the beginning you don t get anything Not details on who the Lantern s are or who the immortal guardians are and this supposed great evil in Parallax Then there is the high school script and dialog is out of a a student film you d expect a child to write That s how bad it was some of the lines were laughable when they were clearly not intended to be Finally there s the two useless bad guys which were uninteresting and weren t really that bad or at least didn t seem that bad Loki and Sebastian Shaw in Thor and X Men First Class seem more alive and evil than the two bad guys in this film combined Now we go to all the useless actors in the film Tim Robbins Senator Hammond is a ghost in this film as you won t remember him once he s gone along with virtually all the other actors except for the two I mentioned above That includes Angela Bassett Dr Amanda Waller Jay O Sanders Carl Ferris Geoffrey Rush Voice of Tomar Re and Michael Clarke Duncan Voice of Kilowog to name a few Then there is Peter Sarsgaard Hector Hammond who I guess was supposed to be tortured soul villain but he was uninteresting and unlikable and wasn t much of a villain Finally there is Mark Strong Sinestro Mark is a good actor and makes a good villain Sadly he was underused in this film and I wish he had been the bad guy and I hoped he would have been when the guardians gave him a yellow ring Unfortunately it wasn t to be and we were stuck with Hammond and Parallax You d think the action and special effects would coincide with each other but the don t with this film While the special effects were pretty good the action was terrible and downright boring I heard this movie cost around 175 million to make and you d think with that much of a budget they d have better action I can t think of one good action scene in this film and the climax where Parallax invades earth and chases Hal Jordan around the solar system is terrible,3.0,21.0,49.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444750/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Le Sigh,The Good Ryan Reynolds he really did give it his all and sold it as best he could His sincerity was undeniable and he deserves most of the credit for what works in the movie He succeeded were plenty of others would ve fallen flat on their faces Peter Sarsgaard not a great performance but he was chewing the hell out of the scenery and having a blast doing it I love that piercing scream he does The creature and Corp design work The suits look great They don t look phony at all on Reynolds I love the bright colors I was surprised how much I liked the look and presence of Parallax Especially good sound work on him There were some neat looking aliens tucked away in the corners The Bad The script lazy lazy lazy It s boiling over with clunky exposition Who these characters were was shoehorned in in a very shoddy manner Hal s flashback at the beginning to his father s death was the height of plot convenience Hal and Hector having a past is pretty much non existent They don t share any scenes together until what seemed like an hour in and their interaction basically amounts to them bumping into each other and going Oh hey What s up And speaking of Hector I have no idea who this guy was He s infected pretty much immediately after we meet Am I supposed to like him see his flaws see how he could be susceptible to fear I don t know Near the end Sinestro describes Hal as brash and opinionated just like Abin Sur Would have been nice to have actually see that quality in Abin instead of just being told at the end Actors in nothing roles Tim Robbins and Angela Bassett do nothing of note playing cardboard characters with nothing to do but further the plot and add some cred to the cast I m not overly familiar with Blake Lively and I left with basically no impression of her I won t blame her as she had essentially nothing to work with The Corp Speaking of doing nothing the Corp and the Guardians do nothing either This is all tell and no show Tomar Re is Basil Exposition Kilowag trains Hal for what seemed like 2 minutes and then more or less vanished the Guardians sit on their thrones making bizarre head scratching decisions and they have a serious case of the CG rubber lips I started to perk up when Sinestro led a small regiment of Lanterns to fight Parallax but it s a 30 second non fight with one projection 5 seconds of zipping around and then Sinestro looking shocked after characters we met in 2 second cut aways are dispatched with ridiculous ease by Parallax Oa one of the biggest let downs for me If you ve seen the trailers you ve pretty much seen all this movie has to offer with this world Some rocks a purple sky and Lanterns standing around doing you guessed it nothing Asgard was a far more visually interesting place and forget about it even coming near Pandora The rest of the people on Earth After Green Lantern makes his first appearance there s a shocking lack of attention There s a news report in the background of one scene going who was this hero who saved the day as if that s the big story and not a mention of gee I don t know all the crazy energy constructs he created The credit cookie Not earned in the slightest The reason Sinestro puts on that yellow ring had zero to do with what was established throughout the entire rest of the movie and for what it s worth Sinestro works well with his small amount of screen time and Mark Strong brings as much gravity as his humanely possible to the role This was nothing but cheap fan service and teeth grating plot contrivance Thor was a much more entertaining ride and I thought Thor was merely good Forget about it even coming close to Iron Man Superman Watchmen or Nolan s Batmans But is it terrible No I ll watch this again before I go near Wolverine Fantastic Four Ghost Rider or Kick Ass again By a long shot It didn t suck but I just can t say I liked it either and I wanted to so bad Big disappointment,5.0,16.0,30.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444686/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,Another DC superhero fails to shine.,Ryan Reynolds stars as test pilot Hal Jordan who is chosen to be part of the Green Lantern Corps an intergalactic police force whose special green rings powered by matching lanterns grants them the power to make anything they can think of a reality I ve always preferred DC s comic book heroes over those of Marvel but other than the highly successful Dark Knight trilogy they ve been wildly inconsistent when turning their characters into movies more often than not completely dropping the ball The Christopher Reeve Superman series started well but went seriously downhill after Part 2 Swamp Thing sucked Supergirl was pitiful the 80s 90s Batman franchise ended on an extremely embarrassing note with Batman and Robin the less said about Catwoman the better Superman Returns sucked Jonah Hex tanked and Man of Steel was a massive disappointment Green Lantern does nothing to reverse the trend Very rarely do I struggle to stay awake during a superhero movie but Green Lantern s tedious plot saw me perilously close to dozing off several times Reynolds makes for a forgettable hero director Martin Campbell struggles to inject any excitement into the bland clich d storyline and a glut of not so special CGI effects fail to impress I sincerely hope that forthcoming DC movies Superman v Batman Wonder Woman and The Justice League show a marked improvement but with Zack Snyder in the director s chair for two of these it could go either way 3 5 out of 10 rounded up to 4 for IMDb,4.0,4.0,11.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3170160/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2020,The haters really ruined the success of this film.,First off as I have said a million times before no matter what kind of movie you are making your main goal is to pass it off the best way you can with the believability factor When attempting to tackle a character such as this and preparing it for the silver screen can be tough Batman and Superman are easy Green Lantern is hard because his power is to create anything with his mind using the power of his ring You also need to avoid making the movie too silly and childish All throughout Green Lantern s history they had his character create a lot of silly childish things with his ring You can t do that in the movies or you will turn off the audience With most of DC s characters since the 80s the writers and artists fleshed out and sophisticated the characters for a more maturing audience They brought in the back story of the Guardians and created a larger Universe to explain the origins of the Lanterns It was this maturation angle that the filmmakers needed to key in on to get it to work in the theaters A tough job It is a basic story with a lot of subplots Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds a skillful but reckless test pilot is the chosen one to take the ring from a dying Green Lantern who has crash landed on Earth He is eventually brought to the planet Oa and trained by the Lanterns most notably Sinestro Mark Strong to help Hal utilize his skills Meanwhile a destructive creature named Parralax has escaped its imprisonment and has turned his anger on Oa and Earth Also a mad scientist Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard who has been infected by Parallax sets out to destroy Hal Also in attendance is Hal s love interest Carol Ferris Blake Lively I felt that the filmmakers did a good job of softening some of the rough edges If they felt they had to do something that would come across as silly or childish they always seemed to compensate with a plot line description of why it happened An excellent example Hal has to use his ring to save a large group of people so he creates a Hot Wheels track with his ring It might come across as silly but Director Martin Campbell makes sure to show us a scene earlier in the film where Hal and his nephew are playing with a Hot Wheels track so it is fresh in his mind and that is why he created one with his ring Another touching scene between Hal and Carol helps knock the wind out of that typical silly complaint that most people have about superhero masks It stops the debate that always happens when people want to know how Clark Kent can get away with keeping his secret identity with a pair of glasses or how Robin can hide his with a tiny mask A brilliant move by Campbell Ryan Reynolds carries the show and the film is quite good with its moderate sprinkles of comedy relief Mark Strong does an excellent job as Sinestro and you have to stay around in the early end credits to see an important plot bridge for the possible sequel that in all likelihood will involve Sinestro and his change that he goes through to become one of Hal s most evil foes The rest of the supporting cast is average even Tim Robbins who plays Senator Hammond Hector s father which I wasn t buying at all is kind of lame I wasn t too crazy about the soundtrack either Trust me there are some rough edges to this film Some moments should have been avoided but overall I had a good time watching this film and was impressed at the execution which is something the makers of X men First Class 2011 which came out two weeks before Green Lantern failed to do with a much easier task I am totally open and hoping for a sequel which we now know will never happen 7 7 B MyGrade 8 IMDB,7.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6147785/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Top Gun meets Star Trek,I don t know why people expect greatness from comic book movies By nature comics are generally fun and fantastical and that s the way I like the movies The Green Lantern was right along that plane Think Fantastic Four not Dark Knight I loved the characters with their subtlety and genuine presences The interactions were very well done And with so little time to tell so much of a story I felt that the little nuances gave good insight to back story and developed character when there just wasn t time to get too deeply into it As a whole the film is bursting with fantasy space travel mind bending energy powered manifestations and has the ability to poke fun at it s inherent comic book cheese The humor is light you are not getting Van Wilder but that plays well into Hal s personal journey and the relationship he has with Carol In short I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be on the lookout for sequels,8.0,18.0,34.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444719/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2011,Green Lantern succeeds because it works hard at becoming what it really is.,A comic book movie The painful truth for any filmmaker in the modern world trying to construct a much loved comic book hero venerably worshipped deity picture is the inevitable comparison to The Dark Knight But let s be frank here fellas The Dark Knight is simply not a comic book movie it never was from the day of its conception and certainly not from the day popular culture set their beady little eyes on it But still the comparisons are what they are and what they are are desperate comparisons of the films with The Dark Knight And because of that this film among others will be deemed painful exercises in Special FX and shallow character development I think these accusations are largely unfair and yes I am probably going to rant in the majority of this review Let s get straight to the facts That is the negative ones first GL is a fairly unfamiliar superhero to most of us I had no particular interest in him before the production started and it is unlikely I will be buying a blow up doll of Ryan Reynolds in a green suit and hiding it in my locked wardrobe anytime in the future wait What Batman Spiderman and Superman are the musclebound dogs we have so deeply ingrained in our personal view of the world s popular culture So when we hear about a guy with a powered ring we can t help but think the son of Sauron is a funny vomit green YAY This is perhaps the primary marketing difficulty for the film The cast overall is not a problem however none of them are given a really significant period of time on screen This makes sense however when you consider the film has a runtime of only an hour and a half or so For a large scale character origin story why wouldn t you use your standard allotted 120 minutes that s about as much as the kiddies you ve used as an excuse to go see it can handle to throw in a few more bones for the older audience to chew on I guess not An extra five minutes screen time for Mega head the green guy the yellow monster thingy the brunette you can tell is really a blonde and the sunburnt guy played by the bloke off Kick Ass 3 5 minutes is an eternity in film and would have tempted this humble reviewer to mark out an early place in the year s top ten list But alas it wasn t to be The plot as plots go in our dear beloved nihilistic Hollywood is on par but is executed with confidence Confidence that goes some distance in hiding its somewhat industrial manufacture Oh and it s always good to keep in mind that if you want a truly frightening villain for the beloved hero to contend with it s best to make him human or humanoid at least The horrors in my nightmares are either unseen until the last minute or human A yellow computer generated thing with a bad dentist ah well Now the positives The first positive is that the negatives did not weigh this film down I walked into the theatre tired grumpy and exhausted It was a 10am showing You get it and very determined to find a reason to viciously hate every bit of this film I had fun was surprised at some of the things on screen and most importantly didn t feel like rioting at the concession stand afterwards for the return of my money Ryan Reynolds is good because he is just ordinary Not ordinary in his acting just ordinary in his characters representation So far the character is the one I ve had the most ease in relating to And this is what I mean I am not a nerdy guy who can t get girls and then gets bitten by a hungry arachnid And I am certainly not from Kryton And contrary to popular belief I was not born in a manger either Neither is Reynolds character He is just a guy who has made some bad decisions has some nightscare issues and one day gets an enormous responsibility plopped right on his shoulders or finger whatever Ain t that life in a nutshell Mark Strong is as usual a revelation in this film He is both menacing and wise in his portrayal of Hal Jordan s mentor amazing if you consider all the tomato sauce layered on his face they call this makeup Gossip Girl girl Blake Lively adds some touching elements to this film and her relationship with Hal Jordan in this film is both moving and surprisingly quite tragic I enjoyed this aspect of the film and would have liked to have seen more of it even if that meant making it the heart of the whole film Peter Saarsgard seems to be playing the standard issue he brings out of all his films but he is sufficiently creepy and thankfully provides some comic relief The action sequences and effects are brisk and mercifully short Martin Campbell seems more concerned with characters and supplementing them with action sequences rather than the other way round which is just what is needed Campbell employed the same stroke with Casino Royale and the method proves useful through all situations James Newton Howard s score is memorable if not stunning and the production design is competent I particularly liked the green suits but stating that as belonging to production design may start new a galaxy wide war with the SFX department so I won t go there Overall GL is satisfying and memorable

14 November 2011,"Let's be honest - The other super-hero flicks of late set the bar high, and this one was obviously the most difficult adaptation...",Green Lantern is a film that could not have been made 20 years ago There was no way to create this character without a heavy dose of CGI The CGI is pretty well done I don t think I had any gripes in that department The film moves along at a fine pace with all the necessary subplots Worthiness Love Fear Good versus evil The problems here lie in a skeleton script and some really meaningless characters Tim Robbins and Peter Saargard s characters came off to me as characters that weren t even relevant to the film Green Lantern treads water in terms of the subplots containing those characters The film also lacks an epic battle sequence Hal Jordan takes on Peter Saarsgard a band of thugs and a huge blob of fear but the movie lacks a well defined and explosive climax The movie also lacks a clear and effective villain In the end we have two poorly defined weak villains that cannot stand up to the well defined and enigmatic if not down right charming lead character All that said this is not a bad film at all For me it s not quite as good as the slightly over rated Thor and a clear step down from Captain America There was so much more that could have been done here They barely even began to tap into the love story superhero obligation problems that could have added some emotion to an nearly emotionless story Let s face it Green Lantern s obligations lie on a planet light years away It s not like Bruce Wayne living in a mansion up the street Reynolds is funny but not nearly as funny as he could have been with a better script I would still recommend this for at least one viewing It was better than I expected but because of some poor reviews I didn t expect much 55 100 You ll like this if you liked Spiderman 3 Episode 1 The Incredible Hulk 08 Xmen Origins Wolverine and Blade Trinity,5.0,2.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2518398/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2011,"Not as finely polished as the greats, but entertaining never the less",In the realm of superheros Batman is and will always be my favorite But in a close second is Green Lantern Why Green Lantern Because there is a major level of depth to his character that doesn t just revolve around earth like most superheros One might make the argument that Superman does the same This is true but when i mean depth i m talking about Green Lantern eventually turning evil something no other comic has dared to try Let s hope this attempt can capture the image i already have planted deep within my brain For starters let s talk about what i did like The visual effects are what really make this shine And the 3D certainly is not wasted Almost every single scene is virtually stunning and very eye catching Second would be the acting by Mark Strong as Sinestro and Peter Sarsgaurd as Hector Hammond These two really came to play ball especially Sarsgaurd Not to knock Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively They weren t bad but they didn t dazzle me like the others The action sequences were pretty rad as well Yes there were few but what they did give you was enough to fill your appetite Could i have used more absolutely But i feel that if they over did it with the action then it would have strayed away from the plot which is what a lot of action movies do and fail in the long run Which leads me to what i didn t like Okay the storyline is just fine It s not bad it s somewhat solid best way i can put it is this It isn t finely polished like say The Dark Knight or IronMan but it does it s job as far as being entertaining I must be honest i was expecting a giant WOW factor with the story but i think the problem was that they didn t incorporate that major level of depth that i was referring to earlier I mean there is a lot going on in this movie you have whats happening on Earth and what s happening on Oa and then there s the love interest with Lively and Reynolds which is kind of flat then you got the two villains one of which is one the other side of the galaxy It is a lot to take in They do a good job of pacing it and spreading it out but i think that if they trimmed a lot of the fat from this movie like say they only had one villain maybe that would have opened some more doors of opportunity to let in some more depth So was the story bad No i liked it but i couldn t help but sense that there could have been more And i m not saying that because i read the comics it s from a movie standpoint Bottom Line i really enjoyed It s not as deep as the great superhero movies which to me is a bit of a let down But overall it was fun On an entertainment level which superhero movie would i compare it too i would say Thor It did a nice job of wetting your beak But so far this year X Men still has the crown,7.0,10.0,23.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444150/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2011,"This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine",The Universe is a big and dangerous place Good thing there s an agency of guardians to watch over us When one of them dies their selection procedure finds a replacement and against all odds it turns out to be an Earthling Another comic turned into film Another comic I have never read so I can t say whether the conversion was done well or not As a film it works OK enough it s popcorn amusement with plenty of spectacle to keep the audience busy for its full duration It is not going to win any prices though no master piece performances no master piece story no master piece of anything Graphic wise it works well enough The planet of the guardians is depicted like a place worth living and the effects used are ranging from OK enough to pretty good Story wise it tells enough even though most of the backing tale is biased along an all too known clich Sound wise I see no reason to complain music was either not there or not disturbing So all in all a 7 out of 10 Popcorn amusement and decent enough at that,7.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2470855/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,GL was awesome. The critics are all WRONG.,I have no idea what movie all the critics who bombasted Green Lantern saw but it must have been something else like Kung Fu Panda 2 The GL mythos is a very complex and complicated one which even followers of the comic could easily get confused by at times However the makers of this film did an admirable job of explaining the background and rationales of the story in an easily understandable manner which even those with no prior knowledge of GL could comprehend There were major plot elements which were drastically changed from the original comic stories Yet in the film they were altered and explained in a fashion that made them accessible to the average moviegoer without alienating fans of the comics Ryan Reynolds excelled as Hal Jordan making him a believable funny and exciting Mark Strong was great as Sinestro and the rest of the cast did a fine job as well Possible spoiler And this movie was made solely for the purpose of introducing Green Lantern and setting up the next story in which he will face off against Sinestro That story looks to be even greater than this one was,10.0,6.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445499/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2011,Perhaps not the train wreck some have suggested....,DC Comics The Green Lantern Darkest night darkest hour was always going to be a tough sell to non comic book audiences The hero derives his power from a ring and he needs to charge it from his nifty green lantern really Hal Jordon Ryan Reynolds is the ultra cocky handsome and improbable fighter jock dog fighting sophisticated drone jet fighters as part of an advanced weapons program Haunted by his test pilot fathers death Jordan battles his own demons as to whether he feels fear embraces it or continues to run through a series of empty but very beautiful liaisons Meanwhile in a galaxy far far away on the planet Oa a corp of Green Lantern s stand guard over the Universe dividing it into sectors which they are entrusted to defend Under the overall control of the guardians think Yoda on very high poles the Green Lantern corp stand watch Protecting their charges from evil using the will of the people as a source for their power defined by a very bright Green light Evil in the form of Parallax who was cast away into oblivion after dabbling in the even more powerful fear power source is now awakened and is firmly in the yellow corner The unfortunate Hal is chosen by the ring following the crash landing of Abin Sur Temuera Morrison after he is injured in a battle with Parallax The ring never fails and always chooses correctly which is seriously questioned when part of the underlying creed for the corps is responsibility a character trait Hal does not readily demonstrate Aided by his friend Tom Waititi Hal shows off his new power a nifty green suit and powers that appear only restrained by his own imagination including flying and morphing any objects he wishes to realise Beating up the local roughnecks at the local bar shows what he is capable of and then flys to Oa to receive more formal training at the hands of the local drill instructor Tomar Re Geoffrey Rush a colossal green giant apparently made of rocks Sparking the interest of Green Lantern corps leader Sinestro Mark Strong he disappoints the group and returns to earth in a funk Meanwhile senator Robert Hammond Tim Robbins and his son Peter Peter Saarsgard are doing some dabbling themselves into the power provided by fear following the postmortem of Sur Modern movies always have politicians as bad guys there clearly is a message there somewhere Hal is called upon to defend the earth from the ever more powerful Parallax drawn to the power that the Hammond s have unearthed Whether Hal triumphs over evil and peace is restored is not the point this is a comic book adaptation after all but is it fun Following the critical mauling the film received the end result is not so bad Director Campbell has kept the whole enterprise moving along at speed is it silly and preposterous of course There are moments to enjoy the reveal to the beautiful Ferris Lively is unexpected and welcome The decision to provide the suit via CGI does detract from the reality which in a film of this type is desperately needed due to the fanciful nature of the story There are too many effects and on occasion the story is in danger of imploding into it s own pretentiousness but it all just about skates by on the charm of the lead and his ability to mock himself By the power of Grey Skull or To Infinity and Beyond are two of the oath s attempted to get the ring to work The film is light and breezy making no claims for a darker vision or Batman inner turmoil and torment This harks back more to the original Superman s where comic book characters were just that unreal The effects are good but there are too many of them the supporting characters are adequate there is no real identifiable villain to shout at but the leads acquit themselves well enough in what must have been an orgy of green screen work A decision was clearly made that this would be gossamer light candyfloss fare for a family audience and on that level it just about hits the mark If you are looking for deeper meanings or complex characters there are better ways to spend your movie dollars Summary Not as bad as feared certainly not in the same league as other comic book adventures but perhaps not the train wreck some have suggested Mild competent implausible comic book fun with too much CGI and little requirement for a sequel therefore expect number 2 to arrive at your local multiplex soon http julesmoviereviews blogspot com,5.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2533764/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2011,Back to basics of what a true superhero film should be!,Initially thinking this blockbuster will be hollow and without depth I was proved wrong by watching this fantastic superhero film Ryan Reynolds surprised me because let s face it he s not exactly Oscar worthy yet he managed to play Hal Jordan really well and not as shallow as I thought he would be Even Blake Lively was amazing as Hals love interest she was brilliant in her role This film was clever in sticking to the true conventions of a true superhero film It has the normal guy turned hero villain created fighting scenes final conflict love interest etc It had all those great definitions of a fun superhero film which really hasn t been seen since Spider Man 2002 Another great positive was that it was not rude there was no swearing it was a clean fun great film The Green Lantern wasn t afraid to show how awesome his powers were the special effects were awesome and the things the Green Lantern could do was brilliant The fighting scenes conflict of good and evil was evident and brilliantly executed I know on the surface the film looks cheap and terrible but I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this film as I wasn t wasting almost two hours of my life but instead I was enjoying two hours of my life,7.0,4.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445360/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Thought this would suck but i ended up liking it,I thought I had absolutely no interest in this superhero and maybe my low expectations are why I was in no way disappointed with this movie But either way I think that Green lantern is an enjoyable action movie with some decent laughs in there too Film sees the usually annoying Ryan Reynolds Whose actually been growing on me since buried get a ring from outer space which gives him super powers The powers that this character has he s a superhero I m unfamiliar with it has too be said are actually what made the movie work for me This superhero is different and interesting with the unique things he can pull off while in his cheesy green costume and the fact the film is in no way taking itself too seriously unlike more popular superheros like Batman works even further in its favour Flick seems too be getting a hard time from critics for whatever reason Perhaps its not brought too the screen well in the eyes off those who knew this character beforehand But I didn t know this guy beforehand and found myself liking it so can t complain The only things I will say against it are that some great actors are in here being sorely wasted in lame parts while Reynolds even though he does a good job seems overused in superhero movies being in a Blade movie an x men movie and now this Peter Sarsgaard looked promising as the villain but then ended up eventually looking as silly as Mark Strong does with his red face and spock ears Compared too The Dark knights Joker and x mens Magneto these rogues aren t as interesting as this superhero deserves But again they re probably part off Green Lantern history Which i m clueless about remember,5.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445416/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2011,Visually stunning eye-candy at it's best!,GREEN LANTERN Four Stars Out of Five Long awaited adaptation by some of the popular DC Comics character Hal Jordan the first human member of the Guardians of the Universe and carrier of the team s powerful ring which gives it s possessor amazing superpowers Ryan Reynolds stars in the title role and Martin Campbell director of two well liked James Bond films CASINO ROYALE and GOLDEN EYE and two Zorro films THE MASK OF ZORRO and THE LEGEND OF ZORRO directs The film co stars the lovely Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Mark Strong Tim Robbins and Angela Bassett and was written by a team of experienced TV writers I enjoyed the film for what it was but didn t have too high expectations going in to it having not been a fan of the material previously The first Green Lantern depicted in the comic books was actually Alan Scott in the 1940 s then published by All American Publications He got his powers from a magical ring though and was not a member of the Guardians This film follows the adventures of the second Green Lantern Jordan who was the first human member inducted into the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps a team of different alien races made up of inhabitants from planets across the galaxy all having made a pact to protect the universe When the team meets their greatest opponent yet an unstoppable force known as Parallax which sucks the life force from all that gets in it s way they re forced with recruiting a human for the first time who have never been deemed worthy before Hal is an arrogant and somewhat self centered test pilot who seems like the least likely choice to fill their requirements but when he s put to the test a true hero is born The film is full of dazzling visuals and is some of the best 3D yet for a film this is almost unarguably it s strongest point The action early on is pretty thrilling and intense but the pacing and overall plot involvement becomes pretty bogged down by the third act None of the characters really standout or feel very relatable and the performances are adequate at best Reynolds is a great leading man and has definitely proved himself to be capable of much more than slapstick comedy over the years but here his talents are mostly wasted He fits the cocky pilot role but isn t given much of any emotional depth to work with He s also too well known to be playing a character like this You never believe he s not Ryan Reynolds playing the Green Lantern Lively looks beautiful and her and Reynolds make a very pretty couple but beyond that they show no chemistry Still the film is breathtaking to watch and for the most part pretty fun it does do a good job of capturing the inner child thrill at least Not knowing much about the characters or their mythology and having no high expectations I can t say I was really disappointed with the film at all it does deliver the summer popcorn entertainment it promises It s definitely not as good as recent high caliber comic book superhero films like THOR and X MEN FIRST CLASS but it s still a decent addition to the genre Definitely worth seeing if you re a fan of these types of films or just visually stunning eye candy in general Watch our review show MOVIE TALK at http www youtube com watch v aotBOLCP Yg,8.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450295/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,Will Trumps Fear,For the record my favorite cinematic adaptations of costume clad comic book crime fighters vary The Christopher Reeve Superman 1978 tops my list followed by its sequel Superman II 1980 then Iron Man 2008 Spider man 2002 Batman Begins 2005 The Dark Knight 2008 X Men 2000 X2 2003 Fantastic Four 2005 and X Men First Class 2011 Interestingly Marvel Comics has enjoyed greater success with their cinematic adaptations than their DC rivals Since I grew up perusing DC Comics I prefer DC heroes for their classic simplicity compared with more sophisticated but fascinating origins of the Marvel Comics mutants Each of these films exhibits ambitious artistry and sets the gold standard for heroes villains and stories The Michael Keaton Batman movies were entertaining but Batman didn t reach the gold standard until Christopher Nolan took over the helm from Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher Typically a great costume clad comic book crime fighter flick boasts the illusion of realism despite its outlandish larger than life quality The hero should be vulnerable without being weak In other words he she or it should narrowly escape death and people s lives should be put in jeopardy Spectacular production values suspenseful and surprising scripting sympathetic heroes menacing villains and an impressive arena for them to display their powers contribute to making great costume clad comic book crime fighting films GoldenEye director Martin Campbell s Green Lantern qualifies as a good costume clad comic book crime fighter flick No it doesn t surpass any of those epics listed in the paragraph above Nonetheless Green Lantern is worth watching at least once even in 3 D Twice wouldn t be intolerable for the 2 D version Thrice might be pushing it unless it is either on DVD or Blu Ray Happily this lavish 200 million special effects driven DC entry in the summer crime fighter sweepstakes neither takes itself too seriously nor wears out its welcome at 104 minutes This exciting movie itself is fun to watch even in its 2 D version for sheer eye candy Considerable imagination went into the screenplay by Greg Berlanti of Dawson s Creek Michael Green of Smallville and Harry Potter and the Order of the Golden Phoenix scribes Marc Guggenheim and Michael Goldenberg They keep things lively enough and deliver a solid origins story The sympathetic Ryan Reynolds hero shows strong potential but neither Blake Lively nor he get a chance to generate any romantic sizzle in this PG 13 outing The aliens and the other worlds make the grade Watching the scenes featuring aliens reminded me of the cantina scene in the original Star Wars Despite the presence of aliens with radically different color scheme complexions Green Lantern never slips into parody No nobody like Jar Jar Binks shows up to spoil things Campbell maintains a fine balance in dramatic tone when his writers and he aren t immersing us with exposition about Green Lantern mythology For the record the DC Comics hero has been around since July 1940 when Martin Nodell and Bill Finger created him for All American Comics and the character lasted until 1949 In those days before DC was forged in a merger Green Lantern was railroad engineer Alan Scott In the 1959 DC rebooted The Green Lantern and he became daredevil test pilot Hal Jordan Although the Alan Scott Green Lantern sounds interesting Campbell and his scribes appropriate the Hal Jordan hero Essentially they have replicated Jordan s origins as the man in green He receives his status and power as a Green Lantern when an alien dying alien Abin Sur crashes on Earth and the ring seeks Hal The mystical Guardians of the Universe supervise an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps The Guardians divided the galaxy into 3 600 sectors with one Green Lantern per sector These individuals sound like Texas Rangers Anyway a Green Lantern wears an emerald green ring which gives them powers limited only by their imagination If there is one quality that a good Green Lantern must possess it is fearlessness When Green Lantern opens a former Guardian who has turned into a super villain called Parallax has escaped fatally wounded Abin Sur and sets out to ultimately destroy Earth and later the Guardians using fear as its chief weapon Naturally Hal is flabbergasted that he has been chosen to wear the ring As it turns out he is the first human to serve as a Green Lantern and his mentor Thaal Sinestro Mark Strong of Kick Ass doesn t have much confidence in him Of course Hal has no confidence in himself but he is an excellent if not unorthodox test pilot Meanwhile milquetoast biology professor Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard of Boys Don t Cry is called in to conduct an autopsy on Abin Sur s remains During the autopsy Hammond is infected by some of the DNA that Parallax left in Sur s corpse Consequently Hammond acquires both telepathic as well as telekinetic powers Eventually Hal and Hector battle over childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris Blake Lively of The Town who recognizes Hal even when he is in green The villains in Green Lantern flaw it Mind you they present a clear and present challenge to our hero but they look like they hatched from the same galaxy that yielded Tim Burton s Mars Attacks Moreover the villains are either hideously deformed mutants or a monstrous supernatural extraterrestrial phenomenon that resembles a creature with the human skull and the vaporous body of a shape shifting octopus Having great villains makes the difference between a great costume clad comic book crime fighter flick and a good costume clad comic book crime fighter flick Green Lantern comes up short on villainy The villains emerge as either blow hards or half wits As one of the villains Sarsgaard is more fun to watch before his head swells up and makes him look like a pygmy with skin disease The skull faced octopus might as well have been a Japanese monster puppet for all the evil that it conjures up Nevertheless the way that our hero defeats it is fun but the best villain Sinestro seems yet to come if you wait around for the end credits for that

21 February 2013,Not THAT Bad!,Green Lantern is actually a decent superhero movie despite many plot holes Contrary to what most people say I actually enjoyed this film It had believable CGI good outer space visuals decent acting and a good screenplay What I didn t like are the small things that bothered me For example when Green Lantern was in space without any breathing device I was quite confused Martin Campbell s film based of the DC comic character Green Lantern is about the superhero himself and his origins The movie explains how the cocky Hal Jordan goes from jet flier to superhero or more appropriately intergalactic cop whose mission is to stop the evil Parallax Ryan Reynolds is actually not that bad as Hal People don t seem to give him the credit he deserves He really has that cocky flair going well for him Blake Lively ranges from good to bad based on what scenes she was in so I found that perplexing The supporting cast of Tim Robbins Angela Bassett etc were solid in their roles Overall this is a good superhero film that disappointed the world so it seems I would love to see a sequel but I don t think that will happen Maybe we ll see this character again in the upcoming Justice League film I rate this film 8 10,8.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2757352/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2011,Superhero movie done to my taste,What I loved about this movie is that it was like the superhero movies of my youth 1990 2000 Sure it was predictable and cheesy but that s exactly what I wanted But also its smart where I wanted it to be and had a lot of important messages for the upcoming generation Carol was not fooled by the eye mask for example and reacted convincingly to the situation and Hector s comment on how its unfair for him to get the job with the alien when there are people more qualified than him and that have waited their whole lives for an opportunity like that is something that wouldn t have happened just a few years ago The movie introduced all the important characters and laid out all the points important for the story I m really looking forward to the sequel,10.0,5.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2536302/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,"10 Years Later, I Still Don't Understand...",I still don t understand why this movie is so loathed It s not amazing but it s certainly not terrible Some parts are a little goofy but you get at least a couple of those in even the best comic book movies The acting is good the story is fun and the special effects are really good I remember walking out of the theater when it came out thinking it was pretty cool I watched it casually a few times since then and every time I keep looking for something to justify the beating the critics gave it and I just can t find it I would argue aside from the Christopher Nolan Batman movies it s actually one of the better DC movies I d be stoked if they made a sequel,8.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7167169/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2021,Deadpool Lite,Just right fun diversion not too heavy not without cool fantasy action effects Easy on the eyes and the brain you can just lay back and be well entertained unless you have to compare it to the comic book or other superheros It stands on its own for entertainment s sake Even so its hard to shake Deadpool off of Ryan Lively s got the looks but was a tad over done up overplayed Robbins as a slimey politician in this always enhances the cast,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7614227/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2011,Awesome!,The critics can go to hell There s no way this film deserved the slagging off it got from the critics It was fun it was exciting and I was damn proud to see Hal up on screen Ryan Reynolds did a great job of playing GL and Mark Strong was even better as Sinestro Hector Hammond was suitably creepy and Parallax whilst completely different from the comics was nicely translated to the screen The cgi Is nowhere near as bad as people make out Tomar Re and Kilowog being prime examples although the Guardians did look a tad ropey however but that s a small problem THAT CAN BE SOLVED IN THE SEQUEL I must have blinked and missed the John Stewart Guy Gardner cameos but not the extra bit at the end of the first set of credits If you re wondering whether or not to go and see this ignore the critics and make up your own mind It was brilliant Now a sequel please Featuring that OTHER corps,10.0,18.0,27.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446415/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2011,"In brightest day, in blackest night, Horrible movies like this Shall escape my sight",In brightest day in blackest night Horrible movies like this Shall escape my sight First I will like to say this movie is nonsense not well scripted and sometimes dull the comic relive scenes lacked the relive it is suppose to offer and the intrigue was drowned in the dialogue Let s not even go to the screenplay which looked like a whole mumbo jumbo of clich s stolen from the super hero movies we love and all mysteriously rolled in to one and what do we get from this Martin Campbell the director latest a bunch of crap A super villain which looked like a puff of smoke a large puff if I may add was suppose to bring the end of the world but Hal took care of it Making the villain my top worse villain ever DC has been struggling with hero movies they have Batman and Superman locked down no doubt but after that this was supposed to be the next best thing but ended up turning out to be the worse I think the director confused recklessness and showing lack of safety with lack of fear which Hal Jordan is known for The movie had a promising start until like after the first 5 minutes where we see a dying green lantern elect a new one Hal he gives him the ring and we get to see Hal produce things conjuring them from his mind e g giant hammers machine guns race cars The character Hal is a Test Pilot with serious Daddy issues well dead daddy issues Well let me say after the huge budget penned down for this intended masterpiece you will expect hey 200 million worth of good looking aliens not Star Trek rejects We see Hal flying around and I ask myself why have I been waiting anxiously to see this movie,4.0,5.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446485/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Excellent adaptation,Don t listen to the negative remarks This is a great movie I ve been a long time Green Lantern fan and the story line is a great adaptation from the comics Yeah there are little things about the acting and writing but they are overshadowed by the excellent story This movie is well worth your time and money The origins and background are spot on I was glad the movie was built around the Green Lantern Corp It is important to know that there is more than one Green Lantern They did a really good job of showing Hal s personality My wife even liked this movie There is not dull moment The momentum of the story keeps you from being bored,9.0,79.0,148.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445044/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2011,Star Wars Cantina Meet Catwoman... a near incoherent mess of a film.,This entire movie looks like a spin off of the Star Wars Cantina scene much like the Ewoks movie a generally bad idea General audiences loved Star Wars because of the heart and story Cutting that but focusing on the wild video game quality of the Green Lantern characters and crazy universe is as bad of an idea as possible for a summer film General Audiences are going to ignore this film in droves The ones that do take a flyer will savage it and word of mouth will be awful from the non fanboy non super sci fi crowd Trust me it s a bad and near incoherent mess of a film What s really sad is the fact that the movie itself seems to be one big parody of the sci fi genre The film s laughably bad because the dialog is one long joke and the live action cartoonish stuff never rings true They try to inject humor and even sentimentality where there s really no place for it at all Even as a live action cartoon this film just doesn t work,0.0,29.0,75.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2443807/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2011,At least it looks pretty,Well I liked the cast Lively Reynolds Strong unrecognizable and Saargard were trying hard with what they were given and I wonder what went through Robbins mind when he read the script which might have been as agonizing to read as it is sitting through some of most terrible lines ever in a DC comic based action film At times I felt like I was sitting in a very unimaginative school production of a famous play There were moments that fell between laughable and excruciating The cast had good chemistry and the special effects were better than average but those dreary lines The previews were varied with some truly hinting at the mess the movie could have been and there were moments were I thought we were going to be treated to an action fantasy filled extravaganza Thor proved to be a lot of fun X Men delivered so far and even down to Earth crash feasts like Fast Five have given us plenty be excited about at the movies In Lantern the disembodied villain never quite provokes any sort of reaction in the audience as we can t figure what his motivation is We can t quite understand what IT is but we have to assume it is angry and dangerous and the mutant creation on Earth delivers a couple of lines that are supposed to satisfy our curiosity about his dislike of the main character Sloppy attention of details works like a cancer through this film and takes away from whatever attempts Reynolds who is goofy and likable gives the movie It was fun to see Lively having some fun in the screen though she doesn t quite reach the confidence Paltrow and Johanson have achieved in similar roles Ironman I and II Angela Basset looked well a bit uncomfortable playing a role that should have suited her very well I must admit green is not my favourite color and it tends be associated with malignancy and evil but the film does tell you that emerald green is the essence of the will thus we have to go along with the premise but there is something about the color scheme of the movie that keeps her from being more beautiful and entrancing My mind kept wandering back to jewels like The Dark Knight where nothing looks relatively spectacular but somehow it feels dynamic foreboding exciting full of emotions we are supposed to have in this type of film Last year Inception gave plenty to enjoy visually Here there is plenty of damage to the entire canvas and the enjoyment is sort of muted If the film spawns a franchise and we have more returns from the same cast let s hope that just like the Hulk it finds its rhythm its heart and we re treated to a true spectacle to a fun time and to an episode where we really care and want to cheer the hero as he fights a worthy opponent Maybe I m expecting too much but I yearn for the visuals of that man flying faster than a speeding bullet or the ominous notes and visuals of the psychologically scarred knight It feels like this character deserved much better whatever its original goal might have been Yes it failed but at least it looks pretty,3.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451221/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,Beware my power... Green Lantern's light!,Saw this movie last night with my girlfriend and two friends I m a comic book fan in general and know of and about the Green Lantern the same for one of my friends the other friend is an avid comic book fan who knows the ins and outs of the stories and characters and my girlfriend knows nothing at all about The Green Lantern OK now that bit of information is out the way on with the review the movie was awesome My girlfriend a total novice to do with The Green Lantern enjoyed the film understood what was going on learned about the characters and generally thought it was a great movie My comic book guy friend thought the film was good and didn t ruin the Green Lantern in any way My other friend enjoyed the film and so did I The actors are all top notch and put in great performances the story was solid and easy to follow slight spoiler ahead although more scenes on the planet Oa and with other Lanterns would have been good end slight spoiler Personally I thought the film could have been abit longer but they managed to cram allot into the running time just some scenes seemed to jump from one thing to another with no real continuity I was also surprised at what was shown there were allot of deaths and violent scenes which I didn t expect considering the film is a 12A in the UK however the scenes were not unnecessary or done for shock value I saw the film in 3D and thought it really fit the film It made good use of the 3D and wasn t just a gimmick I honestly think seeing this film not in 3D would be strange the 3D totally adds to the immersion of the film All I can say is take no notice of the bad reviews the press have been printing about this film The Green Lantern is a good comic book movie a good summer action adventure movie and just generally a good movie,10.0,8.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445909/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2016,No amount of willpower can rescue the Lantern corps from Hollywood meddling.,Poor Green Lantern I love this character and I had high hopes that fans would finally get the real life action flick we ve been dreaming for but alas what we got was a watered down rather lackluster affair that shamelessly squanders a fairly decent first half by turning against itself in the second half Fortunately this isn t a total loss or a bad movie per se it s just had bad things happen to it Basically Green Lantern is fairly decent with great action sequences and they do get a lot of things right with this the character names their appearance the oath the way a Green Lantern is chosen and a bevvy of other random Lantern comic mythology that had the ability to carry this from good to great unfortunately the DC universe and its fans gets screwed over again by the powers that be that just can t leave well enough alone and stay on the ride all the way to the end Instead of needlessly going into the story of what Green Lantern is what he does and what he stands for there are multitudes of comics for that the way the villains were presented in this was extremely poor and everything they are about was virtually garroted by the writers and execs and it just left me dumbfounded Why only do 50 of a job well if you can t be bothered going all the way The 2 main antagonists in this are Parallax and Hector Hammond Firstly Parallax is an entity that is the embodiment of fear and largely looks like a huge parasite it s not a large octopus shaped cloud with a bloated face All they needed to do was Google some Parallax images and create it It s not hard to do but Hollywood loves spending money in all the wrong places so they can skimp on accuracy Secondly Hector Hammond was never a scientist he was a petty criminal that stumbles across meteor fragments while on the run from the law Later he s exposed to the meteorite and this causes his abnormality and superior intellect Not leftover Parallax fragments I never saw the need to change Hector s story it wouldn t have made a shred of difference to the outcome of his showdown with Green Lantern and then he s killed off by Parallax anyway That was yet another moment where I m left scratching my head trying to figure out why you would have that happen Lastly one of the biggest bug bears I and many others had with this was the pulsating bright green suit Many images of Green Lantern show him with a bright green outline particularly when he s flying in space I ve never known the character to have a suit that glows and pulsates when he s just standing around Why mess around with a classic It reminded me of something out of Tron As much of this movie is CGI you re left wondering where and how they managed to spend 2 hundred million on this While the effects are good they re not great and certainly not anything we haven t seen before The fact that this only barely made back its budget plus just enough for a small coke and bus fare home is not hard to imagine as it was largely panned by critics and fans alike so it never enjoyed the repeat cinema viewings It s a shame really but having the idea of adding your own flava can have the same effect as a chutney squishee no one wants to drink it and if you do you re just left with a bad taste in your mouth,6.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3541931/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2014,It's Not Easy Being Green Lantern,Lame attempt to make a DC version of Iron Man I m not a huge fan of Green Lantern to begin with but the character of Hal Jordan in this movie does not resemble the Hal Jordan I knew My brother is a much bigger Green Lantern fan than I am Needless to say this suckfest disappointed him greatly Ryan Reynolds plays himself as he is wont to do in nearly every role Blake Lively is absolutely horrid She was undoubtedly forced onto the filmmakers by WB who wants badly for her to be an A list actress Let s hope things never get that far Mark Strong does OK as Sinestro though the problems with the special effects hurt his performance The rest of the cast is forgettable The special effects are abysmal and this is the most surprising part of this movie The CGI is so poorly rendered particularly in scenes that require humans to interact with CGI aliens and landscapes this movie may as well be classified as at least half animation Kind of like Who Framed Roger Rabbit except terrible The action scenes are uninspired The script is awful and rife with clich s The direction is lackluster Low point of Martin Campbell s career I d say it s the low point of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively s careers as well but who are we kidding Green Lantern as a concept could make for a really good movie Hopefully after enough years have gone by that the pissy taste of this movie is gone from our mouths they will try again and get it right Just don t make a juvenile mess heavy on poor special effects and light on intelligence Also while we re at it try to get an actor who can keep his damn shirt on for five minutes,3.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3009926/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2011,Everything one hopes from a Summer blockbuster.,Well I was one of those lucky enough to be in the advanced screening for this movie Being a GL fan the bashing it was subjected to whether it was criticism for the tone among numerous others I had my reservations But being a fan of Geoff John s work the genius that s Martin Campbell I decided to give it a chance This is perhaps the best superhero movie since Superman 1978 Yes I know there s Spiderman The Dark Knight and many others but GL is the proper summer superhero spectacle The doubtful superhero who lives up to become the legend he s destined to be the ideal lady love and the textbook super villain Green Lantern reminded me of how my Dad narrated me about viewing Superman on the big screen Ryan Reynolds is the ideal superhero which is refreshing to see after so many self doubting self loathing superheroes the rival studios have put on the big screen Peter Sarsgaard s performance is nothing short of spectacular which is amazing What was most surprising is how good Blake Lively s Carol Ferris is giving an emotional subtext to a 2D character is tough but Lively does it with ease Fans won t be disappointed When Warner s declared they needed a franchisee to replace Harry Potter GL is a viable one I was skeptical Now not so much 9 10,10.0,27.0,54.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444023/?ref_=tt_urv

Deserves all the venom it has generated.",Green Lantern is a convoluted mess that has rightfully received venom from every film critic Most are getting it right and correctly labeling it trash This director isn t a filmmaker he s a disc jockey I can t believe a movie with this type of cartoonish action which makes about as much sense as a drunken Swedish prostitute is getting even one good review This thing is utter nonsense that can t and shouldn t be appreciated on any level Green Lantern wants to be taken seriously at least at times It has aspirations of being something better but the subject material simply won t let it A talking gold fish alien man imparting wisdom and a villain that looks like a poo cloud with a cartoon head for heaven s sake Then it shelves the fun and is a terrible mix with dull results It s like they threw everything at the screen in hopes that something would stick A funny line attempt here a bad but brief CG action sequence there a dull turn everywhere Not fun enough not funny enough and not smart enough it s caught in no man s land The writers of this thing deliver a predictable hackneyed and astonishingly unentertaining script This one is truly as bad as most are saying and deserves all the venom it has generated,0.0,7.0,17.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446372/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2011,"Quit it with the hate, this film is pretty good.",Looking back how does Green Lantern stand the test of time now that comic book films are starting to be taken seriously It s obvious that Green Lantern isn t going to stand up against the modern collective of Dark Knight Man of Steel and The Avengers because already production values are insanely improved and so are special effects not to mention acting or writing Having taken Green Lantern with a pinch of salt because I can still accept Christopher Reeve s Superman over today s generation of heroes I immensely enjoyed it knowing that it was going to be a standalone movie In ways apart from the wacky cartoony animation and MWAHAHAHAHAHA I M GOING TO DESTROY THE WORLD kind of villains because Marvel would never do that LOL Lantern was oddly enough an actual light shining back on Reeve s original Superman The Movie It didn t need to be taken seriously back then it just needed to be a superhero movie people could enjoy as a superhero movie Damn No pleasing some majority audiences huh Take all the basic elements of Green Lantern and separate them What do you have Superhero with a unique power Check Science fiction featuring world destroying monsters like back in the 50 s Check because Green Lantern was introduced in 1960 so how faithful please Aliens and government crackdowns on green men and psychic people with big heads Check lets throw in an X Files vibe There s three reasons to appreciate the effort put into this film and I for one do appreciate it The portrayal of Hal Jordan as a reckless test pilot who needs to overcome his fears thus becoming the protector of his own galaxy sector is a great contrast to Superman who is a hyper competent alien who is in danger of destroying whole planets I think they also got that right which is why they need Reynolds back as Hal Jordan for the Justice League collective Green Lantern despite its operatic drama and villainy is meant to be enjoyed not taken seriously and as much as it has faults and can be totally silly at times I think the movie deserves credit and credit is overdue,8.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2508204/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,A Subpar Movie...,First I should say that I m a fan of Green Lantern and he s Hal Jordan my favorite DC character Here s why I thought this movie was subpar 1 Ryan Reynolds was a horrible Hal Jordan Before I saw the movie I thought this was a poor casting choice but thought he could potentially pull it off a la Michael Keaton Batman Unfortunately he did not pull it off Ryan Reynolds is a comedic actor and that s how he portrayed Hal Jordan who if you read the comic book is not a jokester at all It almost felt like Hal Jordan was Peter Parker 2 The origin of the Green Lantern character took way to long to develop The two thirds of the movie was very boring 3 Wrong choice of villains Hector Hammond Really They couldn t come of with a better villain than Hector Hammond I know that it was almost impossible to use Sinestro as the villain in the first movie as it would have taken too long to tell GL s origin and why Sinestro went bad all in one movie then have Sinestro be the final fight at the end the movie would have felt rushed but instead of Parallax and Hector Hammond they could have went with Atrocitus who they killed Abin Sur in the revised Origin of GL or even the Manhunters who were the reason why the Guardians created the GL Corps in the first place Anything would have been better than Hector Hammond and Parallax 4 The special effects were garbage As in the 1st Superman movie with Christopher Reeves I DID NOT believe that a man could fly when I watched Green Lantern The flying sequences looked very cheesy as well as the constructs that the GL s created Also every scene had a CGI feel to it especially GL s body It looked like they pasted Ryan Reynolds live head onto a CGI body AWFUL 5 The ending was the worst ending I ve ever seen in a movie I mean seriously just toss Parallax into the sun I mean Sinestro or the Guardians couldn t have thought of that How did Hal Jordan know that that would kill him 6 Parallax looked like a joke a big Giant head really That s the best that they could come up with AWFUL 7 Green Lantern went to Oa to learn how to be a Green Lantern He quits before he s even had one day of training and goes back to Earth where somehow he s able to master the use of his power ring really I mean come on Parallax defeats and kills one of the best Green Lanterns Abin Sur per Sinestro and defeats Sinestro and about 7 other Green Lanterns but somehow with not even a full day s worth of training Hal Jordan is able to defeat Parallax Makes no sense With all of the above being said the movie had one bright spot which was Sinestro He was PERFECTLY cast a la Heath Ledger Joker Unfortunately we didn t get to see enough of him,4.0,44.0,87.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445413/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2011,Never read the Comic Books But Watched the movie,I just finally watched the extended version of the movie And it took me this long to get to it because i like many other people heard it sucked That could be further from the truth I kinda regret now not watching it in the movie theater and supporting the film Just goes to show should not listen to what everyone else has to say Guess some die hard comic book fans were not to happy about it But i say it was just good fun One thing that threw me off from watching it originally was the on the TV commercials it appeared like the CGI was just awful Maybe the could have left that part out of the trailers But after watching the movie i now see i was wrong Being that i had never read any Green Lantern comics i did not understand that the Green Lantern Outfit was more like a skin and not a costume ala superman batman flash So from the trailers my misconception of the Green Lanterns look was that it was just a bad case of a CGI outfit which it isn t So just Watch it yourself and make your own decision,7.0,4.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2497902/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2011,Ridiculous film with a ridiculous choice of lead role.,This film was terrible I could not believe they ve picked Ryan Reynolds to play Green Lantern he belongs in rom coms And that is what he almost turned this into the comedy played far too big a part in this What little faith I had in Reynolds as playing this role was shattered very quickly he simply is not made for serious movies Though this film isn t exactly serious it isn t exactly a comedy either Mainly though the story line was completely flawed The whole thing just seemed like bits of filler taken from other films and clumped together Nothing was properly explained like why didn t the evil guy have a body Why was he telekinetic if he didn t have a stupid ring Why is fear yellow Whenever they mentioned the yellow power of fear I felt like I was watching kids play with action figures making up a stupid story off the top of their heads And the fact that all Green Lantern needed to do was say the vow then become super powerful and cunning to kill this thing Being a superhero movie I was hoping for more Earthly heroics It was just ridiculous The whole immortal thing was stupid as well Seemed again like they just couldn t come up with an idea so they just thought ah whatever a load of unoriginal aliens sat in really high seats at the top of a really high building who have infinite knowledge but then get proved wrong That sound okay There was just not enough detail to any aspect of this film There was genuinely nothing I enjoyed about this film being a teenager lets me sort of enjoy a film if there s good fighting or action in it even if I know the film is awful Like 300 But this simply offered me nothing Absolutely awful Save your money,1.0,30.0,59.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2452440/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2012,Partly enjoyable,Though I generally consider Martin Campbell as a potent director this one Lacks direction and also dives into awkwardness several times All this peaking into an intellectual dead zone at a finale while of course swimming in screen saver CGI As a personal opinion I might add though producer raped GreenLantern felt more like a movie then I expected It s not good but to be fair it also isn t the worst Superhero movie ever created I contribute this fact to Ryan Reynolds who surprisingly is not the weak spot of this flick and considering the little he s given to work with actually does a good job adding an emotional dimension to the movie After Marvels latest concept work I am also grateful for any kind of action scene and especially ones featuring some kind of imagination and choreography 5 10,5.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2613405/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2011,"Better than was expected, but must be. treated as the start to a bigger story",The danger here was always going to be the decision whether to throw all the eggs in the basket and hit us with the best green lantern has to offer in terms of powers and his ultimate nemesis or to play it slowly and open up a potential franchise The writer s here obviously wanted to make an attempt at the latter and i thought it was a commendable effort even if it did sometimes feel like it was labouring in places and rushing in others Its hard to put a finger on exactly what they did wrong they certainly got more right than other films in this genre recently and have brought another superhero to the big screen which should be and sort of is a good thing First off i like Ryan Reynolds as an actor he has a good ability for comedic turns and yet also able to bring emotion to his roles In this role he was promoted in the build up to its release as playing the character more straight and less his usual sarcastic persona we have seen before And yet still it felt like he hadn t fully shed it like any moment he was going to slap in a deadpan remark The film is VERY CGI heavy and this deliberate call does influence how you will take this film on board To me it was not only a necessity to bring us the green lantern as he should be but it also made the scenes where he wasn t on this planet run a lot smoother But I m also aware that people out there hate CGI effects so if you are one of them this really isn t for you The storyline played out well it managed to bring us a back story of sorts to why Hal Jordan is the way he is and even fleshed him out a little bit with a scene showing some family time for him but its in and around here that elements seem to niggle away at me as the pacing cant make up its mind At times a moment lingers almost too long before we are then yo yoing between plot points until they have felt like they have given us a full enough picture to it all When the green lantern side of it comes into play they manage to calm the film down a little while cranking up the action They find good time to show training and learning about it all before putting into play the villains and forcing the finale upon our hero with plenty of opportunities to show personal growth in more than one of the characters What i will say to conclude is go into this with an open mind to enjoy a superhero film ignore any preconceptions you might have had about the trailer because it seems a lot of us felt that trailer was mediocre at best What i found after the film was that it had felt very much like a good foundation film to a trilogy or at least a 2 parter putting in place the origins and some subtle plot lines that seem to be loose ends now but will obviously come into play in a major fashion should a sequel or two be commissioned So go into this expecting to see the first film in a franchise enjoy what they start and then expect to either feel hungry for more and on a grander scale or realise this isn t the franchise for you and move on happy in the knowledge the film didn t drag on forever nor did it try to explain things to death,7.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2460049/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Green Lantern,I just want to say that I thought this movie was epic The visuals were totally believable the acting was really great and the story was entertaining Ryan Reynolds plays such a good depth of character he totally makes me believe his emotions and forces me to empathizes with him and root for him all the way I did feel the movie was a bit rushed he only had like a 2 minute training course and a line at the end was Can I train them or can I train them This was a really stupid line as he didn t have much training at all The one true thing I find fault with is the fact that no one is really shocked at the fact that there are aliens a corp that will and fear can be turned into rings and used as forces of good and evil Everyone just rolled with it I have a hard time swallowing how nonchalant everyone is about this and a senator not a president I don t get that part but whatever,9.0,15.0,24.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444690/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2011,"Very Good. It could have been better, but it is a very promising start to a franchise",Very good movie Now it had its flaws but overall I thought it was very enjoyable It was faithful to the comics overall and only deviated in some aspects And it seemed to embrace some silliness and the colorful otherworldly aspects of the source material which is a refreshing change from all of the dark and overly moody superhero flicks that Marvel and even DC itself to some extent has been churning out recently Not to say that this movie isn t serious in some parts Lets see where to begin The Story SPOILER ALERT First the good Overall I think the movie did a very good job of introducing the character of Hal Jordan and conveying his origin The two villains that were a part of this movie Parallax and Hector Hammond were both interesting and presented a lot of action and drama for Hal in the story Okay first is Parallax who is introduced as the main villain of the film Now in this version of the character he is more so an amalgamation of Krona and Parallax than the actual Parallax which I wasn t so happy about but I thought the way they did it was somewhat interesting He proved to be a formidable opponent for Hal as a fledgling Green Lantern and the scenes that he was in had me on the edge if my seat even if he did look somewhat cartoon like Second is Hector Hammond which I liked more than Parallax In the movie they did stray from the comics a little in terms of his origin but only in the fact that they made it so that his powers originated from being exposed to Parallax and not from being exposed to meteorite as in the comics I loved him He was just so calculating and maniacal and not in a way that was clich but seemed fresh and original And Peter Sarsgaard was just so good in the role he was just so good at being creepy it seemed like he was made to play Hector Hammond It did take a little while for the story to get off the ground because they had to give the back story of the character and they sort of jumped from scene to scene quickly to set up decades of Green Lantern mythology but once it did it progressed really smoothly and proved to be an example of dynamic storytelling Now the bad So there were some things that I found flawed in the story line First was the romance between Hal and Carol which seemed just overly angst ridden and clich And basically it was the same scene replaying itself until the ending On the bright side Blake Lively was better in the role of Carol than I would have thought and actually did a decent job of portraying a serious businesswoman Second in some parts it was very campy and that sort of took me out of the serious tone that I was getting into However that could be taken as a good thing and it did provide some self deprecating humor that gave the audience a good laugh The Effects OK on this part believe me ignore what the critics are saying The effects were AMAZING a bit cartoon like in some parts but that s kind of what I expected The effects were just so well done and gave the movie and action scenes which were fantastic such strength I even found the scene with the imagined race car track to be very cool The Acting Okay so overall this was a strong cast Reynolds Strong and Sarsgaard were all exceptional in their roles But there were some weak links Lively being one of them She was decent in the role but she still came off as somewhat needy and shallow and the character suffered because of it Since I already went over Sarsgaard I m just going to skip to the other two Reynolds was very good in his role He added some grounding humor which counteracted some of the otherworldly sci fi fantasy and surprisingly he was impressive in portraying a character with fears of inadequacy who rises to the occasion to become the hero which was kind of corny but I have to say that the inner comic book reader in me liked it Last but definitely not least Mark Strong was absolutely amazing as Sinestro He portrayed all of the traits that make the character of Sinestro so cool the pride condescension and lust for power It was all there in his performance And that end scene with him can anyone say sequel Conclusion So overall The movie was no Iron Man or the Dark Knight but it was still very enjoyable in its own respect I thought the action scenes were very compelling and done extremely well It was only some problems with the story and the need to set up the lengthy history that dragged it down from being on par with Iron Man or TDK When you go in there don t expect a traditional superhero story where this guy with his unique abilities or his self made skills chooses to use said abilities skills to take down the bad guy Think of it as an average man who has been chosen for something and has it thrust upon him And I know that that may sound a bit clich but when you think about it we haven t really had one of those stories come to us on the big screen in a while As for what to expect in terms of fantasy and storyline think Superman 1978 mixed with dashes of Iron Man and Thor It is worth seeing and definitely worth a sequel if only to strengthen some of the weaknesses that this one had I m giving it an 8 5 out of 10 not perfect but a very promising start If you re a fan of Green Lantern you ll love it once it gets through the explanatory

18 June 2011,A worthy origin story and a fine beginning to the series,As a longtime fan of the Green Lantern stories I hoped that the promise of the writers to respect the story line was not just something said to placate the fans They weren t lying and they didn t screw it up The movie is a retelling of the standard Hal Jordan origin story which has been told so many times before First we establish Hal as a skilled pilot always in trouble for not following established procedures He is summoned against his will to a crash site where he is given a technological NOT mystical power ring by a dying alien Soon after that he is summoned to planet Oa where he meets fantastic aliens and is trained to be a Green Lantern At first the other Lanterns doubt his skill and commitment but his tendency to think outside the box allows him to defeat a powerful enemy and win the admiration of the entire Corps This same story has been told in slightly different ways in the comics on TV in animated films and now in a live action movie And the movie did not disappoint Ryan Reynolds was excellent as Hal Jordan In interviews prior to the movie he said that he understood the importance of respecting a character that has been loved for more than fifty years by millions of fans worldwide That respect came through loud and clear in his portrayal of Hal Mark Strong as Sinestro was a joy to behold He did a masterful job of acting making the character totally believable Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond was wonderfully wacky bone chillingly evil when combined with Parallax and I wish he could return somehow for another engagement When a killer laughs while doing evil deeds he takes the audience completely out of their comfort zone Very nicely done sir Blake Lively was good as Carol Ferris although she didn t seem to have much to do And that s not a bad thing since the movie was mostly about Hal and the Corps I m sure we will be seeing more of the lady code named Sapphire in future movies She was given a great line at a point where Hal expressed doubts about his ability to be a Lantern due to his fear She said that it s not about being without fear it s about overcoming fear and Hal was good at that It s what a power ring always says to a Green Lantern candidate Hal Jordan of Earth you have the ability to overcome great fear Welcome to the Green Lantern Corps Speaking of the ring that is one of the few minor criticisms of the movie The power ring although not alive can speak to the ringbearer It can report the percent of its power remaining warn the ringbearer of approaching danger or provide the results of a scan Maybe Hal didn t have enough training to bond with his ring telepathically because all it seemed to do was produce a vibration sound like a pager The ring has a voice We want to hear it speak Another quibble about the portrayal of the ring is that normally a ringbearer in space will be surrounded by a force field In the comics and cartoons this is usually shown as being right next to the ringbearer s skin In the movie it was shown as a dispersed electrical field around the ringbearer but in the final scene in space four Lanterns are shown hovering with no shield at all Maybe this was just a continuity error but they would not have been able to breathe without the ring s help The final small nit pick is about the theme song There wasn t one I wanted to hear a stirring and heroic Green Lantern Theme that would stick in my mind enough that I would be humming it on the way out of the theater But instead of that there was generic orchestra music Think Superman and Superman Returns or Star Wars or even Ghostbusters The Green Lantern Corps needs a theme song Now for the kudos There were early complaints that the fans wanted to see the trademark Green Lantern uniform with black sleeves and pants legs green boots and body suit and white gloves and that an all green uniform didn t look right But since the uniform is created by the power ring it makes sense that it would not be static like a uniform made of dead cloth but instead would be pulsating with power The chest symbol was lighted and Abin Sur s light went out when he died and when Hal used his ring the power was shown to be flowing from the chest symbol down his arm to the ring The uniform works The special effects and CGI were excellent Some of the flight scenes reminded me of flying around Second Life as a Lantern This could have been a great disappointment but instead it was a joy to behold And by all means watch the movie in 3D Unlike Avatar where only a few of the scenes were in 3D every scene in this movie has a 3D aspect to it The opening scene all by itself has a jaw dropping effect and is enough to rivet the audience s attention At times there was almost too much action going on like the scene at the party where people are running and screaming and Hal is using his power ring to protect everyone It appeared to me that some partygoers were squashed but they weren t That scene will need to be watched again when the DVD comes out The few minor quibbles only slightly detract from an excellent Hal Jordan origin story I hope the Green Lantern franchise makes a billion dollars and a hundred sequels It s the finest comic book character around and a great role model for kids,10.0,9.0,14.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445543/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,A checklist movie,Green Lantern certainly isn t terrible by summer super hero standards Unfortunately you can tell right away that this is a checklist movie Before a single word of the script was written a bunch of people sat around and decided on a whole litany of things that had to be in the film And worst of all for a long running fictional character Green Lantern was subject to a reverse chronological checklist The heart of the film comes from what s been in the comic book over the past 10 years then they throw in some stuff from the 90s and then some stuff from the 80s and by that time the story barely has room for either a serviceable plot or the original Silver Age stalwart Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is a test pilot who is given a power ring by a dying alien and inducted into the Green Lantern Corps an intergalactic police force created by the Guardians of the Universe An ancient enemy of the Guardians called Parallax is on the rampage and it falls to Hal to stop it from destroying the Earth In addition Hal s got to contend with his ex girlfriend and boss Carol Ferris Blake Lively and another old friend Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard who winds up infected by Parallax and becomes a mutated and mentally super powered bad guy A bunch of other alien Green Lanterns waft through the movie largely as scenery and it all winds up with an epilogue that reveals that this film is essentially a prequel with the story that should have been in this one set up for the next one if there ever is a next one The good things about this motion picture are the special effects and the performances of Blake Lively and Peter Sarsgaard They do better than usual versions of the super hero s girlfriend and his evil rival even though their roles are probably written a bit worse than usual Ryan Reynolds tries hard but can t salvage much from the wreck this script makes of Hal Jordan He may be a DC creation but I can only describe this movie s version of Green Lantern with a Marvel Comics reference They ve tried to cast Hal as equal parts Johnny Storm and Peter Parker That sounds like a bad idea and proves to be one on screen What cripples this movie is that getting to every item on its preconceived checklist takes so long and requires so many hoops to be jumped through that the story is just fat and laggard with no personal or thematic conflict ever able to do more than sputter and fume It doesn t help that the big fight at the end turns entirely on a bit of actual science that feels sorely out of place in a battle between a guy with a magic ring and an anthropomorphic cloud of fear energy 7 different people are credited with writing Green Lantern and it shows For a comic book character like this one without a compelling origin or archetypal metaphor a single creative voice and vision is probably what was needed Maybe that can happen in the sequel Oh wait,5.0,3.0,8.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446309/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2011,Basically Convoluted and Derivative,If there were no comic book based films like Superman Spider Man Iron Man and X Men this cinema rendition of Green Lantern would easily have wowed audiences Alas having so many superhero fantasies that have been so well fleshed out on the screen before this one looks sloppily done and derivative And with its convoluted background mythology that the film makers seem to be throwing at us instead of allowing us to experience it we are left feeling detached about the whole Green Lantern stuff And maybe feeling a little deja vu Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is a cocky test pilot who s still haunted by the death of his father in an aircraft accident After his latest stunt gets him grounded Hal finds himself enveloped by a strange green light which takes him to a wrecked spaceship where a dying alien Temuera Morrison as Abin Sur passes him a ring and tells him that he has been chosen to join an inter planetary peace keeping force known as the Green Lantern Corps The ring enables him to create anything his mind can imagine Meanwhile an evil entity known as Parallax is planning to destroy the Earth and when scientist Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard becomes infected with Parallax s powers he goes after Hal s partner test pilot Carol Ferris Blake Lively Thus Hal is burdened with the tasks of saving the universe the world and his girlfriend Although Reynolds who was picked for the role over Sam Worthington ad Chris Pine provides the requisite brash personality and glib jokes as Hal Jordan he can t shake off his own Ryan Reynolds ness to be the conflicted superhero Green Lantern Thus the sequences of his Green Lantern at the summit conference at Oa with Sinestro Mark Strong look badly contrived and phony For me the best parts of the movie are when Hal Green Lantern interacts with Lively s Carol At the media screening I attended the loudest laugh was when Carol recognises Hal in his silly green mask Indeed Lively provides more than just eye candy as Hal s sexy girlfriend and daughter of his boss Jay O Sanders she is the center of attraction whenever she appears Sarsgaard can be compelling as the accidental and tragic villain and he even manages to convey his feelings through his Elephant Man make up Tim Robbins has a cameo as Senator Hammond Hector s domineering father while Angela Bassett plays a forgettable doctor As far as action set pieces go there are a few mayhem sequences but none to beat those of Fast Five and Transformers The 3D effects are just serviceable not spectacular Basically Green Lantern is just another summer cinema fodder limchangmoh blogspot com,5.0,9.0,24.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444330/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2011,The Main Problem with This Film is the Star,The initial casting news already gave me a feeling of foreboding The trailers had warned me as much Being a fan of the Green Lantern character I still wanted to give this movie a chance to prove me wrong However much I wanted to like this movie though there is one big problem It is the star of this film Ryan Reynolds is simply wrong as Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern There is nothing wrong with Reynolds body as he is built perfectly for this superhero role However his face has that constant comic smirk and expression that simply does not jive with being Hal Jordan and especially as Green Lantern It does not look right to see Reynolds receive the ring from Abin Sur or to hear him utter the immortal Green Lantern creed I felt this was a miscasting of the highest order Nothing they did in the whole movie including the writers and the director Martin Campbell felt right because of this gravely wrong decision in casting It is certainly ironic that the rest of the casting decisions were actually quite astute I even felt that Mark Strong was not given enough to do as Sinestro that was commensurate with his intense star presence Blake Lively was beautiful and fit her role of Carol Ferris like a glove Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clark Duncan voiced Hal s GL mentors Tomar Re and Kilowog respectively very well Peter Sarsgaard was unrecognizable as creepy and nerdy Hector Hammond I think the chances for the success of this franchise are doomed from the start It already needs a reboot as early as now,5.0,8.0,32.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444301/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,"'In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil's might, beware of my power, Green Lantern's light'",Our protagonist Hal Jordan was a character that rebooted the Green Lantern storyline for DC Comics in 1960 Here the writers have remained true to his test pilot background in the employ of Ferris Aircraft and his love interest in fellow pilot and daughter of the company s aerospace mogul However of interest is the fact that our villain here Parallax is named after an evil alter ego Jordan adopted in the comic series in the 1990s having been traumatised by the destruction of his hometown Only in subsequent publications did the storyline emerge that Jordan had been corrupted by an evil cosmic entity of that name The opening sequence of this feature bravely attempts to explain the convoluted storyline behind the creation of the Green Lanterns and their battle with Parallax Yet as critic Roger Egbert noted about the film it does not intend to be plausible This is evident by self deprecating quips from our protagonist such as when trying to power up the ring which has selected him to be the next Green Lantern he offers up To Infinity and Beyond By the power of Grayskull Ebert sums up the main issue with the movie succinctly in declaring The problem with many of these special effects is that they don t take on the gravity and substance of real events they are an obvious extrusion of animation into the physical world In other words this feature does not allow its comic book hero to escape the confines of the comic book genre Director Michael Campbell who had so skilfully brought new vigour into the James Bond franchise struggled to achieve much of merit with this project This was made worse by his constant clashes on set with Ryan Reynolds who was given the role by the producers behind his back Campbell had declared his sole choice to play Jordan would have been Bradley Cooper Indeed such was the level of animosity that Reynolds prayed that the movie would be a flop so that he would never have to reprise the role As for Cooper he revealed that his opportunity to be cast was lost when having adorned a mask he unfortunately decided to employ a Christian Bale rasp This project would have challenged any director in trying to fit so much into two hours Campbell also had to contend with pre production budgetary cuts and heavy interference from Warner Brothers A lot of character development scenes were left on the cutting floor as were the fellow Green Lanterns contribution to the final battle with Parallax Campbell himself feels he should not have stepped into directing a comic book hero movie and philosophically accepts responsibility for the film s failings Success has many fathers failure has one And that s me Yet in interviews he regrets his planned ending with a street level confrontation between Parallax and four Green Lanterns was ruled out for its expense and has heavily criticised the weak script together with the studio having hacked his film to pieces At least the Jack Black starring project which would have been a comical portrait of the Green Lantern was shelved largely in response from a highly critical online reaction from comic book fans Other directors approached over the years including Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino declined the project due to the complexity of the narrative and special effects In fact many feel that from the outset the subject matter would have been better served by being cast as a TV series The aforementioned script has lots of plot holes chief amongst which is the simple fact that there is no backdrop to our Earth based villain Hector s hatred for his Senator father or his jealousy of Jordan s relationship with Carol Ferris Another issue is that the screenplay does not serve the film well in robbing our protagonist of any gravitas torn between kitsch and offering us a credible action hero Moreover laudable though the scenes are in which Jordan questions his suitability to take on the powers which have been handed to him and his ability to conquer fear these are so time consuming that the film lacks sufficient action sequences Finally there is poor dialogue on show more adolescent by nature such as when our ace fighter Jordan declares to the omniscient Guardians the reason for their failure because you re afraid to even admit you re afraid You know we have a saying on Earth We say I m only human A lot of understandable criticism was levelled at the visual effects on the movie especially in the portrayal of Parallax This billowing cloud of rage filled soul sucking gas is on such a scale that it effectively disembodies for the audience the arch villain of the piece so that the fight between good and evil lacks that physical down and dirty duel between our combatants Much criticism has also been levelled at the CGI suit worn by our hero Though one can understand why the visual effects team felt that an actual physical suit may have appeared derivative or cumbersome their reliance on CGI makes it harder for the audience to not regard our protagonist as a mere comic book figure So easy is it to discern the figure behind the mask that the writers must have been grateful for the ad lib provided by Blake Lively when she declares You don t think I would recognise you because I can t see your cheekbones In terms of the supporting cast Mark Strong does a great job with what he was given and adds real kudos to his depiction of the disapproving mentor of Hal Jordan Sinestro The latter regards the human arrival as unworthy of filling the shoes of the valiant Abin Sur whose ring has selected the reckless Jordan to defend his sector of the universe and grows increasingly frustrated at the limitations of what the Lanterns can achieve So committed was Strong to the project that he has always regretted that the critical and box office failure of this feature made the sequence hidden in the end titles suggestive of a sequel in which his character would turn to the dark side one which will never come to fruition In addition Peter Sarsgaard whatever the views are on the quality of his performance definitively captures the snivelling gross and jealousy fuelled Hector Taking on a deformed Elephant Man like appearance Sasgaard relished as he put it being the king of prostheses With regard to Blake Lively though she is perfectly cast as Carol Ferris she is underused By contrast Tim Robbins could never have been convincingly cast as Peter Saarsgard s father Ultimately this movie is saved by one factor many critical reviews overlook the pure likeability and bankability of the main actor together with the on screen chemistry between Reynolds and Blake Lively whose romance off screen would lead to marriage and children Much has been made of Reynolds glibly taking aim at this role in his later incarnation as Deadpool but even he has revisited the film in recent years and found enough positives to be less dismissive of it as a

1 May 2012,Fear and Power,After the whole alien scene and we finally get to the humans and Ryan Reynolds part we see that he is really just a regular guy that s a cocky pilot He isn t the easiest person to be around but he is good at what he does and tries to be the best and be different Once he gets the ring I feel like this is the start of trying to find out who he actually is and the something that is in him that even he can t see I really like the idea of the fear and how they showed that It s as if it means something more and then if you fall into the trip of this fear and enjoy it too much its going to take you over and you will eventually die to the fear It holds you back from what you know is right and your will is sucked right out of you and you succumb to its power There is always going to be fear in the world as we see from the very end of the movie after the credits and even tempting the idea of fear will take you over faster than you realize Having the will power and faith power is always going to win over fear and death,8.0,3.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2605511/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2015,"Not great, but better than average",So here is where my inner geek shines through I admit that I like comic books And I like movies based on comic books With that warning you know that I was predisposed to liking this movie And it did not disappoint me If you are not a fan of comic based movies though there is little here to suggest that this movie will change your mind As with most comic book movies the director walks a fine line of introducing the back story in enough detail for viewers who know nothing about the hero but not in so much detail that the rabid fan base gets bored or worse criticizes what was included and what was not Here director Martin Campbell keeps the introduction short and true to the comic book and starts the action off quickly after that Ryan Reynolds does a good job of playing the reluctant superhero straight with a sense of humor but not so much that he goes over the top veers into pure comedy CGI story and acting are all above average The movie underperformed at the box office and Mr Reynolds and Mr Campbell allegedly did not get along on the set so if there is a sequel there will be some changes to be expected among the cast and or staff Recommended for all highly recommended for fans of the comic book,6.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3166898/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2021,Entertaining Superhero Comic made flesh. A predictable premise combined with the unpredictable Ryan Reynolds.,Fantasy superhero comic books of decades past were static two dimensional escapist universes where children could learn to block out the mundane unjust mediocrity of real life The stories were unbelievable simplistic and usually had a predictable moral theme i e A child s naivety made him her the primary devotees The trend in the last two decades has been to increasingly use ever more realistic CGI in animations made flesh The CGI graphics were a bit TOO unbelievable but their execution was excellent Without attractive actors this production would have been as stodgy as the formulaic Oliver Queen played with deadpan serious looks from Season 1 Episode 1 to Season X No CGI can sustain the life of a well written series nor can impossibly good looking actors at least not for adults The only performance that saves this incarnation of The Green Lantern is due to divergence from script replacing All American comic character with an iconoclastic non stop blabbermouth Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds who introduces humor into an otherwise sclerotic script I am noticing that even though the source comic was overwhelmingly White and male Black actors are being visible as superheroes or side characters Spidey s Philippino classmate overweight friend this Green Lantern s hyper nerdy Indic or Arabic helper all they have to do is make him gay deaf blind and a veteran,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7155535/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2011,Green Lantern,From director Martin Campbell GoldenEye The Mask of Zorro Casino Royale the trailer for this superhero movie based on the DC comics the creators of Batman and Superman looked really cool I was surprised to see it rated only two stars out of five I had to see why Basically in a further part of space are the Guardians of the Universe who created the intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps and one Green Lantern Abin Sur Temuera Morrison is defeated by the evil being Parallax Clancy Brown and forced to land on the nearest planet he can Present day on Earth in the Milky Way Ferris Aircraft test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is the one who finds his body and crashed spacecraft and from his green ring he is selected and appointed as a new Green Lantern as long as he speaks the oath Under trance he manages to do this and he gains the powerful abilities the ring provides and is then whisked to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa to get his new green skin covering uniform and mask and be trained by Tomar Re Geoffrey Rush and Kilowog Michael Clarke Duncan After meeting Green Lantern leader Sinestro Mark Strong hates that Hal is human and is obviously unfit and fearful but returning to Earth he does keep the ring and lantern Meanwhile performing surgery on the body of Abin Sur scientist Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard inadvertently gets infected with a piece of Parallax s DNA causing his head to grow turn insane and for him to gain telepathy and telekinetic powers After discovering something he doesn t approve of he attempts to kill his father Senator Robert Hammond Tim Robbins but Hal is there and with the green disguise and the powers of his ring he saves many lives One of the guests he saved included childhood sweetheart and fellow test pilot Carol Ferris Gossip Girl s Blake Lively and he turns up outside her window she instantly recognises him under the disguise The second attempt by Hector to kill his father succeeds when he burns him to death and Parallax is on his way towards Earth he used to be a Guardian himself and Sinestro suggests fighting fear with fear with a new yellow ring of power But Hal stops this and he believes he can protect his home planet he manages to stop Hector injecting Carol with Parallax s DNA and obviously defeating him and he forces Parallax himself with his power into the heat of the sun where he is destroyed and Hal is now officially the Green Lantern for Earth Also starring Angela Bassett as Doctor Waller Taika Waititi as Tom Kalmaku and Jay O Sanders as Carl Ferris Reynolds is a good choice for the hero some of the other cast members are alright too the story was a bit up and down at times but the film is definitely worth seeing for the amazing special effects and some good action sequences not a bad fantasy adventure Okay,4.0,2.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451385/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2013,"Nope. Hal Jordan Was Definitely Not A Cool Dude, At All!",Possible Spoilers Ahead Did the Green Hornet I mean the Green Lantern really wear his precious little ring in his middle finger Did he really Well I don t know how you d interpret that but since we are all quite familiar with what a middle finger salute clearly indicates then I d say that whenever Lantern extended his middle finger in order to slip the ring on or off he was subtly telling all of us viewers to go shove it literally Well Hey I m sorry folks but that s the way that it came across to me And if you wanna know the truth that s precisely what I thought that the Green Lantern should have done with this frickin lame superhero movie And besides that bit of semi subliminal messaging I ask you When Green Lantern was engaged in his winner take all battle with Parallax did he really fly into this big life force sucker s mouth and then eventually come bursting out of his ass Well did he Cause that s the way that it sure looked like to me Wow Talk about giving your most hated nemesis a total Para Laxative I know that I m saying this now And I could very easily change my tune anytime in the near future But for the time being I solemnly swear that Green Lantern is the absolute last frickin movie that I m ever going to watch that has anything to do with the likes of DC Comics Sheesh I am so bloody sick to death of blasted boring superheroes and all of their ridiculous save the universe nonsense I really am You know it really killed me that out of the 6 billion people that there are living on this here planet Earth it was none other than pilot jock Hal Jordan who the puny green light chose as the one to take the oath of allegiance and become the Green Lantern Ha That was so bloody hilarious that it was utterly demented beyond logic and belief To say that this tired and trite little thumb twiddler of a movie with its staggering 200 million budget was chock full of out of this world asininity would be an understatement of the highest order Like take for instance the transformation of scientist Hector Hammond into the lunatic Elephant Man look alike Ha This screaming bubble headed goof ball s presence did absolutely nothing to improve the utterly aimless and completely predictable state of affairs that prevailed throughout Green Lantern s CGI saturated story And let me finally tell you this If things weren t already dismal enough with all of the ridiculous dialog and the crappy story line and the despicable characters Then on top of it all a frickin sniveling and insipid little love story between Hal Carol was haphazardly thrown into all of this icky mess for good measure Well that my friends was the straw that broke this camel s back Believe me this dead end romance certainly succeeded in bringing everything that Green Lantern might have had going for it which wasn t much to an immediate dead halt from which it unfortunately never fully recovered,3.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2904113/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2012,perhaps worst comic book movie ever,I didn t care for this movie First Blake Lively was horrible in this She does nothing adds nothing to the story and was by far the worst written leading lady character in any action film And the only thing Ryan Reynolds had going for him was the scene in his tidy whiteys One problem I had was how did Hal fly threw space with no oxygen and live That whole part was beyond silly to me I mean he s still human but has special powers supplied by a ring And the bad guy sucked There was nothing memorable about him FINAL VERDICT A far far cry from movies like Spiderman Batman or even the Hulk I can t recommend it,3.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2585196/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,should satisfy both comics fans and non comics fans. But I would have liked a credit for the original comics creators,My husband and I just came back from watching the movie in 2 D here in Ipswich I am a big comics fan My husband isn t but he thought on the whole the film was pretty good We both thought it was slow moving in the first half The portrayal of Hal did annoy me at first after all he wasn t that irresponsible at the start in the Silver Age comics Overall the themes were developed well and I liked how the movie followed the comics fairly faithfully I just wish the producers had given credit to the Green Lantern comics original artist Gil Kane and the original writer John Broome I did not like how the movie set up the sequel already,7.0,3.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446505/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,"Ignore the critics, ignore the cynics",After hearing all the moaning about Green Lantern I expected to see a mediocre mess Well I was pleasantly surprised This is a very good adaptation and a really entertaining film The acting is just about spot on with actors perfectly matched to their characters The story holds few surprises but it s told well with Hal Jordan s internal struggle against fear offering just enough counterpoint to the action sequences I m sure some viewers will find it too slow while others will feel it was rushed But it works if you let it My one disappointment was that Gil Kane and John Broome never mind Nodell and Finger get no screen credit This film is as much their work as anyone s Overall as comic book adaptations go I d put Green Lantern just a bit ahead of Thor and I liked Thor a lot But of course if you really want to scoff you probably will,8.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447008/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Does the Lantern outshine the other hero movies.,Does Green Lantern s Light shine above the rest The summer of 2011 seems to be the season for comic book super hero movies Already this summer we have seen Thor and X men First Class enter the movie theaters and each has provided its own spin and super hero experience This weekend Marvel s super heroes take a break while D C sends in one of their own ringers to take the reign of entertaining the audience The Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds centers on the daredevil pilot Hal Jordan Reynolds who is irresponsible immature and a daredevil willing to break the rules After a few minutes of Top Gun like flying scenes arguing with his child hood friend Carol Ferris Blake Lively and some quality time with a young nephew Hal Jordan is transported to the dying Abin Sur a purple pink alien who is evidently the strongest warrior of the Lantern Core Here Hal receives the mystic Green ring and begins his journey of becoming a galactic guardian I have to admit these first scenes were funny exciting and set up the background of Hal Jordan pretty well and kicked the movie off to a good start However it wasn t long before weaknesses of the movie begin to show After arriving at Oa the planet of the guardians we get to meet some of the other Lantern core members A variety of species of aliens which look like souped up versions of the aliens from Star Wars make up the galactic guardian force Unfortunately most of these soldiers do absolutely nothing in the movie which makes the lantern core seem useless weak and perhaps stuck up depending on how you view the movie The exceptions to the rule are Kilowag Tomar Re and Sinestro who actually show off the green ring skills in some exciting albeit short action scenes Eventually trouble in the form of Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard arises but many may not find this villain very threatening or sinister Instead Hammond s character is more of a bulb headed yellow eyed revenge seeking nerd who seems to have to go to the bathroom throughout most of his screen time My friends laughed at this villain more than cringed finding his howling moans annoying and his telekinetic abilities weak I think the directors of this movie focused more on Parallax who has been completely made over from the comics who still didn t have the most centered role in the film The menacing cloud floated more than anything but the CGI work combined with the sinister voice still makes him incredibly sinister looking and threatening So what else to say about this movie Well for one thing women will love Ryan Reynolds in this movie That classic charming and fast mouthed comedy prevails in this movie and women who love the movie The Proposal will fall in love again with him A few of the audience members were also wooing and drooling over his physique which is shown off both in and out of the uniform Guys however also get an eye treat as Ms Blake Lively shows off her beauty to the camera Her character other than being beautiful has a combination of traits that make her a dynamic character to the film instead of a typical damsel in distress which adds to the movie The man that they picked to play Sinestro was also well done as the actor Mark Strong captured that pompous arrogant and serious nature that defines the Sinestro character The other thing that I must complement on is how well the CGI work was for this movie It s not easy for one to make the powers of the Green Lantern shine but this movie did a good job at portraying the abilities of green energy without being too flashy The forging of weapons the power beam shots the generation of fists and vehicles were sharp crisp and not eye blinding which was a positive for me I do however wish there was more action and scenarios that required the use of the ring even if it wasn t Hal Jordan using the powers I still think the biggest disappointment to this movie was the fact that the other Lanterns really did nothing and showed off no advanced techniques that we ve seen in comics past Overall Green Lantern was a decent movie that was fun entertaining and visually impressive Although rushed and crammed with information that took years to establish in the comics I still think that Green Lantern had a lot of positives that will make most audience members applaud and laugh The eye candy that Reynolds and Lively provide is probably the biggest selling point of this movie and I must warn that fans of the comic series may be upset with the direction the movie took I hope that if they do a next movie as hinted about halfway through the credits the CGI work stays the same but there is a lot more involvement by the other Lanterns Overall I give this movie a 7 0 or 7 5 Recommended audience Ryan Reynold and Blake Lively fans and those who like comic book movies Audience to avoid this movie Big fans of the comic book fans looking for lots of action and anyone who gets annoyed of the stars of this movie Check back tomorrow for my take on The Art of Getting By,7.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445509/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,"Green Good, Yellow Bad",Greetings again from the darkness I have admitted many times that I am a sucker for Super Hero movies There is just something really cool about an average guy falling bassackwards into super human strength and being able to fly With that said I readily admit some Super Hero movies are better than others While this one has some entertaining moments it certainly isn t one of the better entries in this genre It is difficult to know if a viewer is better off as a Green Lantern expert or novice for this adaptation I can see both sides The film beats us over the head with explanations lectures and details but falls way short of the necessary action sequences Basic storyline has test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds chosen by the ring to become part of the Green Lantern Corps an intergalactic peace keeping patrol Yes he would be the first human Lantern and no he is not readily accepted by the leader Sinestro Mark Strong By the way who would choose a guy named SINESTRO to be the leader of your good guy patrol There are roughly a half million sub stories that get a blip and then are cast aside That s the film s biggest problem next to the shortage of action sequences Some stellar supporting actors here in addition to Mark Strong include Tim Robbins Peter Sarsgaard Angela Bassett Michael Clarke Duncan and Geoffrey Rush Duncan and Rush are voice only but definitely have an impact Blake Lively plays Carol Ferris the co pilot and would be girlfriend of Jordan She is also involved with her Daddy s defense contracting firm and just doesn t work as a high powered exec The film is directed by Martin Campbell who also gave us the near awesome re awakening of James Bond in Casino Royale 2006 He seems to have a feel for action but gets to use very little of that talent in this film It really seems to me that the writing was too scattered and just generally weak for a movie of this size I kept thinking we were going to get some real mind games between Sarsgaard s Elephant Man with psychic abilities and Reynold s perfect body Lantern Instead we get just another tease and a disappointing action sequence to end the film,5.0,3.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444919/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2012,Disappointing... To put it mildly...,For a film the relied very heavily on effects I was quite disappointed they forgot to add a plot At best it was messy and confusing and I felt quite sorry for the actors trying to cope with some truly awful dialogue I could see that there was a decent story in there trying to get out but for some reason it never did There was no mystery how can you expect an audience to embrace a character or a story if its spoon fed to them at every turn I could cite countless examples of films where half the fun of watching them is the things you don t see the pieces that are left to the imagination and that s exactly what was missing here imagination Yes it all looks fantastic but it doesn t make much sense and there is little else for the audience to cling onto Over all could have should have been much better Forget 3D concentrate on the plot PLEASE NOT RECOMMENDED My Score 4 1 10 IMDb Score 5 9 10 based on 96 176 votes at the time of going to press MetaScore 39 100 Based on 39 critic reviews provided by Metacritic com at the time of going to press Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer Score 27 100 based on 224 reviews counted at the time of going to press Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score 47 100 Liked It based on 118 336 user ratings counted at the time of going to press You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog Thoughts of a SteelMonster,4.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2638272/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,Epic Fail,I m not sure what was sadder in this film the big budget that was used to make this film or the great cast who performed terrible acting I really felt during the film that the script and the plot was written by a cheerful 7 year old comic book fan The Really funny thing was that you have thousands of green lanterns who are responsible for the protection of different sectors and who have been doing this for hundred of years but then at the end of the film its Hal Jordan who saves the day all by himself The movie was a sort of a combination of spider man and Superman and The Lord Of the Rings which did not work at all and seemed funny at times The only good Points of the film were the 3D and the visual effects which i have to admit were fantastic So in other words green lantern was a cool looking film Nothing else Overall 5 10,5.0,6.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445679/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2021,Underrated Masterpiece,One of the worst reasons I have ever hard as to why I should dislike a movie is the protagonist has a CGI suit First of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies are much more guilty of overreliance on CGI than Green Lantern is yet this movie s haters tend to be huge fans of the MCU Secondly the CGI wasn t actually low quality And thirdly and most importantly there is no good reason for me to care about that But it s different from the comics I didn t read the comics If you think that you can t have an opinion on a movie without prior engagement with the source material that s on you But the acting is bad That just isn t true The reason Hector Hammond comes across as a creep is because the actor is playing him that way Hal Jordan Carol Ferris Amanda Waller The Senator et cetera Those roles are all well acted within the film But Parallax is a giant alien space cloud Yes He is Like Galactus from Fantastic Four Rise of The Silver Surfer or Dormammu from Dr Strange Now do I like the plot Yes It s a superhero movie that s not ashamed of the fact it s a superhero movie unlike other DC Films which actively seek to avoid acknowledging that It doesn t stupidly shed secret identities the way the Marvel Cinematic Universe did And yes Carol Ferris questioning Hal s mask for its utility was funny Hal Jordan has great character evolution from pathetic coward to noble hero and a sympathetic backstory And the villainous Hector Hammond is an excellent mirror image to Hal And the movie has got great themes Effectively the only thing I disliked about the movie was its post credits scene revealing the villain of the sequel because it made no sense at all within the context of the actual film Since this is a spoiler free review I can t give details Is this movie as good as say the Dark Knight Christopher Nolan created a dark and gritty superhero franchise and as one of the more lighthearted superhero movies this is an apples to oranges comparison What about the Original Spider Man No And it s an insult to the Original Spider Man even to mention the Green Lantern movie in the same breath But is it as good as the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to which it is most similar Iron Man No It s better Much better By far I think I made my point This movie is egregiously underrated,9.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7140035/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2011,"Don't Wait, Reboot This NOW",They waited 5 years to reboot the other green comic book character Hulk I hope they don t take five weeks to decide they made a huge mistake Make that many many mistakes with Green Lantern Oh I don t know where to begin with how many things were wrong with this movie Terrible editing Shitty dialogue Unforgivably boring action sequences Tedious characters with such little depth and even less charisma A script that felt both rushed and too crowded Open ended story lines that vanish Plot holes bigger than Hal Jordan Greenie s Ryan Reynolds imagination Let s go with the movie has no heart There was nothing to hold on to I found myself caring less as the movie progressed Heck they gave us a boy Hal s nephew who I suppose we re supposed to sympathize with and he s gone within a minute to never be mentioned again Or how about the best bud Tom Taika Waititi who appears briefly and only to partially explain Greenie s situation though he does it in the most boring manner Or we can latch onto Hal who s supposed to be a top notch pilot but irresponsible human turned hero who quits wants love sometimes and gains some momentum while solving a problem that an infinite number of guards and immortal idiots couldn t even think of I ll pass on those characters So where do we normally turn when our heroes sidekicks and love interests are boring and or pathetic Ah the bad guy s Joker anyone Ha Ha ha Beyond the enormously unmotivated and uninteresting Tim Robbins as some Congressman Hammond who literally only showed up for green and a black cloud with a LOL face who was as shapeless as his character we have poor poor Peter Sarsgaard in his most embarrassing role to date And I really like Pete He has to MUST admit he s ashamed of what he did or what they made him do when he saw the finished product Barely three seconds of screen time is devoted to explaining his motivations ambitions and love triangle background with the mutual love between him and Greenie Worse his powers are presented to us but they seemed to come from thin air without much explaining or reasoning The fact he was ugly and unimaginatively constructed is only incidental to how little time they spent on a proper foe for Greenie Kinda reminded me of the laughable Electric Man villain Hulk s daddy becomes in Hulk Vol 1 The irony of this all is this is a film that s built on an imagination induced superpower and yet it lacks any imagination I ve seen the un Fantastic Four films I ve managed to get through Daredevil and even Catwoman Greenie lands solidly on the list of worse comic book make that ANY adaptation I ve ever seen Wow I made it this far without a single positive OK I m positive that if they reboot it with 99 1 less alien interference I guess you gotta have the ring granting one fine and keep Greenie grounded it might be 10 better,1.0,3.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449469/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2011,"Not as bad as, say, Ghost Rider, but pretty poor nonetheless",Disgraced aircraft pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is chosen by a green ring to be Earth s representative in the Green Lantern Corps a police force that spans the galaxy that protects the universe from evil The ring gives him the power to materialise his imagination into a green force powered by will The ring was brought to Earth by a crash landed alien Abin Sur Temuera Morrison who had in the past defeated a deadly foe named Parallax voiced by Clancy Brown who after escaping from his prison attacked Abin Sur and caused him to flee his planet Meanwhile scientist Hector Hammond Peter Sargaard son of Senator Robert Hammond Tim Robbins is brought in to perform the autopsy on Abin Sur A part of Parallax that has lingered with his corpse latches on to Hector causing him to develop telekinetic powers and a rather large forehead Green Lantern is one of those adaptation that has been thrown around Hollywood for years with many writers directors and stars named as possibilities and then dismissed as quickly as the idea came around For some films this proves a good thing An example Zack Snyder s Watchmen 2009 was a hell of a long time coming with the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger being banded round to star as Dr Manhattan But several writers and directors later it came to someone who had a passion for the material and he created something very good and loyal to the graphic novel While it was by no means a perfect film it was just about as good as one could hope from a movie adaptation of a very difficult novel In the case of Green Lantern perhaps the troublesome journey from comic book to screen was there for a reason as the finished film is pretty poor As likable as Ryan Reynolds usually is he doesn t have the charisma or the lovable rogueishness that say Robert Downey Jr has as Tony Stark in Iron Man 2008 Hal Jordan is generally unlikeable he is cocky reckless and selfish Tony Stark s arrogance makes him stand out and separates him from the mere mortals he swears to protect Jordan is seen at the beginning of the film sacrificing his wing man or wing woman the sexy Blake Lively as Carol Ferris in order to beat a rival company in a dog fight He is evidently an emotionally torn character we see this in an extremely soppy flashback which shows us how Jordan witnessed his father blowing up in front of his eyes Well boo f g hoo I couldn t ever warm to his character because he doesn t deserve his power Perhaps if his back story was served with a little less cheddar and a bit more originality then maybe I could root for him The premise that he can harness his imagination as his power is an interesting one and certainly one ripe with limitless possibility Yet director Martin Campbell Casino Royale 2006 The Mask of Zorro 1998 and the four different screenwriters seem to leave many gaping plot holes Jordan is seen throwing up fast and imaginative defences when being trained by Green Lantern Corps combat trainer Kilowog Michael Clarke Duncan yet when being faced by the giant headed Hammond everything goes out the window Hammond holds Carol as hostage when Jordan bursts in brandishing his ring the one on his finger when Hammond makes him aware that Carol is being held telekinetically in mid air with a syringe filled with what I can only imagine as poison floating near her neck Jordan appears to be helpless So why doesn t he imagine a steel wall around Carol and a giant knife across Hammond s throat Because that would be to easy and would require the writers to come with better ideas of course The film really isn t quite as bad as the critics have made it out to be It is sporadically fun and features the ever watchable Mark Strong as Green Lantern Corps leader Sinestro But the film is just so annoyingly stupid that it made me question why someone so stupid would be chosen to wield such power And the script is so bad that you can hear the desperation to try and forge some humour out of the thinly written supporting characters the comedy relief best friend is so bad the director just seems to cut him out of the movie half way through Not exactly a Ghost Rider 2007 sized pile of steaming s t but nothing to give Christopher Nolan sleepless nights DC better book up their ideas as Marvel seem to be running away with it although Marvel have yet to make a film as good as The Dark Knight 2008 www the wrath of blog blogspot com,4.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2507280/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2011,"Good, but not Great",I saw this film through two sets of eyes one as a DC Comics fan and another as an avid moviegoer As a fan of DC Comics who is familiar with Green Lantern and the Guardians of Oa it was a great thrill to see all of these characters come to life on the big screen There was plenty of action and Ryan Reynolds and cast played the roles to perfection balancing tongue in cheek with the seriousness of a world on the brink of disaster As an avid movie goer I thought this movie was rushed There are plenty of good characters but the story was rushed Perhaps if they trimmed down the exposition it would make for a sleeker film Less is more I would put this film in the same class as IRON MAN and FANTASTIC FOUR although it is the best of these three The best superhero films SUPERMAN THE MOVIE THE DARK KNIGHT X MEN are better because there is more character development You get to have time to bond with the characters Definitely better than SPIDER MAN 3 way too rushed DAREDEVIL and GHOST RIDER GREEN LANTERN has hints of character development but it is patchy at best I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than the second half Although truth be told I was very satisfied with the ending Mark Strong as Sinestro stole every scene he was in He played the role to perfection and his character seemed to be the most complex and fleshed out in the movie He has a commanding presence that does everything that character needs and more in this film Stick around after the credits I enjoyed the special effects For the most part they were excellent There were one or two scenes with GL flying that didn t look very smooth None of them were as natural as Christopher Reeve s flying Superman though Blake Lively is gorgeous and beautiful but her character is somewhat wasted in this film It started out great with a lot of tension but fell flat relatively quickly Definitely go and see this movie if you are a fan If you are not go in with expectations of a fun summer blockbuster ride and try not to think too much You will enjoy it a lot more,7.0,19.0,36.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444401/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Great comic book film,If you a fan of Green Lantern you should love this movie as I thought it truly captured the spirit of the comic I bought the Green Lantern comics back in the 60s and early 70s and this film nailed him pretty well There are also elements of more recent Green Lantern stories with Parallax and Hal Jordan s family It integrated the new elements with the old pretty well Essentially it s a super hero movie with a twist of sci fi There is far less comic relief in this movie than in most super hero films All the comedy can be seen in the previews for the most part The depiction of Parallax may be a bit silly but a little suspension of disbelief should make for a very entertaining and enjoyable film,9.0,7.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444933/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,watchable if unremarkable,Hal Jordan attempting to follow in the footsteps of his late father is a hotshot test pilot who s never realized his full potential His opportunity to do just that comes sooner than expected when he s chosen to inherit a mystical green ring that not only grants him otherworldly abilities but more importantly forces him to join a group of fearless intergalactic warriors whose mission is to fight evil and keep peace in the universe but does Jordan really possess the will it takes to succeed Comic book adaptation has a plethora of splendid visual effects some effective moments of human drama and Reynolds is effective in the lead but the story isn t very compelling and unfolds in disappointingly routine fashion,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446374/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2011,Pretty good movie - better than Thor to me.,I thought this movie was pretty good If I had read the reviewers I might not have seen it because they latched on some items and all seemed to be repeating each other There was an exposition at the beginning that the reviewers seemed to hate but it lasted only about 30 seconds I don t see what the big deal was There was a lot of action and the graphics were quite good The 3D was great there weren t any 3d thrill shots instead the 3D just made everything look a little more real While I liked the movie and my younger daughters liked it as well my wife did not she fell to sleep So perhaps it s not for everyone But I d rate this the second best superhero movie this year after X Men first class,8.0,7.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445566/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2012,Average superhero affair.,A fearless pilot is chosen by an alien ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers tasked with keeping peace within his sector he finds the responsibly maybe too much for him to handle Like Thor s 2011 Asgard the screen lights up with the scenes set in Oa featuring the Guardians and other Green Lantern Corps Notable is Peter Sarsgaard s Hector Hammond who is menacing however Tim Robbins is wasted as his father and Blake Lively as Carol Ferris is little more that eye candy that has been dressed up to be a stereo type independent woman Unfortunately the usually lively and amusing Ryan Reynolds appears miscast and his trademark quips feel forced Thankfully an almost unrecognisable Mark Strong steals every scene as Sinestro Many of the effects are finely executed especially some of the Corps monster alien characters and Abin Sur played by Star Wars Temuera Morrison is particularly memorable Director Martin Campbell successfully brings the production together making even the most mundane scenes visually interesting that said the tone feels a little off at times not sure if it wants to play out true comic book style or as a dramatic piece As far a superheros goes Green Lantern is a standard affair with its murky and shades of grey sub characters more interesting than Hal Jordan himself,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2570427/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,A sleeper.,This movie is fluff Even allowing for the comic book format the movie lacks substance This movie is geared for the pre teen audience It offers a lot of cartoon like special effects with lines spoken by cartoon like characters At no time does this movie approach the level of an adult story Every scene is dominated by all kind of flashy lights and some absurd attempts at drama This movie borrows the most embarrassing features of other comic book based movies and combines them to produce this unsatisfactory product Both Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively give good performances but really have little material to fully demonstrate their acting skills The problem with the movie is not the cast it is the way the story is presented It is apparent that the director had opted to sacrifice substance for flashiness which is okay from a marketing vantage point but makes for a superficial interpretation of a comic book story which itself is not exactly Shakespeare In short if you decide to watch this movie take along a companion to let you know what you missed while you were napping,5.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446684/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2015,"Come on, people, it's not that bad!",Ever since its release back in 2011 people have been lambasting this movie calling it one of the worst comic book movies ever made Having seen it myself I can safely say that while not a good movie by any stretch it s also not the abomination that everyone is making it out to be I love both Marvel and DC and the majority of movies and shows based on their properties The brilliant Justice League cartoon produced by Bruce Timm gave me my love for the JLA and being a huge fan of that cartoon was one of the main reasons I enjoyed this movie Not only did they get the tone of Green Lantern right but his origin story and for the most part his character too while Ryan Reynolds is not my first choice he did a decent job Besides it was refreshing to finally see a DC comic book movie that wasn t about Batman or Superman It goes to show that DC are willing to branch out and expand their movie universe and while their first attempt wasn t that solid it was a step in the right direction And yes while the movie has a ton of problems that bring it down considerably are we really gonna put it on the same level as say Catwoman Steel or Superman IV I m not trying to change your mind I m just saying that DC has thrown far worse at us If you re not a fan of the GL movie then check out the excellent Green Lantern The Animated Series you won t regret it As for the movie yes it could ve been better but it could ve been a lot worse 7 10,7.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3251048/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2016,An Honest Review,It wasn t horrible That s the best thing that can be said about it It wasn t totally horrible Ryan Reynolds was amusing certainly watchable except maybe he was doing too much of a Chris Evans playing the Human Torch sort of impersonation but that wasn t exactly bad just more of a we saw this before kind of feel The big problem is that he is supposed to be utterly fearless and that never really came across He did a bit too much complaining for someone that was supposed to be fearless BUT it wasn t horrible it wasn t as bad as people say it was You sit down and you get action and humor and you get to watch things that are actually pretty cool on the big screen There is a lot to say there mainly that it was a fail but one that was far from an epic fail,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3581257/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2013,Green Lantern - 1.5 Stars,Of all the second rate comic book movies that has occupied most of 2011 s summer Green Lantern is the only one of its crowd without a saving grace Captain America The First Avenger saw a true hero in Steve Rogers giving as much attention to his human character as with his superhuman attributes It was the goofy playfulness of Thor that made its overall silliness acceptable X Men First Class was a prequel that founded itself on prior knowledge instead of avoiding it Green Lantern doesn t have a singular thing that could make it more than what we already expect It fulfills the requisites of the superhero genre then immediately stops trying Millions of years ago long before the nuisance of 3 D an assembly of aliens called the Guardians formed an intergalactic peace keeping organization Each member called a Green Lantern was assigned to protect one of the 3 600 sectors of the universe We re not sure how many planets or galaxies each sector covers but we trust the judgment of the Guardians With the whole universe accounted for the blue big headed Guardians have decided to spend the rest of their immortal lives in a planet called Oa This peace is interrupted when a colossal evil force named Parallax figured that it would be real evil if he started to eat planets Earth and Oa are on his menu Meanwhile on Earth our central human characters who coincidentally all have daddy issues are introduced Hal Jordan is a reckless test pilot whose actions on the job are always questioned by his authorities When a severely injured Green Lantern crash lands on our planet Hal is the one chosen by the Lantern s ring as his replacement His duty later lands him in Oa where he meets the Guardians Plot details are discussed obvious questions are asked and shallow dilemmas are regarded with undeserved seriousness as a delay for the obligatory climactic confrontation like taking 90 minutes to get to a destination 60 minutes away Read more here http localmoviereview com green lantern movie review,3.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2784163/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2011,Just okay,I wish I could say that I loved it and that it makes me want to know more about Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern comics but it just doesn t Unfortunately there just seemed to be too many missteps in the movie including the pace the sound in the theater and the oh so mellow acting I m not sure I can blame the actors but I know the screenplay didn t help Unfortunately the star power couldn t do much with it Ryan Reynolds didn t have his usual comedic flare that was used comfortably for his Deadpool character in X Men Wolverine Blake Lively didn t seem lively at all and actually was quite bland Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond just didn t have much to work with as far as character development And some of the other few other Green Lantern corps members weren t shown enough to generate much interest to their characters The theater I saw it in didn t help much as the sound was surprisingly lower than what I m used to hearing You literally couldn t eat your nachos if you wanted to hear what the characters were saying Overall it was lacking in too many areas and it was just okay for me Least favorite movie I ve seen in the theater this year so far,6.0,26.0,53.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444199/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2011,Some good effects but story line is a bit weak.,You get quite a lot of different types of action and effects in all sorts of settings So its quite an all round adventure Unfortunately the story is a bit overblown and silly I m not familiar with the Green Hornet comics so maybe they were being faithful to the comics but I didn t find the story line compelling There are some draggy moments in between the intergalactic sequences At first I thought Ryan Reynolds wasn t quite leading man charismatic for the hero but the tone is light and comical so he is adequate Blake Lively is quite attractive as a brunette Compared to recent comic book hero movies I preferred Captain America Overall its worth seeing for the grand effects but the story isn t very compelling or exciting,0.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2493525/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2021,Ironically Top tree DC Movie,In my opinion DC lose the opportunity to create something great taking this movie as a start Ryan Reynolds as always great Mark s Stron character always great also The only problem I found was the transitions between scenes But as a starter of the franshise I don t se why DC didn t went forward I can put this together with Aquaman as the best DC so far,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7322302/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2011,the light ain't so bright for this lantern,i was looking forward to green lantern having its own film its a great franchise if its in the right hands sadly it wasn t this movie was ruined by cheesy writing lack of character development wrong actors and horrible acting this movie is about Hal Jordon Ryan Reynolds who is a pilot and he is a daredevil pilot and he is at a parking lot and gets flew off to a i guess pier of some kind and sees a purple alien and not once does he say oh my god a spaceship with a purple alien or even look like that so he runs to save him not freak out emotion there just sadness and gets the ring things go on and then he gets sent off to train in lantern world he leaves doesn t believe in himself that kind of stuff and well i wont say everything anyway once i found out that Ryan Reynolds was playing green lantern i thought to myself oh no not a comedy star there are some any other people that could of played this role better than Ryan Reynolds and the big villain they don t let the threat of the movie flow with the plot they just say it in the beginning of the movie which is stupid because there are two threats in the movie two villain for some reason and you ll see that in the film plus there was no character development Hal s love interest in the movie you have no idea how they met and why they like each other so much you don t hear about the past history of Hal Jordon other than his father died when he was a young buy right in front of his eyes thats sad but there s nothing else and you don t care for the love relationship between Hal and the girl and you know how there is one cheesy scene where the supporting character tells the main star what he needs to know and then the main star gets an epiphany well there were two or three of them in the movie and they couldn t get them right the only good thing about the movie was the special effects and some action special effects where very good but to much action the action was good they just replaced key parts about Hal s life that should of been in the movie with action a big mistake so i recommend not to see it,3.0,3.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448979/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2011,Green Lantern Review (may contain spoilers),For a superhero that can create anything he can imagine with his mind the Green Lantern s creative team failed to create good characters villains special effects or an overall enjoyable experience worth 11 dollars The movie starts off well enough with exciting action in space where we meet a villain capable of absorbing entire planets which comes across as a space version of the kraken used in Pirates of the Caribbean 2 not a good thing Upon being injured the greatest of all the Lanterns crash lands on Earth to begin the search for his successor After searching what seems to be 4 square miles the ring chooses the cocky and brash Hal Jordan He s sucked up in a manner similar to the game Super Monkey Ball and finds himself on the other side of town and there before him is a spaceship After an interaction of less than 30 seconds the alien Abin Sur dies leaving Hal wondering what to do next and unfortunately much of the fun dies after this point After a bar brawl Hal is whisked away to the beautiful planet Oa For how much detail design and money they put into this planet that holds all of the Lanterns they spend all of 16 minutes on it And of those 16 minutes 10 is spent talking to knock off Yodas about pointless stories and how they don t feel fear In a segment that feels very much like a video game intro to a game where they ask is it OK the way you look up and down he learns to fly by simply falling off a ledge and just knowing how to and why wouldn t he know how to fly Considering he s had these powers all his life except he hasn t At this moment the film feels like it s finally going to pick up but it doesn t He learns to imagine by getting the crap kicked out of him by a Lantern voiced by Michael Clark Duncan After all of two minutes he has mastered the art of creating indestructible things with his mind And after all of this build up he quits and goes back to earth after his feelings are hurt I wish I was kidding Here a character enters the movie for no reason whatsoever A scientist named Hector Hamond or what you will eventually know him as that guy who shrieks and screams every time he so much as stubs his toe is charged with examining Abin Sur s dead alien body by a secret government organization After examining the alien body he begins to change into a mad scientist All the large head make up and special effects in the world couldn t make him either scary or believable as a villain After this point every time someone so much as forgets the ranch he ordered with his fries he makes bad things happen to people They even go as far as giving him the disappointed in his son father figure Even though his dad got him the job to examine the alien and a promotion he still hates him Enter Hals love interest or what I like to call her attractive girl who stands around and looks pretty Clearly taking acting notes from Natalie Portman s character in Thor she is there and looks nice but doesn t really do anything important to the plot or to the movie itself She and Hal have one good scene of chemistry but other than that it s just scene after scene of her in tighter and tighter dresses Hals best friend character does nothing more than pick him up one time and then say cool when Hal shows him the Lantern suit That s literally all he does There isn t that helping the hero out as best he can in the end or anything else to add All of these distractions and pointless characters begin to add up in an origin story of a superhero with a running time of an hour and forty five minutes The music I found myself feeling that much of the music could easily have been lifted from any episode of 7th Heaven at times During the action there wasn t any swell of excitement that music should add to a film In fact it goes unnoticed for much of the movie never creating a Green Lantern theme no anthem for the DC hero Just the most stock music you will hear this summer The one bright spot in this otherwise dim movie was the character Sinestro played by actor Mark Strong His scenes were the more enjoyable to watch and yet in the end his character stays in the wings for the entire movie Bottom line The Green Lantern is a movie that starts off promising but ends leaving the viewer with very little interest in a sequel or in the hero in general With poor characters video game like special effects and a very anti climactic finale the Green Lantern offers very little compared to the already great movies released this summer Throughout the movie the Lanterns stress the fact that they do not feel fear but unless this movie has a monster opening weekend the execs that green lit this 300 million dollar movie might just be fearing for their jobs,4.0,37.0,75.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444659/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2011,In brightest day...,Where should I begin Alright I ll start by saying that the movie isn t bad And give my views to why it isn t all that good either One of the reasons why I look forward to Green Lantern was that it was a DC Comic movie adaptation and as a fan of superhero selecting this movie at the cinema comes quickly The movie begins with a narration of the history of the Green and Yellow Lantern Corps with visuals that felt like playing a video game Abin Sur a reputable Green Lantern falls to Earth and his ring chooses its successor Hal Jordan played by Ryan Reynolds comes into the story as a test pilot and he slowly discovers the ring s abilities and learns of the responsibilities of becoming the holder The movie has its wow moments like the test run of the fighter jets i was holding tight to my seat as if i was flying the plane when Hal saves a helicopter crash and when Hal eventually saves the Earth On the whole the effects are good I particularly like the part when Hal recites the Green Lantern vow and as Hal being Ryan it was quite a funny scene Ryan suits Hal Jordan s role like how Robert fits into playing Iron Man He adds the comedic sense in certain scenes However with all the recent Marvel movies out like X Men and Thor I felt Green Lantern fails to excite as much as the others did Comparisons are surely made and i fear Green Lantern might be overshadowed by the other superhero movies tremendous success Plus the trailer of this movie does not spark much eagerness to watch Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively surely have good looks but unfortunately they don t share on screen chemistry like Iron Man and Pepper Spiderman and MJ Superman and Lane or even him and Sandra Bullock in The Proposal thus making their love story somehow dull Hal has character but it was not elaborated much He suffers from the memory of his father but the movie lacks to bring forth and emphasize his true struggle The climax was good but it was short and i expected more In short Green Lantern feeds on the imagination of a viewer to be a superhero It certainly has its wow and dull moments so enjoy and savour the best parts and forget the rest,7.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446856/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,The kid in me like it,Puncher line I see a lot of negative reviews but they are wrong OK someone can argue about actors performance script scenes transition between earth and space movie length etc But is this movie so bad to be rated as a mediocre B production I don t think so The kid in me like it It has great CGI a cheese but enjoyable main character I mean common who can take seriously a green guy who can manipulate universe with the power of will It s a light joke meant to be taken accordingly When he comes after saving his girl to collect the anonymous kiss in the style of Batman she sees who he is with easy and does justice to all viewers screaming it s just a tinny mask This defines the movie Is not Shakespeare and we are not reviewing such a thing Beside there is no need to tell the story of the movie What you saw in trailers is almost all there is but is still fun enough to worth watch it,6.0,4.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447013/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Better than you think,Surprisingly this film was better than I thought Due to the reviews online I nearly did not want to see this and probably would have waited until the bluray version came out I am glad to say this film met my expectations and was sure fun to watch I chose to see the 2d version after finding out that the movie was actually filmed in 2d and later converted to 3d After watching clash of the titans 3d and alice in wonderland 3d I was definitely not falling foul to this false economy Anyway back to the story This is once again a nice movie of a comic book Green Lantern Hal is the earth super hero and defending the earth The visuals are actually amazing and keeps to the nice expectations of most I really don t want to spoil anyone s hope of missing this film The film is good It is not better than the new x men film but it is nt far from being good The only thing I would say would be that the film was not long enough to concentrate on the main mission of the story It started of fast slowed down and finished to fast with a high Also for people who will be watching this please hang around after the credits,7.0,5.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445422/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2011,Yet another superhero movie...,Well even though I am not a huge fan of superhero movies I had to give Green Lantern a go Why Well because it looked nice in the trailers and because it seemed like it had potential Now that I have seen it I can say that it is fairly much like most other superhero movies out there You have a reluctant guy being put into the role of the superhero much against his own choice and he has to struggle with himself to come to terms with who he is who he will become and we have seen that before in other similar movies Plus of course there is a damsel in distress and of course there will be a romantic connection between the two Nothing new or innovating here just boiling soup on broth already used before What puzzles me is why they chose Ryan Reynolds Well I am not saying that he is a bad actor I did enjoy his performance but once you have starred as a superhero in a movie in a different role mind you you don t go on and don the colors and garments of another superhero It is just wrong Sadly Hollywood seem to enjoy doing that re casting previously seen superheroes into new superhero roles It is just sad Green Lantern was good entertainment from start till end and there is a good flow to the story Though personally I thought some of the scenes where he used the green energy was a bit too comical and should perhaps had been done in a whole different approach But hey I guess it worked well enough because I watched the movie from start till end I am not overly familiar with the universe of the Green Lantern so how much or lacking the movie kept true to the comic book I can only guess But for a non fan the movie was adequate It sure was one amazing CGI fest Lots of really cool effects and lots of details everywhere Green Lantern is a movie that doesn t require much thinking so it is well suited for an evening when you just want to unwind and get sucked away from everyday life and go into a universe of superheroes One thing that I had a hard time buying into was the villain What was up with that An entity of fear growing in mass as it consumes the fear and lives of random people Well alright why not guess I have seen that as well now Even though Green Lantern was good enough entertainment it is hardly a movie that I will be making a second date out of watching It wasn t just that appealing to me And the best scene in the movie for me at least was when he said by the power of Grayskull Hey I am a big fan of He Man and the Masters of the Universe so that scene was epic Time to put out the green fluorescent light in the lantern,6.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2493661/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2013,Green Lantern,This film was good in establishing the origins of Green Lantern Only the necessary characters were introduced with just one central villain Parallax and his human embodiment were done pretty well Kilowog was just the one that I wanted to see The tough and fierce trainer The training of Green Lantern was done a little too quickly if not you could have enjoyed it more I enjoyed myself throughout There could be more action scenes but it was an origin film after all I like how they modify the origins to fit Parallax into the story Ryan Reynolds was pretty good as Green Lantern The Green Lantern suit was rather cool with the modifications of the glowing lines The CGI suit was done pretty well Although there weren t too many action scenes with Green Lantern constructs it was still cool The ending leaves plenty of ideas for a sequel This is not the best superhero movie or one that evokes much of your emotions but it is a fun Green Lantern film Comic book fan or not you will definitely enjoy it The only problem I have is the end credits scene with Sinestro wearing the yellow ring He did not receive punishment for any wrongdoings like in the comics so why did he wear the ring The only small conflict he had was with the Guardians Yes it was to give us a sneak peak of the sequel but just wearing it for the fun of it Come on you can do better than that Maybe it will be explained in the sequel so I m definitely looking forward to that Star Sapphire Carol John Stewart and Guy Gardner Evil Sinestro Atrocitus bring it on,8.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2798466/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2011,"Despite what critics say, Green Lantern is a solid film",The critics can say whatever they d like to about this adaptation of the DC Comics character but it was actually a very good movie While I will say I think the pacing moved a bit too quickly not allowing all characters to be fully developed that is the film s only real downfall Honestly when I first heard about them making a movie about Green Lantern I was a bit skeptical Not because of the movie itself but because as much as I love Ryan Reynolds as an actor he always does a phenomenal job I wasn t sure I d feel completely comfortable with him playing a superhero After seeing the movie though all doubts were lost Reynolds made for a perfect Hal Jordan The story follows Jordan a test pilot who has a mystical ring which possesses great powers bestowed upon him by an alien He is told that the ring chose him to induct into an intergalactic squadron who is tasked with keeping peace throughout the universe A good majority of characters and locations in the film are done in CGI and I have to say that they were spectacular As Hal is introduced to this new planet and these creatures we too experience it as if through his eyes It is a magnificent universe that has something new and breathtaking to see around every corner It was just a totally unique world unlike any you ve seen in a film before only aided by the voice talent that brought some of these aliens to life such as Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan Along with an incredible performance by Reynolds Peter Sarsgaard did a wonderful job as Hector Hammond who was accidentally introduced to remarkable power in true comic book fashion which consumed him purely for evil I now look forward to seeing the sequel which is currently in the works to explore more of this incredible universe and see what excitement still lies ahead,0.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2461989/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2013,The Green Lantern,May Contain Spoilers First off I was very thrilled that they finally brought this character to the big screen I had probably waited longer for this comic book character to get a Big Budget movie made more than any other Superhero character This is my favorite Superhero So when I learned they were making this movie I could hardly contain myself Now the movie I D Like to say first that I don t think this movie as bad as the critics said it was It s actually an enjoyable movie Now with that said let also say that although its not bad I was expecting this to be so much better than it is I felt they used too much CGI at times I felt almost like I was watching a cartoon I wasn t crazy about the villain it looked like he was fighting a Smog Monster That entire last fight sequence seemed a bit anti climatic to me and I feel could have been done much better Also felt like the movie needed more action I would have like to have seen the Green Lantern do more crime fighting on Earth after he made himself known to the public I think it would have been great to see the Green Lantern thwart a bank robbery stop a runnaway train full of passengers stuff like that Afterall don t we go to see Superhero movies to see Superheros do Superhero things There was some positives I took from this movie I liked Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan when I first saw that he got this role I had doubts He pulled it off very well Mark Strong as Sinestro was Superb Blake Livelywas good in her role All the actors did fine Another positive I took from this was the Musical Score which also superb There are certain aspects of this movie that were done extremely well I would still recommend this movie its a good popcorn muncher I have heard that Warner Brothers is still planning a sequel but with a different director and wants the sequel to much darker than this film was That could be a good thing also could be a bad thing but there hasn t been any movement on that front since Green Lantern came out on DVD So who knows if the sequel will get made or not,8.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2787905/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2011,"In brightest day, in blackest night, The Green lantern was OUTTA SIGHT!",Firstly HUGE HUGE fan of the comic series When i first heard the news that the green lantern was officially in production i nerdgasmed EVERYWHERE My inner geek was dancing harder than Kevin Bacon in his Quiet place from Footloose As casting news started to leak i prayed and hoped the role would go to someone fitting of the ring of power Jack Black out Thank god Common out We don t want no Jon Stewart Green Lantern movie Ryan Phillipe out WIN When i heard it had come down to Bradley Cooper Ryan Reynolds i couldn t have been happier As we all know Reynolds landed the title role Fast forward 18 months or so After all the negative buzz i was hearing and all the poor reviews that emerged i had lost all hope As a true fan it truly was my blackest night But alas upon recently getting to watch the film in Australia The Green Lantern showed me his true colours This film was exactly how i imagined it to be Hal Jordan is portrayed so well by Ryan Reynolds witty and charming with a hint of egotistical douche Even Blake Lively whom everyone had down trodden as an actress before Ben Affleck s The Town shut everyone up fits here role perfectly Mark Strong as Sinestro was ingenious and even Peter Saarsgaard whom i wasn t too familiar with before hand performed well The story is as follows Hal Jordan nice guy but a bit of an unreliable douchbag Crashes plane during test flight resulting in his being grounded by friend love interest eye candy Carrol Ferris Lively Angry at the world for wanting to know why he crashed the plane we are shown through flashbacks of a tragic test flight accident that resulted in the death of Hal s father Crazily cool Alien dude gets beat down by huge yellow baddie Parralax jumps in spaceship mortally wounded and crashes to earth Dying slowly he asks his power ring to find a successor Hal is basically kidnapped by said ring taken to the feet of dying Alien and told he has been bestowed a great honour and responsibility Awesomeness ensues as Hal is transported to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa He is trained somewhat before awesome Mark Strong s Sinestro trash talks to human race Feeling an outcast Hal quits the Corps and returns to Earth Whilst Hal is struggling to identify what it means to be a part of the green lantern corps and what it is to be without fear Peter Saarsgaards character Hector Hammond is called in to examine the Dead Alien from which Hal gained his ring Remnants of Paralax remain inside the wound of the dead alien and Hammond becomes infected with some kind of telepathic powers So much stuff happens and in the end it all comes down to Hal overcoming fear and putting a old fashion beat down on Paralax The special effects in this movie were among the best i ve ever seen and i urge you all to watch this movie Its not nearly as bad as the wrap its getting and i rate it just below THOR There were a few confusing parts in this movie on most occasions its due to some shotty direction All in all i really enjoyed myself during the GREEN LANTERN Many people i know who aren t fans are asking me all sorts of questions and are genuinely interested in the character after seeing the film So much fun 8 10 Its exactly what you ll expect it to be BUT BETTER PS stay after the credits for the lead up to the sequel,8.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449190/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2011,Why the hate?,Now I am a big Green Lantern fan And I actually had low expectations to this film When I saw reviews for this my expectations were lowered and when I finally saw the film I liked it It s not as great as the Dark Knight but it doesn t have to be It s WAY better than other DC live action movies such as Jonah Hex Steel The Spirit Superman IV and Catwoman Despite me liking it I still have some problems with the film One of my problems being Parallax as the main villain both we his design and him being in the movie in general Parallax is a bug like entity in the comics that possess people when they become afraid Here it s done but I think it was done to early and Hector Hammond shouldn t have been the one And why is Parallax attacking Earth instead of the entire universe Second I have the same problem with this movie as I do with the first transformers movie and that is too much humans not enough aliens One of the reasons why I love the Green Lantern comics is because I love seeing the aliens in the Green Lantern Corps They are very impressive to see in the movie and I wished they focused more on Hal Jordan adapting into the Corps Speaking of which while I admit I kinda liked Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan I still think he was miscast Reynolds fits more for Guy Gardner than Hal Jordan Blake Lively while hot she really didn t have anything to contribute as Carol Ferris and I wish they might ve developed her character maybe if they make a sequel she ll become Star Sapphire Now I really wished that Sinestro would be the main villain Mark Strong gave an awesome performance and it would ve been the next Heath Ledger s Joker if they gave him more screen time I really wished that they show Sinestro s fall from grace Where he becomes a renegade Green Lantern and tries to take over the universe and the final battle would be Sinestro vs Hal Now for the good parts The special effects are awesome And as I said earlier the aliens look impressive and I wish they spent more time on Oa than Earth Tomar re Kilowog Abin Sur and Sinestro all their actors do a wonderful job and I know I keep repeating myself but I really wish they had more screen time I actually thought the comedy was pretty good And I did like the final battle between Hal and Parallax Overall despite my complaints this is a very fun movie It has good action and I actually got into the story I don t know why critics hate this movie I m guessing because of Thor they were expecting more Still if your a fan of comics I say check it out,7.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2462706/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2011,"Delivers on action and effects,little blend on everything else!",With all those super heroes movies it was inevitable that The Green Lantern would get made into a live action movie After already having seen an animated movie about the origin of Green Lantern I was wondering what more they could do with it And I have to say that while the movie was good It didn t pack that punch the animated movie did Let me make this clear The movie will satisfy the masses As the movie is full of humor beautiful special effects and lot of action It is everything else that is kinda off especially when compared to the animated version In there the origin was much better explained Still that is nitpicking on my side Since I wasn t bored one second,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2493146/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2013,"Fantastic world and designs, but a poorly executed film",Do not fear the critics Have the will to see this movie The Good Likable main character Very imaginative action Awesome CGI especially all the aliens and Oa Very well paced doesn t linger in one scene it keeps moving and doesn t bore good sense of humor The Bad Ridiculously clich script 5 story lines and only one of which is really developed Average soundtrack over too quickly Making no large steps for the genre as whole Green Lantern is exactly what you would expect An origins story with a character unsure about his new powers and what he should do about them but then ends up saving the world It s clich But that doesn TM t stop Green Lantern from being entertaining and exciting Green Lantern is a decent combination of action and story telling Even if the story is light and simple it s not a bad story The action is imaginative and really quite cool It may feature more spectacle than story but it by no means deserves the criticism it has been receiving One thing that the Green Lantern does well that lots of superhero movies have failed is moving quickly through scenes and not boring the audience Sure Thor was good but man that desert scenery was downright boring Green Lantern shifts quickly from scene to scene all of which are appealing to the eye making it interesting to look at and much more stimulating than other recent superhero films Among a super clich script and a simple story Green Lantern doesn t do much to aid the genre but it is much better than I though it would end up being Despite these gripes the stellar CGI and effects the action scenes a surprisingly likable hero and humor that hits the funny bone just right Green Lantern is an OK Origins story just not one to advance the genre as much as I had hoped,4.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2786832/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Great summer fun,OK I m not sure what movie the critics saw but it wasn t this one Just got back from seeing it and was impressed They hit all the notes for the Green Lantern fans and had enough story to give the non fans some fun too Ryan Reynolds was good as Hal Jordan and captured his cocky self centered devil may care attitude very well He did a great job balancing the bewilderment of the situation with his ultimate responsibility Mark strong really stole the show as Sinestro He captured his arrogance and superiority perfectly Loved seeing the members of the Green Lantern corp brought to glorious life on the big screen and loved the CGI I especially got a kick out of the constructs Hal comes up with yes cheesiness as well It was a refreshing change of pace from all the dark take itself way to serious tone of some of the more recent superhero films Dark Knight anyone I can see where the critics would destroy it but movies like this aren t meant to Academy Award films they re meant to be fun And Green Lantern was exactly that By the way stay for the credits As with so many films now a days there s a nice little set up for the inevitable sequel My advice see it and just have some fun,8.0,5.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444951/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2013,Excellent Green Lantern Too Comic like for non-fans,I think the problem maybe that even in Green Lantern s heyday he was not the most popular comic hero The real problem is this movie is too much like a comic and doesn t appeal to non fans it s not just the the green thing Being a Green Lantern fan of the Golden Age and Hal Jordan since the 70s my own view is Ryan Reynolds comes off as a nigh perfect Hal Jordan and the there is not much wrong with this movie I think there is just a lot of nitpicking because Green Lantern isn t Thor or the Avengers I m a fan of Marvel since way back when but also DC you anti DC types need to get a grip This movie was easily one of the best comic to movie projects ever if what you want is to see a comic on the big screen not some bloated Hollywood farce,10.0,4.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2730780/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2011,I found it no surprise that it had made less than half of its two hundred-million-dollar budget back.,You know it s been a pretty bad time at the movies for me this year Oh sure there have been some good new releases at the cinema such as Unknown and The Adjustment Bureau but we re now more than halfway through the year and a good portion of the movies of 2011 have been total duds And joining the accumulation of instantly forgettables is Green Lantern the latest of an exhausted trend of overproduced comic book to screen transitions Here we have a movie with a potentially engaging premise a good cast and a very talented and accomplished director and yet it succeeded at being nothing to me other than a waste of time It s all been seen before The egotistical protagonist the misunderstood dweeb who becomes a villain the secret organization unbeknownst to the public etcetera etcetera This time Ryan Reynolds gets the unoriginal leading part playing a high on himself Air Force test pilot who by strange circumstances discovers an alien ship crash landed by the sea When the pink fleshed pilot of the pod expires Mr Reynolds takes a strange green ring from around his finger and a lantern from his ship and finds himself chosen with a special assortment of powers controlled by his will and diminished by his fear At least that s the mumbo jumbo the movies throws in place of a plot dynamic The director of Green Lantern was Martin Campbell who recently made Edge of Darkness and the marvelously entertaining Casino Royale and I am quite appalled that a director of his stature went so willingly with a movie that evidently thought it was either still a comic book or a video game From start to finish it is really nothing more than a display of the range of images that computers can generate something that I stopped being wowed by ages ago Yes Hollywood wet get it Computers can produce cool images Once upon a time you were more focused upon telling good stories And to be honest the computer graphics are not that spectacular From time to time I saw a couple of special effects shots that were quite impressive but most of the time despite their detail I was not convinced The purple skinned alien seen at the beginning of the movie in particular is a very cartoony effect I never felt like I could reach out and touch him or the world he was in And the movie is so oversaturated with special effects that aren t as dazzling as they should be that it makes the sketchy characters and plot seem even more flimsy than they already are Mr Reynolds is a very talented actor with a lot of movie star quality but he has zip to work with here He s the same troubled egomaniac that we ve seen a thousand times before just toned down Way down And even though he and the very lovely and talented Blake Lively have some sexy moments together there isn t any real chemistry between them None of the aliens are particularly interesting the confines of their world and organization are just barely touched upon One of the aliens was voiced by Geoffrey Rush and I had more fun trying to guess his name while listening to his voice than deciphering any of the mumbo jumbo that emanated from the CGI alien s fish like lips Nothing ever built up enough for me to really care about anything that happened But here s the defining example of lazy screen writing Early on in the movie we have a drawn out scene with Mr Reynolds and his nephew A close call occurred earlier before and his nephew is quite upset The movie hints at a father and son figure dynamic developing here and right after this introductory moment it just stops We never see or hear of the nephew again Not once He and the context of his character in the plot are just dropped Now I have to be honest the movie does garner a little momentum in the third act The special effects become buttoned up the action becomes more engaging and things take a turn for the better But that only lasts the better part of twenty minutes in a two hour movie And when it was all over and done and the credits had started rolling and I noticed that all of the other people in the auditorium had already flocked for the exit I found it no surprise that Green Lantern had made less than half of his two hundred million dollar budget back,5.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454512/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2011,Great Movie: Critics obviously don't read comics,The movie was very true to the comic book which I read as a child in the 1950 s One idiot critic called Green Lantern a relatively obscure character What a rube In the comic book universe it was Superman and Batman first then Green Lantern and Flash Both were even in the Justice Society long before the Justice League even existed The Hulk was still a wimp and Spiderman wasn t even born yet when Green Lantern was one of the top four heroes in comics The movie used all of the basic tenets of the comic unlike Thor who in the comic when he was outcast to Earth was made a wimpy crippled doctor by Odin It took months for him to learn humility and find someone to love him for the type of person he was and not just his super good looks unlike the movie where Thor was still a hunky Thor who found true love and learned humility in less than a week The Green Lantern Corps was super cool the special effects top notch the dialog believable and the actors well cast It was all that Green Lantern s fans could hope for Even better was the fact that my 11 year old sons loved loved the movie and though they hadn t read the comic they had seen GL in the Justice League movies and in the TV series and in the Brave and the Bold as Batman s partner so they knew he was not a relatively obscure character Maybe they should be critics,9.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447155/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2011,We Like It!,For those who are desensitized to any and all great effects decent stories and spectacular production values this will be a so so movie but if you still have the ability to carry some form of wonder in your heart this was pretty darned good I had no problem with the principal actors their performance or the execution of their characters I enjoyed the repartee between Hal and his love interest I thought the intro was pretty spot on with the earlier editions of the comic and I think the remainder of the film is a great introduction to the franchise But I do say introduction Honestly without a follow up or two this intro will fall flat It sets the audience up for something more something bigger So without it this doesn t work As a stand alone movie it IS so so but if we are given a sequel or two the grandeur of this film will pay off My biggest disappointment is in the Blu Ray release The digital copy is NOT a digital copy It s an ultraviolet copy from flixter and you have to put it on your android phone iPad or computer to watch it My iPod is how I watch movies on the go so this didn t work for me I ll be looking out for that Ultraviolet Digital Copy warning next time I want my 5 back for the upgrade that wasn t,0.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2504035/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2011,Green Lantern appears to be DC Comics' attempt to compete with Marvel Comics in creating a series of major superhero blockbusters.,Watching the trailers I expected this to be one of the worst films I had ever seen My major concern was what appeared to be very weak and superficial casting I would consider the acting to be the biggest weakness of this movie Ryan Reynolds may have the look of a superhero but he is much better suited for a romantic comedy than an action flick Similarly Blake Lively looks like the perfect superhero love interest but in this movie she was also supposed to be a serious business type woman She did not pull this off well Overall I was pleasantly surprised The acting was not great The effects could have been stronger and I would have been satisfied without so many story lines But I enjoyed seeing the film and do not think it was one of the worst films I have seen I think it will fall in the wayside of many other major summer movies but Redbox it if you are in the mood for another good superhero adventure Redbox Netflix It http burningreview blogspot com,6.0,6.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445043/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,"The most powerful force in the galaxy is not Fear or Will, but Boredom.",Green Lantern Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds receives a ring from a mysterious dying alien and finds that through it his thought can be turned into reality He uses the ring to fight a fear based enemy Parralax which is not a pharmaceutical drug but an intergalactic glob of space doom You know for a story of such intergalactic peril it s hard for me to remember anything of significance The movie is literally slipping from my mind but I ll do my best to diagnose the film The Good The Green Lantern planet of Oa and the power ring effects are pretty The performances aren t bad Ryan Reynolds is a good actor even though he wouldn t have been my choice for Hall Jordan Peter Saarsgard is also good as Hector Hammond and the film would have benefited from more of him Whenever Mark Strong appears I feel like caring There s a training sequence that is easily the most entertaining thing in this film Mark Strong just has a gravitas and an intensity that the movie needed more of That s not to say that the rest of the film is full of laughs It s not Humor would have also added a lot to the film The Bad About that lack of humor I m going to blame most of the faults in this film on the writers Nearly all of them have only written for television They ve all produced more than written and two of them have written for No Ordinary Family and the bad half of Heroes Oy To quote the Mythbusters in a pseudo plumber voice Well there s your problem There are a bunch of superfluous scenes and some fairly random cuts to unrelated stories scattered through the film Nearly everyone mentions Hal s dad s jet fighter fatality to him at least once just to make sure we remember Then there s the problem that the audience is supposed to believe two test pilots a senator and biology scientist all know each other stretching back to childhood or are related And two of them receive superpowers It s not like this is going to ruin the film It s just another thing that subtly tells you someone wasn t trying And that s the gist I get from this film The film basically has no real antagonist There s a floating cloud of blackish yellow Parralax doom but it never really poses a threat It s kind of laughable that Hal Jordan travels to Oa and back to Earth twice before Parralax could conceivably reach either Thank goodness when it gets to Earth it attacks the half of that planet that s in broad daylight or you d never find it Hector Hammond should be a better nemesis as he has telekinesis and telepathy and an actual personality but the film spends too much time trying to make him sympathetic rather than a true villain He has no real scheme or goals he s just a victim of Parralax I know the reason the filmmakers went with these two sad sacks is they want to save Sinestro for a sequel but judging from the box office returns only 50 million on the opening weekend for shame they should have hedged their bets and spent that rainy day money early Because there s no real villain the problem Hal faces is self doubt How exciting He has substantial fears which is exactly the sort of thing I would think should probably disqualify someone from being a test pilot Anywho I think Hal s real problem is a lack of imagination A minigun chainsaw and a couple of jet fighters are the most interesting things Hal does with the ring The Ugly The film has a drastic overuse of CGI Green Lantern should at LEAST have a real honest to goodness costume Superman s from another planet too but his costume is made of honest to goodness cloth It s hard to really be interested in a hero when 85 of his body is digital And when his power is to create green CGI from the power of will there should be more creative uses than what we see What should be Hal s iconic entrance into the public eye has him instead I kid you not rollar skating a helicopter through a series of Matchbox Car style loops to safety Like a Cartoon I think Daredevil slicing a man in half with a subway train was a better superhero introduction Even the characters later admit how stupid and un iconic an introduction Green Lantern s display of power was which means the writers probably also knew Bottom line the movie is ho hum There s just no wow factor Aliens and power rings and telepathy seem to faze almost nobody in this film And if they re not interested I m not interested There are few moments of power depth or interest or anything Therefore I give the film a D,4.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448592/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Far better than I expected,I went into this movie thinking it d be mediocre at best especially with 7 on IMDb I usually don t go to movies under a 7 in the theater However I was really surprised It was a very good movie Never got bored great casting good effects good character development told the story well for somebody who never read the comic book I m usually very critical of movies and looking back at this one I can t find anything I didn t like not one thing He did create some wacky things with his imagination as you saw in the previews but he s new and they are things humans just starting out would think of so it still made sense and honestly none were very effective Great movie though not sure what people are complaining about and they don t get much more critical than me Oh yeah and stay after the credits in the typical Marvel style,9.0,8.0,19.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445047/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2011,"At last, superheroes are back",Treated myself to this film earlier today meant to see it sooner watched it at the last cinema showing it on the last session before it vanished Glad I did There s been something lacking in superhero flicks since Spiderman fell from his web and thank goodness the Green Lantern has finally got it back The film draws from all the traditionally successful elements of superhero flicks It has a strong story which anyone can understand is entertaining and doesn t strain the brain It oozes Good Vs Evil The characters are believable The heroes look like heroes and the villains likewise look like monsters No more sitting there guessing who se a goodie or baddie with The Green Lantern The film paces well and rarely leaves you wishing the cinema had a fast forward button on the seat Most of all it has emotion that thing which strangely leaves you pretending that you are the hero as you watch As you walk out you believe everyone s a hero and that tomorrow at work you could apply a bit of Green Lantern thinking and save your own world The Green Lantern is a sleeper success will grow in popularity and will undoubtedly build a cult following It certainly doesn t deserve some of the flak that many other reviewers have given it I guess these reviewers have gotten used to reviewing complex tiring and competitive films and have forgotten the enjoyment of just sitting there and letting a film just wash all over you Green Lantern is that sort of film Unlike many other recent flicks of it s genre I ll be watching The Green Lantern again Soon Zordmaker,0.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2483231/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2013,The Star Trek of DC comic book-heroes but only slightly above average,Green Lantern has always been something of the DC comics version of Star Trek a valiant human among aliens aliens and more aliens fighting for the good of the universe Like most other popular comic book franchise the Green Lantern comics have gone tremendous change in the last 50 odd years various different characters have worn the Green Lantern moniker since and the Green Lantern Corps saga in comic book terms has grown to Star Trek ish proportions This Green Lantern film starts at the beginning the origin of the original GL Hal Jordan and I don t want to hear anything about some Alan Scott keep it to yourselves geeks and yet manages to add elements or canon if you so want from more contemporary story lines Ryan Reynolds well as in all films featuring Reynolds Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds playing Hal Jordan semi animated Green Lantern In other words he compensates his limited acting range with playing his amiable self There has been more criticism for the animated costume I only agree to a point the costumes are alright but whenever Reynolds Jordan wears his tiny mask he looks cross eyed if not to say mentally challenged putting it mildly Hector Hammonds prosthetics are excellent and let s give credit where credit is due squint eyed Peter Sarsgaard always makes a suitable villain Too bad that Hammond is second antagonist to a CGI cloud and gets a very sudden run of the mill end but apparently Hollywood producers still subscribe to the Marshmallow Man syndrome size beats quality Which brings us to the main villain Parallex in this movie Parallax is a fallen Guardians by the way what s up with those glass helmets while in the DC Comics if comic geekdom doesn t escape me it s Hal Jordan taking on some evil form killing off half of the universe in an event called Zero Hour And perhaps the producers would have been well advised to watch Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer the main villain being a huge CGI cloud with a face has rarely been a good idea Galactus anybody Great make up job on Sinestro Mark Strong who manages to get across both fascist and sympathetic yet but I won t spoil it still watch the extra scene after the credits On the other hand the Abin Sur character is slightly wasted coming across like a random creature that spilled over from an Outer Limits episode In a way it s sad that we ll have to endure a couple of Spider Man reboots and a number of Iron Man sequels before we might or might not see a second Green Lantern 6 from 10 not necessarily because it s a great film in the classic sense but because it s one of the more decent comic adaptations,6.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2746686/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2011,GL gets a bad rap...not nearly as bad as some,Worst comic movie ever Worst acting Worst effects are some of the phrases being slapped around about Green Lantern I ll recount some gems you may have forgotten Elektra Catwoman Batman and Robin The Schumacher one and Howard the Duck Get my drift No GL is not that bad at all in fact it is kinder to it s fans than the first Spiderman movie was The fact of the matter is there is no way of putting Hal Jordan on celluloid without an element of kiddishness just wait till they attempt an Aquaman movie Here they went ahead and just did Green Lantern as per the printed without trying to reality up the guy like Nolan did with The Dark Knight because you just can t with what is essentially a space opera With garbage like Sucker Punch around I am astounded at the reaction to this film which provides a solid story and decent visuals Just a tip watch the animated movie GREEN LANTERN FIRST FLIGHT to get acquainted with the character before this movie especially if you know nothing about Lantern mythology You ll realise then that they got this pretty right,0.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2471298/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,pretty good,to be quite honest i think this is a good film seeing this in 3D was probably the better option don t know what it would of been like as 2D as the previous comments yeah i don t think it is as good as x men but its still pretty amazing definitely was worth all the money i paid Ryan Reynolds is a good actor everything i have seen he has portrayed the character really well like in blade he was the funny cocky guy he is generally a funny person if you like action you will love this if you get the chance watch in 3D before it is released on DVD because DVD 3D s aren t as good,10.0,8.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447548/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,Not as bad as they say,Everybody hates this movie Relax enjoy The trip because this is basic entertainment here People expect a lot from a superhero movie but this is what it is and you can t compare it with Cinema masterpieces It s made to be watchable by kids adults seniors although I don t think they like this usually so what were you hopping for Yes the CGI mask is horridly done but the love interest get it right away and that s cool The direction and effects are generally greatl acting is what you should expect for a movie like this where drama has the capacity of catch you for a second and let go has nothing has ever happened It s filled with renowned actors so you can leave the bad reviews mostly to chooses made by screenwriting and the big bosses thirst for money The guardians are ugly as hell although I liked this movie s concept art a lot their faces are a weak point This is no Batman and it couldn t be this character is empty and cinematically uninteresting It could only be made with a huge amount of CGI and for the year it was made its a lot better than Justice League or some other recent superhero movies The story is meh but the mask did I mentioned it already,6.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8545185/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,Good but a better script would have made it great.,I saw it in 3D which wasn t all that eye popping 2D would have probably been just as good The action scenes are good it s the in between that suffers with some badly written scenes and lulls that had me wanting to fast forward it especially the love interest scenes that were full of sappy dialog On a different note The character of Sinestro was wicked even as a good guy you knew he was like an Anakin Skywalker type before the fall His true history of being chosen is less than heroic and rather evil he was chosen but his predecessor did not die and wanted the ring back realizing this Sinestro did not give the ring back and left him to die This is not revealed in the movie but may be when the sequel comes out as we all know what happens to Sinestro stay during the credits and there is a scene that shows the beginning of Sinestros downfall where he puts on the yellow power ring All in all a 7 10 could have been an 8 or better with a more thought out script Lets hope the sequel is better written,7.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446030/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Very Good Action Movie. I Definitely Got What I Paid For.,This movie was a very good It basically gave me everything I asked for in a superhero flick good action scenes great special effects and a cool new superhero character The story was a little rushed in some parts but mostly it was pretty entertaining The acting from most of the main cast was spot on and Reynolds was at the top of his game I d definitely like a sequel and that easter egg scene at the end definitely set it up for one The only problems I really had with it was the narration at the end which was a little corny and the image of that purple alien at the beginning where it just shows his face and his fist it looked a little like a drawing Everything else though was great A solid entry to the summer superhero movie season,10.0,8.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445563/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2015,Nothing to get excited about,I am going to show you that will is more powerful than fear Hardly a bad message to teach all of the kids out there but then again there s quite a few moments in this that clearly aren t for children It s the failure of this film to decide who it s really targeting that proves its biggest liability Ryan Reynolds stars as a complete bell end air force pilot who becomes a lycra wearing super hero after finding a ring and is invited to join The Green Lantern Corps while some rather poorly realized big evil entity head toward our planet I never read the Green Lantern comics when I was younger and had no ideas what powers he had Apparently he can use his ring to conjure constructs like creating a car underneath a person thrown through the air and then a helter skelter for them to reach the ground safely He goes to the Green Lantern Corps to act unworthy and quit only to return His journey is not particularly interesting and he s not a likable character We get a big battle scene at the end but I found myself wondering what of any value this film s 200 million was spent on Reynolds is OK but not great and he is playing a terrible character Lively s performance does not live up to her name Saarsgard s decent as the villain This is not a terrible film but it is a poor introductory movie and was a major flop It s not in the Captain America 1990 Supergirl or Superman 4 category of pure garbage but it s not out of place with the mediocre Joel Schumacher Batman films or the Mark Webb Spiderman movies There is an audience for this but they do so many things wrong from the script to the casting to the performances It s just mediocre and we ve come to expect more from Comic Book films,5.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3201981/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2011,Better than the critics give it credit for.,I know this movie has been critically panned for the most part but I found it very entertaining and after all isn t that what we go see movies for in the first place Most of you know the story Talented but cocky and irresponsible test pilot Hal Jordan is chosen by a dying alien to assume his role as this sectors protector by giving him a power ring and a batter to charge it with To me what carries this movie is one thing The charisma and likability of Ryan Reynolds in the role of Green Lantern He brings just the right amount of naivete and boyish charm to the role I never lost interest in what happened to him during the entire movie Oh there are a few nitpicks with it I though Blake Lively as a test pilot was comical She flies a fighter plane in one scene and then spends the rest of the movie in tighter and shorter dresses The cast is excellent but not given much to do Tim Robbins as the typical dirtbag senator and Angela Bassett as a government scientist are under utilized in my opinion Also I thought they could have given Green Lantern better constructs as the other Green Lanterns call them I mean you have all the power your imagination can come up with at your command and all you can come up with are machine guns race cars and planes Oh well I said just a few nitpicks This movie is very entertaining and charming so don t listen to the critics,8.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449538/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2011,Don't listen to the critics,I love it when you hear a movie sucks then watch it yourself and realize that there are some really whiny people out there This was a good movie but I m not about to say great because there were problems Namely the editing was not good I have heard that the theater version was the studio cut and not Martin Campbell s so I think that the extended cut coming out on Blu ray should fix allot of these problems Also the plot seemed like there where some holes in it and supposedly the extended cut might fix this Also the training and last fight scenes were short But once again the extended cut it is supposed to make these scenes much longer with multiple lanterns instead of just Hal Jordan in the final fight scene That being said this movie had so much more to love than hate Ryan Reynolds did a near perfect Hal Jordan and Strong did a perfect Sinestro The CGI was kinda cartoony but its supposed to be so I didn t mind I did not watch it in 3 D cuz I hate 3 D but the 2 D visuals looked beautiful I really don t see why this movie got all the hate that it has other than that I think people were expecting a sci fi Dark Knight and got Green Lantern I would put it on par with the first Spider man and X men movies So just go in with an open mind and have fun Also this is a good movie for kids cuz its no more violent than Star Wars but it may be a little scarier,6.0,5.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2478260/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,DC tries very hard to no avail,Green Lantern is DC s biggest hope to launch the DC universe to the big screen Other than Green Lantern the only real DC adaptations have been either Batman or Superman adaptations DC promised that Green Lantern would not only bring that character to the big screen and but would also lay the ground work for their future film adaptations of their other heroes such as the Flash or Wonder Woman Those are some pretty big promises to fill considering the only real recent success DC has had with their super hero franchises has been Nolan s Batman series This movie was truly a gamble on DC s part if they really hoped to bring their comic book universe to the big screen Luckily the movie does boast quite a bit of talent from stars Ryan Reynolds Mark Strong Temuera Morrison and the voices of Michael Clarke Duncan and Geoffrey Rush as well as the director Martin Campbell director of Casino Royale So despite the fact that this movie was a big risk it appears that DC may have something special on their hands Did Green Lantern successfully launch the DC film universe or should we just stick to The Dark Knight for our DC fix Check out the rest of my review out here http mastersfilmreview wordpress com,5.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447100/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Was this good? No... it was GREAT! Here's why...,I ve been reading in the past few days tons of reviews about this movie and how it doesn t fill expectations Yesterday after seeing it myself I went to bed wondering if all those reviewers had seen the same amazing movie I saw I am a HUGE Green Lantern fan and had been waiting years to see this come to the screen I was really excited when I knew it was finally being made Not that excited when I read about Ryan Reynolds But yesterday I just shut my mouth and saw a feast an Emerald Feast Green Lantern is NOT thought to be in the same vein as The Dark Knight It is NOT intended to be a realistic psychological portrayal of s society and an anti hero that rises It is the opening point to an intergalactic saga of epic proportions in which our core sense of morals duty and responsibility need to be questioned This movie is screaming in your face Hey this is only the beginning I remember when I saw The Lord of The Rings The Fellowship of the Ring back in 2001 Some people said Oh what a waste of time They didn t even destroy the ring My answer was What letter of the word TRILOGY you didn t understand Green Lantern is CLEARLY the STARTING POINT for an epic story that will continue developing in its sequels just like Star Wars A New Hope So if you have been worrying thinking this is a mess trust me it is NOT It s GREAT To me better than Thor and on the same level as X Men First Class Ryan Reynolds suits the role perfectly as Hal Jordan and you can definitely see a process in him his journey to become a hero as he deals with his own fears Blake Lively is really hot and delivers a right performance much to be developed in further sequels too Mark Strong and Peter Saarsgard are great They hit the spot perfectly in their roles This movie is definitely now on the top of my FAVORITE superhero films Said again Green Lantern isn t about dark realism and crime like Batman it s about LIGHT in galactic proportions and how you can discover your most courageous side in times of despair It s a true HERO movie much like Christopher Reeve s Superman was back in 1978 I cross my fingers hoping that a Director s Cut will be released This movie could easily last 3 hours I never saw the clock once There s too much to cover and too little time But despite of this Martin Campbell manages to give us a solid story that as I said before is just the germ of further development So just grab a snack sit down and enjoy And get ready for some great Green Lantern sequels In brightest day in blackest night mates,6.0,6.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446892/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2012,Great intro to Green Lantern for someone who hasn't read the comics,I haven t read any of the Green Lantern comics and I think this movie did a very good job of setting the context and background of all the key characters I was surprised to see this get a relatively lower rating because I think this movie was quite well made There is a brief history narrative of the green lantern corps intro to a bad guy selection of a human green lantern entry of the bad guy into planet earth and finally human green lantern defeats bad guy Come on thats the theme of every superhero comic movie and this is no different I am sure there is more character development in the comics but there is only so much that can be adapted to the screen especially as an intro movie I do hope they make a franchise of this There is an indication towards the credits that there could be a part 2 All in all a pretty enjoyable and entertaining movie Don t always believe what the critics say,7.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2641370/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2011,Not sure Hal is Green for a sequel...,Green Lantern Hal Jordan the newest superhero to make it to the big screen is probably in the top 5 most important DC super heroes others being Superman Batman Wonder Woman and arguably the Flash Unfortunately it s far from being in the top 5 of the best super heroes movies It s competent fairly entertaining but not particularly great or engrossing It s a mix of earth born adventure with a bit of sci fi thrown in on another planet and in space which is the more original part along with the fact he s not the only Green Lantern From the previews I thought it was trying to be a bit like Iron Man with the cocky womanizer protagonist Not so much really Ryan Reynolds does an OK job He looks the part and for the first time we see a costume that really shows up the muscles like in the comics However like others I had troubles with the mask and specifically the lightning coursing through often yellow which is a no no for history reasons Enough with those minor considerations and let s move on to the rest The earth part is obviously set to ground our future hero I understand why that was done but most of it wasn t particularly memorable The dogfighting scene was exciting I admit the fan boy in me getting a little shiver when Hal started reciting his famous oath but it was undermined by alternating with another scene not the only part where that was done awkwardly The scenes with his former paramour Carol Ferris were kinda flat I don t know if it was from lack of chemistry or just bland writing The actress playing Ferris Blake Lively from Gossip Girl really wasn t as bad as I expected Far more interesting was Dr Hector Hammond an unfortunate looking genius with potential mental powers I liked his portrayal and I found the part just before his exit with Hal s gift very clever I found the alien world Oa and the alien part far more interesting as this is something unusual in superhero movie territory The special effects there were very well done but weirdly I didn t feel a sense of awe I must be growing blas Unfortunately very few aliens not counting the Guardians who mostly spout exposition actually say or do anything interesting even in the background I didn t think computer graphics for them as I watched which is an exploit in itself Some of my favorite moments involved those aliens Sinestro could have looked really corny but he looked fine and pretty faithful to the comics I think it also helped that he was acted very well without going over the top Green Lantern can create basically anything he can will into being as a physical green construct On one hand it means you can be quite imaginative in the use of his powers On the other hand it runs the risk of being ridiculous The problem here is that I was constantly second guessing the hero s choices They seemed sometimes unnecessarily convoluted ex the track or illogical ex the planes It makes for nice visual effects but also makes things less visceral From the trailer you would expect funnier fare like Iron Man but things too often fell flat I don t remember hearing much laughter from the theatre crowd if at all and I wasn t really amused myself with a couple exceptions There was one amusing part where Hal Jordan wants to show his powers to his friend that played on our expectations because of the trailer That was clever unexpected while also giving a needed explanation All in all I liked Green Lantern although I preferred the other superhero movies this summer excluding Captain America which I haven t seen yet I wouldn t pay full ticket price for it especially not 3d which was not really not worth it but a rental later on would be recommended especially if you tend to like superhero fare I think critics and the public would not have been so severe if there hadn t been so many superhero movies this season and if Green Lantern hadn t cost so much Rating 6 out of 10 Good,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454112/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Green Lantern proves a missed opportunity,After Marvel delivered two strong comic book films in the summer of 2011 it would be nice to say that DC followed up with an equally engaging entry with the first cinematic outing of one of their signature characters Green Lantern Alas that is not the case While not a dud Green Lantern comes up wanting in the comic book film sweepstakes full of promise and failing to deliver on a significant portion of that promise Green Lantern introduces us to test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds who finds himself in a less than ideal position early in the film he has crashed an expensive jet for his company Ferris Aircraft and most likely cost them a major military contract He is disturbed by memories of his father also a test pilot who died flying a mission He attempts to seek comfort in the friendship and possible courtship of longtime confidant Carol Blake Lively and when that ends with him walking away from her attempts to reach out to him a major unexpected life changing event lands literally in front of him in the form of Abin Sur Temura Morrison an alien from another planet who is a member of the Green Lantern Corps Hal is selected by Sur s green power ring to take his place in the Corps and Hal discovers that the Corps is a group of over 3 000 beings who have harnessed the green power of will to combat evil and keep the universe safe On the Green Lantern s home planet of Oa Jordan quickly clashes with the leader of the Corps Sinestro Mark Strong who believes humanity in general and Hal Jordan in specific is not strong enough to take on the mantle of the Green Lantern and at first Jordan uncertain of himself agrees But outside forces intervene in Jordan s decision to turn down his super powers Abin Sur was assaulted by the creature Parallax which is comprised of the yellow energy of fear and was infected by some of Parallax s evil When the body of Sur is discovered by the military they bring in xeno biologist Hector Hammond Peter Saarsgard who turns out to have some part connection to both Hal and Carol to examine the remains of Sur During his work he is infected by Parallax and quickly begins mutating into a force of destruction that is luring Parallax to Earth to consume it and only Hal can combat it If Green Lantern has one major problem it is that the screenwriters fail to capitalize on much of the meat of the story There are so many elements in Green Lantern that have the potential to give it depth that when it fails to use them properly it proves the film s undoing Countless plot threads are introduced and then largely go nowhere Hal s haunted memories of his father seem to be a big deal early but taper off before the running time is even half over The relationship between Hal Carol and Hector is put on minor display for a few scenes but are seemingly mostly window dressing to the plot to pay off some later scenes and the plausibility of them all knowing each other as awkwardly introduced in the film seems a bit far fetched as well The list goes on and on as the script mostly skirts by these ideas never plumbing their depths and then just moving on to the next scene What results is a film that has a great deal of good material just under the surface but the cover holding it back never comes off Ryan Reynolds proves an able lead in the role of superhero with his usual charm and light touch working in the film and the character s favor Despite the fact that the script doesn t really delve deeply into Hal as a person Reynolds manages to get us to root for the character as much as possible even without the necessary depth to back it up Blake Lively is a fetching actress to be sure but as with so much else in Green Lantern her simmering romance with Hal is thin and lacking and her scenes have their charm at times but you don t find yourself investing in their relationship Peter Saarsgard does his best in the role of Hector allowing us to see the wounded man that Hector wants to be presented as but here even more than any other of the leads the film really drops the ball Saarsgard s performance is strong enough that even as underdeveloped and underutilized as Hector is there is a still a palpable degree of menace to him Green Lantern may be the first comic book film where the villain seems like an afterthought and Saarsgard proves how much of a missed opportunity Hector is Green Lantern isn t without its moments The visual look of the film especially in scenes set on Oa have a degree of scope that proves effective in making the Corps sufficiently alien and opening up the film to the realm of space opera which seems hard to come by these days Also the script and dialogue at times has some fun with the more traditional comic troupes especially the idea that someone wouldn t recognize a person who was wearing what amounts to a harlequin mask over their face Those jabs at comic book movies make you wonder why the screenwriters couldn t devote the effort they expended in tweaking the genre to also flesh out the story and characters more Green Lantern is hardly boring and operates well enough at times as fetching eye candy but the film undercuts itself so often that it can only be described as a missed opportunity It is difficult to predict whether it can manage to bring in enough bucks to justify a sequel but if it does perhaps someone will learn from their mistakes with this outing and deliver an entry that mines the material the second time around,6.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445048/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2011,Wasted potential,The one thing that struck me about this movie is its absolute waste of potential What could have been a superior action hero epic turns out to be a below average battle between will and fear that will probably not even keep younger children entertained Although the visual effects are very well done both the Green Lanterns and Parallaxlook good it is the characters acting and script that let this film down The dialogue between the characters is the usual drivel encountered in so many below par superhero films and it offers nothing unique or different In fact that is the problem with the whole film PREDICTABLE BLAND and quite frankly DULL The script seems to have been written by someone passing the time whilst on the toilet The best lines go to Michael Clarke Duncan s character and Peter Sarsgaard s Hector Hammond The film spends a great deal of time showing us the transformation of Ryan Reynold s superhero and Peter Sarsgaard s villain but I feel we never really get to know either character Although Ryan Reynold s character is dealt with in some detail it offers us nothing new but the usual arrogant man with no responsibilities bucks up his ideas and becomes the saviour of the world The character of Hector Hammond on the other hand has the potential to be fascinating but is instead completely under explored He could and should have been an ignored loser who turns tragic villain perhaps even a character that the audience feel sorry for but his hatred of his father is poorly justified The acting is largely only mediocre Ryan Reynolds makes a reasonably convincing superhero but doesn t make his transformation from layabout to superhero quite as convincing as say Tobey Maguire s Peter Parker but Peter Sarsgaard s talents are wasted in the role of Hector Hammond He does the best he can with the awful script but spends most of the film just screaming and squawking like a girl The performance by Blake Lively is OK whilst Mark Strong and the ever reliable Tim Robbins albeit in a small role turn in solid performances The plot along with character introduction and development is all rushed and the film should have spent more time on these areas the film is only just over 1 hour and a half so an extra half hour fleshing out the above would have made the film more rewarding for the viewer Sadly a disappointing viewing experience,0.0,3.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2463581/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2013,One of the Worst Superhero Movies EVER made!,I ve always enjoyed and adored superhero movies but I know that some superhero movies hasn t been very good like the 2 Fantastic 4 movies and Catwoman which I disliked But when I heard about the Green Lantern as a live action movie I thought This really could be interesting but I was so unsure at the same time after when I heard the critics hating it but it didn t stop me to take a look by myself Even though the Green Lantern isn t exactly my number 1 favorite superhero I was really looking forward to this one But after all the hatred I was just going to calm down with open mind and see the movie in a different angle So how was it This has to be one the most disgraceful and horrible experiences I had when watching this movie Was it really that awful C mon It can t be YES Please trust me everything in the movie had absolutely nothing original or even emotional to experience it OK but I understood that it wasn t going to like the Dark Knight or Spider man the Raimi trilogy or whatever I wanted to see at least a good superhero movie that shows some seriousness and polite to the original comics and mythology What went wrong There s just to much bad and lame quirky humor on this one it s almost as much as or even equal like the movies by Michael Bay OK look for me there s nothing wrong to put humor on a superhero movie but these humors that appears on this movie is annoying as hell There was one supposedly joke that bugged me and made me feel extremely mad and insulted on the part when Hal was going to show his friend the ring and made a step by showing what was included and he shows his middle finger to represent his finger to put on the ring OK Seriously the middle finger Not only is the humor bad and ruining the movie but also it has no originality to show what it s like to be a hero Now I m not saying that superhero movies are old or boring to look at because I believe that they can be made on just any kinds of different ways or angles The Dark Knight trilogy showed on a very different way that showed what it really would have been If we had a Batman This Green Lantern movie it felt like I was watching a movie that has stolen the good aspects from other superhero movies I ve seen in the past No interesting character development no interesting music and the romance was actually bad and looked pretty forced The special effects looked alright but nothing spectacular and the costumes looked pretty bad I really tried to like it and after reading the recommendations here on IMDb and trying to protect the movie sorry guys this movie didn t work for me I had a pretty bad head ache after watching this and tried to remove the anger by looking at something that at least was well made Is it recommended Heck no I was hoping it to be entertaining but it turned out to be a crap fest who does not want to show any kinds of entertainment or any originality Although if your e too curious to look at it be careful or you could use it as a good example of how not to make a bad superhero movie,1.0,3.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2928202/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2011,A Major Disappointment from DC,And so it continues With Marvel Studios dominating the comic film crossover market DC has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to expand past it s Christopher Nolan Batman series especially since the third film is said to be the final With Zack Snyder s Superman reboot two years away Warner had to rely on GREEN LANTERN to get people excited for DC properties I guess someone dropped the ball on this one Instead of an exciting sci fi superhero adventure that could span the galaxy with one of the most interesting characters in the DC universe we re treated to the most generic superhero films I ve ever sat through This movie is in fact lamer than the Tim Story FANTASTIC 4 films DC s Green Lantern series is extensive with a long and varied history and the film focuses on one of the more popular Lanterns Hal Jordan of DC s Silver Age The Green Lantern Corps is an intergalactic peacekeeping collective with members from all reaches of the Universe Hal Jordan becomes the first human to join the Corps when his predecessor Abin Sur crash lands on Earth following an encounter with Parallax a powerful ever growing entity that feeds and thrives on fear Jordan receives the green power ring and eventually arrives at the planet Oa the home of the Lantern Corps where he receives a brief training before questioning his role in the Corps and whether he has the fearless disposition to accept his position As Parallax grows stronger and threatens the Corps a bit of his energy finds its way into xenobiologist Hector Hammond and infuses him with exceptional powers that only build upon his own festering hate and turn him into an additional threat As with any superhero origin story there is a lot going on in GREEN LANTERN and the problem is that the movie just breezes through it all to try and cram it into its two hour runtime Here s an idea with a history as rich as that of the Green Lantern series maybe take your time to ease the audience into it all A good piece of the audience going into the movie has no real idea about the world of Green Lantern and they are going to need introduced in a manner than can understand Being a casual fan I knew enough to get started The movie blasts through the important points as if reading off a checklist and assuming that they re giving enough for people new to the franchise to follow along All right here we go You re a Green Lantern now Here s your power ring It can manifest anything you can imagine just keep it charged This is Oa homeworld to the Corps and the Guardians of the Universe They run this whole operation OK you can fly now and your first job is tackling this evil exceptionally powerful being who s killed many experienced Lanterns already and destroyed two worlds You got all that Good Take care of business and we ll see you at brunch Jordan s training and introduction to the Corps is breezed through so fast it s a wonder if new audience members had any real idea what was going on Instead it s just a footnote in a movie that s so dedicated to following the established superhero origin beats that it never breaks out to become anything fun We meet Hal Jordan he gets the ring he receives his training he questions his role he saves some lives he gets in his first real battle with the villain and loses he questions himself again and then he s tossed into the final battle It s like superhero connect the dots I wouldn t have been so disappointed in GREEN LANTERN s laziness if it had been more entertaining But it s not It s mostly just stupid It s gaping plot issues have been covered in so many web articles that it s almost not worth mentioning here but come on how does Parallax a creature of immense power that nearly destroyed the Corps before escape so freakin easily He s not even guarded And the aliens that stumbled across him don t seem aware of the fact that they re toying around on a planet used as a prison for one of the strongest evil beings in the universe Its just whoops well he s out now Why did Hal use Carol as a decoy during their flight test when it accomplished absolutely nothing other than set him up as an arrogant jerk Why was young Hal Jordan allowed to run across the tarmac unattended moments after his father just crashed in a flaming inferno in the flashback Was there no one there who thought Wait a sec He probably shouldn t do that being a kid and all Why did it take so long for the government to respond to Abin Sur s crash His ship sits in the bay all day without notice until Hal shows up When a helicopter loses control and beings spinning dangerously over an open crowd why do they all just stand there slack jawed Why do so many things make no sense I know I m being nit picky and a few questionable decisions are allowed in movies in an effort to keep the ball rolling but GREEN LANTERN is full of so many that it s distracting There s many many more issues with the plot but those can be found elsewhere if you re interested I just wanted to emphasize how wrong this film had gone DC had better treat their Superman movie a little better if they re hoping to get anywhere in their film franchises once Batman s done I know the movie was plagued with problems since the beginning and I have faith in director Martin Campbell seeing as how he made two of my favorite 007 movies The director was talented the cast did well enough with what they were given and the Green Lantern canon is full of awesome movie ideas So what went wrong And more importantly will they try a little harder with the inevitable sequel,5.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2520246/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,"In Brightest day, In Blackest night, someone did not do Green Lantern Right!",With critically acclaimed Green Lantern centered events like Blackest Night rocking the comic book world expectations were sky high concerning the live action movie adaptation It could have been the one non Batman DC movie to be a major hit and the launch of a multi billion dollar franchise that would eventually lead to a much anticipated Justice League film Perhaps the comics did too good a job of elevating the Green Lantern tale to epic proportions For compared to that and even compared to your standard superhero blockbuster the live action adaptation of DC s favorite Emerald space man is an utter mess Ryan Reynolds effortlessly slips into the role of Hal Jordan a hot headed daredevil test pilot with a witty mouth Other than the fact that he crashed a plan and was almost fired from his job he seems to have a pretty good life judging by his hot girlfriend in bed and his expensive looking sports car In another part of the galaxy an ancient evil named after a visual displacement error Parallax escapes from imprisonment and seeks revenge upon the intergalactic peacekeeping force known as the Green Lantern corp One member Abin Sur survives the initial attack and crashes on earth Near death he bids his power ring to seek a successor who is supposed to be able to overcome any fear That successor so happens to be Hal Jordan Like any good wannabe superhero Hal goes from disbelief to confusion to rejection of his heroic calling and then to acceptance and embracing of his duty as quickly as he is spirited off to the alien world of Oa then back to earth space then earth again The first mistake Green Lantern makes is that it feels like two different stories pasted together On one hand you have the set up for this galactic scale conflict between an alien peacekeeping legion and an immensely powerful cosmic entity On the other hand you have a run of the mill earth based superhero origin tale complete with tacked on cheesy romance subplot underdeveloped villain and too much dialogue The producers chose to go with the latter since recent superhero movies that were comparatively more grounded in reality such as Iron Man or Dark knight did better than their less realistic counterparts But any fan of the comics would tell you that Green Lantern is anything BUT down to earth the galaxy spanning adventure is what sets it apart from most other superhero stories The producers failed to realise that Then in perhaps the biggest misstep short of giving a romantic Victorian drama film to Michael Bay they decided to have Martin Campbell be the director Campbell s resume includes only spy thrillers like Goldeneye and realistic adventures like Zorro shot on physical sets hardly the kind of guy you would want directing a visual effects laden green screen shot space epic Much less so a space epic written by FOUR different writers Too many chefs spoil the broth Thanks to this the movie cannot seem to decide what it wants to be It embraces the out of this world comic book look of the aliens and the CGI sets but never the comic book feel Sadly some of the special effects are painfully erratic with CGI scenes alternating between awesome and obviously cartoony Thankfully the Hans Zimmer inspired score by James Newton Howard delivers space age electronic tunes with a militaristic beat which complement the sci fi action perfectly However everything seems to screech to a standstill during the more conversation heavy or romantic scenes even the music stops The pacing of the whole thing feels like a race car in a city road The moment you hit a good adrenaline pumping speed you got to pull over at the next red light At least Ryan Reynold s enthusiasm and timely humor saves the conversations from being completely boring Many scenes seem to be an intended homage to previous superhero movies Hal invoking catch phrases like by the power of Greyskull to reacharge his power ring seems to be a reference to that scene in Spiderman where Peter Parker was learning to shoot web There is even a very clever homage to the balcony scene in the old Christopher Reeve Superman movie but with a humorous twist The writing however makes the Hal Jordan character likable but not easy to relate to despite Reynold s stellar performance Same goes for the other characters like Sinestro Hector Hammond and even Hal s love interest Carol There is a certain sense of disconnection between the characters and the audience relating to them Green Lantern is no doubt entertaining as a mediocre summer blockbuster but serves as a bad case of the right movie given to the wrong people to do It does the comic books little justice by providing only a cosmetic resemblance but few of the intrinsic elements that made them such a hit in recent years This film is more intent on following pre established trends than blazing new ones Instead of getting Star Trek with superpowers we get a poor man s Iron Man with green energy suit instead of armor What could have been a shining beacon among comic book blockbusters is instead reduced to just another lamp that flickers in the face of sky high expectations caused by over publicity and the critical acclaim the comics have been getting So much for the power of Green Lantern s light 6 5 10 round it up to

20 June 2011,"Alright, although I felt that Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively where miscast.",I liked Green Lantern but I was never a real fan of my DC favorites are Superman and Batman But was hyped when I heard there was gonna be a live action movie of this DC comic book superhero Ryan Reynolds was gonna the title role I thought he d be perfect and a cast like Mark Strong Peter Sarsgaard Blake Lively this movie is in the bag Ryan Reynolds felt out of place here after seeing him here Now he was not horrible and he does play it to the best to his advantage but he was miscast So was Blake Lively who also felt was miscast and her acting here says it all it s like she s sleepwalking through it Not to mention Reynolds and Lively have very little chemistry not enough to keep the movie interesting They re not bad but I felt they where miscast here maybe Patrick Wilson and Rachel McAdams would have better choices Now the effects where amazing the uses with the ring was watchable and some battle scenes are exciting Peter Sarsgaard steals the movie has Hector Hammond so does Mark Strong has Sinestro who plays it very powerful and not getting silly or campy It s not great like THOR or X Men First Class But still an amusing film,7.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446246/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2011,Seems that one of the best and most devalued DC Comic characters still being devalued,I really don t know anything about Green Lantern more than is shown in the Justice League animated series Fans are claiming it a fair adaptation based on the early years of the hero But for me as a movie Green Lantern gives the feeling that something is missing and there are a lot of reasons for that Being a Marting Campbell movie the same director of great action flicks such as GoldenEye 1995 The Mask Of Zorro 1998 Vertical Limit 2000 and Casino Royale 2006 I was expecting something much more fun and full of intense action interesting dialogs and an effective construction of scenes as people claim that Green Lantern is one of the best and most devalued DC Comic characters Also the screenplay has been written by 4 people so it s the necessary number to know that things weren t good enough and probably wouldn t be good enough in the end The intense industrial production of movies based on comic books is creating their own Parallax I mean it s being destructive for their own devouring everything adapting anything as possible just to fill their bank accounts giving zero attention for the quality When the new generation of comic book adaptations hit the theaters in the beginning of 00 s they were great because things were being planed for years The biggest fear of everyone was how far this would go It was just a matter of time till comic book adaptations become habitual And now this intense production is giving sings of tiredness The time between a screen writing and pre production to its release is incredibly short something about 6 8 months and we cannot ignore the fact that this is something that reflects its quality X Men First Class 2011 for example had been planed for years and is the best comic book adaptation of 2011 so far but it doesn t mean that it s the best comic book adaptation When making a movie studios try to achieve the biggest number of people as possible so it cannot be adult enough nor naive enough it cannot be intelligent enough nor stupid enough Everything needs to be in between Sometimes it works but sometimes not Also they are creating a comic book adaptation formula that isn t working anymore As David White says in his review I want superhero movies to involve something more than setting up a marginally interesting premise so that there can be more sequels I want to feel like something real is at stake After one hour of movie nothing happens and Parallax is just some hours before swallow entire Earth and then you realize that Green Lantern will have only 30 minutes to become the best super hero as possible even with just 2 minutes of training conquer the girl fight with Elephant Man and destroy a space monster that not even the best Green Lanterns were able to do but also destroy a monster that killed the king of Green Lanterns called Abin Sur That is absurd Not even the animated series makes Green Lantern so omnipotent The best part of the movie for me is when Parallax says that Hall is nothing without the ring because that s true and also Peter Sasgard that gives the serious tone that the movie lacks but also his talent and character are wasted in the whole movie Aside that there isn t a single scene that I could be amazed or breathless because not even the special effects are good enough and seems much more a rush jobbed thing than anything else maybe a result of the short post production time I ve said above and the lack of time for screen tests So I mean the movie isn t entertaining because it pushes too hard on the plot and things just happens incredibly fast in the last 20 minutes being hard to accept Also there is that thing about the Yellow Ring that leads to nowhere more than a 5 seconds scene so it makes you think that Oh we forgot about the Yellow Ring That s okay just put that scene and everything s fine and maybe we can resolve that on a 2nd installment People will not even notice that A lame and boring super hero movie Could have been excellent but not even 4 screenwriters were able to give it the tone Fans can accept it a fair adaptation for the elements used to define the character and his powers which seems a lot fair as some comic books fans have stated but in the end it s just another catch money machine a movie able to satisfy the comic books fans but not the other ones looking for a truly impressive action flick to give them real interest to the comics,4.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2452288/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,"Good, but drags in the middle and peter sarsgaard is awful",Overall i would recommend this film to others as good A healthy dose of comedy action and bravery Alot of sci fi aliens spectacular CGI goodness Alas the pacing of the film is flawed not enough to make it a bad film but enough to stop it being a great film There are plenty of great moments good characters story and and inspiring ending The villain of the piece or at least the human face of it is just terrible weird uninteresting and unsympathetic for a poor possessed being god knows what he was thinking with his acting style but the film needed a larger than life character we get a bumpy little freak with no personality at all perhaps next time they can have sinestro as the villain he was great So watch enjoy and ignore peter sarsgaard and his forehead of destiny,8.0,3.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445350/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Incoherent movie that makes no sense.,I didn t have much expectations of this movie I never read the comics but was ready to see what the Green Lantern is about Unfortunately the glaring errors and incoherent editing stood out like a sore ring wearing thumb I m not talking about any of the sci fi Hollywood action movie logic although there was enough of that I constantly had the feeling important scenes were missing which ended up giving the entire movie an disjointed feel The attitude of characters would change 180 degrees between cuts but you aren t shown why they change or how I like to think I m quite forgiving when it comes to errors in a movie Never let a fact stand in the way of a good story right But here it was very hard to maintain that attitude as there were so many of them The next bit contains spoilers How can a helicopter that is only a couple of feet of the ground all of a sudden have so much speed that when it crashes it plows through dozens of yards of people How can someone fly from Earth to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter yet still end up at the Sun My advice re watch Iron Man instead,4.0,16.0,37.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445438/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,"Good Comic-To-Film adaptation, but down by its flaws...",In brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight Unless you re a comic book aficionado it s unlikely that you ll be able to finish the Green Lantern oath off through simple guesswork but Martin Campbell s film is structured in such way to appeal to both comic fans and comic newbies alike The cinematic adaptation of the DC comic book Green Lantern follows a member of the Green Lantern Corps everyman Hal Jordan goes from being a test pilot to a universal peace keeper while having to juggle the conventional girl in between It is a fun and easy to enjoy comic book movie neither Campbell nor Reynolds take the film too seriously and it will no doubt be appreciated well by children across the globe but it s fun free loving spirit can t save the film from having an absolutely dire script an un even pacing during the second act which in turn drags the comic to film property from decent fanfare to adequate beginnings Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is a first rate test pilot who never seems to be able to live up to not only his own potential but others expectations of him as well Battling the various demons associated with his past he coasts through life and his job to the displeasure of many including his female co pilot Carol Ferris Blake Lively and that is until the Green Lantern member Abin Sur Temuera Morrison crash lands on Earth and chooses Hal as his successor Abin Sur is a member of an inter galactic peacekeeping authority called the Green Lantern Corps with over 3 600 members the group promises to protect all life forms in the entire universe s against evil and now Hal Jordan has been chosen as humanity s first member Armed with a ring a green lantern and almost infinite power which is driven through the strength of its participants will power Hal must join the Green Lantern Corps and prove himself as he battles the parasitic entity Parallax which feeds on its opponents fear Despite obtaining some criticism from writers and critics about Green Lanterns lavish and brightly coloured CGI and non CGI sets it does allow the film to set this planet apart from the other worlds in which other comic books envision Oa where the Green Lantern Corps central base of operations is situated is a brightly lit utopia fuelled through the will power of thousands It looks beautiful as the computer generated imagery really sets the city a part from other recently envisioned comic book realms While the characters themselves Sinestro Mark Strong Killerwog Michael Clarke Duncan and the Guardians of the Universe also establish themselves within the comic book universe with their unique and vibrant appearances allowing them to drive the film s plot along where needed but their characters are incredibly underused which is most likely a product of the fact that a Green Lantern sequel is no doubt being lined up ASAP but it is also a big drain on the film s impact While the CGI aliens and action heavy plot does its part to create a pretty easy going popcorn flick the human characters and the film s script do not Despite Green Lanterns running time being a mere one hour and forty five minutes due to the boring and drawn out second act of the film it seems like the film lasts a lot longer in reality While it is a Green Lantern Hal Jordan centric film very little time is spent even trying to intersperse a small amount of characterisation into the human characters of the piece Senator Hammond Tim Robbins Dr Waller Amanda Bassett and even the film s Earth trapped antagonist science teacher Henry Hammond Peter Sarsgaard are barely allowed any time to present and develop their own motives or thoughts This isn t helped by the film s exceptionally clich d and poorly written script which fails to not only add further depth to related characters but it also fails to provide Reynolds with enough humorous sequences to drive his comic book persona While Green Lantern does work on some levels it also fails on others and while the film is very easy going and enjoyable comic book adaptation it is also severely restricted by its slow moving poorly written middle segment which is then undermined further its frenetic conclusion,5.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446141/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,"It was bad, but... actually no it was just bad.",Five or ten years ago you could get away with really screwing up on your movie adaptation of a classic comic book superhero When Richard Pryor Richard freaking Pryor the comedian headlined Superman 3 or when Joel Schumacher raped Batman with a disco ball and made Bane wear a Hulk suit we could forgive those things because they were stomping on new ground anyway Nobody had ever done a successful third episode to a superhero movie franchise But ever since square one Marlon Brando and those sweet sweet Mario Puzo scripts that started it all with Superman 1 and 2 we ve known how to pull off at least a good start to a superhero franchise Not to mention the rabble of others since that have attacked us on all sides and managed to get things right Spider man goofy but good X Men hasty but solid Batman Begins dark and believable Iron Man charmingly ironic and even the Burton Batman which was a little too much purple and not enough black but still rocked pretty hard There s also a whole s storm of other ones that didn t work but at least showed us what NOT to do in the future Ang Lee s Hulk too avante garde and Gumby as the Hulk Fantastic Four Doctor Doom the single heaviest supervillain of all time played by some poser fruitcake from Nip Tuck Jonah Hex why and Catwoman Sharon Stone was a plastic surgery themed villain in that one So there was ample opportunity to learn from the past pick what worked and not doom the Green Lantern movie franchise from the start but apparently that opportunity wasn t ample enough So then why did this suck so much I ll start with the obvious NO movie is going to be good just from having CGI even a lot of CGI in it CGI hasn t really been mind blowing since Jurassic Park and hasn t even necessarily been a good thing since Star Wars Special Edition Correlary if your CGI doesn t look as good as the CGI in either of those films it s not even going to be very impressive I know Green Lantern s kinda predicated on computer generated animation and to be fair I d say some of what I saw in this film was pretty neat lookin but banking on people being too distracted by shiny rings and race cars to notice all the other crap I m about to rail on that made this film awful that s just bad business There was a good actor in this movie Mark Strong did Sinestro about as well as I d imagine anyone can we re not talking Shakespeare here right Everyone else blew chunks Actually that s not true there were a few seconds of the film where I liked Tomar Re the fish lookin lantern whoever did his voice in the sound studio gets a gold star Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan I doubt it He s dead on as Deadpool you know for the minute of dialogue they squeezed in for him in Wolverine but he s not really DC icon material The DC superhero universe only even plausibly stands up to its Marvel counterparts because its nucleic pantheon of 6 10 heavy hitting iconic characters Superman Batman Wonder Woman GL Flash are officially MORE super than almost any Marvel character comparable to them Superman s more iconic than Cap America Batman s more iconic than Wolverine etc When you make a Green Lantern movie you have to put a guy in that suit that commands respect not the dude who played Van Wilder in Van Wilder There were a few points in the film where the people around me cracked up presumably when they weren t supposed to like when Hector Hammond screams like a girl or when Reynolds tried to do the Bale Batman thing and talk in a deep voice to his throwaway female lead in that throwaway identity reveal scene in the middle of the movie Note to the creative team Try screening your movie before you put it out as it is you might learn how terrible it is before word gets out and a humiliating screen writing credit follows you around for the rest of your career This one will They put a bunch of easter egg cameos of other DC comic book characters in here some of them not directly related to the Green Lantern story God I hope that doesn t mean they re trying to seed this as the first in a line of badly written awkwardly paced bastardizations of what could have otherwise been good superhero films that eventually lead up to a monumentally bastardized Justice League movie like what Marvel s doing with the Avengers but where Batman wears gray tights Jason Biggs plays the Flash and Aquaman rides a big sea horse Somehow I imagine that was the intent though don t say I didn t warn you So in short your 6 to 10 year old might like it but if you do you have the good taste of a 6 to 10 year old Enjoy,5.0,18.0,39.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444698/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,"This is, without shadow of a doubt, one of the worst superhero movies of all-time. Who green-lit this? (NO PUN INTENDED).",Green Lantern 2011 where in the world do I begin Probably one of the most shocking things about this film is that it had a decent director Martin Campbell Now I m not saying every movie he directed is a masterpiece but he has directed much better films than this one This movie is so bad that it actually almost made my top 10 worst superhero movies list But it didn t aggravate me quite enough This movie has a dull cliched story abysmal acting cheap special effects boring sets locations and a generic boring soundtrack to attempt to try and tie together this diarrhea stain The story is once again your average superhero origin story Seen it Yes all movies are recycled plot lines but the point is to take the same idea s and to try and bring something different and fresh to it There is nothing unique or creative in the storyline of this film The sad thing is that the idea had such good potential But poor writing prevented it from shining As a result we get one of the most boring superhero films I have ever seen One thing to point out the main villain is named Parallax Seriously that s the name of the villain Sounds more like the name of a laxative Maybe that s why the villain looks like a piece of crap Or maybe he s just fighting the film itself That would honestly make more sense though This movie might just be 114 minutes but I felt like I was watching it for days The Green Lantern is a cool superhero I have never read any of the comics but I still thought that he was awesome When I first heard that this movie was in production I was of course excited So you can only imagine my disappointment when the film sucked in the end Most of the actors and actresses gave horrible performances Not even Ryan Reynolds himself could save it He wouldn t have been my first choice for the role of Hal Jordan Green Lantern but I stayed positive and said maybe if the writing and directing is good he might be able to pull it off Nope once again we have a substandard performance marred by poor writing and direction However there is one scene that always makes me laugh The part where Ryan Reynolds said ring Finger As he says that he flips the bird That got a chuckle out of me there s the classic Ryan Reynolds humor Where was it for the rest of the movie There are two actors that actually give passable performances in this film seriously Mark Strong as Thaal Sinestro and Jon Tenney as Martin Jordan Those two actors were the only ones who appeared to be trying Mark Strong is great as Sinestro and his performance is pretty much exactly how I envisioned the character Jon Tenney may have only been in this movie for a brief amount of time But whenever he was on screen his performance was decent but still a bit cliched All of the special effects are poorly done and this film was made in 2010 That was shocking There are some that work but the majority of them just look cheap and generic I ve seen movies and TV shows made back in the 1930 s with better special effects All of the sets locations are dull and boring even the planet Oa looked terrible There is also a lot of orange in this movie So I m guessing that the director or lighting director really loves the color orange huh Finally the soundtrack is a total letdown Well I suppose crappy movies deserve crappy soundtracks makes sense Green Lantern is one of the worst superhero films I have ever seen They had such good source material to work with yet they still managed to screw it up I m giving this film 0 out of 5 stars on my scale If I could rate it 0 stars I would but 1 is as low as I can go Ignore the 1 star rating my true rating is 0 stars Stay away from this movie unless you re a huge fan of the Green Lantern Even if you love the character and the comics you ll still be just as disappointed All you ll see is a flying green booger fight a flying piece of crap for a villain Life s too short to watch a piece of garbage like this,1.0,2.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5827517/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2023,NO,Martin Campbell made two Zorro and two James Bond movies but that in no way seemed to prepare him for this DC Universe film It took a long time to get this far as Warner Brothers had spent nearly 15 years working on ideas starting with Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino turning down the film Robert Smigel wrote a treatment with Jack Black in the lead but comic book fans hated that Ryan Reynolds who played Green Lantern Hal Jodan said You really need a visionary behind a movie like that but it was the classic studio story We have a poster but we don t have a script or know what we want let s start shooting It was also one of those movies that needed to be a big hit to even break even In fact to make money it needed to bring in 500 million Roger Ebert probably summed it up best It intends to be a sound and light show assaulting the audience with sensational special effects If that s what you want that s what you get The Green Lantern Corps which are a lot like the science fiction series Lensmen has protected the galaxy for billions of years Our sector of the galaxy 2814 has been protected by Abin Sur Temuera Morrison until the alien demon Parallax Clancy Brown escapes and mortally wounds him he passes on his ring power battery and oath to cocky pilot Hal Jordan Reynolds He works for Ferris Aircraft operated by his former girlfriend Carrol Ferris Blake Lively probably the only positive of this movie is that this is where she and Reynold met they later married in a plantation which is still kind of weird to me He soon goes to the home of the Green Lanterns Oa where he is trained by Tomar Re the voice of Geoffrey Rush Kilowog Michael Clarke Duncan and Corps leader Sinestro Mark Strong who doubts Jordan to the point that he goes back to Earth Meanwhile Senator Robert Hammond Tim Robbins has gotten the body of Abin Sur to his strange son Hector Peter Sarsgaard and as he s exposed to Parallax s energy his head starts to grow and his evil side comes out In the comics Parallax caused Hal Jordan to turn evil Here it s just a CGI monster to throw into the sun Reynolds hated the movie and working with Campbell who wanted Bradley Cooper and felt stuck with the actor who was happy when it combed How happy In Deadpool 2 he goes back in time and stops himself from taking the role Other than Amanda Waller Angela Bassett who joined the cast nine days before shooting other DC characters include Green Lanterns Hannu Apros NautKeLoi Norchavius Voz Larvox Morro MedPhyll R amry Holl Rot Lop Fan Boddikka Galius Zed Amanita Penelops Stel Green Man M Dahna Isamot Kol Bzza Lin Canar Salakk and Chaselon What no Ch P Katma Tui or Arisia,2.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9023695/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2011,"'Lantern' flickers, but holds some interest",From the Could Have Been Much Better dept The Green Lantern fails to shine like earlier graphic novel action adventure summer blockbusters Thor and X Men First Class but it is not for lack of trying It s for lack of a coherent script decent pacing and a clear storyline Directed by Martin Campbell Goldeneye Casino Royale with scribbling work by Greg Berlanti some TV series but no major motion pictures among others the film pays homage to the hero created by DC Comics in 1940 Engaged by the Gaurdians of the Universe to protect the 3 000 plus sectors of the known universe the Green Lanterns are currently battling an evil force the Parallax consisting of smog tentacles and a huge skull that feeds upon the fear of its victims After escaping from its forlorn prison chamber the entity defeats the head lantern Abin Sur Temuera Morrison but before his death Sur sends his special ring to find a new owner The ring chooses of course a person no one could have ever predicted the hotshot but arrogant erratic jet fighter test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds Adventureland The Proposal Stunned by his choice as one of the protectors of the solar system he s the first human chosen for such a role his fellow lanterns put him through the paces including being beaten up by Kilowog Michael Clarke Duncan The Green Mile and shunned by new leader Sinestro Mark Strong Sherlock Holmes The lanterns each have a special power of their own plus each can create things in their minds green imaginary things which enable them to defeat their enemies and escape dangerous situations Meanwhile biologist Dr Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard Boys Don t Cry Jarhead the son of a U S senator Tim Robbins is chosen to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur Infected by an alien organism inside the body Hammond becomes in turn John Malovich the Elephant Man and Kiefer Sutherland in Freeway After battling boyhood friend Hammond Jordan then has to prove himself to his lantern colleagues by taking on the Parallax and attempting to save earth from its fearful assault During all of this He is carrying on a tepid and lukewarm love affair with lifelong friend and fellow test pilot Carol Ferris Blake Lively The Town Gossip Girl TV series And this clear lack of chemistry thus begins a series of problems for this film The pacing as mentioned previously is almost non existent hyper kinetic at times and then slows to a snail s pace Situations also take place like the tension between Jordan and his family as well as his tender moments with his nephew and are never referenced to again Then it appears as if whole segments have been chopped out including a scene in which Sinestro inspires his troops to support his war against the Parallax and then suddenly a group of lanterns is gobbled up by the entity with little or no setup Reynolds a pretty face is appropriately muscular but cannot hold his own with other superheroes paling especially against Thor s Chris Hemsworth who himself pales against comic book movie actors Christopher Reeve Christian Bale Robert Downey Jr Edward Norton and Tobey Macguire It s an effort I had hoped would have succeeded since it looked as if it might from the trailer plus it s better to watch a good movie than a bad one But a series of seemingly unrelated scenes Tim Robbins berating his son a near fatal helicopter crash a birthday party an alien autopsy a rally of lanterns a jet fighter dogfight and scene between Jordan and Ferris taken right out of Superman continues to boggle the viewers minds This incoherence is not only irritating at times in a picture on the bubble like this one it s downright disappointing and ultimately becomes a deal breaker,5.0,2.0,7.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445646/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2011,A Courageous Effort,We re all a little spoiled with our movie going experiences these days I feel Even without the CGI which was spectacular and the cast which had several fan favorites both as characters and the actors portraying them this movie would have been a serious contender not ten years ago We ve had a glut of superhero movies in the last decade some phenomenally good The Dark Knight Iron Man and some phenomenally bad Catwoman X Men 3 The Last Stand We ve adopted a sort of attitude that a superhero movie isn t good unless it s great Sure we can say to ourselves and each other that we never expected it to be on par with Christopher Nolan s films but that s exactly what we wanted it to be And that s exactly what it didn t need to be GL tells the story of a cocky test pilot Hal Jordan who manages to disappoint several people close to him by crashing his plane during a test Despite this apparent failure on his part the risks he was willing to take during the test demonstrate the sort of indomitable will Hal possesses that makes him worthy to enter the Green Lantern Corps Hal is the first human being to ever be chosen for the Corps We re a young species unaware of any life beyond our own planet and rather arrogant besides That makes some of its more prominent members Kilowog Michael Clarke Duncan and Sinestro Mark Strong doubtful that Hal can fulfill his duties especially since the Lantern he replaced was Abin Sur Temuera Morrison their greatest warrior In the face of their skepticism and even hostility towards him even Hal begins to doubt that he belongs Meanwhile back on Earth Abin Sur s dead body has been recovered by the government Killed and infected by the dreaded being Parallax he is examined by scientist Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard who also becomes infected and begins to exhibit strange powers of his own as a result Jordan and Hammond are seemingly polar opposites one so self assured and charismatic that he can do anything he wants and the other so brilliant and yet so timid that all he can do is dream of what he wants It s a dynamic that sounds clich but that fits easily into the storyline and their eventual confrontation The problem is the movie doesn t spend enough time building their chemistry and relationship on screen Actually the movie doesn t have much time to spend on anything It s only an hour and forty five minutes which given how much ground and space they need to cover is not enough It needed to be at least twenty minutes longer not just to give the characters more time to develop but also to smooth out some very awkward segues between scenes Not that everything about the movie was awkward or rushed I actually think they did a good job with Carol Ferris Blake Lively relationship with Hal throughout the movie They establish their childhood friendship their past as lovers and their current balancing act as best friends and pseudo employer employee She s positioned to take over her father s company so she needs to put her foot down about Hal s seemingly careless attitude sometimes but she still helps him realize the difference between being fearless and being able to overcome fear which is the one lesson he needs to learn if he is ever to live up to the responsibility entrusted to him with and by the power ring The only real misfire with her character again was with her relationship with Hector Hammond It s another aspect of their particular triangle that could have worked if only they d been given more time More time is exactly what this franchise needs It laid a significant amount of groundwork for a trilogy especially with the character of Sinestro and his ruthless pursuit of what he considers to be the right path to justice It gave Hal Jordan an opportunity to grow from willful to full of will It was sort of the Iron Man 2 of the franchise if indeed it becomes a franchise more setup for what s ahead than establishment of what is more flash than substance though it certainly did not lack for substance DC and WB should not be afraid to follow up with a sequel or even a full trilogy because as Hal reminds us in the movie once you give in to fear you can never go back They want to branch out from Superman and Batman They want to compete with the Avengers and Marvel s full slate of superhero movies both planned and current Then they need to give Green Lantern time to grow into his role They need to take another chance another risk as they did when they made this one in the first place Now is the time to give the franchise the support it needs Just making this movie was a courageous effort it will take even more courage to move forward from here originally appeared at http fourthdayuniverse com reports,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446888/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2011,Sickly Green and not a lot of fun . . .,Of all the comic book heroes Green Lantern has a superpower would seem to be the most fun He wears a ring that gives him not only a super suit but also the ability to expel a green energy that can transform into anything he needs In the new film by Martin Campbell he transforms this energy into a racetrack to save a doomed helicopter and later into a giant machine gun to take down an otherworldly menace That s a good starting point but it is a tiny piece of a movie that gets lost in its own drama Green Lantern is of course a 71 year old DC comics property that until now I was completely unfamiliar with This is my introduction but it didn t make me want to study on it any further The move stars Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan a hot shot Air Force pilot and the son of a celebrated Air Force pilot who died years ago in front of little Hal s eyes Hal now an adult is following in daddy s footsteps although he possesses survival skills that don t make the military brass very happy As the movie opens he takes out two indestructible robot planes by forcing them to chase him into the stratosphere He takes out the robots but loses his own bird along the way On the same day he also comes across a downed spaceship occupied by a blue alien named Abin Sur Temuera Morrison The alien is near death and bequeaths Jordan with a magic ring and a glowing green lantern The ring grants him membership to The Green Lantern Corps an intergalactic union of peacekeepers from all across the universe Jordan s territory of course is earth At the same time a menace called Paralax which looks like a corroded octopus is released and is headed toward earth Jordan has to battle this beast while also dealing with a bucket full of personal issues His relationship with his girlfriend Blake Lively his daddy issues and a nerdy scientist Peter Sarsgaard who gains some evil superpowers while performing Abin Sur s autopsy If this all sounds overblown and silly believe me it is The problem is that the movie takes this silly plot with resolute seriousness especially in a moment when Reynolds stares into the lantern and recites the GL creed In brightest day in blackest night No evil shall ever escape my sight Let all who worship evil s might Beware my power Green Lantern s light This is a line that could only be performed with a cheesy grin unfortunately Reynolds is stuck with delivering the line twice and both times with aching seriousness In fact that s the problem with the whole movie it takes itself so seriously that there isn t any room for any fun It gets so bogged down in the business of training Green Lantern for the Green Lantern Corps and then the business of The Paralax that there is no time for Jordan to be amazed by his newfound powers Most of the movie is taken up with the business of Green Lantern s battle with a nerdy scientist named Hector Hammond whose body is infected while doing research on Amin Sur and becomes bloated and deformed His scenes are grotesque and unpleasant and drag the film into scenes that are bleak and ugly The look of the film too is ugly The production is dark and grim the skies are overcast one earth and in the realm of The Green Lantern Corps The cinematography has an unhealthy pallor of sickly nauseating green I understand that s Green Lantern s color scheme but as the main color palette of an action film it is very unsettling Even Green Lantern s suit looks a little unappealing making him look like a walking collard green Green Lantern is the fourth superhero movie that I have seen this year It is not as silly as Green Hornet It is much less humdrum than Thor and it is far less predictable then X Men First Class There are moments in this film that seem to point to a much happier production and I wish director Martin Campbell would have reached back into the campy origins of his superhero and make a movie that isn t such a downer of four,0.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447535/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2020,This movie is a masterpiece!!!,I love this movie a lot is one of my favorite movies of DC only what I don t love is that Ryan Reynolds interpret Hal Jordan and Ryan Reynolds is a funny actor and Hal Jordan is a serious character so that was the only thing I don t like of the movie But still Ryan Reynolds was good in this movie and he is a great actor,10.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6256216/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,A typically average DC movie,I know a lot of people berate this movie including it s stars but it s not awful just very average The plot felt clunky the dialogue was poor and the effects were average They definitely didn t get the most out of Ryan Reynolds there was practically no humour in this movie I would like to say that the DC movie producers have learnt their mistakes of 11 years ago but apart from a couple of exceptions DC movies in general continue to fail,5.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8217331/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2021,Dont Normally Write Reviews but..,The people who say this isnt a good movie know nothing about comic books but beyond the that this IS a good movie Ryan Reynolds was an excellent Hal Jordan I love how much Green Lantern lore was given to us up front The other level A actors in this movie also add to the awesomeness of it all I could go on and on about why people who dont like this movie are way off base and why I d love to see more Green Lantern and Lanter Corp movies Please Ryan Reynolds make this happen and maybe if possible add John Stewart to the mix,10.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6593403/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2012,"""Green Lantern"" is a very vapid, empty comic-book movie that fails overall, but is likable and watchable enough to see once",From director Martin Campbell Casino Royale The Mask of Zorro comes Green Lantern a silly vapid comic book film about a silly character with a downright silly power This Ryan Reynolds vehicle is pretty much dead on arrival save for a few likable characters and a few hilariously campy moments Despite being a bad movie it has some watchability and settles at average Reynolds stars as Hal Jordan a cocky fighter pilot whose father died quite humorously and over the top I might add in a tragic accident when he was a child He flies jets for Ferris aircrafts run in part by Hammond Tim Robins He is close to his childhood friends Carol Blake Lively and Hector son of Hammond played by Peter Sarsgard But he is reckless and haunted by the death of his father also a fighter pilot whom is killed in a flashback sequence At least in the extended cut of the film that I saw although I hear parts or even all of this scene are omitted in the theatrical cut At the same time an alien named Abin Sur a legendary Green Lantern guardians of the universe whom have special pseudo magic pseudo scientific rings that allow them to conjure up whatever they can imagine is injured by a ruthless creature named Paralax and crashes on Earth He finds Jordan and entrusts him with his power ring to take his place as a Lantern and despite hesitation Jordan gives in and decides to help stop the evil Paralax from destroying the world On paper though basic this isn t a bad set up for a fun little comic book adventure with some good action and great imagination and at times this film does have some good action and great imagination However it is also an extremely flawed film for a number of reasons and can never elevate itself beyond the level of meh Acting wise this film is very mixed I m not really Pro Ryan Reynolds or Anti Ryan Reynolds I like him in some roles while I detest him in others but here I didn t know what to think He isn t acting he s simply playing an exaggerated version of himself He s a wise cracking oaf who at times is completely unlikeable while at others times quite charming You ll hate his guts in one scene then love him in the next Lively is just a mannequin she is given no good lines or development to work with Robins tries but can t do anything with his bland material either Sarsgard is an enigma he is so over the top several times shrieking like a 5 year old girl in unintentionally campy moments yet at the same time still the most realistic character He ends up getting turned into one of the villains and he is fun to watch as a bad guy so he gets kudos Mark Strong stands out as Sinestro one of the lanterns who looks like an old fashioned depiction of the devil with red skin and a goatee and he actually plays his role quite well The script is a huge part of the problem of the film It s very very very poorly paced Nothing happens for nearly the first hour of the film at least in the extended cut where Jordan doesn t even get the ring until the 30 minute mark then doesn t do any heroic action for another 45 minutes then too much happens too quickly and the gravity of the situation never sets in The development is also troubling and riddled with inconsistencies and errors Particularly troubling is the first scene in which Jordan becomes a Lantern and starts training he trains for approximately 5 minutes of screen time not even in montage this is his first training session depicted in real time and it lasts less than five minutes and suddenly he just gives up and decides he doesn t want to be a Lantern This is one of his most unlikable scenes as it makes him seem like an enormous spoiled brat for giving up so outlandishly quickly Until 15 minutes later in the film when even though he only trained his powers for five minutes he is somehow able to save a huge party and perfectly use his powers before deciding he does want to be a Lantern This is a VERY messy film with a lot of logic and plot problems The film is well directed however Even though there is very little action what action there is is very thrilling and imaginative Some have complained that Jordon never does anything interesting with his powers but I disagree he uses his ring to conjure up all sorts of stuff cars jets drills giant fists mini guns springs that launch trucks through the air I thought the power was well depicted in the film Also Campbell does have a great sci fi flair and all of the outer space and alien world sequences are startlingly detailed and very epic They were almost worth the price of admission alone And even though the early CG in the film is bad all of the CG later in the film is very fine and very realistic This is a bad movie It was poorly written and horribly paced and characters were underdeveloped However it is a very pretty piece of eye candy the action is phenomenal there are some genuinely good jokes and some of the performances provide unintentional campy laughs So they even out the abysmal plot and elevate the film to a very watchable status I give Green Lantern an average 5 out of 10 It s a bad movie but it s a very fun to watch bad movie and I d say you should rent the Blu Ray for the effects and watch it once or twice with friends and a lot of popcorn then forget about it,5.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2576851/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2012,"Close to the best super hero movie there is, why close, I might have missed one :)",It was not the most enjoyable superhero movie close though there was built in depth which made it stand out from the nothingness Firs of the acting was super for the superhero genre I hail the genre don t get me wrong but here you could actually greet the actors as real actors That seems so little but honestly is a one very huge piece of miracle Green Lantern filled me with the hero feeling Ferris was like a girl I would fall in EASILY and the bad guy was a real person too I had feelings for him too The story was crazy and believable in the word of superheroes However I felt there was 3 hours missing from the movie still Campbell made a masters job to put that ALL in to reasonable not too confusing well crafted tight time frame I gave ten because this is so undervalued movie that it breaks my heart If something like this lightens my hart so massively this however would really break it in a positive way Reynolds staring Transformers with Megan Fox directed by Martin Cambell I could go with Ferrish and smile too,10.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2541662/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2011,Daft and predictable - young boys will love it.,Ryan Reynolds is an obvious choice to play a cocky womanising daredevil pilot he oozes charisma and has great comic timing the only two things required for such a role Unfortunately his turn as Hal Jordan the first human to be inducted into the Green Lantern an intergalactic force that keeps the universe safe isn t gifted with a strong enough story Director Martin Campbell who breathed life back into James Bond with Casino Royale offers a verdant superhero flick that never strays from the Superhero for Dummies handbook complete with a daft narrative prologue and a plot arc that is predictable to the point of tedium Despite this Lantern very nearly succeeds as a decent night out thanks to the imaginative special effects and string of tongue in cheek humour throughout Young boys will love it,0.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2481789/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2011,Good vs. Evil. Again.,Nothing special at all in this film A bored linear thing that anybody could predict from the trailer I did expect the green lantern you are limited only by your imagination idea to at least create some beautiful special effects and some real comedy But no all they did was bring forth weapons cars and walls I guess that s all for the imagination of the characters The plot itself is that a human oh lowly human is chosen by the ring that is never wrong to defend the Universe If this ring that feeds on willpower is never wrong and there is an entire planet believing that it is effectively their god Evil on the other hand feeding on fear doesn t have the same belief system and thus it is the enemy In the end the human successfully uses plot elements fed to him by the scriptwriters to trick the evil and win Even Red Riding Hood is more complex than that So the bottom line is that I don t recommend this to anybody that wouldn t read Red Riding Hood,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2514428/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2012,Green means stop,I really wanted to like this film being a long standing DC comics fan who always thought that the Hal Jordan Green Lantern character with his unusual super power of a power ring would be a challenging one to put across on the big screen Unfortunately this gaudy cacophonous blockbuster mock bluster more like didn t succeed due to the fairly common practice of most super hero films of dumbing down the action by investing no life in any of its characters throwing in predictable SFX battle sequences and overall failing completely to engage with the viewer As usual with this genre it takes at least a half hour for Ryan Reynolds to get into his greens and also as usual we get two menaces for the price of one the super brain of Hector Hammond and the fear feeding entity Parallax but none of their respective fight sequences convince There s the obligatory love interest between Jordan and his boss s daughter fellow pilot Carol Ferris played rather unmemorably by Blake Lively although at least there s a funny in joke as both she and Jordan s assistant see right though his rather thin disguise of an eyemask The effects are mixed in quality while I enjoyed the creations of GL s ring the depictions of for example flight or inter galactic landscapes looked pretty phoney to me I didn t rate Ryan Reynolds much in the title role he looks too slight in the part and never seems comfortable in his role The door was left open for a sequel involving the later renegade Lantern Sinestro but given the poor ish returns for this feature I m not convinced we ll see him return anytime soon It seemed obvious to me that Reynolds was bored in the lead part and I doubt he ll hurry up to sign on again Green Lantern was never quite in the upper echelons of the DC universe indeed his comic was cancelled for a time in the early 70 s but this attempt at rehabilitation like Marvel s attempts with say the Fantastic Four or Daredevil characters aims too low at its target audience and is a pretty boring uninvolving watch from start to finish,4.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2641325/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2018,I liked this movie.,Iunno why this movie got so much hate when its such a fun movie It was the first take on a hero on this scale and I thought it deserved a sequel Its a fun movie from start to end and its not your typical dark dull boring and slow DC film This movie had an MCU feel to it which is great That means you won t fall asleep I thought the two villain was alright Hector was the best of the two villains because he added a story to the film There are a lot of complaints about the animated suit I didn t see a problem with it It was nothing to cry about really The final fight scene is the highlight of the movie Overall a fun exciting movie for a DC movie,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4431097/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2015,An immensely enjoyable....,The powerful but arrogant warrior A decent comic book adaptation of the DC comic book character Green Lantern It s certainly not as bad as some critics have made it out to be It s fun the action sequences are flashy and exciting The acting is all top notch and the humor is done really well It s fun the action sequences are flashy and exciting The acting is all top notch and the humor is done really well Now let me begin by saying this film is not an amazing film It is definitely not an awful film like most critics are saying I think critics might have raised their expectations due to Thor and X Men First Class They should not compare the Green Lantern with those films It is ranked now 24 on Rotten Tomatoes which is way too low It would probably be in the high 60s if it was released before Thor and X Men First Class keenly waiting for second part,10.0,2.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3303062/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2011,A good fun Super-Hero movie for all.,Green Lantern 2011 105 mins Ryan Reynolds Mark Strong Blake Lively PEter Sarsgaard There have been very few times lately where I have gone to the movies and I was just giddy to see the movie I have been wanting to see a ton of movies in the last few years but the only one s that I have nearly lost sleep the night before I went were Lord of the Rings and the first installment of the Transformers franchise This was one of those occasions Growing up I had been a HUGE lover of the Green Lantern and the Green Lantern Corps comics so this both was one I couldn t wait to see but also one that had some lofty expectations in my mind to fill Sometimes movies like these deliver on exactly what you want LOTR and 1st Transformers and sometimes they are ok but not mind blowing 2nd Transformers This was INDEED one of those times where the whole movie met my expectations and then some I had a giddy kid grin on my face the whole time I was in the theater and still as I sit here thinking of the movie I am just amazed at the effects especially the planet Oa and acting especially Reynolds and Strong and cannot wait to hear the news of them starting to film part 2 So for those living under a rock for the last 5 months and haven t either seen the 1000 trailers on TV or haven t been to this site enough to see most of them here is a bit of a spoiler free synopsis The Green Lantern Corps is a group of intergalactic police officers charged with protecting the universe from all evil doers When a once overwhelming force of evil called Parallax is accidentally released back into the universe no one is safe even the home of the Corps itself Parallax takes it s revenge on the Lantern who imprisoned him and fatally wounds him causing him before he dies to flee to the nearest system and find a proper owner for his ring of power The ring itself searches for a proper wearer who is worthy of being a Green Lantern It finds Hal Jordan cocky fearless fighter jet pilot to be crowned new Lantern It s from here the movie goes on as it s now his duty to take on Parallax and grow into the Lantern he needs to be Basically it s a origin comic book origin story Every franchise has a movie like this and you gotta learn about how the hero comes to be and the back story of the powers etc This is no different but it keeps you interested and invested in the story from all aspects From Hal Jordan the person to Hal Jordan as newest member of the Green Lantern Corps The best effects and eye candy is when Jordan is on Oa doing his training and meeting other Lanterns You simply are in awe looking at it all trying to take in all the visual spectacle that is the heroic planet All in all it s a good movie It never over steps it s bounds to being overly confusing and doesn t over stay it s welcome It s got that usual Ryan Reynolds charm to it as well The little comedic quips and funny looks that just make you chuckle just a little bit Good enough to make it funny but not enough to make it a farce of itself The supporting actors are all good in their roles but Mark Strong as the strong GL Corps General Sinestro is strong and very confident He simply delivers an amazing performance that you will remember as much as you will remember Reynold s emerald warrior himself Verdict See this movie now then see it again later It was AWESOME You will get spine tingling goose bumpy goodness every time you hear the epic oath on screen It was great in 3 d and I cannot wait to get a chance to see it in IMAX when the local theater moves it over to the one screen they have Just a fun summer blockbuster and families fan boys and casual fans will enjoy It s a comic book super hero movie so don t go into this looking for some convoluted epic drama affair It does what it does well and you will leave the movie with a smile Family kid wise There are a couple of curses a middle finger and depending on your kids age Parallax might be a little scary but not overly so I think any school age kid whom can handle a few curses can see it no problem I cannot wait for Green Lantern 2 so we can get a ton of more action and fighting and more glimpses of the Corps It s always more of an actiony affair when you don t have to deal with going full into an origin story Stay for the end credits as there is a small scene a couple of mins into it but nothing after the credits Again say it with me In the brightest day in the blackest night no evil shall escape my sight Let those who worship evil s might beware my power GREEN LANTERN S LIGHT,9.0,7.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445347/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2011,Triumph of Wills,Do you have the slightest idea what a moral and ethical principle is Do you Jack Torrance Ryan Reynolds plays The Green Lantern a superhero who derives his power from a magical Green Lantern The lantern belongs to the Green Lantern Corps an intergalactic police force tasked with protecting the Universe from Evil Lanterns float throughout space and select Guardians those they deem to be worthy of wielding their power The Lantern s choice of choosing Reynolds a young brash wilful hot headed devil may care American baffles and angers others on the Green Lantern Board They quickly realize however that Reynolds courage in the face of fear strong willpower and never give up gung ho American attitudes are exactly what is needed to defend the Universe from Parallax a genocide loving space terrorist who inspires pure Fear As Lanterns allow their users to harness willpower and manifest any object their minds can think of the film ends with Reynolds defeating terror fear through sheer force of will It s Riefenstahl s Triumph of the Will in spandex with all the crypto fascist overtones and creepy allusions to Manifest Destiny and White Exceptionalism that the worst comic book plots trade in The original Lantern comics were inspired by a post WW2 period in which the League of Nations United Nations and various other border spanning bodies were created in an attempt to facilitate cooperation in international law and foster international security economic development human rights world peace and social progress In other words The Green Lantern Corps is the United Nations and Reynolds is America a super country whose hubris is shown to be deserved Uncle Sam Reynolds plays a military test pilot protects the world from evil see Meanwhile in the real world the organisational structure of the UN and international institutions such as the IMF World Bank and WTO etc disproportionately favours developed nations and are overtly designed to disadvantage developing countries The veto power awarded to powerful states in the UN Security Council and the IMF combined with the relatively low representation of developing nations in these institutions also results in an uneven ground for economic decision making So while these bodies like The Green Lantern Corps profess to protect everyone the truth is almost always the reverse Much of these bodies were formed as a response to the Holocaust and WW2 events which themselves influenced early Green Lantern Comics in the film Parallax is a giant holocaust addict whimsically wiping out whole civilizations But though the UN General Assembly repulsed by the sinister scale of 20th century war crimes unanimously passed the Genocide Convention in 1948 a Convention designed to stop and punish perpetrators who slaughtered victims the following half century was actually marked by not only a global increase in genocides but a world in which such events went deliberately uncontested Swiftly the UN s Never Again became Again and Again The US itself led the movement to build on the precedents of the Nuremberg war crimes trials enshrine the lessons of the Holocaust and ban genocide Overnight it became a global spokesperson speaking out against crimes against humanity taking charge of the Nuremberg proceedings and helping draft the Genocide Convention which embodied the moral and popular consensus in the US and the rest of the world that genocide should never again be perpetrated while outsiders stand idly by President Truman himself called for the endorsement of the Convention on the grounds that America had long been a symbol of freedom and democratic progress to peoples less favoured and because it was time to outlaw the world shocking crime of genocide In recent years this consensus has gained indirect support from the popular growth of a veritable cult of Never Again in the United States Meanwhile the creation of a Holocaust industry really a cult of kitschy sentimentality which salivates over death rather than actively confront anything has seen the establishment of a slew of Holocaust memorials and museums the Holocaust Museum in Washington is the most heavily frequented museum on the National Mall and an unprecedented burst of Holocaust related news stories and or entertainment In the 1990s there was in fact more stories on Holocaust related themes in major American newspapers and more Holocaust related films books and docs sold than in the preceding forty five years combined US leaders Carter Reagan Bush Clinton etc have themselves gone out of their way to pledge never again to let genocide happen But as this increase in rhetoric and rise in public feeling takes place the opposite happens in the real world Never Again doesn t only count for little but becomes a form of cohesive widespread social denial We don t repeat because we ignore history we lie to ourselves because we repeat and we lie deny louder because we repeated greater see The Shining the basis of opening quote The American consensus that genocide is wrong has not been accompanied by a willingness to stop or even condemn the crime itself Since the Holocaust the US and its Jolly Green Lanterns have intervened militarily or via less direct means across the globe for a panoply of purposes none altruistic and many resulting in widespread deaths And despite an impressive postwar surge in moral resolve the US has never intervened to stop the one overseas occurrence that all agree is wrong and that most agree demands forceful measures when Rwanda happened which it directed the US squabbled over bills Irrespective of the political affiliation of the President at the time the major genocides of the post war era Cambodia Bosnia Rwanda etc have yielded either virtually no American action condemnation or have been supported in the sidelines Regardless of all this Lantern is a generic action movie contains only one exciting sequence an early aviation battle and wastes an opportunity to milk the Lantern s powers This power could be taken in all sorts of cool areas but the visual possibilities are wasted 4 10 Worth no

18 June 2011,Fun,While the Green Lantern has never been one of my favourite comic book characters I have looked forward to seeing this film since I first heard it was on the cards It s good to see Hollywood adapting comic books even better when they do it well not just because I m a bit of a sci fi geek but also it is a huge improvement to churning out yet more remakes of old films For those unfamiliar with the premise the Green Lantern Corp is an intergalactic group of heroes who protect the universe with the aid of rings which give them great powers one of which includes solidifying whatever they imagine I m not sure if I explained that well enough but watch the film for a better description This film focuses on Hal Jordan an irresponsible hotshot pilot who is forced to mature up when he is chosen as the first human being to wield the ring and protect Earth from an evil threat that even the most accomplished of the Lanterns fear I felt the CGI was a case of hit or miss with some scenes coming off well while others seem a bit cartoony I do feel that perhaps this was a film that should have been kept to one side for another few years until CGI had improved enough to pull the suit off well And when will Hollywood realise that 3D is pointless and stupid There is absolutely no need for this film to be 3D keep it for kids animation or slasher flicks In terms of the acting Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan was not as bad as some feared He does suit the role of irrelevant over grown kid that the character starts out as although he did lack the depth to show Hal s serious side Mark Strong on the other hand was excellent as Sinestro an alien Green Lantern who is very doubtful of Hal until his faith is affirmed at the end I wish we could have seen more of Sinestro and his acting as a reluctant mentor to Hal Blake Lively played Carol Ferris Hal s love interest childhood sweetheart and who in the comic books will also one day become a superhero but her presence was barely felt She seemed to just be there to highlight how childish Hal can be and give the film some romance The plot was flowed reasonably well but there was no great depth to Hal s journey into becoming a great Green Lantern nor was there any great character development Perhaps if there is to be a sequel it should focus on another human Green Lantern John Stewart who is a character that is easier to depict without falling into the pitfall of making the film too light hearted This was a good film to see as an entertaining summer blockbuster but don t go in expecting to see Batman Begins we all know Bats is the coolest and no one can compare to him anyway or even Ironman which was far superior in balancing drama with action and humour If you do want to see a better depicted Green Lantern then check out the animated film or even the animated Justice League show However do check this out if you re in the mood for some light hearted entertainment,6.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445439/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2017,"""Are you afraid, human?""",Cocky test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is the first human recruited to join the Green Lantern Corps a centuries old intergalactic police force To the more experienced members of the force Hal is unlikely to ever live up to the standards of the Corps Even Hal doubts he can measure up Meanwhile an evil being known as Parallax has escaped from an underground prison The best and brightest of the Green Lanterns engage Parallax but are ultimately defeated As Parallax continues its deadly rampage across space it s on a collision course with Earth Without support from the rest of the Green Lanterns Hal is left on his own to face an enemy too powerful for the rest of the Corps I ve never read any Green Lantern comics so I m not very familiar with the character backstory or anything else Therefore I m not going to make comments on how faithful the film is or is not to the source material Considering all the negative things I ve read across the internet on Green Lantern I was surprised to find I enjoyed the movie as much as I did It s nowhere near as bad as I d been led to believe A few things that worked for me the overall story arc the handling of the Green Lantern Corps the uber creepy Dr Harry Hammonds and some of the action sequences and death scenes Speaking of death scenes when Tim Robbins is burned to a crisp it s one of the best moments in the whole film I also really liked the way director Martin Campbell and the special effects people involved with the film chose to image the Green Lanterns powers and bring them to the screen Very creative If some of the acting Blake Lively displays the emotional range of a rock and characters Ryan Reynolds plays Hal like the biggest ass on the planet Green Lantern might have been a much better overall film Still a 5 10 isn t all that bad for a movie that going in I thought was going to be hot garbage Having watched Green Lantern after Ryan Reynolds made Deadpool am I alone in looking at his portrayal of Hal as something like Deadpool lite It s like he used Green Lantern as a dry run of sorts for Deadpool It s not as over the top but there are similarities However with Deadpool it s funny but with Green Lantern he looks like a d k,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3866538/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2015,This movie deserve a better review score!,Well I will be quite direct Pros Loved the actors and their acting story of green lanterns is well presented is funny isn t very serious and I don t think it shouldn t Parallax is a bit scary but is fine with me maybe this it should be Cons I think the whole story shouldn t switched back and forth from Earth to Oa I think it should focus more on the hero theme and maybe a bit less than humane one Sinestro had no reason to become a villain at least that is what movie is telling us but maybe it was his personal choice I guess Overall like I said in the title this movie should have better score because he deserves it It teaches us how to overcome fear how to deal with it even in difficult situation I think that s what people should know about this movie People should take this movie more lightly and not to criticize so hard this movie It is a good movie,8.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3185796/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,I thought it was amazing! (3D is a must!),Let me preface this by saying that I have not read the comics I just got back from seeing the Green Lantern to find poor reviews on here and rotten tomatoes I think these are completely unwarranted I loved this movie I thought Ryan Reynolds was amazing and Blake Lively was OK I was really interested in the concept of the power in Will and Fear ANd let me say the animation was fantastic Not as good as Avatar maybe but better than let s say Tron It also had the perfect amount of action and humour to keep me interested and a good backstory so I could catch up on what s going on At the end of this movie I was literally stunned I felt as if I had been there in space with them the whole time and that I had just landed back on Earth Maybe it s not the best movie if you are comparing it with the comics or with Avatar CGI but I thought it was brilliant Just had to get that off my chest,10.0,10.0,20.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445116/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,DC HEROES got their fanbase in 1950-1960 are the creators of these films born in 1980 or later?,To me this film tried to cover the first 10 issues of this comic and character in one fell swoop Too much tech and the bad guys were the worst and least exciting of that period Other than the original The Flash TV series no DC comics character especially from the 60 s has been done justice on film or video The film starts by trying to impress upon us the main character is irresponsible and not as skilled as he believes he is and then spends more than an hour undoing that impression The original comics never had Hal Jordan in such an adversarial relationship with his fellow Lantern characters and that stuck in my craw the whole movie It s hard to give an up to date honest review of this film and other films based on most of the DC comics from the sixties because of this,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8779527/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2011,"Forget class rings and wedding bands, this is one ring you'll wish you had",A brazen man named Hal Jordan who tests the limits of everything he does including flying fighter jets like he s got nothing to lose has these impressive powers thrust upon himself and has to fill the shoes of an esteemed alien warrior named Abin Sur that crashed on Earth and is dying If that wasn t enough he s given the responsibility to protect the world with this little bitty ring from a monolithic entity called Parallax that feeds off of fear like a whispering voice that nags inside your ear and tells you you can t amount to anything before succumbing to its hungry jaws Mr Jordan has a few things on his plate to work out in his personal life such as continually disappointing those around him including his family co workers and old love interest named Carol who also works with him but grew up and he didn t Without having a chance to really think about what he s getting into by giving his word to the dying alien and swearing an oath to this weird green orb he takes what s happening in stride His powers come out of the ring by accident but it isn t until he s transported to this distant planet called Oa that houses the Green Lantern Corps does he really understand the scope and magnitude There are droves of others just like him that are assigned a certain area in the galaxy to protect except his position is unique because Earth is a younger planet that has never had a ring bearing guardian He s not taken very seriously and like something out of the Marine Corps he has to go through make or break training to prove he s up to snuff Meanwhile a hermit named Hector Hammond is taken to a secret facility to examine the body of the alien and in the process is infected by a contagion left over from Parallax from his battle with Abin Sur prior to crashing on Earth Hal Jordan and Hector Hammond are figuring out what their powers are capable of in interspliced shots They both crave their fathers respect and also have an eye for Carol except she only sees potential love in Jordan Now with Hammond s powers coming into fruition he decides to do something about it that doesn t include just asking her out because that s not what psychos do As a massive budget feature Green Lantern samples the board without being on top of its game with it all It s mostly easy entertainment that plays it safe and somewhat formulaic at times though it comes with a few challenges regarding not measuring up to what you re supposed to be and having to conquer yourself before you can beat your enemies It constantly plays on a relatability factor with the cool aspect of having unlimited power that s conjured up from the lantern ring by just using your will Any object you can think of such as a machine gun sword giant fist will come out of the ring in a green mirage that packs a physical punch or safety net to save innocents think of Mr Fantastic meets Bugs Bunny Unlike the realism in X Men First Class this requires more of your imagination to reach out such as traveling great distances so quickly everybody speaking the same tongue being able to breath wherever they go not one astronomer spotting any activity on these distant planets prior If you re a comic book reader this won t be a stretch as brushing over the details to accelerate an epic story has been happening since super heroes were first inked in space Ryan Reynolds retains a lot of himself here from past movies by giving out some of his typical one liners but on the other hand adds a fun element to what could have been serious subjects Peter Sarsgaard is almost unrecognizable as he keeps it downbeat and deplorable due to sinking further and further into something else Like Iron Man with Jeff Bridges character this attempted to include another big star face though Tim Robbins plays it stiff and safe as his role didn t require range or any likability The 3 D gave a chance to show off some of the outer reaches of space with nearly pure CGI shots of planets that jut out and are painted with various splashes of color Some of it is detailed though the other parts look somewhat dated and almost what you d expect out of a video game instead Not all of the movie required 3 D as a share of it was a building process to a concluding battle where the results felt somewhat inevitable and predictable That s one aspect a sequel could include more of more action in between that doesn t have to be crammed at the end instead of distracting with token love interests and unnecessary quirky buddies on the side beforehand Also submitted on Cinema Freaks http docuniverse blogspot com,5.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2453232/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2014,Not good for a Marvel movie...,Green Lantern is a movie which is based on the comic hero of Marvel Green Lantern who was a test pilot and he was granted with an alien ring that bestows him with otherworldly powers and that inducts him into an intergalactic police force I did not really like this movie because it was not what I expected to be I expected to be a true transfer of the hero Green Lantern and not like this First of all the hero Green Lantern in Marvel was colored and not white that was something that I did not like I also did not like the interpretation of Ryan Reynolds who played as Hal Jordan and Green Lantern I also did not like the special and visual effects which used to this movie Finally I have to tell you that if you are a fan of Marvel and its heroes then I really believe that Green Lantern you will let you down too,5.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2952951/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2011,I suspect die-hard fans won't be bobbling up and down in their seats when the end credits roll.,Another week another superhero movie to catch on the big screen This time it s green but it is not huge and not by Marvel Comics Truth be told not many people know of Green Lantern unless you are someone who feels that life is not worth living for if one doesn t know these super cool guys If it is reassuring I am not one of these fanatics Thus watching Green Lantern for me is more of an exploratory experience than something I would be giddily excited about Though I suspect die hard fans won t be bobbling up and down in their seats either when the end credits roll Green Lantern for all of its conceptual creativity is still a relatively weak genre film And with the blockbuster gale in our midst this film will not blow audiences away but be blown away to Oa instead Oa as you will see is a distant planet far away from Earth where Ryan Reynolds character Hal Jordan to his incredulous disbelief will fly there to undergo training to be part of the Green Lanterns an intergalactic peacekeeping force of sorts whose superpower comes not only from the green ring they wear but from their willpower Directed by Martin Campbell who famously rebooted the James Bond franchise with Daniel Craig in Casino Royale 2006 Green Lantern however is not always a joy to watch It is still fairly entertaining and for a first installment in a planned trilogy the setup and storytelling is at least straightforward and clear The chemistry between Hal and Carol Blake Lively who is his colleague at the Air Force and his romantic partner is cheesy but minimal though attempts at humor fall flat more often than not The film s biggest flaw is in its treatment of its villains of which there are two The first one is Hector Hammond who is played by a sneering Peter Sarsgaard He seems to transform into the evil cousin of the Elephant Man too late into the film Thus his presence is more perfunctory to the plot than someone we truly fear The other villain called Parallax a huge octopus like monster alien that is almost as huge as the alien spaceship in Independence Day 1996 is considerably more menacing It comes from outer space and it feeds on fear and gives the film s climax the requisite epicness it needs Green Lantern s visual effects is fantastical and at times cartoonish looking which somewhat fits with the general campy experience that we get from the film I must say that the superpowers of Green Lantern are quite eye opening with the use of mind and will power instead of sheer physical strength or high tech weaponry Pity he has to constantly remind himself to recharge his ring with a portable green lantern It must suck to go about saving the world knowing you have to do that every morning If you are still in two minds whether to catch this I say wait for the DVD release Or just read the comics I bet they are much better GRADE C 6 5 10 or 3 stars www filmnomenon blogspot com All rights reserved,6.0,2.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444787/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2019,A Genuine Super Hero,2 July 2011 Unlike Tom Cruise in Top Gun 1986 Ryan Reynolds character is presented as a genuine human being that isn t scripted over the top melodramatic two dimensional character Even though Hal Jordan Reynolds is the masculine over the top narcissist this character maintains a delicate much more complex and even somewhat underplayed character making the star attraction even more acceptable and believable Unlike Batman movies unlike almost every other superhero Hal is authentic in his nature Even Peter Skarsgaard as Hector Hammond is the movie s nemesis is given a believable character development unlike those found in Spiderman 2002 and Willem Dafoe s Norman Osborn The fantastic otherworldly set designs are superior in their innovative vision that sets it apart from Avatar 2009 Star Wars The Phantom Menace 1999 What is accomplished is that Ryan Reynold s humor originates from not comedic nature but just from the more difficult nature of events and circumstances and retaining the character that he is making this movie even more balanced and mature There are great emotive subplots going on here that aren t exploited and there is an immediate harshness unlike Spiderman that aren t unwieldy or saccharin Only three technical but small weaknesses earlier in the movie became apparent the unnecessary Star Gate 1994 motiff the reverse alien leg design from The Arrival 1996 and the incongruity of Reynold s character receiving universal knowledge but still having to ask questions Overall this is a great fusion of less known superhero but as such it brings with it a potent and serious punch to this genre,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4589209/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2011,Utterly awful,I used to like Green Lantern when I was a kid in the 60s and was quite looking forward to this sadly due to an utterly abysmal storyline p ss poor acting and p ss poor actors we ended up with this tripe I admit I can t remember much about the Lantern from the 60s but he must have been better than this The ring which was supposed to be infallible sure as heck wasn t when it chose the plank of wood who was the star of this film Choose wisely said the dying alien and with the pick of billions of souls throughout it s sector it chose the guy round the corner who had just won an air battle by crashing his plane Yep a total dumb ss with an ego the size of the Milky Way We witness through the turgid next 2 hours his coming of age as a responsible Lantern and his final battle with the baddie Yes it s meant to be camp and trite as it s a comic book but surely all the real actors can t have been booked and whatever chimp wrote this script should be returned to the jungle and his typewriter given to one with at least two brain cells Not quite as bad as the two Iron Man movies or Thor but not that far off Yes it s nice to see the comic book heroes of my youth brought to life but do they all have to be complete moronic asses who exist within a storyline written by a monkey on the back of a Chinese menu,1.0,2.0,10.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2493051/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2011,"Good for the visuals, but nothing unique.",To be honest there is nothing really about this movie that sets this apart from many of the other films out there Okay the effects looked good and I did enjoy the movie but beyond that it is simply what one would expect from a superhero movie Basically big bad guy comes onto the picture to lay waste to the universe Then an unlikely person becomes a superhero The bad guy then comes to destroy Earth and then after an epic battle the superhero wins and we all go home again or put it back on the shelf Basically a movie to entertain you for about an hour and a half and that is it Well then you may ask what exactly is it about It s about some guy call the Green Lantern and it is based on the comic books of the same name The Green Lanterns are a universal peacekeeping force and when one of them is killed by the bad guy a giant skull type beast with smoke swirling around it who goes by the name Paralax and his ship crashes to earth Suddenly our hero is chosen by a ring the alien is wearing and drags him to the crashsite where our hero takes the ring and a lantern and escapes However because this is an alien the government gets their hands on the body and brings a scientist not necessarily the best but since his father is in high places he gets the job to perform an autopsy While performing the autopsy he picks something up and he also gets super powers However it is like anti superpowers I should explain the movie has the good force known as will and the bad force known as fear The good guys the Green Lanterns harness willpower to defend themselves against fear The scientist is a classic geek and one who resents being laughed at for all his crazy ideas This is the type of guy that when he gets superpowers he uses it as an opportunity to get back at those who laugh at him and this includes his Dad Becoming a bitter and twisted man he lets loose on the city which summons the Green Lantern However their fight summons that big bad guy Paralax to Earth I do find it interesting that there are always these two contending forces good and bad dark and light fear and will though I am not sure if willpower is the opposite of fear but then darkness is not the opposite of light but the absence of light which could suggest Willpower is the absence of fear but I digress Pretty much that s the movie As I said a lot of eye candy and nothing to really deeply discuss so I guess we will leave it at that,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2506445/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2011,Don't bother if you are over 15 years old,Like many didn t have great hopes for Green Lantern but I really wanted to like it I still came out of the theater disappointed If this is DC s attempt to compete with Marvel s summer blockbusters they have to learn from the mistakes of this movie We have a hero in Ryan Reynolds playing the typical Reynolds role a wise cracking good looking guy afraid of committing to anything He plays it well so I don t have a big issue with this even if we have seen it before Blake Lively plays the love interest she looks great but her performance is painful to watch For the first half of the film it seemed she didn t want to be there she was simply reciting her lines Reynolds has far more chemistry with his nerdy best friend in the movie played by Taika Waititi The villains firstly Peter Sarsgaard plays the anti Reynolds and I liked his performance although he could have been more vicious and threatening he comes across as enjoying his role and I would have liked to have seen more of him The big baddie and my biggest issue with the story is a CGI fear entity called Parallax My problem is this supposedly terrifying entity never really makes any sense It dispatches with a group of the most hardened Lanterns in seconds but when faced with Hal Jordan and his 5 minutes of training or getting his butt kicked by some Lanterns it can t land more than one hit and is destroyed in about 5 minutes Hard not to think to yourself well that was easy To sum up this is a slightly dumb movie that if you get free tickets to you should make use of them but I wouldn t spend any of my money on it,5.0,11.0,23.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445180/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2011,"""Green Lantern"" has lots of polish, but no distinct shine",The challenge of making a Green Lantern film was always going to be bringing it down to Earth Not necessarily in a planetary sense but sifting through and boiling down all the intergalactic mythology Everything from the planet Oa to bird fish aliens named Tomar Re to a far fetched concept of harnessing will to defend the universe had to be accounted for Blending all that into something your typical non geek audience could stomach had to prove no simple task The resulting puree is surprisingly digestible but ultimately too bland for most tastes Green Lantern is hardly the disaster some have made it out to be but it does rely heavily on its viewer having an innate interest in the subject and lore at hand Not unlike Green Lantern s power the ability to convert what s in the mind into matter the audience s imagination becomes critical to unlocking the potential of the story Director Martin Campbell Casino Royale and the creative team have put serious effort into envisioning the sci fi elements of the film but they aren t likely to spark anyone but a child s imagination The approach taken to the film could be described as paint by numbers in the sense that the film says and does what it needs to in order to make sense move along and express the themes of overcoming fear but the result feels uninspired Green Lantern lacks an it factor something to make the story and characters take root and bring the audience on an emotional journey alongside the intergalactic one Green Lantern tells the story of how human Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds a cocky fighter pilot gets chosen to become part of the Green Lantern Corps a group of several thousand peacekeepers and defenders of the universe who harness the power of will to conquer evil This happens when Abin Sur a dying purple alien as Hal calls him crash lands on Earth after escaping the clutches of Parallax a fear feeding destroyer of worlds in the form of a billowing spirit Abin Sur s ring chooses Hal who must learn to embrace his destiny as a Green Lantern despite concerns that he might not be as fearless as he leads on All that doesn t include Carol Ferris Blake Lively an old flame of Hal s who is emerging as the heir to her father s fighter jet industry and Dr Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard a scientist living in his father s Tim Robbins shadow who becomes infected with part of Parallax while examining the body of Abin Sur One might say that s sub plot overload and they would be right but the film actually paces itself effectively stays interesting and doesn t fail any of its characters entirely with bad writing or dialogue The consequences instead show in the film s inability to hook its audience emotionally We care about Hal but Reynolds hardly gets any time to truly develop the dimensions of his character because the plot keeps chugging along and bouncing around His hero s journey never becomes fully realized It s as if the characters never have time to just be themselves Although the 105 minute run time seems impressively short at first glance an extra 15 minutes of character development wouldn t have offended anyone and possibly done wonders It s not as if the cast is unimpressive they do well with what they have to work with Humor also lacks in the film unexpected for anything starring Reynolds There are moments when he gets to do his thing but they come more in ad lib form than being creatively written into the story A chief difference between Green Lantern and this summer s Thor two other worldly superhero stories would have to be the degree of self seriousness Thor had a surprising amount of levity to counter its overbearing mythology which Lantern doesn t have Yet another difference between what Marvel has done with its properties compared DC Much like Hal s downfall during his training on Oa with Kilowog and Sinestro the criminally underused character played by Mark Strong the film s limit in imagination caps off its potential All the entertainment value in the world which Green Lantern has in spades simply can t counter its inability to inspire You can follow the film with ease enjoy the unique action sequences without rolling your eyes and genuinely like the characters but there s no denying something s missing from the finished product to elevate it to level of many of its superhero film contemporaries Steven C Visit my site at http moviemusereviews com,6.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447113/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,After all these years I still love it,I am still shocked that it is still not liked very much From day 1 I ve blamed Peter Sarsgard s portrayal of the nemesis too cutesy comical smiling chuckling grinning etc I watched the whole movie once skipped the Hector scenes confirmed to myself that that was a big negative for the film Green Lanern is 1 of the 6 founding members of the Justice League Green Lantern Superman Wonder Woman Batman Flash Aquaman So to make a Justice League movie without Green Lantern is just plain wrong,10.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5503548/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2011,Green what?,A huge disappointment I just came back from watching it and it just feels PAINFUL to have wasted this much time of my life First of all a super hero is commonly based on his childhood and how it changed him in a way that makes him unique Batman watches his parents die Spiderman sees his uncle die Superman s parents send their son to Earth because their planet is in peril The stories go on Green Lantern hangs loosely on his dad s death During some parts of the movie Green Lantern is recalled about his dad s death and is somehow used as a lame excuse to call Green Lantern a super hero I would personally say Super zero The story of his dad is not convincing at all as he shows to great affection towards his dad except for the picture he carries in his jet at the beginning of the film We seldom hear from his dad again Secondly I find it hard to believe that this movie cost around 200 000 000 as the actors seem weak and untrained the settings look cheap and the script somewhat resembles a horrific parody of Green Lantern Ryan Reynolds did not convince me about GL s personality In fact he lacked all of it What does GL like What does he dislike How is he changed by his environment WHAT MAKES HIM SPECIAL WHAT IS HIS WEAKNESS And many more questions pop up in my mind Blake Lively Stay in Gossip Girl please I really didn t like her for the role of Carol Ferris as she like Ryan Reynolds does not portray the character as it should be I really don t know how Tim Robbins signed for this film as it bring his whole acting reputation just a tad down Poor performance from all of the actors not to mention Peter Sarsgaard He was not born to be this villain I m sorry Thirdly the 3D effects are just blindly bad I watched 90 of the movie without the glasses because it looked like I was wearing SUNglasses Some of the scenes were 2D so no excuse for charging extra The sound of the movie was 5 10 Lastly I really don t know who decided to write the script and who to edit it but they did a really really poor effort I really can t think of anyone that would be sitting in their seat after watching this film going WOW WHAT A MOVIE I really can t The storyline is lousy It takes the movie 100 minutes to show us who this Hal Jordan guy is why he has been chosen not clear as nobody knows his weakness not even him OR the ring The editors and the screenplay writers then decide that it should only take 7 minutes to destroy the bad guy and then another 3 to show how the other lanterns care for Hal Jordan Then 30 seconds to kiss the girl and OH another 30 seconds for the TOTALLY UNEXPECTED SCENE AFTER THE CREDITS Really pathetic excuse for a super hero movie Warner Bros please step up your game,0.0,6.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2477108/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2011,Better Than Expected!,Although slightly corny a couple of times this movie was actually very good This movie had every element action love hate comedy etc I laughed multiple times and enjoyed the action scenes quite a bit The villain a good guy gone bad and turned into a roiling cloud of Fear and evil was actually quite disturbing especially when it would suck the souls from it s victims The action was intense and thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat yelling advice at the hero And for once someone saw through the ridiculous mask and recognized Hal for who he was He talked with his friends for advice and pretty much saved the universe Overall this was a very enjoyable film which I will probably watch again,8.0,1.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2535100/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,Simply Terrible,Flash Review It should have been titled Gangrene Lantern as this should be hacked out of the superhero genre If this doesn t stunt or end the growth of the Green Lantern series I don t know what will Overall it was very disjointed The scenes between the alien world and earth felt like two different movies It is poorly paced and written and it created zero emotion between viewer and the characters The main important alien clan felt underdeveloped The special effects were substandard for a movie of this scale and budget I swear when people were walking on a surface in the alien world that the ground had the properties of a gymnastics tumbling mat Many creative concepts in the movie didn t have the right tone and or weren t intriguing or oddly goofy I had low expectations and it failed to eclipse them,3.0,0.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3771207/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2011,Beware his power...Green Lantern's blight.,In the Lost Sector of Space the fear empowered entity Parallax escapes from where he was imprisoned by the Green Lantern Abin Sur Parallax spends the next six months consuming entire civilizations before tracking down his jailer in space sector 2814 for some payback In the brief struggle Abin Sur is mortally wounded and ends up retreating to Earth the nearest inhabited planet Once here he charges his ring with finding a suitable replacement It settles on test pilot and all around cool guy Hal Jordan As Hal deals with this xeno biologist Hector Hammond is called on to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur accidentally becoming infused with residual energy from Parallax Hal initially resists his new calling while Hammond embraces his newfound power This leads to the inevitable confrontation where Jordan trounces Hammond feeds Parallax to the Sun and saves the Earth before heading off to patrol his slice of the cosmos That s the story Despite what the critics are saying Green Lantern isn t a horrible movie But it s also a far cry short of great This could ve been a major summer event but too many elements drag it down and into absolute mediocrity First the only thing that worked about Green Lantern is the lead Reynolds did a credible job as G L Even more importantly he nailed Hal Jordan as someone wielding a cavalier attitude to hide some pretty heavy emotional issues So be it getting his butt kicked in the parking lot of a bar or cruising the stars Reynolds managed to carry this film Aside from him however nothing else quite clicked Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard was too much like the poster child for high school reject syndrome Carol Ferris Blake Lively looks more like a little sister to Hal than a viable love interest and peer The government conspiracy angle as represented by Amanda Waller Angela Basset served no real purpose and felt shoehorned in The stuff on OA was underwhelming and seeing Jordan as just one of 3 600 G L s felt like a waste of CGI Not to be left out are the energy constructs that while workable in animation and on the comics page don t necessarily hold up in live action The biggest problem though is how derivative everything felt G L was kept planet side and robbed of the cosmic edge which makes him unique in the DCU So you re left with a hodgepodge of the world saving antics of every Superman movie the recklessness and self loathing found in Iron Man the romantic beats that feel ripped from Spiderman and a pinch of the parental abandonment issues found in Batman Begins So the script the direction the action and the special effects were pretty much all unremarkable However this brings me not to the screenwriters the director or the F X crew I instead find myself looking to Geoff Johns He s the Chief Creative Officer CCO of D C Comics and serves as a co producer on this film But before any of this he is a gifted writer who has left his mark on several of D C s major franchises One of the characters he s helped to redefine was Green Lantern beginning with his 2005 retelling of Hal Jordan s origins And it was Johns material this film liberally borrowed from However his take on G L definitely is not the best fit for the big screen The optimal fit would ve been Green Lantern Emerald Dawn This six issue mini by writers Keith Giffen Gerald Jones and artist M D Bright came out in 1990 and dealt with Hal s standing as a green Green Lantern The story was streamlined stuck him on OA and fully fleshed out who the Corp is and what they do most notably with Kilowog and Tomar Re The capabilities of the ring were better defined with them still being vulnerable to yellow It even provided a worthy adversary who afforded Jordan the opportunity to prove himself as THE Green Lantern With a three act plot begging for adaptation this would have been the movie to put asses in seats and keep them there Unfortunately it s not the one written by Geoff Johns I find it hard to believe the CCO of D C and co producer of this film didn t push to have his work adapted to the big screen as opposed to an older one that would be more approachable to an audience who may not even read comics So instead of what might have been the beginning of a viable franchise on par with Batman Begins we get this rather inert production which doesn t work But I don t hold a grudge This is just a rookie mistake any creator in a newfound position of power could make when they re insulated by success If Johns has this opportunity again I hope he learns from what went wrong here and is able to take any traces of ego out of the equation So if you want to read the excellent G L movie that could ve been track down a TPB of Emerald Dawn at the local comic s shop or bookstore There s also the two animated DTV s First Flight and Emerald Knights No they aren t perfect Regardless they still have a much better understanding of what makes this property pop than this movie does If by some lark Green Lantern manages to make enough to warrant a sequel I hope the studio sees fit to address these issues rather than do a reboot The next chapter if done properly with regards to the needs of this medium can redeem the property and serve as the start of a franchise Another reboot however could spell the end of this genre since movie audiences aren t as forgiving as those who follow the comics,6.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2460210/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,Martin......whats wrong with you man?,Whaaaaaaaaaat Well I am a big fan of DC Comics and yes of course the Green Lantern The recent animated movies and by that I mean First Flight and not to mention the comics have always managed to keep me riveted When I heard that there is going to be a movie on him I was so excited that I wanted to watch the movie real bad The trailer seemed so promising I was elated when I found great names served in the same bowl Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Tim Robbins Mark Strong and Peter Sarsgaard I had high expectations Don t have that I was so much disappointed by the flick I couldn t believe the director Martin Campbell can t believe he is the guy who directed awesome movies like Casino Royale Goldeneye and The mask of Zorro got all clumsy mid way The story was almost the same It went actually pretty good albeit with some lame acting Parallax had affected Peter and had metamorphosed him into a diabolical psychic who seemed so promising that I wanted a fair fight against him and Hal But it got over so quickly that I didn t have a chance to even root for him The training part trained Ryan so fast and well that I was like What the When the Parallax invaded earth I wanted it to be goddamn destructive I wanted to see maximum annihilation and some breathtaking scenes in the end but I was surprised by the fact that Ryan had the blob in his platter with a simple thought which he had learned during his training Before the adrenaline could even pump it was pacified by the last scene Sinestro played by Mark Strong said that he would try vanquishing Parallax with his fearless army of green lanterns but goes out on the battlefield with only a couple of green lanterns who get their ass kicked big time The Guardians prepared a yellow ring which was never used I was like then why go for all the trouble bro I felt deceived duped and cheated big time However the story was really great had it been directed by the likes of Nolan Slade Vaughn Cameron Snyder or any other thoughtful directors it would have been a huge hit Blake Lively tried her best but I didn t expect much from her either Tim Robbins had such a small on screen role that it makes one wonder Was he even there While Ryan tries to hover around hither and thither in the movie there are only a few scenes that had great 3D effects and which had me drooling the rest was pretty lame I kept on watching Sinestro eventually as I wanted to be hinted how he turns foul but that never happened either I d rate the movie as an average flick The green was not enough should have tried another because it was all god damn colorless,6.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449713/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2012,"In brightest day, in blackest night, No evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil's might, Beware my power Green Lantern's light!",Superhero films are a common stable of blockbuster cinema ever since 2000 but it is a genre that dominated by Marvel and DC have been lagging behind The Christopher Nolan Batman films have been their only real success DC and Warner Brothers hoped to redress the balance by starting up the Green Lantern series For millions of years they has been a organisation that has been guarding the universe The Guardian They have been able to cultivate the green energy of willpower and form it into rings for people who are fearless to act as a galactic police force the Green Lantern Corp But an old threat has re emerged the entity of yellow fear Parallax Clancy Brown and it able to kill the Lantern s best agent Abin Sur Temuera Morrison On Earth Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is a arrogant test pilot who is a very immature and reckless He seems a unlikely candidate to be Abin Sur s replacement but he is the next Green Lantern the first human to earn the role He has to learn quickly on the planet of Oa being overwhelmed by his new responsibilities Also on Earth a secret government organisation find Abin Sur s body and biologist Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard has to do the autopsy But during it he is infected with some of Parallax s DNA Hammond develops psychic powers and Parallax s dark side affects him As you can tell there is a lot of different story elements and the film makers did not seem to know where to focus their attend Even in the Extended Cut it was a lot and the Extended Cut was only around a hour and 50 minutes Sometimes films can fit a lot in a short package like Wall E Rise of the Planet of the Apes and X Men but Green Lantern does not seen to manage that The seems to be a clash of tones from being very serious and dark to a be light and humorous I am sure that Martin Campbell wanted to make a serious film seeing he is normally a serious director but the producers saw the success of Iron Man one of Marvel s lesser know characters and he was turned into a successful film series and wanted make a more lighter film The tonal shift was particularly noticeable between the scenes on Earth and the scenes in space As a film Green Lantern did not know who to focus on having too major villains that do not really do much We have Hammond who could have been a mirror to the Hal Jordon having to get use to the new powers he has acquired and acting as a origin story for him as well Or the story could have focused on the unstoppable force that is needs the whole of the Green Lantern Corp to stop them forcing their leader Sinestro Mark Strong to explore his dark side foreshadowing his turn as a villain in a sequel There was not a right balance on who to focus on Ryan Reynolds is not the best choice as the leading man He looked the part but he was too comic for the most part and that did not fit the role He is meant to be a former air force pilot but he did not seem like he was ex military particularly someone who is meant to be a handling multi million dollar jets he too reckless He gets a bit better near the end as he becomes more serious but he is not Robert Downey Jr like he was trying to be He came off more like Chris Evans version of Johnny Storm Blake Lively seems too young for the role and that is being kind because she was not a good actress Sarsgaard was hamming it up when he was meant to be playing a more tortured character The best performers were from the aliens Strong who is always a professional Morrison Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan who in no more then a cameo Most of the cast did not seem to put their heart in this film compared to say the X Men films Nolan s Batman or the new Bond films Whilst it is clear that Campbell is not a special effects director he does provide some good if slightly cartoony CGI and the action was well handled for the most part A problem was that the Green Lantern was not very inventive with his psychic creations and felt a bit cheesy particular with the car and racetrack I know it was a troubled production and Campbell was very public about his disdain for 3D and well he was not the right director for the project He did his best but he is known for making more grounded gritty work like he did with the Bond series Green Lantern needed a director that could take you to another world like what Kenneth Brangh did with Thor or Peter Jackson and Ridley Scott are constantly good at Another similarity to Iron Man was a revel at the midway point of something I won t say what which turns out to be very useful later on As an origin story this Green Lantern offers us nothing we have not seen before There are problems involving character development and even with the extended cut some elements felt like they were left out Admittedly Green Lantern is a harder sell to mainstream audiences then some other superhero characters and DC do what Joss Wheadon calls a God complex with them having very powerful heroes As superhero film it is not the best but still better then say the Fantastic Four It was just a bit generic

15 June 2011,"Don't expect too much, and you'll have fun watching this movie.",So lucky me I have a friend who works at WB and she graciously invited me to attend an early screening of Green Lantern If you re like me and have been cautiously scanning rotten tomatoes for early reviews you ll know it hasn t exactly been impressing people as the best comic book movie adaptation The general consensus is that it s quote noisy overly produced and thinly written squandering an impressive budget and decades of comics mythology I don t agree Yes the background is laid on a bit thick the opening narration bombards you with exposition meant to quickly catch non comic book fans up to the setting Sure the story is befuddling at some points There were 2 or 3 moments in the plot where I thought flat out this does not make sense No I can t deny that some of the characterization is a little weak and some of the plots are a bit derivative Hal Jordan played by Ryan Reynolds for example doesn t seem to know if he wants to be a wisecracking jackass or a soldier of honor and duty fluctuating between the two just a little too quickly to be believable See the full text of my review at my blog,7.0,8.0,15.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444433/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2011,Save your Money,In a summer of generally good superhero movie s Green Lantern breaks the chain as one movie than can be given a miss From the perspective of a casual viewer Green Lantern has never appealed to me in the past so I write this review souly based on the film and not a comparison to the comic books The first thing I must say if you are planning on seeing this film is lower your expectations Green Lantern is a shallow movie packed with cheese average dialogue and flashy effects I can say it will entertain you so long as you do not take this seriously This is no X Men First Class Secondly try to avoid this or save your money if possible If you are settled on watching it borrow it on DVD or get it at a cheap price Now onto the film itself The storyline to Green Lantern is incredibly flat You will get an instant sense of d j vu as you see the rich and famous protagonist become the hero who rejects his power This is nothing new And frankly it is incredibly disappointing The film feels as if it is stuck in the past unable to keep up with the modern style of high quality superhero movies Ryan Reynold s character Hal Jordon is on e of the least engaging protagonists to date and the other human characters just feel entirely absent As for the antagonist all I can say is just awful There were a few things I enjoyed about this film I felt the concept of the Green Lantern s and their planet was interesting and Mark Strong and Geoffrey Rush saved the film from being a complete failure If you can accept this movie for what it is a cheesy fireworks show then you should enjoy it enough Unfortunately there is no escaping the fact that this movie still failed Save your money for Transformers,3.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448728/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,A Superman Ghost !,In terms of having origin story of a superhero usual earthly city unusual spatial world superpowers that go public late and bad guy for the sequel from the first movie s start then this movie is influenced by Richard Donner s Superman 1978 BADLY The problem rather the catastrophe isn t in this only It s in that script as a whole There are many wrong things with its structure characters logicality pace climax etc Ok let s see Why the blabber at the beginning How any contracting could be done after the fiasco of a performance that the lead did with the plane Why the lead s recruitment was delayed How he surrendered easily to the call of heroism Why he was chosen to be the hero while he s a determined clumsy from the get go And to add more nuclear fuel How come that all the other more strong Green Lantern superheroes couldn t defeat the terrifying universal monster and that poor guy could How can I believe that And that villain how can you hate him while he s a victim He s someone who lives peacefully and harms no one Then after getting infected with alien DNA he suddenly sees his lethal hatred to his father and his failed love where was that since day one He was supposed to be evil beforehand and that yellow energy just gave him the power to carry out his wicked desires Otherwise every nerd out there is nothing but a crazy serial killer who waits for a good chance to start slaying people The movie is long and uninteresting shouting proudly I m boring The lead has the ring after 30 min and gets super after 40 min The matter of having fear and facing it recurred time after time to wearisome extent There are parts where the drama goes to sleep and the action dies provocatively like the scene in which the lead tells his secret to his girl on some roof which was similar to another roof scene in Superman 1978 Ask yourself What s the necessity of having the lead s scene with his dad AGAIN in the plane Or having a moment in which the villain discovers that he has telepathic skills Or having a scene where the lead turns into the title character in front of his friend Originally what s the necessity of having that friend or the lead s nephew The answer of all of that is Nothing Totally Nothing These moments and characters were better being deleted The training sequence on planet Oa was a farce compared to the wild nature of its characters You can say that again about the imaginary car scene Even the way the lead used his powers at the climax was disappointing Well the movie s makers were the real disappointing with their limited imagination Aside from that careless script the designing of the Green Lantern Corps characters was hideous The Guardians of the Universe were extremely laughable It s as if the CGI guys stole the worst designs of the Star Wars prequel trilogy and made the rest as ugly fish Even the villain looks like the Elephant Man I wrote in my notebook while the viewing Make something watchable of our own please Ryan Reynolds is perfectly unbearable He has such a pale charisma and weak talent His face is one note not during the whole movie rather during all of his movies I think that part of his success in Deadpool later is that his face was covered I know that I had problems finishing Green Lantern due to that face alone Peter Sarsgaard was worse He screams more than Shia LaBeouf and the makeup made him too repulsive to be watched Tim Robbins is only 13 years older than him so how come that he plays his father Robbins himself seemed joking around as if he didn t love being in the movie expressing that in a way Director Martin Campbell is considered one of the action movies masters So how did he make THIS He underestimated the job was uninspired or worked with a material he hated as I read indeed At any rate he delivered a pipe dream Any pros I can say the glamorous voices of Mark Strong Geoffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan Plus the idea of Parallax as a mix of mighty fear huge smoke and cities destroyer Long story short this is Superman the empty remake After canceling its sequel and going for a reboot instead I hope that the producers read the observed foibles in its script and learn themselves any lesson first Obviously Hollywood s main catastrophe nowadays is in dealing with a serious element like the script recklessly If only they knew that Finally I believe that this movie as it is has its fan base And big part of the reason is other based on DC comics tragedies that came later like The Dark Knight Rises 2012 Suicide Squad 2016 and Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice 2016 Actually they make Green Lantern 2011 look nice and entertaining,4.0,0.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6113263/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2011,great entertaining film,Just home from watching the green lantern and i have to say i was really impressed The always impressive Ryan Reynolds was great in the lead role of Hal Jordan who has been chosen as the new green lantern This is an effects heavy movie but they are jaw dropping and some of the action sequences are totally amazing the plots not hard to follow i cant understand how this film is being so heavily criticized Right from the start of the film we are taking on a real roller coaster ride given an in depth explanation of the green lantern corps and what they stand for The fantastic mark strong gives great support as usual and it was nice to see Angela Bassett in a small part Totally recommended and i hope its not the last we see of the green lantern,7.0,5.0,8.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449348/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2020,A good comic book film,I feel like I need to explain my 8 It s a rounded up 7 6 The special effects and whole superhero production add quite a few points to what it would have been It s a nicely atmospheric live action comic with big visuals and big sound If you like to lose yourself in something like that you ll enjoy it too It helps to channel your inner twelve year old,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5454039/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,Fearless Test pilot granted cosmic Ring of power to defend the galaxy,Well a lot has been written about how bad Green Lantern is some of it fair some not so fair Its a big summer popcorn movie for the 10 year old in all of us Ryan Reynolds is not a bad Hal Jordan he s cocky heroic and a smart ass but i think he would have been better suited to Dc s The Flash Character not to say he does nt give it his all to Green Lantern OK lets start with whats not so good Martin Campbell is the Best James Bond director of the last 20 years but outside those movies he s very hit and miss and struggles with the comic book movie film in tone length and special Fx s and not tieing up payoffs set up early in the movie Well you say whats good about Green Lantern well the creature design of the lantern corps is spot on perfect the look of the planet Oa and best of all the scenes stealing Mighty Mark Strong as Sinsetro is pitch perfect more of him would have been great The action scenes are short but very clever using the ring and imagination to conjure up all sorts of weapons to fight the bad guys Its not a bad start to a very difficult comic to translate to the big screen that has to appeal to everyone,4.0,3.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449669/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2012,Succeeds where Marvel fails,All in all I thought this was a pretty good superhero movie I have always been a big Marvel fan and especially Spider man but their films may usually be competent they always leave me feeling under whelmed But where they fail every time DC has succeeded in this very comic like superhero offering Yes Green Lantern was predictable and there were somethings that grated the constant banging on about the corp was a bit to gung ho conjuring up more visions of brainless violence than superhero good guys for me but that is just nit picking really The humour on the part of Reynolds was good and the not all bad bad guy was also carried off quite well by Sarsgaard Got to say I gave a little silent cheer when sleazy senator Robbins got his fork tongued comeuppance or was I supposed to be sorry he got the chop The action sequences where also executed well with none of the usual confused mayhem of too much going on CGI a la Transformers many of us got tired of long ago Saw the final little sequence coming way back in the film though,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2571417/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2011,Better than what the critics say,Contrary to what MANY professional critics have to say about it green Lantern is an enjoyable superhero movie but one that doesn t quite live up to its potential My biggest concern was Ryan Reynolds casting as Hal Jordan and I was pleasantly surprised in this movie He is a little jokey but certainly not too much as to detract from the character The parts of the movie that are not on Earth are great from the opening scene to the Lanterns home world OA Mark Strong as Sinestro is quite good and Peter Sarsgaard as hector Hammond is also good While this movie does have flaws mainly being some editing of scenes that seem to end to quickly and the main villain isn t too villainous Plus the final fight is a bit too short All in all though the movies strengths make up for its flaws I think the main reason that critics have hammered the movies is that Thor and X Man have come before and were both excellent so this movie had A lot to live up to Also DC fans will love Dr Amanda Waller s cameo,8.0,7.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444905/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2011,Disjointed mess of a film.,I think that they treated the action scenes the way a soft core porn movies treats the sex scenes the dialog and plot are just to get you from one to the next We start out with yet another superhero with daddy issues Again Really Hasn t this device been used enough How about a super hero with a living father he has a normal relationship with That would be a change I guess this is a sign of our times when we know our generation is less than the one that preceded it so I guess this is some kind of angst thing we have as a society but it s getting a bit old don t you think My next biggest problem with this film Sinestro For those familiar with GL mythology Sinestro is a Green Lantern who adopts the yellow ring and becomes a villain He s what the Joker is to Batman or Lex Luthor is to Superman But all he is here is kind of a jerk whose villiany includes undermining Hal s self esteem Not to worry he puts on the Evil Ring in the closing credits to foreshadow the sequel they are never going to make The final battle with the villain Parallax only lasts about ten minutes and is actually kind of mind numbingly dull CGI The acting is that bad but not great It throws a bunch of the characters from the comics in but it s so disjointed only fans with a knowledge of the comic can follow and even they ll be annoyed,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2503408/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Do not waste your money on Green Lantern,this movie has to be the worst of the comic book stories presented in a movie form Ryan Reynolds is a great actor and I am bit baffled as to why he would even consider doing a film as such He went from acting with A list star like Sandra Bullock to non competent actress like Blake who lively she was not at all lively sorry this actress cannot act she doesn t posses the star like quality like scarlet Johansson Sandra bullock has Blake lively is another reason why this movie shocked me an actress that will beg and go out of her way to get a role that s not up to her level which eventually fail and that was the only thing she has ever convinced me thus far Bad actress who loves all the wrong attention the only thing good about this movie is the color green hopefully no sequel to this movie Terrible actress with an OK genre made the movie extremely dissatisfying,1.0,19.0,44.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444865/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2012,"Uneven, even for a comic book movie",Green Lantern isn t a terrible movie but it s also not a terribly good one It zips through the titular hero s origin story shoehorns a faux villain into the plot and ends on a promise of a sequel I ll say this much for it it is certainly green Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is a hot shot jet pilot who d be more at home in a movie like Top Gun He s cocky but caring aloof and irresponsible The latter trait plays a big role in the development of his character in this movie He comes across a dying alien who bequeaths a magic ring to him like any of us Hal takes the ring The ring is green and is as powerful as the imagination of its wearer This leads to some inventive problem solving when the first of two evil doers shows up The CGI is mostly believable as long as you understand that this is a comic book movie and that laws of physics need not apply universally The crux of it all is that Hal Jordan is now part of the Green Lantern Corps a legion of guardians who protect the universe from evil which by some strange coincidence has congealed together to create a bad guy made of fear The idea is that the villain Parallax uses fear to suck out the souls of its enemies or something and so the Lanterns must have no fear Can Hal Jordan overcome his deeply hidden fears of failure to save the world Will he be able to reconcile with his beautiful supersmart coworker Carol Blake Lively Will he rally the remaining Green Lanterns to fight back and not to use fear against Parallax Boy if only I could easily predict the answers to those questions If only this movie were that obvious Okay maybe it is that obvious But in a way that s all right You don t really expect intricate plots in a comic book movie Even though I could suspend my disbelief easily enough I did have some issues with the movie It felt like there was a lot of focus on the hero and his Big Transformation from selfish flyboy to savior and not enough on some of the peripheral stuff such as his relationship with Carol Carol s relationship with her inventor bigwig father and how their mutual childhood friend Hector Peter Sarsgaard fits into all of this and his own relationship with his father I m just saying there were a lot of secondary and tertiary characters that were given short shrift and yet in the grand scheme of the plot they mattered quite a bit A second issue is much more mundane the plot is pretty mundane standard issue stuff Hero becomes Superhero wrestles with some inner demons while trying to look cool fights human and alien bad guys with as usual the fate of the universe at stake As little of the comics as I knew I was actually expecting a different bad guy he s in this movie but he s not The Bad Guy I believe that s what they call Hoping the Movie Is a Huge Success So We Can Do a Sequel with the New Bad Guy And although the movie didn t make its money back in the States its worldwide grosses may have ensured that sequel anyway The Green Lantern character is interesting as well as whole idea behind the Corps Jordan is the first human Maybe a sequel would elaborate more on that area As for the acting Reynolds was a pretty good casting He had the look the patter the swagger Lively was also surprisingly competent Tim Robbins offers up a pained but thankless performance as a senator and Jay O Sanders is smarmy as usual as An Important Guy Probably the standout is Peter Sarsgaard who plays the childhood pal of both Carol and Hal and whose attitude plays a heavy role in the story Green Lantern works sometimes but suffers from an underdeveloped script too much backstory not enough front story and questionable direction It feels at times as if you re watching not a movie about a comic book but a movie about a movie about a comic book Not enough attention is paid to the subtleties of the plot or the nuances of the lead roles,5.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2607459/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2013,Not Nearly As Bad As It's Made Out To Be,I have dreaded watching Green Lantern for quite some time Firstly I m not a big fan of DC comics I don t know anything about Green Lantern but other than Batman I have not been impressed with their super heroes I also am not a huge Ryan Reynolds fan Now he s not terrible but he doesn t usually add much to any of the movies he s in Lastly the terrible reviews absolutely turned me off Why go see a movie that I already dreaded knowing that the majority says it s terrible Well it s unfortunate I waited so long because the movie was pretty good No it s not on par with Batman or the Marvel Phase One movies necessarily but it was definitely a good time Firstly Green Lantern is a much better hero than I had initially figured As much as I disliked the costume in the trailer I actually liked it seeing it during the movie I also loved how the ring allows the Lantern to create anything they can imagine But anyone who knows Green Lantern already knows these things As far as Ryan Reynolds I thought he played the character well Again I don t know the comic so I don t know if he does the true character justice but looking at the movie in a vacuum he was very good in the role The biggest problem I had was the villains They were both forgettable You had a jealous scientist and a floating head There was no Loki or Red Skull Nothing that had a real presence In fact you didn t even really see the villains until the last quarter of the movie The were definitely expendable in the grand scheme of things Ultimately the movie was a good time and I highly suggest that anyone who enjoys super hero movies give this one a shot Green Lantern is an interesting hero and the movie was well done Again I m not stating it stays true to the comics but as a stand alone movie I highly enjoyed it,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2847445/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2011,outstanding,This was a good entry in the DC comic superhero series I was wondering when they d come out with one about Green Lantern and they finally did This was one of my favorite movies of the summer and Green Lantern is one of my favorite characters It does a good job setting up the story storyline character background and foreshadowing My favorite scenes include the plane crashing the training session on the Lantern Corps planet and the part where he rescues the Senator from the sabotaged helicopter Ryan Reynolds makes a great Hal Jordan Green Lantern and I enjoyed seeing it in 3 D The final scene with Sinestro indicated that this would be the first in a franchise which might or might not happen I hope there will be more I loved it Get the DVD too out of,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2519552/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,Another Nicely written Comic Hero!,There were quite a few movies that have sprang form the cloth woven by the Caped Crusader back in 89 and many of those smelled worst than my feet on a summer evening namely Batman Robin of that franchise But among the farts that came there were several gems that shown bright than Ole GL s ring And speaking of GL Green Lantern was definitely one of them Now I know said by many people even those I know that this isn t the original Hal Jordan and that Reynold s performance wouldn t be up to the original s par and maybe they re right But considering that the story was re written and expanded less than ten years ago one can t go to the two dimensional version and expect that story For one it wouldn t work and two no one would watch it Now pushing that all aside this was a good film going to the same level as the first good Fantastic Four and maybe even better A great cast compelling and dazzling visuals and a well knit story Green Lantern made a memorable mark on the comic world and Reynolds made the character his own with just enough flare that you felt for the character but not too over the top that he was campy And of course Mark Strong s Sinestro stole the show I really enjoyed the film but there were parts that made me cringe mainly the villain development It was a bit lacking and not really what I would consider a menace Tomar Re and Kilowag didn t feel all too real for me even in 3D The voice acting from Rush and what I believe is Richardson was great and the only thing that gave the doll like characters life But back to the villain I had more feeling whether Sinestro would go all Anakin Vader style evil than whether the actual bad guy was bad Not a great choice in my book All in all GL was enjoyable and worth a see even in 3D So check it out,7.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446644/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,Scuffed rollercoaster can still be a fun ride,It s not a secret that the major accusation towards the movie is the usage of extremely unrealistic and bad CGI The costume is considered one of the worst in the history and this is said bearing a Batman suit with nipples yes that one wasn t computer generated but it is 2011 and the budget floats around 200 mil However as we know effects is not the only factor that makes us watch an action flick As we know behind the mask every hero needs to have a righteous soul that wants to do good in the world The same applies to Green Lantern the writing is not bad and encourages you to follow the story of a human engaging into something that is beyond our comprehension In fact this explains many childish and unprofessional things that Hal Jordan does The villain storyline is pretty straightforward and together with the powerful Corps of Green Lanterns they build quite a runway for a newcomer to perform a glorious take off Everybody wants to create an ultimate hero nowadays but this requires finesse which in this case was missing This movie kind of reminds me of the Beauty and the Beast Despite the ugly looks it still preserves that gist of fun and adventures that lure superhero fans into its trap Even though you probably won t remember for long but the viewing is pretty easy and enjoyable,4.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5506633/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,Greenpool,Oh the dreaded Green Lantern Lamented and hated by so many a film that has become a mockery by it s own star s hands and yet I don t hate this movie Now before I m tarred feathered and run out of movietown let me be clear Green Lantern is not a good movie I just don t think it s as god awful as it s made out to be For starters the story is a bit weak cliched and convenient but it doesn t actively upset me It s lazy but has never felt full on offensive Then there s the suit Yes the suit and that stupid mask are ridiculous but aside from that I actually quite enjoyed the lantern constructs that are created here it s always somewhat fun to see those things coming to life in their weirdly cartoonish way Acting wise Reynolds is a giant ball of charisma and it s hard not to be entertained by him in darn near anything he decides to be in and the rest of the cast is fine here Lively deserves better that s for sure and the villain is way overacting but I get the impression that s what he was directed to do Honestly I think my biggest problem here was that they tried to go too big too fast Going to Parallax right from the start is a mistake That is too big of a villain to be in an origin film and he really should ve been something worked up to a la Thanos with Marvel Instead they introduce this cosmic threat and just POW take him off the board right at the get go It just feels like a waste All in all this is a trashy super hero movie that s really not that great but there s some charm here some laughs a smidge of fun It s not great but I don t know that it warrants all the hate it gets Still can t exactly recommend anyone go out of their way to watch this unless you re just a diehard fan,4.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6498398/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2012,I don't see what all the hate is about.. I enjoyed this movie.,Going through the reviews for this movie there are so many reviews that are lower than 5 I don t get it I just don t Yes Ryan Reynolds may not have been the best actor for the role of Green Lantern but I thought he did a phenomenal job He did very well portraying Hal Jordan Green Lantern However I think this movie got such bad reviews because it was released after Thor and X Men First Class Not to mention Iron Man 2 came out in 2010 and did amazing in the box office I firmly believe that if Green Lantern had come out before those three movies it would have done much better But because that trio set such a high bar for Green Lantern it didn t live up to everyone s expectations and seemingly flopped I however enjoyed it a lot I thought it was great There were a few problems I had with the movie however I understand that movies have to give a back story I m fine with that It s happened in Thor Captain America Spiderman Iron Man and countless others That s all fine and good but it seemed like this movie took longer than all of the other ones The main qualm I had with the whole back story thing was Hector Hammond s character which was played by Peter Sarsgaard Hammond while doing the autopsy on Abin Sur s body was seemingly bitten stung by something which infected him with the alien lifeform Parallax Soon Hammond was given telepathic and telekinetic powers and his head grew very very big and he had to eventually be bound in a wheelchair Regardless it seemed like Hammond had more screen time as the regular guy than as the super villain During a face off with the Green Lantern Jordan Reynolds gave Hammond the ring after he had threatened to kill Carol Blake Lively However Hammond couldn t kill Jordan because you had to be chosen to wear the ring Almost immediately after Parallax swarmed into the building and killed Hammond That was the last we ever heard of him for the rest of the movie To me he just didn t have much time as the super villain Most of it was attributed to the back story and like I said I get that But I would have much rather seen him battle Jordan more as a super villain It seemed as though they battled for no more than 7 8 minutes throughout the entire thing I also wish they would have focused more on Jordan s training to become a Green Lantern His sessions with Kilowog didn t last that long and it would have been nice to see exactly what he needed to do and how he fared Of course he was able to defeat Parallax at the end of the movie with not much training apparently He really didn t need that much however as The bigger you are the quicker you burn was somewhat easy Additionally I would have liked to see Jordan and Parallax fight more They had that big fight scene at the end of the movie which lasted about ten minutes if even that much But like I said the movie would have likely been better for two reasons A it came out before Iron Man 2 Thor and X Men First Class and B if they didn t have to do the back story The back story took up a lot of the movie meaning that a lot of potential action scenes were never going to appear Much of the back story just wasn t that entertaining i e Jordan s nephew s birthday party the scene with testing the airplanes etc Even though it had a few flaws much like nearly every single film I enjoyed it Like I said I thought Ryan Reynolds did a great job I love superhero movies and have seen the majority of them and Green Lantern is one of my favorites along with both Iron Man films the Batman trilogy The Avengers and Thor I thought it was a great movie and because of that I went out and bought it on DVD It s definitely not as bad as people are saying,9.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2659235/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2013,Bland,Was there ever a blander superhero than Green Lantern as played by Ryan Reynolds I lost interest in this movie after seeing this actor for the first time in this piece of fluff He is so anodyne as to be almost an advertising agency s idea of an all American hero Ditto Blake Lively substitute Megan Fox or any other one of the dozens of interchangeable so called actresses who pass for stars these days I rate Peter Sarsgard but what is he doing in this What really insults the intelligence is the way he changes to a grotesque physically and no one remarks upon it when they first see him Mark Strong one of my favourite actors is wasted in this too and I was disappointed to see how little he was used The effects are just that totally uninvolving and overused Avoid,5.0,1.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2739439/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2011,Not special enough,I m not a reader of comic books but I enjoy a good super hero movie and recognise that comics are a rich source of characters for such films Marvel has given us the likes of Spider Man Iron Man X Men and Thor while DC Comics has been racing to catch up with Superman Batman and now Green Lantern Since most of these are franchises that s one huge battery of super heroes and new movies inevitably struggle to differentiate themselves and offer something new Green Lantern is entertaining enough but lacks distinction Character wise it is hardly special We have the usual alter ego a human with childhood issues and a disbelieving girlfriend although at least Hal Jordan a lantern jawed Ryan Reynolds is a cocky test pilot with the right stuff We have the familiar evil destroyer which in this case looks strangely like the dust cloud that raced through the streets of New York City after the collapse of the Twin Towers deliberate Filmed on location in Sector 2814 of the Universe Green Lantern scores in scenes set on the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa but is at its weakest when it tries to be funny I saw it in 3D which worked well for many sequences and even for the early credits when a short scene sets us up for the inevitable sequel,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454364/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2011,"Lotsa green, but too little of everything else, (watchable at best)",If Nikelodeon s Danny Phantom was done as a movie it would probably look identical to Green Lantern Green Lantern at its core suffers from a basic lack of ambition and the finished product feels like a money grab Green Lantern wants to dazzle an audience in superficial ways and to some degree it does flying faster than the speed of light across galaxies was kind of memorable and I thought the fight scenes short though they were had a good scope and spectacle to them Otherwise the film did little for me The Green Lantern keeps hamming the overcoming fear message down the viewers throat but the irony is that the film itself is too afraid It is unwilling to go to the depth that is necessary to make this a decent origin story Ryan Reynolds lacks the charisma and emotional range that the role definitely needs but if nothing else at least he plays the few comedic moments well enough Blake Lively is adorable but there are moments when it sounds like she is reading off cue cards It s a shame because I think they had the potential to make a great screen couple I think a better screenplay would have helped For me Mark Strong had the most memorable character in the show which is weird because he has almost nothing to do The plot is silly to begin with and highly unoriginal Even derivative movies can be good sometimes I ll site Avatar but the Green Lantern s sort of obvious scrappiness doesn t cut it Director Martin Campbell to some degree is able to build dramatic momentum to the climax Considering the imaginative new world that we are exposed to and among other things the size and scope of his shots with thousands of little CGI green lanterns I was expecting something a little better than what I got It was too hard to ignore the fact that our hero single handedly fights the forces of evil within touching distance of the sun and he doesn t even sweat let alone burn up in a millisecond Superheroes are super but aren t invincible to the laws of the universe or are they The end product is like watching a really flashy video game for an hundred minutes It was a shallow experience but perhaps that s enough for some I didn t think it was a terrible film it s just rather fundamental,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2521335/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2014,"Not spectacular,..but still entertaining",Unfortunately Ryan Reynolds is one of those actors who viewers really enjoy or really hate to see on screen He has tried time and time again to prove his worth that he is more than just a comedian and most just haven t been able to accept that Much these opinions start arriving when he began playing comic book related characters Sadly when this movie arrived to all the local theaters people were none too pleased with the end result It s a little confusing why because although there are a few sections to this movie that are not polished up it is still a watchable movie and a fun one at that The story follows very close to the DC comic where test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds has an encounter with an other worldly being that gives him a green ring with extraordinary power The power is materializing anything one desires with the strength of their own will The actors that portray their respective characters perform decently Ryan Reynolds certainly looks like Hal Jordan and portrays his character with charm Along with Reynolds is Peter Sarsgaard who plays a childhood buddy of Hal Hector With them is Carol Ferris Blake Lively another childhood friend of Hal and Hector All of which give respectable performances even with a script that feels unfinished with their somewhat clich d backgrounds Very little of these three main characters childhood s are explored Only a small bit of information is given about Hector s life as a tragic sympathetic character Furthermore after the prologue it s just assumed that Hal and Carol were destined to become a couple Also Hal s motivations seem to contradict what he says versus his actions Once Hal figures out what the ring is and what it belongs too he becomes acquainted with the rest of the Green Lantern Corp The top members that audiences will get to see are Sinestro Mark Strong Abin Sur Temuera Morrison Tomar Re Geoffrey Rush and Kilowog the late Michael Clark Duncan and they are also performed well After being beaten down through a series of tests Hal decides that the Green Lantern Corp is not for him even though it was stated that when the ring chooses a host it doesn t make a mistake So that s OK Hal made a decision But what contradicts this choice is once he s home he decides to use the ring to save the day and sticks with it after using it once out in the open The writers should ve picked a side here I don t understand why it was difficult when half of the writers have worked on the Arrow 2012 series However even with these issues the story isn t entirely empty The main antagonist known as Parallax voiced by Clancy Brown has an interesting background Additionally Parallax s method of destruction isn t extremely divergent from other grandiose intergalactic villains but it s still different which is devouring worlds not conquering them With this needs to be the appropriate special effects which do look presentable Although Parallax is not in his traditional form he still looks massive for a cloud octopus The creations that GL creates look awesome too in their digitized form Conjointly is his suit which is also cool even though it strangely sheds a few pounds off of all the physic that Reynolds has on him Likewise the action was enjoyable and with the well integrated special effects There are a number of neat tricks that Hal and other Lanterns come up with to use The cinematography by Dion Beebe is appropriate for the film It doesn t stand out as anything out of the ordinary but it s not ugly either which is fine Editing was taken care of by master Stuart Baird who made the 2 hour long movie not feel like it dragged Music related James Newton Howard produced the score Thankfully since this is a superhero film he does have a main theme for GL and even has tunes that are for the more softer moments Yet when it came to action cues Howard didn t make anything that was memorable I don t understand he s not a bad composer and he did the exact opposite to the score to Salt 2010 Were the action sequences that uninspired to him Overall though this film isn t as bad people say it is It still needed tuning up but wasn t trash No Its musical score and background to the main characters are in some ways transparent but that doesn t make the entirety of the storytelling unwatchable It still contains a decent mix of effects and action with an acceptable cast,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3025249/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2011,Is not that bad but is not that good.,Being a comic geek I was happy when the Green Lantern news was called Ryan Reynolds looks like a great choice and Peter Sarsgaad was a good choice too The day came and Boy I was wrong How can you manage to ruin a movie based on a comic OK Dragon Ball Z and X Men 3 doesn t count The story is based on the comic but the acting Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan is bad Just bad You don t care about him because Hal Jordan is not like that Ryan was funny in a movie that doesn t need to be funny Peter Sarsgaad as Hector Hammond fails badly The way that this villain is in the comic is not even close as the portrayed here The Best thing of the movie was Mark Strong as Siniestro He is a hero villain in the comic and here they give him this evil touch The CGI was push over a lot Thor worked good with the creation of the planet and environment but here all looks CGI,5.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448834/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,Before DC got REALLY bad,This is actually a pretty great movie Engaging great actors great CGI for the time It s so funny that it got so much negativity when it came out it was just the first DC movie and sort of disappointing Next with each step DC movies would prove to be much more terrible disappointing cartoonish and forced than this This is good,7.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6801627/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2011,Green Lantern (2011),A film I can both hate and love in equal measure Superhero movies have always been compelling to me even if I am not acquainted with the character Green Lantern is the character I am most dedicated to I simply adore the comics the world the characters and the story lines This is where the film faces a major problem The inclusion of aliens and a mythology centered around glowing rings may be a bit too corny for newcomers and a retread of the origin story is a bit repetitive for adoring fans The film certainly tries to cram everything in A little too much as it tries to focus on Hal s training his doubts his fears his loves his losses etc All these elements are simply incorporated into the scenes they are relevant to rather than hanging over the character and adding to his dimensions Sarsgaard is a great earthbound villain He s grotesque and quirky and also faces some daddy issues of his own He s the perfect parallel to Hal Jordan As the film focuses on Hal and his romance we are given little in terms of the Green Lantern Corps This is a shame as they are the most intriguing parts The editing on OA however is very sloppy It seems like a Green Lantern trains for 5 minutes The vast planet is reduced to a few platforms on which to fight The other Lanterns also get a space battle which cuts out before it s finished and we get a quick summary from Sinestro From a huge fan there is a lot of disappointment BUT it is also fantastically enjoyable It s pure summer fun and many comic book movies forget to be exactly that The acting is spot on and all the right ingredients are here even if not in the correct amounts or frequency I was amazed by the effects and the humor was probably the best way to handle some of the more out there aspects of the mythology On par with Spider Man 3 and Iron Man 2 Enjoyable silly fun with hopefully a lot more to give in the future,6.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2531786/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2011,This is why I don't listen to critics anymore.,Lots of people will say that the movie was a let down and wasn t good at all This movie was epically awesome Yes they could have done more as far as the rings power but it was a good movie none the less I wish they had more of Blake Lively in there Maybe her in a two piece would have been nice It was flashy and entertaining to watch but most of all I liked its presentation of the message it tried to deliver Which is basically even though you don t see it you can go as far as you allow yourself to go Also be sure to stay after the credits They show something afterwards,9.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448780/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,Better Than I expected,Ryan Reynolds sucked in Comic Book movies Blade Trinity and X Men Origins Wolverine This time in the Green Lantern he did a really good job Critics have been giving this movie negative reviews even Rotten Tomatoes started off giving the movie 23 I believe that the Critics should watch the movie again and take back everything they said about the movie the first time This movie has pretty good humor very cool special effects I m guessing that it will be nominated for an Oscar the action is pretty cool it s climax was pretty good even though I expected to see more but it was still decent I m sure that the Comic Book fans won t be disappointed with Ryan Reynolds playing the Green Lantern,7.0,4.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445945/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,"Nonsense, suffered from many flaws.",I can t believe that the same guy who directed 2 awesome Bond movies directed this movie Everything looked so fake with inexcusably bad CGI and special effects which looked way too old for the time Some characters had some depth but not nearly enough There were maybe a couple okay action scenes where Hal showed off his powers but I didn t get invested enough since there was a poor excuse for a villain and mostly bad acting the villain should ve been Sinestro It was also absurd that human technology like exploding missiles and just ordinary fire had an effect on Parallax which should ve been a lot more powerful I feel like Since the protagonist was Ryan Reynolds I couldn t take this movie seriously maybe I wasn t supposed to Maybe it was meant to be DC s Deadpool but it didn t work,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8648552/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2011,Better than we expected after reading all the critic's diatribes,My kids 17 19 and I were happily surprised that this was a much better movie than we had been led to believe The acting decent to very good from all The special effects great especially in 3D and the story line was able to be followed by those who had no idea who what GL was is And that s the way the movie should be made Not everyone is a GL fan with a working knowledge of GL lore and facts They need to fill in the story to inform people of the GL history while keeping the action up and storyline moving In our opinion they were able to do this We all agreed that if GL2 comes out we hope the cast will remain the same And we will not only go see it but bring friends Not the best of reviews if you re looking for what happened in the movie but I couldn t let all those negative reviews go unchallenged,9.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449338/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2012,Somewhat Better than Expected,By the poor reaction and general panning by critics early on last summer I went in to watching Green Lantern with low expectations for a DVD watch I kept waiting for it to get awful and employ my trusty fast forward button on the remote but it never really did It was a fairly good entertaining movie Not as good as Thor or even Captain American and granted the alien evil being was mostly clich d and unintersting but I liked the back story pretty well especially the Green Lantern origin planetary development Some of the effects especially with the fighter jets were less than stunning and the romance was not really there spoiler however the Green Lantern effects were pretty well done and I loved the weird assortment of Alien Green Lanterns All and all the movie is worth a watch as satisfactory,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2564886/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Another comic movie that lacks depth..DC fails again,Green Lantern was a film that I have been looking forward to for years After seeing this movie I can say that a reboot is already needed The development of the movie has been through a lot after months of speculation that Ryan Gosling was set to play Green Lantern Ryan Reynolds was cast instead who simply had the body of a superhero Reynolds personality simply did not fit the persona of Hal Jordan Green Lantern His frequent wise cracks just did not work with this type of hero and the movie was just too concentrated on him physically What I hated the most was that the Green Lantern suit was all CGI Reynolds was not actually wearing a real suit during the movie In terms of the overall plot of the movie it was lacking too much depth The origins of the story was too focused on Green Lanterns in general and not on Hal Jordan himself In fact there was only one scene of Hal Jordan s past and one scene of Hal with his family The story would have been more powerful if we could learn more about his origins and why he was so destined to wear the Green Lantern Ring In looking at the positives of the movie Blake Lively was smoking hot and made a decent performance as Carol Ferris Mark Strong was EXCELLENT as Sinestro He plays as Green Lantern s mentor but also maintains the evil villain that we all knows lives inside of him Peter Sarsgaard tried way too hard with Dr Hector Hammond s character As a Green Lantern fan I was questioning what the whole point of the character was in terms of the plot Sarsgaard s character has multiple scenes where he is making uncomfortable moaning sounds which was all but dramatic Overall the film was a disappointment and the upcoming new Superman and Batman movies will have to save DC comics,0.0,5.0,13.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445228/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2018,So many missed opportunities here it's not funny.,Green Lantern was stuck in development hell for MANY years they tried to make it in the 90s but due to bad developments like Batman Robin and the infamously never made Superman Lives the project was pushed back until it FINALLY got made in 2011 And the end result was anything but spectacular Sure we finally have a theatrically released movie featuring the popular space opera franchise but its first outing is a troubling and often incredibly frustrating take on the classic superheroes bearing the name of Green Lantern Ryan Reynolds just doesn t fit the character dynamic that Hal Jordan possesses thankfully this film was useful in serving as fodder for great jokes in Deadpool 1 2 and the special effects are nauseatingly bad but Mark Strong does a great job as Sinestro in spite of the film s many shortcomings Green Lantern tries setting up more movies without concentrating on the one thing it should be focusing on the one in hand right now which is why this review has cited this thing as frustrating It s one of those movies where the focus is on franchise building rather than the story being told first off it s a creative anomaly only Hollywood can practice on a consistent basis and have mixed results at best Such projects like this one the Amazing Spider Man 2 and Fant4stic come to mind It s sad that Green Lantern didn t get a memorable cinematic kick off like Batman and Superman managed to muster decades earlier Even Wonder Woman s gone on to have a great film whereas Green Lantern s still yet to have its movie heyday Green Lantern is a timeless comic book property that s why he deserved better than this misguided mess 2 5 stars,4.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4321368/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,enjoyable,It s a good adaptation from the comics didn t stray far off and didn t give it full justice either but overall it s fun and entertaining to watch specially if you don t know about the green lanterns and it s your first experience the story is good direction and special effects are not bad at all what i didn t like was the script it s desperate for some good writing as some of the dialogue were lame and most of the secondary characters didn t get their proper spotlight I loved Ryan Reynolds he fits the part and he easily could relate his human weakness to the audience also the performance by Mark Strong as Sinestro blew my mind away,6.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448371/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2014,Massively disappointing.,Let me begin by saying I m a comic book fanboy also a film buff Green Lantern is in my top ten lists of favorite superheroes in both Marvel and DC Now though I m a fanboy I know the differences between movies and comics Sometimes what works from the comics doesn t mean it ll translate well in the big screen But here it s a giant mess There are so many things in this movie that just does not work at all But before I get to that let me talk about the three things I found to be watchable Ryan Reynolds does the best job with what he s given I bought into his character I liked his portrayal of Hal Jordan and does a commendable job showcasing his arrogance but also displaying his character flaws and insecurities Mark Strong steals mostly every moment he s in as Sinestro Perfect casting here blunt honest and full of Green Lantern pride Most fans have talked trash about the Green Lantern suit I totally disagree All the Green Lantern s appearances look great and works well for the big screen I liked that they were light constructs covering up their body with anatomical designs and light glowing out of them It was a refreshing look to the characters and a much needed updated appearance The special effects are pretty cool the Green Lantern s do more that just shooting out blasts out of their ring They get creative by creating knives shields cars jets fists chains machine guns brick walls and even a race track Also the aliens particularly Kilowog and Tomar Re were fun to watch What doesn t work in this film is the boring soap opera romance Blake Lively gives out a dry performance and there is no chemistry between her and Reynolds It only slows the film down Peter Sarsgaard is a good actor by all accounts but here he is too over the top and screams like a girl in almost every scene he s in His arc is also underdeveloped and only comes across as a two dimensional villain his father portrayed by Tim Robbins is also fodder here and does nothing at all We also get a shoe horned rushed relationship between Hal Jordan and Sinestro Lastly Parallex the epitome of a fearful villain is just plain laughable Horribly misrepresented in this film He s nothing more than a giant fart cloud enough said How he is defeated in the climax is also pathetic I know this is a comic book film but there has to be some sort of logic for instance how in the world did Hal Jordan and Parallex reach near the sun in such a short amount of time Just terrible This summer s Guardians of the Galaxy is what Green Lantern should have been Not exactly the same but similar All the scenes in space and Oa the home planet of the Green Lantern s are arguably the best scenes in the entire film For the future of the DC Cinematic Universe my wish list is that Ryan Reynolds and Mark Strong do return in their respective roles It s probably not going to happen but in any case hopefully the second incarnation of Green Lantern will be better than this 5 5 10,5.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3078086/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2017,A movie that's so bad it's kinda good...,It s weird that during the making of this movie that Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively were dating while on set and got married a year later and had kids Times have changed since then with Reynolds having a resurgence with Deadpool and Blake Lively with Gossip Girl and The Shallows As for DC the failure of Green Lantern forced DC to create its own cinematic universe following what its arch rival Marvel have done successfully With the success of Wonder Woman a reboot of Green Lantern as Green Lantern Corps is on the horizon,1.0,0.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3789245/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2012,Better than most people make it out to be,I don t know why every cynical and jaded movie snob hates this movie There are plenty of reasons to like it First off the effects are spectacular when I saw the trailer for the movie I thought they were sub par when in comparison with other effects but in the finished product they massively improved the only part I didn t like was that the suit was cgi In a day and age were you can physically reproduce superhero outfits for film I don t think the cgi was necessary for the suit Second off the casting I m not talking about Ryan Reynolds he did okay or Blake Lively she was bad I m talking about things like Geoffrey Rush as Tomar Re Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowog Mark Strong as Sinestro Mark Strong gave a good performance that well reflected the treacherous lantern we got to know in the comics Geoffrey Rush as Tomar Re acted as kind of a mentor figure Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowog was a good drill Sergent But one i really liked was Peter Saarsgard as Hector Hammond He managed to craft a compelling villain with an interesting and even sometimes creepy performance Third off the accuracy to the comics this movie takes a number of things from both the silver age stories and the Geoff Johns stories I couldn t think of any particular things they took from the silver age but from the geoff johns stories they took Parallax Hector s origin The concepts behind the emotional spectrum Sinestro being Hal s mentor Hal s Dad dying and more All in all at the end of the day It doesn t compare with Avengers or Dark Knight but that doesn t mean it s not good don t listen to the haters they just like to hate because they can t make movies This one is worth at least a rental and maybe even a buy,8.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2665171/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2018,No Wow Factor,Long before Ryan Reynolds was fitted to the role of Deadpool adding his name to a comic book movie was like adding salt to an open wound While Green Lantern isn t the worst comic book movie but it s still an unimaginative movie The CGI is unrealistic the designs aren t so creative the characters the antagonist and the writing are dull and action sequences isn t so charming,3.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4388695/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2012,I Wish I Could Will The Power Of A Better Script...,Hal Jordan is given a powerful ring from a dying alien The ring gives Hal the power to conjure anything his will desires In receiving this ring Hal becomes a Green Lantern and must defend the universe against all evil In brightest day in blackest night no evil shall escape my sight Let those who worship evil s might beware my power Green Lantern s light Exiting to see the Green Lantern get his big screen debut sham it was such a lackluster one that confused many people and didn t do the source material justice The main problem with this film isn t the shady CGI sequences it isn t the miscast Blake Lively and it isn t even the un menacing villain It s the script crippled with the pain of telling an origin story that isn t inspiring or interesting The film opens with a narration of some events that is suppose to get the viewer up to speed with things that will play a big part in the story later on The gist of it is that a Green Lantern had imprisoned some evil that evil escapes kills that Green Lantern and his ring finds a replacement Enter our hero with flaws Hal Jordan played by the charming and witty Ryan Reynolds Reynolds plays the character with a bit of sass but he s still likable Jordan has to overcome his fear to be a great hero we are shown some flashbacks of his father dying typical superhero daddy issue drama The film had a chance to give us something deeper more meaningful and it chose not to Not only that but what we get is weakly portrayed and thus we never truly feel the weight of Jordan s problems Opposite Reynolds is one of two villains Peter Sarsgaard who plays Hector Hammond A brilliant scientist who becomes infected and descends into madness His story is told alongside Jordan s One is about the rise to become a hero the other is the demise of becoming a villain Interesting stuff there but never really explored Sarsgaard is interesting as Hammond but we never dive deep into this character Same goes for Reynold s as Jordan We never connect to any of the characters on the screen no matter how charismatic they may be Which brings me to Blake Lively who was miscast She is a pretty face for sure but not once is she believable as a pilot or business woman The love interest is filler and it feels like it I mentioned earlier the shady CGI I m not talking about his suit which has a lot of fans in an uproar I actually like the skintight CGI suit it was visually pleasing compared to the basic costumed hero I had problems with the obvious mask he wore which never truly felt like he had one and a lot of the bad green screen when Jordan first arrives on the planet Oa Oa never truly felt magical like Asgard did in Marvel s Thor but that s not saying it was badly materialized With the power of the ring which is one of the most powerful things in Marvel s universe One would expect well anything the imagination can come up with The power of one s will is immense and the creative minds behind what we were shown were lacking in the creativity department The training sequences were too short and the race car track to save the helicopter was inane When you introduce something like whatever I can imagine becomes real then you re going to have many people say why not thing bigger Despite this being an obvious crux it s one that I couldn t help but wonder myself In the climax why only have to jets pull you away when you could have dozens It s not hard to add at least one more jet to help save your life Despite that most of the special effects worked I liked the green imagery and the Parallax evil that invoked 9 11 imagery To say the film was a total failure is wrong it s pretty decent As a superhero film it manages to do the core basics It was entertaining and held my attention Despite obvious script problems and the big opportunity with Sinestero wasted Green Lantern is not as bad as people say It s just not as good as you will hope for,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2588029/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,Green Lantern great movie,I saw the movie to night not expecting to much after reading a review in the papers when the movie started it was a little hard to understand since i have never read the comics but as it got more into the movie i found my self having a good time laughing and quenching my hands all through the movie now i saw x men wolverine origins and when i first watch it i didn t like it that much i found this movie was funnier and better i plan to watch it a few more times just so i can understand it better and i might even start reading the comics but over all it was quite good and i plan to buy it when it comes on to DVD,8.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446028/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2015,Just no simply put,How I first became aware of Green Lantern was from The Challenge Of the Super Friends Cartoon which I watch on Reruns and enjoy very much It s a good thing I waited for this film to come on HBO instead of watching this on the big screen or buying it on DVD because it is not even worth it Green Lantern is one of DC Detective Comics biggest characters and when you think you could get a movie for the character and expect it to do a fine job well I m afraid I ve got some bad news Green Lantern tells the story of Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds and how he would become Green Lantern Along with his relationship with Carol Ferris Blake Lively The film itself just seems broken from the start Where can you even begin on how lame this film is Let see the script in it is pretty much awful while the plot did seem promising it turn out to be a total wreck as the story moves on The acting in the film other than Blake Ryan and Michael Clark Duncan performance is more or less a wreck the characters just feel flaw With such a big budget you think that would been more time on character details but this is not the case The music is interesting which one of the few good things I can say about the film The special effects are also amazing which is pretty much the only other good thing about the film but if you don t have a interesting cast of characters and plot you re just pretty much asking for trouble and boredom Overall Green Lantern is just pretty much a waste of money and waste on a chance to get DC movies back on the map because this film couldn t find success with both hands and a map I give Green Lantern an 3 out of 10,3.0,0.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3217120/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2017,"Don't believe the bad hype, it's actually good",May Contain Spoilers First off I was very thrilled that they finally brought this character to the big screen I had probably waited longer for this comic book character to get a Big Budget movie made more than any other Superhero character This is my favorite Superhero So when I learned they were making this movie I could hardly contain myself Now the movie I D Like to say first that I don t think this movie as bad as the critics said it was It s actually an enjoyable movie Now with that said let also say that although its not bad I was expecting this to be so much better than it is I felt they used too much CGI at times I felt almost like I was watching a cartoon I wasn t crazy about the villain it looked like he was fighting a Smog Monster That entire last fight sequence seemed a bit anti climatic to me and I feel could have been done much better Also felt like the movie needed more action I would have like to have seen the Green Lantern do more crime fighting on Earth after he made himself known to the public I think it would have been great to see the Green Lantern thwart a bank robbery stop a runaway train full of passengers stuff like that Afterall don t we go to see Superhero movies to see Superheros do Superhero things There was some positives I took from this movie I liked Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan when I first saw that he got this role I had doubts He pulled it off very well Mark Strong as Sinestro was Superb Blake Lively was good in her role All the actors did fine Another positive I took from this was the Musical Score which also superb There are certain aspects of this movie that were done extremely well I would still recommend this movie its a good popcorn muncher I have heard that Warner Brothers is still planning a sequel but with a different director and wants the sequel to much darker than this film was That could be a good thing also could be a bad thing but there hasn t been any movement on that front since Green Lantern came out on DVD So who knows if the sequel will get made or not,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3823846/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2011,Green Lantern gives off a dim light.,To be chosen to join its ranks is the highest of honors and the greatest of responsibilities The ring never makes a mistake Green Lantern is a serviceable action superhero movie with a decent cast but the characters are so thin and underdeveloped that fans of the comic are bound to be disappointed and newcomers won t find many reasons to care about what s going on There are a few good aspects to the movie I enjoyed the scenes on Oa and the time spent with the Green Lantern Corps but that s all too brief Mark Strong is great as always and a bigger role for his character could make a potential sequel much better Ryan Reynolds does his usual thing which will probably please his fans but there s really nothing to the character of Hal Jordan beyond his flashbacks to his father The same goes for Peter Sarsgaard who is basically wasted as Hector Hammond If you feel like renting Green Lantern on a Friday night go for it It s not an awful movie but it does nothing well enough to earn it a place among the better superhero flicks It s two hours of been there done that A movie about a character with galactic scope and the power to make almost anything should have offered a lot of opportunities to do some creative things but mostly that potential goes unrealized,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2508211/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2011,The Green Lantern,Amazing film definitely the best superhero film in the last years An excellent use of visual effects and the main character with great attitude just a good movie thumbs up Although there are changes to the story are minor adjustments that help the continuity of the script The key lines of the main character makes you understand the philosophy of the hero Despite the lukewarm reception from critics consider this film is far superior to what is described and even what to expect after watching the trailers It shows that enthusiasm goes beyond the fear which makes these teachings to the level of Yoda himself Since the beginning of the movie shows agile and witty giving us an opportunity to recognize the background of each character For connoisseurs of the Green Lantern comic will be a joy to see the conformation of Oa and the deployment of power and charm of the Green Lanterns,10.0,3.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2473008/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2011,"It was okay, but something was missing",A Green Lantern from another planet crashes on earth but before he dies he tells the ring to find someone worthy of the ring and it s power of course The ring finds Hal Jordan Reynolds a cocky somewhat irresponsible test pilot Did the ring make a mistake This new Green Lantern will need to find a way to be accepted into the Green Lantern club and to save the earth from Parallax a power more powerful than all the Green Lanterns combined The something missing is very important here What could it be Ah I didn t like anyone in the cast Oh the story was okay the actors and their dialogues read no good lines were okay the CGI was fantastic to say the least but the non likability factor reined throughout In the THOR movie I liked everyone Is it fair to compare the two movies Yes indeed This movie didn t talk to me the way the THOR movie did All was okay just not likable enough This movie talked to itself not to me and it was more interested in showing us the CGI than anything else And the CGI was fantastic as I mentioned When Carol Lively Hal s sometime girl friend finds out that Hal is the Green Latern and takes her time while looking straight at him I was shocked What took her so long Any fool can see it is Hal in a green costume The mask didn t really do the job too well She asks Hal where did the mask come from He replies it came with the suit And that boys and girls is about the best line in here Just a quick thought The evil power Parallax seems to have been Doomsday resurrected from the Smallville TV series Hey an evil power needs to live also Besides he needed the gig HA I noticed that Mark Strong Sinestro finally plays a good guy Green Lantern but wait a minute Watch as the credits role and you will see Sincestro try on the Yellow Ring the one that produces fear in all and watch closely as his eyes widen and then narrow and it is then that you know we will see Green Lantern 2 And then we will see Mark Strong as the bad guy again Does this mean as he should be We will just have to wait and see I think we have seen movies for almost all of the comic book super heroes well except for Mandrake the Magician Green Arrow Plasticman Aquaman Captain Marvel the Flash Superboy and Wonder Woman But stay tuned they are probably not far behind Violence Yes Sex No Nudity No Language No,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2512157/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2013,An Implausible Plot Even for a Comic Book Hero Movie,I just saw this on The FX Channel The worst written Sci Fi adventure since Star Trek V The Final Frontier Implausible because the evil villain is the size of a planet In Star Trek V the evil villain is also planet sized Corny as Hell Green Lantern Corps Brotherhood or alliance would have sounded so much better Why it stinks Like Clark Kent the superhero disguise fools no one The teaser ending is implausible as well Why would the head of the Corps want to turn evil Basically Superman in a Green Suit powered by Energizer Batteries Great special effects in spite of it all so maybe worth watching just once out of curiosity May have been better as a TV series Unintentionally funny at times due to plot development and dialogue Would have made a great 3D attraction at Universal Studios I could see the nerd scientist transforming into the evil villain s henchman a mile away Since it made a ton of money a sequel is inevitable sadly,7.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2885467/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2011,Green,I did not find this very offensive I did not like the move and would not recommended it simply because I liked the comic books as a kid Green lantern was my favorite Being a little older I expect more move from a multi million dollar production yes it is too dark and too green In the comic black and green was OK but in a film enough with back and green and the bit of yellow Yellow is the color of the sun and not fear green is the color of envy and environmentalists If they only would spend a little money on the script maybe they did if this is what you get for your script writing you may as well just take all the plot scenes etc from the comic book but then you would need an actor or rather actors who can pull it off Actors are in short supply these day why bother to learn to act when you just mug a few faces and let the special effects do all the work De evolution it certainly does exist in Hollywook God be with you,1.0,4.0,13.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447096/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,Worst Movie of the Year,Comical at best when it shouldn t be Ryan Reynolds seems to be confused about how to portray the character The special effects were like a bad sci fi from the 80s The chemistry between characters was unbelievable The acting was not bad it just did not flow smoothly and the lines sometimes seemed as though they were intended for elementary school children The movie would have been much better presented as more realistic instead of cartoonish I had so looked forward to this movie all year and found myself laughing out loud throughout the whole movie My husband fell asleep halfway through it and started snoring If you feel you must still see this movie go to an early matin e so you don t waste too much money,4.0,7.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445991/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2023,Goofy ahh movie,SCORE 1 6 10 Goofy ahh movie Watching this film for the first time makes the end credit scene of Deadpool 2 so valid However there is one beautiful thing about this monstrosity and that is that it gave us a Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively relationship They met on the set of Green Lantern while dating other people and the rest is history It was a Canon Event for the both of them This garbage movie had to happen and I respect it With that being said I am shocked at how awful this was The person writing this movie had to have been on some type of drugs or drunk or a combination of both All jokes aside you would ve thought this movie was made in the 70 s or 80 s with the quality of effects and character design The villains and extraterrestrials in this film looked awful which was paired with awful dialogue and delivery of that dialogue The real villain was Peter Sarsgaard s hairline They almost didn t have to put any effects on his character for his transformation This was honestly just one big mess that was probably a massive stinger to people who adore Green Lantern as a character in the DC comics Hopefully they can find a way to do the character justice in the future but let s just pretend this never happened,2.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9169457/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2011,not spectacular - but fun entertainment,A weak script and very thin plot make this super hero movie pale in comparison to the others that have come out lately but the special effects and action scenes were enjoyable The whole story felt very rushed which makes the characters come off one dimensional I must say that despite Ryan Reynolds essentially playing well Ryan Reynolds its tough not to like him he s just fun to watch on screen Mark Strong as Sinestro is one of the highlights in the film and the finale leaves no doubt that he will be back but possibly as one of the bad guys Peter Sarsgaard s character Hammond was just hammy his character really became annoying by the end of the movie I especially enjoyed the scenes on the far away planet and the Green Lantern Corp characters however if there is another film hope they will do a better job with getting a more interesting villain The moral of the story that someone can face their fears and embrace their destiny is as we all can figure out by now the main formula in many of the super hero movies and this included but this film only gives us a speedy checkout line version The Green Lantern doesn t compare with Iron Man or Thor but offers good fun entertainment for a Saturday afternoon,0.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2455033/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2012,"Good, But Not Great.",I don t know why people are hating on this movie It isn t as bad as everyone says and here is why Acting Ryan Reynolds is a very good Hal Jordan Yes he is a little goofier than the Hal we see in the comics but so isn t Tony Stark to an extent Could they have gotten someone to play him better Maybe but I was actually pretty happy with his performance Blake Lively wasn t the Carol Ferris I would of liked to see I would say her performance was the weakest Mark Strong IS Sinestro Couldn t have picked someone better Action Was very strong I however don t really like CGI to much but it was still very cool to watch GL fighting off the Parallax Writing It wasn t great A little to comedic but the origin story was spot on The villains were not bad choices Parallax could of come a little later and I didn t really like Hector Hammond to much but Oh well Overall I would say it was actually a pretty good superhero flick Not The Dark Knight or The Avengers but it was very good Not as bad as Green Hornet Catwoman Elektra etc,7.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2618241/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,Green Lantern: Shines Dimly Behind Reynold's Charm,Every trend in the movies goes through the same motions They come out of left field when no one thought it would be a viable idea then instantly becoming the most watched genre in years finally over extending itself to the point of pure silver screen saturation and the profits nose dive off the celluloid cliff You can usually mark the first movie going over the edge by how far it pushes the genre out beyond the norm For fans of the comic book genre even knowing that Iron Man 3 Captain America and The Avengers are still on their way this weekends superhero offering gave many pause wondering if this was one spandex d crusader too many Did the curtain begin to fall Nope Not quite yet Green Lantern tells the story of Hal Jordan a reckless flyboy who is chosen by a magical ring to protect his planet from destruction Never one to follow through on anything Jordan must struggle to discover the hero he never imagined was waiting inside I was going to start with some of the struggles and hardships that this story and script had to work through but really let s get down to the green glowing tacks here Ryan Reynolds He is not just playing a superhero the man actually is one No matter how bad the dialogue no matter how convoluted the script no matter what crazy situation you put him in his charm and nearly flawless ease on screen allows him to raise that bar a little higher I m not saying that all these things were necessarily terrible here but they could have been and Reynolds still would have found a way to make it work Following his career since the Van Wilder days Reynolds has never failed to enliven each and every project and provide at least one or two solid moments of wit and enjoyment on screen For his generation of actors I believe he is the closest they will get to George Clooney a man who can truly balance comedy action and drama all while looking like he was born to play that part Now that we have that out of the way back to the problems With all the comic book movies capturing the audiences recently most are earth bound or at least set mostly in an environment we can all easily recognize Thor was the first in the new battalion of superhero flicks to test the waters of magical landscapes and far away universes and it succeeded fairly well Without that preceding it Green Lantern might have suffered more by spending so much time in outer space but Thor built a bridge to that arena and then busted it at the end of the movie in joke so Green Lantern flew right over and pushed even farther out into the cosmos Instead the surrounding characters and subplots became the weakest links Sadly the first half of the movie had to do so much of the heavy lifting establishing the universe literally and giving some foundation for all these new and outlandish creatures while still getting enough time to bring in their human counterparts back home Peter Sarsgaard pulled out some decent angst and rage but was never given enough time to really fuel the fire Even worse was Blake Lively who was given absolutely no room to breathe in a virtually lifeless character Her introduction as a fellow fighter pilot was painfully unnecessary and forced her to try and work her way back into relevancy which might have worked if given time but she really wasn t As for the arch villain CGI cloud creature Parallax the effects were impressive but the story behind him felt flawed and unstable so he never brought a whole lot of weight or tension to the scenes Overall I still give this a five rating because it brings us back to those true summertime carefree flicks that didn t try to give more than we bargained for People who say this is a failure because it isn t Dark Knight are making unfair and outlandish comparisons Director Martin Campbell who helmed two of the more successful recent Bond chapters Goldeneye and Casino Royale wasn t going for grit and bones he wanted light fun and entertaining for the few moments he had you trapped in the theater In that context and with the effortless abilities of Ryan Reynolds they achieved their goal albeit one set far lower than what audiences may have envisioned The End of the Page recommendation Green Lantern may hold a little more light for the comic book enthusiast but for the mainstream moviegoer this is only a mildly flickering flame not a bright light of the summer,5.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448336/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2011,Wow; this was one of the worst super hero movies; sequel? I hope not,Out of all the super hero s the Green Lantern s story is probably the most basic The problem I had with the movie was that even though the story isn t exactly brain surgery the acting was over the top bad and uninspired Ryan Reynolds acts like he s having beers with his buddies on a weekend and that this Green Lantern thing happens to him every week Blake Lively has never been a great actress but she sleep walks through this I think she changed expressions twice during the entire movie I m sure she s a nice person but I really don t get her I don t think any Oscar nominations are in order The rest of the cast isn t bad with Tim Robbins and Angela Bassett giving their usual good performances but it s hard to get excited about it If you have 2 hours to waste and I mean waste then you can see this If you don t then wait for the video This is one movie that I hope a sequel isn t in the works,3.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449441/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2011,Ryan Reynolds couldn't save it,While I am not a DC comic fan growing up reading Marvel i was still interested in this I am also a fan of Ryan Reynolds which was what ultimately convinced me When i went to watch this my ultimate comparison was to X Men First Class They seemed to be complete opposite While X Men had a great story and characters the effects lacked greatly for 2011 In Green Lantern the effects were great and convincing yet the story was too quick and there was little character progression outside of Hal I was able to understand Hal s character but no one else The part in here that i really liked actually distracted from what a superhero movie should be It was less about the action and more about finding the true power of will to overcome fear It was more about Hal finding himself than becoming a hero even though of course this is what lead him to become the hero that he is The path to finding will power was perfectly crafted which helped make up for the weak characters And of course as with most super hero movies nowadays there were the comedy bits that were actually funny In the end it s worth a watch probably not more than once unless your a big Green Lantern fan Go to the theater for the full experience and it s up to you if you want more of it,6.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445893/?ref_=tt_urv

NO SPOILER,I opted for the 3 D version and viewed this movie with my wife son daughter in law I m an avid movie goer and do admit I m not a critic When I pay 13 dollars for a movie I want to enjoy myself and typically do unless there is a bad plot or unnecessary filth Ryan Reynolds was perfect in the lead role He seems to bring the right mix of awe shucks who me mega butt kicker to the part His interaction with friends after he has the ring is hilarious Blake Lively was very believable in the role of ace pilot corporate exec and love interest Didn t really know who she was before but she s very hot and talented Peter Sarsgaard was a great creepy bad guy in this movie It s hard to recognize him but the voice and mannerisms come through Other high end actors play smaller parts which make this a must see I never even picked up a green lantern comic book as a kid but picked right up all the plot points How about a Green Lantern II and while you re at it toss in a new Van Wilder,10.0,5.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2453296/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,Green Lantern Shines and Flickers,Green Lantern takes us into the story of one Hal Jordan a charming but irresponsible test pilot who rises up to the challenge when he gets to be given a ring of immense power With this he becomes part of the Green Lantern Corps sworn protectors of worlds and galaxies It is hard to write a review about something when all that surrounds it is negativity However for the next sentences I shall put on my hat of fairness give it my best shot and go over the film point by point All superhero movies should have sufficient portions showcasing the awesome abilities of their title character Fortunately this film had a decent amount of action Objects formed through Hal s ring were very creative and blended well with the environment Although Thor s Asgard was a more impressive sight the Green Lantern home world Oa was a unique experience already No matter what you say about the plot of Green Lantern it is certain that the humanity of Hal Jordan was central to the movie if not overly emphasized With all the aliens from the other sectors around him he seems so small and insignificant and yet he manages to overcome this and prove that he is worthy to be part of the Corps This presentation allows viewers to relate to him just a troubled regular guy who has his heart in the right place For me highlighting the Green Lantern Oath was one of the best decisions they made It was able to describe what a Green Lantern is with a few well chosen words Let s face it it s short catchy makes a lot of sense and fun to recite After watching the film I have found myself repeatedly imagining there s an emerald ring on my finger and reciting the oath Seriously Sinestro was nicely done by Mark Strong Sherlock Holmes He is such a self righteous character that he makes you want to reach through the screen and tear his mustache off If there will be a Green Lantern 2 you are sure to see more of him All and all having a Green Lantern movie made helped the average person know more about such an interesting hero Being part of the Justice League core together with Batman and Superman he deserves to be appreciated and celebrated by more people With that said let us evaluate the reasons why appreciation towards the film might be hard to do Even after watching the movie it is still hard to fully accept Ryan Reynolds as the Green Lantern For some reason he just doesn t fit the bill However note that Justin Timberlake almost became Green Lantern at some point so going with Reynolds actually allowed them to dodge an even bigger bullet Blake Lively has had a lot of exposure with dramas like Gossip Girl and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants but is she ready for something like Green Lantern What is the direction of the film anyway The first trailer featured a happy Hal Jordan and then the second one was as serious as hell This kind of mixed emotions will confuse viewers which will then lead to a lower quality movie and lower ticket sales There is a comedy vibe present but somehow it makes the story seem shallow when the whole world is supposed to be at stake Character development could have been improved if we had a peek of how Hal Carol and Hector grew up together or if we were shown more of the relationship between Hal and his father at the beginning of the film How was Hal growing up Lantern could have been like Iron Man lauded by fans and critics alike but it falls short Let us talk about the villains Hector Hammond is not only one of the ugliest villains ever but also one of the most useless Aside from giving Abomination The Incredible Hulk a run for his money in terms of attractiveness he could not elicit interest from me His powers were not explained enough I get the basics of telekinesis and telepathy so why was Hammond unable to know what Green Lantern was thinking And no Hal having a strong will should not affect mind reading After all this it seems just right that Hammond came from another equally if not more disappointing villain called Parallax He is a floating mass of gunk revealed to have originated from a being of great intelligence and ability no names to avoid spoilers If that is so then why was he so easily duped by Hal Green Lantern is not a bad movie Yes I said it and I am not taking it back There s such a thing called building too much expectation for a movie and this film falls victim to it However you can t really blame viewers for having this kind of mentality when you ve spent a whole lot of dollars promoting it Still people who say that this is the worst superhero movie ever is entitled to their opinions but are not necessarily right Are they saying that Blade Trinity which amusingly also stars Reynolds Jonah Hex and Hulk 2003 are better I don t think so Even though I don t know a lot about Green Lantern I find his character colorful and I wanted the film to be great I really did A shallow execution of the storyline uninteresting villains shaky casting and a whole list of other things prevent it from happening However Green Lantern packs enough gas to warrant a watch Go for it if you 1 watch movies as a hobby 2 want to be entertained 3 are tired of the usual heroes populating the big screen 4 have the hots for Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively and 5 can squeeze in a hundred minutes into your busy

22 February 2012,Maybe I was just in a good mood...,but I found this latest DC entry in the superhero movie sweepstakes to be far more entertaining than the critics and box office would have otherwise led me to believe it would be and certainly far more satisfying than a number of recent Marvel offerings which shall remain nameless all of which including Green Lantern I caught for free thanks to my public library Maybe it just stems from being a GL fan back in the day or maybe because the film makes absolutely no attempt to be anything but a comic book story Without question as in virtually all superhero movies comics real science is out the window and it matters not a whit Ryan Blade III Reynolds plays the reluctant hero with affable aplomb Blake The Sisterhood of the Baggy Pants Lively measures up as the plucky love interest and quality support from Mark Stardust Strong Peter Boys Don t Cry Sarsgaard etal keeps things from collapsing into camp or derailing into vain attempts at gritty realism or high significance I for one found that refreshing I was leery when I saw the multiplicity of screen writing credits but Green Lantern proved to be the exception to the rule of too many cooks spoiling the broth Martin Casino Royale Campbell holds the reins well keeping the action fluid and discernible while Dion Collateral Beebe proves his DP Oscar was no fluke Production quality is of a piece I had no problem with the CGI in home viewing and didn t miss whatever 3 D may or may not have brought into the mix Not much else to say really If you haven t much liked watching the last decade or so s worth of superhero movies you won t care about Green Lantern If you enjoy an occasional comic book romp Green Lantern is worth a spin The cheaper the better of course but still worth it,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2570289/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2013,"Not good for the comic lovers, and not good for the movie lovers",Indeed this movie didn t reach any of my expectations The casting was too lame and the script was too usual While trying to create the powerful Green Lantern they could have thought of something better especially since they have Hal Jordan as Green Lantern here But alas the worst has been done by working on a poor script and lame direction The effects were good but they could have worked hard on it The story is all the same The good guy gets chosen He trains He quits He realizes the world need s him He comes back He wins But I am tired of this usual stupid plot Overall a disappointment for comic lovers and an average watch for those who just wanna see the movie,4.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2738763/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,Underrated movie,Watch the movie and decide for yourself I think I watched this movie back in 2011 and was curious because I was watching Stargirl with my daughter and one of the characters in the series reminded me of then Green Lantern Yes the plot of the movie could have been better but I was great for setting up the hero Too bad they didn t make sequels I guess they lost money,10.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7239350/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2017,"Sure, it could have been better...",The story is passable after you get past the Top Gun similarities at the beginning The CGI is rather good I thought even if it felt understated at times The acting unfortunately was average to poor with some really useless dialog that belongs in a comic book but not in a movie I just did not feel the vibe like we are supposed to when we are presented what is essentially an action super hero movie it just was too subdued throughout much of it But It is a pretty entertaining movie and that is what any movie is created for,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3837725/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2011,Its trash compared to The Dark Knight.,Ryan Reynolds is the arrogant test pilot Hal Jordan in Green Lantern a visual marvel at times but an empty film non the less Green Lantern has a great cast but the film is unoriginal and overall worth a pass in my opinion When you compare it to something like The Dark knight its a piece of trash Reynolds is always likable and to me always seems arrogant So I think he is a good fit here Hal is a test pilot who one afternoon is chosen by a dying purple alien and becomes a member of the Green Lantern Corps The films villain is Parralax a hideous blob that is trying to destroy well the world Parralax has possessed Hector Peter Sarsgaard an ugly scientist for no reason at all You don t get to know him much before he starts looking like the elephant man All you know is that him and Hal aren t fond of each other because they vie for the affections of Carol Blake Lively The scenes between Reynolds and Lively are enjoyable and she is eye candy and some of the movie is too But there isn t enough character development which is always needed in a comic book film You don t much about any of them The outer space scenes where Hal is training looks like something out of a Star Wars set and the movie is kind of like that in its own way Director Martin Campbell who works wonders with Casino Royale fails to give these characters depth I like a comic book film where you can side with both hero and villain like Spider man 2 I couldn t side with Hector because well I didn t know him Green Lantern isn t a horrible movie it just doesn t compare to something like The Dark Knight C,0.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2459851/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,In blackest night..,First let me say I love Green Lantern Since early childhood Hal Jordan and his alter ego have been my favorite comic book characters So it s not pleasant to report the general failure of the movie What were these guys thinking Both reviewers and casual film goers keep saying the same thing The story when it moves off Earth to the planet Oa and the Green Lantern Corps is fairly compelling but when Jordan returns home the whole thing just dies Despite a fine performance the character of Hector Hammond should not have been here Blake Lively apparently was directed to act like an automaton perhaps foreshadowing the future for this character Tim Robbins was wasted in his role as Senator Hammond In the end I just didn t care about the supporting cast and feel most of this back story should have been jettisoned leaving the focus squarely on Hal Jordan and his destiny as a member of the Green Lantern Corps The ill advised use of Parallax while intriguing on a galactic scale and challenge for the Green Lanterns might not have been a wise choice for an origin story Even worse it looked to be amateurishly conceived and almost comical as a threat to Earth Speaking of which a film with such a budget has no business looking cheap around the edges So will there be a sequel Box office results suggest no but given a different take Green Lantern may still rise to greatness,6.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445969/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2012,Another Disappointing Entry t,2011 was a good year for Marvel but the same could not be said toward DC Instead of presenting a good story that focused well with the characters this film focused more on presenting a complete CGI world with countless amounts of mindless moments To me this was made by a director who loved the comic book and tried to recreate every bit of detail into the story However in the end he presented the Green Lantern universe in a picture book fashion only introducing the universe and the Lanterns just to bring in some wows There is nothing new to the film following a typical clich of super hero flicks and presenting a very bland storyline If you like these films then you won t probably mind everything on the other hand if you want a comic book film that focuses on the character then you ll probably be disappointed The story didn t had enough power and enough of that entertainment that many super hero films had in order to grab your attention The story tends to jump all over the place not being exactly sure of what story it wanted to tell Characters don t help boost the entertainment either and fails to tell a simple tale about one of DC s memorable characters The worst about the story has to be the main character as you barely see Hal Jordan Green Lantern portrayed by Ryan Reynolds go into action and to actually illustrate his development You only see him train for a few minutes then he quits being the hero and changes his mind in the end There are no signs of portrayal of Hal s progress only portraying his denials and worries that caused the film to drag and creating a huge gap Personally there were plenty of pointless features displayed in the film You will not buy the comic relief character and view him as a loose end to the humor The relationship between Hal and his love interest tends to be everywhere making it hard to buy their chemistry The worst had to be the characters themselves being introduced but completely being a loose end to the story playing no important role Basically you will not care for any of the characters especially toward the only 5 who actually mattered You won t care about the characters won t care about the chemistry and will simply not even be impressed with the villains since you have a humanized Brain from Pinky and the Brain and a huge yellow cloud that looks like a dust cloud from Pigpenn of Peanuts Dr Hector Hammon portrayed by Peter Sarsgaard was definitely not menacing and wasn t even worth to exist in the plot He actually does nothing that makes him matter and although the yellow cloud does do some damage it was quite useless as a villain as well You will not root for the characters not even for the main character whom you are supposed to cheer the most You will definitely see plenty of these moments that are filled with CGI used for the characters and for the powers of the Green Lantern The ideas and creativity behind the ring bearer s was quite nice as you see these characters imagination come to life as they unleash their power The action however cannot be said the same because of how it lacked that creativity and ideals Some of the abilities that you will see are quite questionable as they cause the film to drag making no complete sense One perfect example is this crazy helicopter crash and rather than producing a net the Green Lantern produces a race car to catch the plane making a childish and pointless scene that was certainly unneeded You barely get to see the action and did not develop this high speed action that you would want in a super hero film The final battle was especially disappointing as it lacked that dynamic battle that you wanted especially since the main antagonist is a fart cloud When it comes to the acting I won t completely blame the actors for their portrayal since most of them were actually good I still see Ryan Reynolds as The Flash and find it a total miscast but he did good overall Peter Sarsgaard despite being a pointless villain actually was good Blake Lively was pretty hot and decent as her role she did the best to keep the romantic factor of the chemistry alive I was quite surprised with the voice performances by Mark Strong Michael Clarke Duncan and Geoffrey Rush to commit the roles of the other ring bearers Tim Robbins is also in the film but I find him the most misleading as he once again plays a character that is not needed The complete winner of 2011 of the super hero genre is definitely Marvel since the only DC movie that came out of the year simply sucked Having a bland plot annoying and pointless characters mindless action and heavily relying on CGI in order to grant the attention of the audience simply caused this film to fail If you do like these types of films then chances are that you will like it but others will definitely find this a disappointing entry to the DC universe,3.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2623898/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2021,"great effects and as someone who isn't familiar with the source at all, fun to an extent; but too much romantic drama and a very underwhelming finale",I really like Ryan Reynolds but I stand by saying I think he does straightforward comedy the best Mixing it up makes it hard to take him seriously during solemn scenes Not to say he isn t a bad actor The first wholly mostly serious role I watched him in was Smokin Aces and I loved it and him But in this it s just all over the place Particularly cringey we re the melodramatic romantic scenes and the rehashing to death of the whole I m not fearless thing The effects themselves are really cool and fun especially the cosmetics on Peter Saarsgard who I d have to say stole the show in this one Most of the characters are just meh although I honestly loved the villain Parallax as loathesome as he it was That said the climax felt particularly underwhelming but at under 2 hours it wasn t a terrible time spent though I ll likely never watch it again,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7516826/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2011,Green Lantern Part 1 (SPOILER ALERT!),This should have been called Green Lantern Part 1 Because that is what it felt like If you are familiar with the story you ll love it But if you re new to the series don t have your expectations too high First realism was never in the equation due to it s story Ryan Reynolds is well cast as Hal Jordan Blake Lively does a decent job as Carol Ferris but her character is reduced to a typical love interest and in the story she s mote than that Peter Sarsgaard is a decent but ineffective villain Mark Strong is fabulous as Sinestro but you never felt the relationship between he and Hal Disappointing considering his eventual turn to evil The love story between Hal and Carol is not fully explored either The action is pretty much left to the back end and doesn t really hit you Martin Campbell s direction is off pace Overall it is a mess However I recommend seeing the animated film Green Lantern First Flight prior to seeing this It is better on the whole and tells the whole origin story arc Lastly I think the future sequels will help clarify all of the subplots for all non fans A decent start to what could be a good series if done correctly,6.0,5.0,11.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444967/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2016,I can't believe this is from the director of Casino Royale,Green Lantern is a bland hopelessly by the numbers origins story of a fairly obscure superhero I d never even heard of This time it s a pilot who is given a space ring and becomes an intergalactic superhero with some actually awesome powers involving creating anything out of thin air This has some good ideas and Ryan Reynolds who I ve never had a problem with and always rather liked even though he rarely appears in a good movie is good as the lead character he has some interesting superpowers and there are occasionally punchy entertaining moments Aside from that this is doomed from the word go This is barely a live action film more a woefully artificial and even worse very poorly animated cartoon filled with CGI blobs falling left right and center As a result you could start to wonder if you re actually watching Tetris the movie Underdeveloped characters terrible villains a dull script and no real tension make this a difficult film to sit through overall and throughout its run time it bounces between idiotic and dull This is one comic book movie dud and its low box office taking was well deserved It s arguably worse than Batman Vs Superman 4 10,4.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3491751/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,could have been better,one thing this film lacked was pace or an exciting story line i was bitterly disappointed with the villain because the villain had several similarities as the one rise of the silver surfer the best part about this film where the visual effects which were good but at times didn t make any sense at all the film was further bought down by the lack of emotion coming from the actors much of the emotional stuff was very predictable and even then it was done horribly i blame the direct because i thought since martin Campbell who directed a James bond movie was on the project we would get a decent film but instead we got a just barely good film i was very disappointed the casting of the actors and choice o director didn t work for me,4.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448527/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2023,Warner Bros is trying to do their best.,Warner Bros Is making an effort to develop a fantasy action hero franchise with a self deprecating sense of humor and superhuman abilities The protagonist wears a skin tight green outfit and a matching mask that are both noticeably less cool than Batman s and less recognizable than Superman s outfits This might result in subpar box office results and a general weariness with such endeavors When Hal Jordan the future Green Lantern was a young boy his beloved test pilot father perished in a fiery accident He developed into a fearless airman and daredevil whose guiding principle is to flee from both women and plane crashes In this location Carol Ferris a fellow traveler and aviation heiress has experienced two burns Due to his lack of fear Hal is chosen to join the elite Green Lantern Corps by the guardians of a long ago civilization There is a lot of exposition in the script for the benefit of both the audience and Hal and it was written by the team of Greg Berlanti Michael Green Marc Guggenheim and Michael Goldberg Elderly Yoda like sages have long ruled over a small number of different species on the intergalactic outpost known as Oa Hal notifies humanity when a rebel Corps leader decides to embrace fear and transform into the arch villain Parallax by using his green ring and enabling lantern which are given to him by the purple skinned man Abin Sur The government commissions Hector Hammond an unproven superhero to examine Abin Sur s corpse He is thrilled about the chance but unknowingly contracts the infection from the exposure and transforms into a mind reading Elephant Man clone with a fanatical propensity for evil and a debt to his influential political father to settle Playing the role which feels like a clever parody of John Malkovich at his most enigmatic is a lot of fun for Sarsgaard The most crucial information in this text is that Parallax an octopus like fire breathing billowing changing brown cloud arrives on Earth in an aesthetically terrifying form and that Hal finally gets over his reservations to embrace his new abilities and lure Parallax to the place where he would meet his demise There is enough action to keep viewers 3D glasses firmly in place but Carol s last second saving the day in a climactic emergency is ridiculous and the hero s method of saving a sizable outdoor gathering from an out of control helicopter looks clumsy Reynolds succeeds as a bad boy who has greatness thrust upon him so subsequent films won t have to put up with his doubts Reynolds now more closely resembles the Warren Beatty of 1965 Regarding sequels the end titles make it apparent which nice character becomes bad in the next scene,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8886284/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2011,"Mark Millar, are you serious? This had flaws, but not the worst superhero movie",This was one of the movies I was looking forward to this summer It was directed by Martin Campbell who directed Goldeneye Casino Royale 2006 and The Mask of Zorro But as the reviews came in after it s release critics were bashing this movie and Mark Millar called it the worst superhero movie ever I saw this movie without the 3D and Mark Millar should reconsider what he said because it s not the worst superhero movie I think he should see Spider Man 3 Hulk Eric Bana s version Catwoman Jonah Hex and Batman and Robin and reconsider his thoughts Ryan Reynolds did good for the most part Blake Lively was attractive in this movie and did decent acting wise Peter Sarsgaard did good but his screaming made me laugh Mark Strong was great as his performance as Sinestro But there were things I had to consider though this was the hardest superhero movie to bring to life Because the Green Lantern hasn t been taken seriously in the comics For the most part it made it flow well but the story at times can be slow and I wanted to see more of him training to become the Green Lantern This movie should have been a little longer and should have added more story to it And I really didn t see no need for the 3D technology except for the beginning were Parallax sucked the life out of those people for the first time but other than that I was glad I saw it in 2D But this movie had me entertained for what it was The action was good and the story was decent but there was more to be desired The ending with Sinestro putting on the yellow ring will signal a sequel and I hope they make one so that they can develop the story more But I enjoyed myself and Mark Millar and the critics were being way too hard on this movie It s a good movie to see in the theaters or see it on Netflix Overall the Green Lantern was a entertaining superhero movie but there are better superhero movies than this,7.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2453662/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2012,About 1/2 to 2/3 a good movie; but.......,In Hollywood s increasing attempts to find franchises to exploit Warner Bros came knocking on subsidiary DC Comics door and came back with Green Lantern Lantern has had a storied history as one of the leading lights of the Silver Age of Comics approximately the mid 50s through the 60s and was the platform for the socially relevant stories of Denny O Neil and Neal Adams However over the years he proved a difficult character for many to get a handle upon the writers of this film all four of them included There is a decent story thread through here but it takes a lot of patience to get there The film is big on visual spectacle and action as one would expect from Martin Campbell James Bond and Zorro but the characters needed more work and the casting appears to have been guided by name recognition rather than ability for several key roles The film makes extensive use of CGI but it has such an artificiality to it that much of the film feels like a video game rather than a dramatic work Ryan Reynolds is cast as the hero Hal Jordan Here is where some of the problems start Reynolds isn t bad when the script is up to the challenge but he isn t able to elevate the weaker moments which makes up most of the first act of the film Reynolds improves as he moves away from Earth and encounters Oa and the other Green Lanterns This is also where the script starts to come alive The CGI allows for a grand alien environment but Reynolds seems too removed from it Perhaps an actor with more stage training or experience in this realm might have added a greater sense of realism He does handle the action sequences well and is suitably awed by his new job and colleagues Mark Strong is excellent as Sinestro though unfortunately the filmmakers chose CGI rather than makeup to render the character Strong is an excellent actor with a great physical presence but some of that is robbed by the artifice Blake Lively is sadly miscast She brings very little to the proceedings apart from a pretty face and barbie doll proportions She is laughable when she tries to deliver technical dialogue especially aeronautical terms You just can t buy her as a pilot let alone an executive at an aviation company Peter Saarsgard gets to have the fun as the villain Hector Hammond and provide a physical presence for the antagonist He is better before mutating though he is still able to keep things within the bounds of believability as someone whose inhibitions have been torn aside and his true psychoses have been thrust upon the surface You feel equally sorry for his self esteem issues and creeped out as you watch his obsessions twist him The rest of the cast are generally fine serving their functions As for the film it works better when we move away from Earth and the scope expands beyond the mundane and into the cosmic This is where Green Lantern has always worked best as saving someone from a burning building or crashing helicopter seem small challenges for someone who can craft anything his mind can imagine It takes a bigger canvas to let that imagination run its course and space provides such a canvas Really the film needed to jettison much of the earhtbound material especially the early scenes establishing Hal as a screwup and move right along to space It was far more interesting to see Hal pulled out of his environment and confronted with issues beyond his experience to see his skills challenged and to watch him grow into a leader That is where the story focus should have been not clich d romance and rivalry Better to have Hal rise to the challenge to defeat Parallax alongside the Green Lantern Corps providing the leadership where Sinestro falters which sort of happens here setting up future events which comic fans and viewers of Justice League know all too well All in all it s a decent film but one that would have been better to follow the examples of something like Babylon 5 where CGI created alien worlds and fantastic energies constructs but practical effects created aliens with presence and a physical environment that actors can work within,6.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2605921/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2011,Popcorn Fun of a Warm Summer's Day,Given the negative reviews I was a little apprehensive about going to see Green Lantern but I m glad I did I think critics are comparing it to movies like Iron Man and Batman Returns which is a huge mistake and unfair to the film Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are no Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow but they do have a sweet chemistry between them and Green Lantern may not be as darkly complex as Batman but sometimes you want a lighter superhero flick Green Lantern is fun full of nice eye candy and doesn t take itself too seriously in other words a great popcorn movie perfect for when you just want to unwind after a hard week,8.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2455819/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2019,A Great Analogy Within a Boring Movie,Green Lantern is all about the idea that we can create anything we can visualize the only thing holding us back is Fear Once the fear is in us everything can be lost That idea I loved but the film itself is not that great Ryan Reynolds is a likeable actor but here he plays the type of role we expect boyish and sarcastic but lovable The rest of the cast are given little to do and perhaps the only fun anyone is having would be Peter Sarsgaard as the pawn of the main antagonist I didn t outright hate it but the potential was there and wasted,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5073584/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2011,Really enjoyed it. Much better than critics sait it was.,This movie really blew my mind Before I watched the movie I really wasn t expecting much I loved the trailers but once the reviews and horrible rotten tomatoes score came out I really lost hope This did not diminish my interest for the movie so I gave in to my needs and went to the midnight showing at Elmwoods AMC Loews theater in Buffalo NY In my opinion considering this was a Origins movie it was very entertaining throughout the length of the movie and both lead actors Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds were pleasant to look at Their on screen chemistry was very strong in most of their scenes with the exception of just a couple The thing that made this movie for me was the fact that even though the commercials gave away a lot of material and even though I knew what was going to happen I was eager to see what was coming next and what obstacles our Green Lantern would have to overcome This is a perfect summer Blockbuster and is recommended to everyone but don t over hype it so it falls below your expectations but don t believe the critics either Enjoy PS Please stay after the credits For those of you comic book fans you probably know whats going to happen but its still epic tl dr watched Green Lantern Was great recommended by me D for David,8.0,7.0,15.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444721/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2023,The worst visuals in a not that bad story,Speaking of bad VFX for The Flash I wanted to revisit a movie that has an even worse reputation for the same reasons In this my second time watching it I have to say that its visuals are indeed horrible but the story is actually not that bad I enjoyed it although it was difficult to follow the story line when the visual effects are so bad that they are distracting to the point of taking you out of the plot But maybe there s no need to keep kicking this movie to the ground by continuing to badmouth its visual effects it s already too obvious and well known I m not a follower of this character in the comics however I ve seen some animated movies about him From there you can see that the original material is not too far from what is seen in this feature film There is some comedy action and a lot of traditional heroism Perhaps some events come for no apparent reason hinting at a somewhat careless edition but it s not so terrible There s at least one efficient basic structure a villain with a good background althought he falls too easy considering how big of a threat he was Anyway watch it if you get the chance If you do do your best to skip the poor quality visuals and focus on the plot,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9127263/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2017,Disappointed!,We were six years ago all optimistic that this film would rock and why to doubt the Dark Knight trilogy was pitch perfect up to that point and the next year it would be concluded In other words it made scene in both the fan point of view and the business point of view But the final product was a a epic let down Now I won t repeat the reason of the awfulness of this film for they are already known ugly CGI stiff acting too much exposition lack of action and character development No I will complain for the magnitude of the failure and what it meant for the DC It meant that it couldn t follow the greatness of the recent batman films the planned films based on this film were scraped so they went two years later and made Man of Steel originality to the minimum and overall a average over crowed film Another thing that furiates me is that in 2009 a straight to DVD 45 minutes shorter manage to do what 200 million feature film couldn t yes I am talking about the first flight Seriously this is a issue with the DC films say what you want about the Marvel films apart from Fantastic 4 of 2015 all after 2010 work as films However this trend may finally been broken after the Wonder Woman film from earlier this June I don t want to sound pessimist but after so many miss fires only time and several more films with tell if DC has finally found its footing In conclusion what this flick proved beyond any doubt is that fans will come to watch their heroes and heroines in the big screen but if you want to keep them and make them return you have to make good products,4.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3744149/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2021,No green with envy for this film,This film is like a good secret agent You just don t notice it at all It blends into the green background and almost dissappears in it s own blandness The only thing that is remarkable is how totally and utterly unremarkable it is Credit to Ryan Reynolds that he still built a career despite having this on his CV,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7441842/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2012,Emerald Dawn,Green Lantern isn t a perfect movie but then what is The movie takes the modern day origin of Green Lantern and changes it a bit The origin almost stays the same Abin Sur is one of the Greatest Gren Lanterns He is tasked with finding and stopping Parallax a ancient creature made of fear When Abin Sur meets Parallax he is defeated and runs to Earth where his ship crashes and dying He sends his ring out to find a worthy successor and finds it in Hal Jordan Hal is a daredevil high flying test pilot But Hal doesn t have the slightest idea about responsibility The Ring selects Hal because he has no fear in him Or so we are led to believe Once Hal Is recruited by Abin Sur he becomes Green Lantern But he doesn t have the slightest idea of what it is he s supposed to do or how to do it Fight Crime easy save lives even easier The Rest of the movie is Hal Jordan meeting the Green Lantern Corps and finding his place amongst the Green Lantern corps The movie recreates The World of Green Lantern really well Hal Jordan and his girlfriend boss Carol Ferris And the rest of the Green Lantern Corps and the evil Hector Hammond who becomes possessed by Parallaz and given godlike powers The climax is one of the best fight scenes I ve see in recent years the sheer imagination it took to shoot this is film making as it should be I ve enjoyed it for what it is adventure at it s finest Green Lantern is not a Oscar winning film But you can t beat it for what it is A thrilling tale of heroes and heroism,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2677568/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2016,That not bad critic-folks. Read some comics!,Green Lantern deserves some credit It tries and it tries hard Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds has his work cut out for him his Green Lantern s completely outs muscled by DC favourites Batman and Superman He s chosen by the universe s greatest to represent Earth tackling a bulbous headed professor Peter Sarsgaard a giant tentacle looking creature a romance with fellow pilot Blake Lively and some been there done that daddy issues This film only dapples in its plot points but none quite gel Harder to believe is Hal left on his Lal to save the world TGL s leader Sinestro Mark Strong and his buddies are left out of what could have been an epic showdown Some good scenes are amongst the mundane and the CGI is terrific Hal Jordan though promptly suffers left without an audience to care for him The Green Lantern is good but never coming out its superhero origin romance showdown with villain formula,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3436537/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,A big waste,If you look at the team behind Green Lantern you will find the actors and behind the camera crew are the best possible fit anybody could ever find Ryan Reynolds can bring any role to life with his charm and wit Blake Lively was perfectly cast as Carol Peter Saarsgard as the villain watch for his scenes They were for me the highlights of the film Mark Strong as Sinestro is pitch perfect And Martin Campbell the man who brought James Bond to life twice in the last 2 decades in the director s chair was the best possible decision taken by the producers The question you should be asking right now is what went wrong then THE SCRIPT I don t think the writers have been following the comic book movies since 2008 Otherwise they would have known that Dark Knight Iron man changed everything People now expect more from movies inspired by comics No wonder it took 3 people to write the story and 4 to write the screenplay One single person cant be this dumb The story of Green Lantern as most of you know by now is about Hal Jordan a fearless pilot who is give a ring of power and asked to protect earth sector 2814 And then they have the part where he learns how to use the new found power and the part where he tries to save the girl and an eccentric evil genius and a threat to the earth and many other side plots If you read the last sentence again you will notice that it was the story of Superman Also the editor of GL is from Superman itself Kilowog and Tomar Re are just props and not that impressive On the whole Green Lantern is going to leave you wanting for more and not in a good way I still cant believe Martin Campbell was involved in this Also I call for Ryan Reynolds not to be involved in DEADPOOL Just coz he killed Green Lantern,4.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448541/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2011,uh... OK.,Well as an action flick Green Lantern was interesting I guess The film seemed choppy as if they edited large scenes out of the movie and didn t bother to film new scenes that gave shorter explanation as to what just happened As someone who s never actually ready the comics it was interesting but to go up against an enemy that is never true defeatable such as fear the ending seemed rather anti climatic as impossible Fear is never defeated on conquered in a situation it always has the chance of coming up in power again As for actor choices I like Ryan Reynold he s a cute guy but I personally preferred a African American as green lantern its just a better choice in my view I can t really take Ryan Reynold seriously as a super hero especially when he s just a cute face and sexy body to make the rom coms actually succeed As for Blake lively got to say I like her better as a blonde I enjoyed her performance but found her character and the script to be highly lacking But am I wrong or is the red dude supposed to be the bad guy a little lost there But I m sure it will all be explained when some big company decides to make a crummy sequel,6.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2515515/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2021,"It's not that bad, actually better then some more current DC movies (sorry Justice League, Wonder Woman 1984)",Funny thing is I avoided this movie because of the critics when it came out Found an unopened Blueray at a consignment store and purchased as a joke for my husband We made it part of a bad movie date night thinking we would be panning it and to our surprise actually liked it Poor Ryan Reynolds taking the heat for this all these years Decent story good cast of characters entertaining CGI when the ring was used Compared to some of the more recent DC movies this is a gem,8.0,2.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7100246/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,Very underrated and over bashed,This movie was very enjoyable for me I love movies like this action with little thought process How people complain about a movie without too much character development is beyond me If you want character development or story development watch one of those 3 hour movies that puts you to sleep This is a light hearted movie nothing serious but nothing too light Some people complain how Hal Jordan can defeat Parallax but Abin Sur could not For one thing Abin Sur didn t know what he was dealing with and he was contained in his ship when he was attacked Hal Jordan had advanced warning knew what drove and fed Parallax and had plenty of room to maneuver It can also be said that Parallax underestimated Hal Jordan because of the fact he was from a young species of humans and took him lightly like we don t see this storyline of underestimating an opponent into failure every week in sports As for predictable storyline if you read the comics you know the storyline If you watch any superhero movie you know the hero will prevail Duh what did you think he was going to die The CGI was great do people expect something new for every movie with CGI CGI is used to help tell the story Period beautiful looking sets alien characters and explosions As for the acting it was above average Ryan Reynolds is as good as can possibly be no shame in that he s a decent actor Blake Lively was smoking hot as usual and acted well also Bottomline the movie is worth the admission Don t listen to the naysayers who study movies or try to pick a movie apart of guess what is going to happen Extremely enjoyable movie to waste the afternoon away without having to think about this crappy economy,8.0,3.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447677/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,I've read some of the other reviews...,I ve read some of the other user reviews and I find a lot of them laughable Was this a great movie No Was it a bad movie No of course not I went into Green Lantern the same way I would go into oh I don t know a Hangover movie You pretty much know what you re going to get I suppose however that most of the same critic wannabes I had the displeasure of reading will probably go into the Smurfs movie with their quippy lines and well thought out rants already typed up and ready to send It s easier to jump on the band wagon than it is to be honest I guess Personally I thought Green Lantern was fairly good Now I should preface that with the fact that I already knew a bit about the ring wearing superhero before going in That doesn t mean however that I wouldn t have been entertained otherwise In fact I thought the movie was entertaining Granted it seemed rushed and it was but I left the movie theater feeling neither giddy nor disappointed I jut wanted more I wish there was more More action more fighting more build up Just more To those of you bashing the special effects or the storyline you obviously don t know much about Green Lantern And that s fine This movie obviously isn t for you Have fun watching the Smurfs,7.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447818/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,Just For the Green,In brightest day in blackest night lack of serious acting and a limited script makes this film bite There is only one reason to see this film the visuals And you do not need to spend a fortune to see them in 3D since there are not many Somewhere somehow some idiot decided to make Hal Jordan into Ryan Reynolds and not have Reynolds act like Hal Jordan He isn t likable he is arrogant and cocky nothing compared to the Hal Jordan of the comics who was a dedicated professional pilot who is loyal The movie version of Hal Jordan is a mirror image of today s youth arrogant unreliable womanizer who runs away from responsibility The visuals are the only thing worth seeing Wait until it hits BluRay and you will be more satisfied,6.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445949/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2011,"""Green Latern"" is what it is",I ll start out saying I have never read any of the comics so the concept of the Green Lantern is relatively new to me With that said I thought that it was a interesting story behind what Green Lanterns are their powers and the other Green Lanterns were pretty cool but something just seemed to be missing This movie is exactly what you d think it would be a movie with a cool super hero and awesome effects but the story is a bit clich for the genre which didn t bother me that much If you go into this honestly expecting cinematic beauty all I can say is why This is meant for entertainment and it does a pretty good job at that The action sequences and attention to detail with the other planets creatures aliens and what have you really was great so kudos to the special effects team Acting was meh I think Ryan Reynolds fit the role Mark Strong was great Peter Sarsgaard was effectively creepy weird and Blake Lively well all she had to do was look sexy pretty mission accomplished However the clich love story seemed forced to me and the chemistry between the actors just wasn t there Other clich areas of the story actually seemed to poke fun at themselves which added to some of the other funny moments Also the only other draw back was not even the fault of the movie but the marketing team They left little room for surprises and potentially hurt my experience in the theater because the movie started to become kind of predictable since I was piecing together parts of the trailer before they came up on the screen Again that is not the fault of the movie Overall it is a fun watch for entertainment purposes Cool hero interesting powers back story of Green Lanterns and great special affects 8 Stars,6.0,4.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444896/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2012,"Interesting movie, great visuals, meh ending",These movies based off of comic books are interesting As I don t read the comics or the book I tend to judge a movie based on it s story and acting and if it gets me emotional This movie just didn t do that for me The visuals were impressive yes I fully admit that CGI wise it was very well made However you must remember that it isn t just the visuals that matter but also the story and acting The story was okay It seemed a bit too science fiction for me to be able to judge it fairly as I judge based on reality and this wasn t But from what the plot was trying to suggest I was interested to see how it went Until the ending came It seemed forced and the surprise wasn t really there The acting was okay but again it s like any movie Good guy gets the girl right At least there were no random sex scenes that were unnecessary Anyway I ll rate this 7 10,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2560483/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2019,Very nice film,This film is very nice I enjoyed watching it on theatre and I enjoyed rewatching it on DVD It is a nice action movie enjoyable funny It is so much better than the hideous and I mean absolutely hideous Deadpool I think at the end of Deadpool 2 where Ryan Reynolds actually shoots himself while reading the Green Lantern script it should have been the other way round Green Lantern is a real hero Deadpool is an atrocity So I do not understand Why movies like Dreadpool are highly rated and movies like Green Lantern are disregarded Actually I wanted it to have a sequel and it was made to have a sequel at least that is what the ending implies I found the movie worth watching and do not be fooled by the bad reviews Sometimes I watch movies with low ratings out of curiosity and frankly most of the times they are much better than other acclaimed masterpieces,8.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4799846/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2012,Worst superhero film.,The movie starts with the same old thing with an intro towards the whole subject of the film than moving on to our hero who is shown as someone having problem coping up some childhood issues and from nowhere the ring moves on to him And worst of all stating the he alone was worthy for that Amazing thing on his Ryan Reynolds part is that he didn t seem to be surprised with the extraterrestrial matter May be his acting was mediocre The ring takes the hero to their training camp where without even introducing him properly his training got started as if they need not pay attention to the new recruits When he seemed unfit for the power and when the native people said like he is not fit and all the hero just abandons the place and goes back to his planet and the natives don t even do anything regarding that Laughable thing is that all this seemed to happen in just 15 20 minutes Than talking about the villain who is shown as a victim of poor CGI and is seemingly very horrifying but for the major part he is not shown It is completely absurd that the whole alliance is not ready to fight together with the villain but instead only HAL is sent to fight for his planet and surprisingly in just 15 minutes time he beats him without showing any struggle The villain was made a complete fool as he never was shown having a chance to harm the hero in any sense VERDICT Keep yourself away from this,5.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2651266/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2013,One of the best comic book movies I've seen.,Original different interesting and entertaining The critics don t know what they re talking about Other comic book super hero movies are full of predictable clich and boring formula plot lines This movie Green Lantern is so different it is wholly original and like nothing I ve ever seen before I really enjoyed it and thought it is one of the best movies I ve seen in a long time Obviously every movie ever made some people will say worst movie ever or best movie ever The story spans the universe and is so much bigger and more interesting than so many other comic book based movies It has original ideas and themes of fear and willpower used in a way I have never seen before One of the best super hero comic book movies I ve seen A really great fantastic movie An incredible science fiction fantasy story on an epic scale,8.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2888058/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,I went to the movie with reservations...,I went into the movie with reservations as I wasn t really sold on Ryan Reynolds being Super Hero but I have to tell you he did a pretty good job I am a big fan of many of the modern day Super Hero Movies and I put Dark Knight at the top of the list with X Men 2 as My number 2 Most of the other super hero movies fall in pretty much evenly right behind these two With that said I would say this Movie was at least as Good as the original Iron Man the 1st Spider Man and the 3rd X Men as well as the 2nd Hulk Movie Honestly ignore the lame BS reviews and give the movie a shot as I think you will enjoy it overall and it really is worth seeing on the Big screen One little note they manager to overcome the myth that his powers didn t work on the color yellow and explained that it is Yellow Energy they work against Also stay until the Credits are finished or you will miss seeing the birth of The Green Lantern s 1 Enemy Oh and one let note there have been many Green Lanterns as the Ring is passed on when one dies and yes some were Black but not all of them,8.0,3.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445854/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2013,3D Blu-Review,I did watch the Extended Cut before but I have to say I enjoyed the theatrical cut a little more the movie flows faster and seems to have more energy The 3D presentation is well done and does help with the CGI as well The story is about test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds who is chosen by a ring of power making him part of the Green Lantern Corps which are basically an Intergalactic Army protecting the galaxy from evil Hal is the first human to ever be chosen and needs to prove to the other Lanterns and himself that he can be one of them and protect earth from ultimate doom The 3D presentation is immersive enough and still looks good in the outer space scenes helping the CGI blend as I said before as well A lot of well used floating effects sometimes the villain can become hard to make out but that s the nature of the effect I think so I won t hold it against the movie For the most part the picture isn t overly dark either so that s a plus as well,7.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2838216/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2011,"There is nothing to fear, but an over bloated price tag that doesn't deliver.",Green Lantern is quite like no other comic book film I have seen to date This is perhaps the good and the bad of that notion Beckoned finally by the powers that be a special human is selected by a large corp because they believe he holds leverage over all the others to bring something special to all man kind If you think I m referring to the general plot line I was more steering this towards how Ryan Reynolds garnered the job Reynolds simply isn t a hero Not in a traditional sense and while maybe Hal Jordan isn t the traditional hero Reynolds simply doesn t have the gravitas to deliver He can win me over with a few small scenes but Hal Jordan is destined to carry the weight of the the large responsibility I think Dennis Quaid Now this isn t to suggest that the part should have gone to Quaid but hell how sweet would that film be but we have to believe that there is a possibility that a Quaid lives dormant for the time being in this Hal Jordan body What we get is more akin to Randy Quaid Reynolds is the interchangeable actor You can simply replace him with countless body types and get the same film Bradley Cooper or Paul Walker come to mind There are some scenes that stirred emotion in me and I started to see the potential in what this film had but all this led to more depression because I was more aware of what Martin Campbell missed The more he showcased these small moments the more frustrating it got when he didn t stay with it This was DC s first attempt at a franchise outside of the two powerhouses of the last 30 years and it comes at us like Daredevil or Fantastic Four did for Marvel Ouch The dialogue is messy and stilted There isn t anything memorable here and given the writing credits you d think Berlanti would at least push for some of his signature human emotionfest he was known for to make an appearance The film clunks forward for the first 45 minutes and not until Randy Qua er Ryan Quai Reynolds is literally out of this world does the story lift us and the possibility up Campbell wasn t capable here the 3 D is useless like always and at the end of the day the tone of story simply isn t sweeping Not even a proper theme Lesson 345 of the superhero genre you need a theme Period Fear is what the film focused on I m afraid it failed,0.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2461978/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2011,A Decent Start to a Interesting Franchise,First I would like to start off by saying I was never a Green Lantern comic book fan I have only recently begun reading the Geoff Johns graphic novels They I must admit are quite good especially The Sinestro Corps Wars I think the writers are using the current Geoff Johns novels for this movies storyline First the good that this film brings And interesting Star Wars like plot special effects and Ryan Reynolds Believe me without Ryan this film would have suffered greatly He brings his rye sense of humor and charm to the role of fearless pilot Hal Jordon The special effects despite what many may say are fair especially when Hal goes to Oa Oa is a wonder to behold But that leads me to where the films weakness lies Hal Sinestro Abin Sur and Kilowog voiced by Micheal Clarke Duncan are perfect in there roles however Tim Robbins Angela Basset and even the heroine Blake Lively s Caorl Ferris performance are all flat without much character This may be the writers fault because they obviously focus more on the Lantern corp other than Hal s love interest and other characters But this movie somehow keeps the audience interested with great action sequences and humor to boot That is all you need for a great family movie blockbuster That is all we want when we go to the movies in the summer escapism This film doesn t try to win an academy award nor create a new special effect gimmick like The Matrix or Avatar In the end the weak acting in the co stars a not so interesting protagonist in Hector Hammond and lame end fight with Parallax I think hurt this film s chance in me given it a solid 9 like Thor But it was still pretty entertaining Maybe the in sequel we will get into some darker territory But Ryan did an Okay job Its a a barely 8 out of 10,0.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446382/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2011,"The pacing is off, the humour is wrong and the effects are lacklustre.",This film suffers from a bad case of pitching The story didn t know how to pitch itself didn t know whether to be funny or serious The actors didn t know how to pitch themselves didn t know whether to be funny or serious and the director didn t know how to bring it all together to make it totally coherent So as you ve gathered I think they pitched it incorrectly and its a shame because I see a lot of potential here The overarching storyline isn t too hard to get despite its potential they opted to dumb down the storyline to something fairly straightforward and rather trivial and clich d Ryan Reynolds is actually a fairly strong lead and manages to keep film from completely sinking into the abyss Unfortunately other characters do not match the leading man Blake Lively despite looking the part has no chemistry with Reynolds and acts through her speech but really doesn t embody the role like one would expect Peter Saarsgard is a fairly solid villain but totally under used and the other supporting characters barely get a look in The other big problem is the special effects which aren t quite up there with the likes of Xmen or Dark Knight The Computer generated creatures are so obviously computer effects they almost look fuzzy and Reynolds suit is supposed to just be like skin armour but you can see plainly that its a poorly constructed rubber suit Its fair to say that at times The Green Lantern is fun but all to often is a victim like so many other comic book heroes of being too generic Had this film been more like Thor and used humour to push the story along as opposed to a weak romance and generic story telling it may have faired better Though sometimes The Green Lantern on the whole is enjoyable it has a lot to detract from it Thor is far more enjoyable and I would recommend it over this Maybe if a sequel is made they can work out some of the kinks but for me I m just generally awaiting Dark Knight Rises to show them all how its done,5.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451102/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2011,Entertaining but there were plot malfunctions,One of my favorite scenes is the one in which Sinestro responds to the nervousness of the Guardians at the mention of Parallax s name with deep confusion So what re you saying You BELIEVE this enemy can defeat us The theme of this movie is Fear corrupts and that through strength of will we can overcome the most frightening challenges in our lives Beautiful The acting was awesome frankly That said the story at times didn t make a lot of sense Some of the characters decision making was weird Characters learned things or at times even ILLUSTRATED lessons they d learned then committed actions which were contradictory to their own understanding spoiler follows Sinestro learns from the immortal Guardians eternal beings who must consider the impact of our actions over billions of years that even they have failed to harness the yellow power of Fear Sinestro s response We must forge a yellow ring Really So you with a comparatively pitiful frame of reference can follow a superior IMMORTAL being in failing to harness the power of fear Good thinking Then following an illustrated re affirmation of the continuing supremacy of Will power over Fear Sinestro does the dumbest thing imaginable for no apparent reason WHY What was the impetus I agree that the writers need a beating But apart from that the movie had everything it needed to be so much more I still enjoyed it,0.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2518134/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2011,"Should have been released before ""X-Men: First Class""",You re asking why this movie has gotten such low reviews It s because it premiered 2 weeks after X Men First Class did While this was a pretty good action film by itself I couldn t help but compare this movie to X Men First Class which was superb if I must say and the fairly new Thor Green Lantern started out well Fast paced and full of action and just Riveting But then somewhere along the line the exciting factor dropped The pacing became choppy and the scenery began to look fake I m not sure if the background behind Carol s house was real or not but to me it looked fake I also felt like there were too many thing happening at once The film was too messy The scenes kept alternating between Earth Oa and outer space The movie tried to show what was happening in all three places at once and failed If the movie just focused on one point at a time the film could have gone so much better My golly the transitions were horrible I remember leaning in towards my sister more than once to ask Why is he there now I think that major flaw of this movie was Blake Lively While I love Blake Lively I couldn t help but think that her character wasn t really needed She was nothing but the needed love interest of another superhero The scenes between Ryan and Blake could have been scrapped altogether to be replaced by more action scenes I think that the movie would have done so much better if this was the case I ll say this again I may just be comparing this movie to the other recently released Marvel movies that I watched so my rating may not have been fair at all I think that is the case with many other reviews too But disregarding the fact that this was shown after X Men First Class I think that Green Lantern was pretty adequate for a Marvel film It had good humor at least 2 good fighting scenes and Oh who am I kidding just watch the damn film if you really have to But just know that Green Lantern REALLY falls short when compared to another Marvel film that starts with X Viewed on June 25 2011,6.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448723/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2012,Not Bad but Unexceptional,This film based on the DC Comics character involves arrogant test pilot Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds who is given a super powered ring by a dying alien in a crashed spaceship The ring marks him as a member of the Green Lantern Corps a kind of elite intergalactic police force based out of the planet Oa and gives him the power to turn his thoughts into physical constructs Soon Jordan finds himself pitted against a powerful being that feeds on fear Despite what some critics have said this is nowhere near the worst superhero movie ever made However it is bland and unexceptional It is very much an origin story and is mostly made up of exposition with very few surprises and the villains pretty much taking a back seat for most of it The look and feel of the film is pretty close to the comic book series and there is a nice line in corny humour Ryan Reynolds does a decent job as Hal Jordan but the character is so obnoxious for the most part it is impossible to really sympathise with him and most of the other characters are relegated to one note clich s Blake Lively makes an engaging love interest it s just a pity she is never really given much to do The special effects are good if overused and lose their impact long before the film is over however the alien effects are pretty good Another problem with the film is the fact that Green Lantern kind of has too many powers to be interesting It just feels like kind of a cop out to have a character who can do pretty much anything If you re a fan of the comic than you might enjoy the film s fidelity to it s source but others may find that it lags in many places However there are moments when the film flares up and provides some thrills The trouble is just that there aren t enough of them By the way stick around when the end credits start because there is an additional scene,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2638335/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2011,ringed superpowers,Before we discuss the film I suggest the mystery out of the superhero Flies but not Superman Light but not Iron Man Green but do not Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles With a lantern but not under the eye And if you re reading these lines omitting the title you already know the answer Well to get acquainted with new shoots adaptations of comics is not superfluous to learn the fate of another defender of the Earth and not only Green Lantern Especially pay attention to this movie because the green light of previously unknown on the feature film characters cartoons completely about him and his team participated in the animated Justice League does not count our view is a colorful adaptation of the old kind of comics like and distinguished themselves by the same token what make us happy and other products in the same genre namely super powered humor fantastic graphics and morality the more force the greater responsibility here the same meaning incorporated in the phrase In the darkness of night by the light day of evil does not hide from me and so on oath but this time a priori familiar cocktails adorned from top to the new face and a new superpower attributes but within a fully justifies all of the above expectations simply can not fail to please either comics fan or viewer just decided to rest a couple of hours in front of this spectacle And we have to admit that the spectacle of it in terms of graphics my hopes were positive Beginning with a flight through the cosmos is fascinating and immediately sets up the audience on the future joy to the eye In this respect the contrast of our familiar human world with the scale of affordable Green Lantern came in handy You look at earthly events and see the movie as a movie at least initially to master the power is nothing special even in flights of fighters I have not seen but when the action moves before our eyes and open universe and extraterrestrial beings the picture turns from reality to fantasy not the high quality animation computer game or something but the picture is very very entertaining Needless to say that 3D though not particularly felt in terms of emission objects in the auditorium still gone only for the benefit of the project type of space and the Green Lanterns speak for themselves Special mention deserves the hero s costume when you look at the screenshots footage seems that the actor s head stuck to the suit and the combination turned out far better but on screen whether it s terrestrial planet or fight Lantern the main character looks great with no contrast or the combined effect of filming People from other worlds with strange faces turned at least good quality And as the green light flashes and the ring of objects materizovannye imaginative characters not only create the effect of the previously unseen ability but also look great in a frame Although the main villain Parallax tucheobrazny and convert the hunchback with a psychic from the Earth looked like a much more modest At the suggestion of extraterrestrial crap Flies around the world our new hero Drafted into the ranks of the Lantern By the will of the ring not at his will With the fear of battle to save the girl See Ryan Reynolds do not let me down The plot revolves around a guy named Hal Jordan who acquired an unexpected ring which Frodo did not dream any became a superhero but for the happiness of this did not even ask About how he mastered the force and I started using it and says it s a movie At the same time and found the story of Lanterns in general and in the earthly life of the protagonist in particular Humor fantasy relationships and a couple of thoughts about fear will on demand In the course of history itself whose development is determined before the start of the movie I want to mention that I personally did not have the finale in fact on the face of this long and diverse singles final regular collision happened revealing spectacular and ambitious but on the personal impressions of some smallish Although remember genre predecessors and they then great timing too do not stand out Finally focus on the cast Ryan Reynolds looked just fine in the course of the film not once not twice not even three times as apt glad this is the choice of the actor on a central role Blake Lively played a standard girlfriend of the hero just type as old as the world of superheroes but the muzzle of the performer a new and more on the character can not say anything When looking at the list of founders are still a couple of familiar names at least some familiar faces that made good under zagrimerovali aliens so much so that I am personally not one and not guilty Peter Sarsgaard was well just not bad especially with regard to external changes Result as expected in fact another brilliant film adaptation of comic book with all its successful tradition of humor to science fiction and Bravo theme of struggle against evil and externally a little more original with a new kind of hero picture green color and special effects which could not be better approached another excellent entertainment

7 July 2011,Green Lantern Surpasses Expectations,Green Lantern has never been quite as popular as some of the other heroes in the DC Comics stable Superman and Batman for instance but he s been around in various incarnations since 1940 and is a mainstay of the superhero universe He s also one of the most powerful heroes in comics blessed with a ring which bestows virtually unlimited powers upon its wearer Green Lantern is frequently rated as one of the two most powerful members of the Justice League along with Superman naturally Given his neat powers and renowned history it was only a matter of time before Green Lantern made it to the big screen And the wait has been worth it The story begins when test pilot Hal Jordan discovers what appears to be nothing less than a crashed UFO Without a second thought Jordan pulls the injured occupant of the alien vessel out of the wreckage and tries in vain to save his life But before he passes away the alien informs Jordan that he has been chosen to wear the ring of a Green Lantern Baffled Jordan buries the stranger from the stars and takes the aforementioned ring and its lantern like battery back home with him Gradually Jordan discovers that the ring can draw upon his own willpower and project beams of green energy with which the wearer can form nearly anything imaginable force fields giant bulldozers glowing swords even machine guns and gargantuan fists But when Jordan is called before the Guardians of the Universe and the rest of the Green Lantern Corps he learns that with this power comes enormous responsibility and that he will only achieve his full potential if he can overcome his personal fears Meanwhile the very embodiment of fear a monstrous being known as Parallax flies through outer space toward Earth Can Jordan overcome his inner demons and rise to the world s defense Or will fear be his undoing and that of the Earth as well It s an epic plot perhaps the most ambitious in the history of superhero films but director Martin Campbell pulls it off The story is brought magically to life with some of the best computer generated effects ever captured on film and the assorted aliens monsters and action scenes the plot throws at us are all rendered with an almost ethereal beauty and sense of wonder Thanks no doubt to the unique animated effects and set pieces the movie even looks good in 3D wonder of wonders I would even go so far as to say it is the most expertly rendered 3D film yet produced The cast does an incredible job Ryan Reynolds would probably not be my first choice to play Green Lantern Hal Jordan but despite my misgivings he does a standout job capturing Jordan s transformation from reckless immaturity to sober heroism with an entirely believable portrayal of an iconic comics figure Blake Lively has been criticized for perhaps being a few years too young for the part of Carol Ferris Jordan s on again off again girlfriend and boss but there s nothing wrong with how she actually plays the part and in fact the movie wouldn t work without her And no it doesn t hurt that she s totally hot This could be a big breakthrough role for Lively and the chance to see her reprise the part is a big reason to hope for a sequel Naturally Carol s love provides Jordan with the inspiration he needs to ultimately prove himself worthy of the title hero Mark Strong is outstanding as the enigmatic Green Lantern Sinestro and Peter Sarsgaard delivers a knockout performance as Hector Hammond an ordinary mortal infected by the evil of Parallax and slowly transformed into a being only barely human The parallel lives of Hammond and Jordan play out the ultimate differences between a life lived on willpower or fear The final battle between Jordan and Parallax is cinematic magic accompanied by a stirring recitation of the Green Lantern s vow that may be the most inspiring moment in ANY superhero film to date Visually glorious never boring and well executed on almost every technical front Green Lantern is a terrific addition to the ever expanding canon of live action comic book adaptations A scene after the credits sets up a promising sequel Here s hoping we don t have long to wait,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454681/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2011,Minimally entertaining for it's genre! A slow time waster.,If information from Wikipedia is correct Green Lantern was made for two hundred million dollars I wont go on saying how it s exaggerated and how a whole bunch of actually good movies you know the ones with good script could ve been made with it but i will say that the final result was not even close to being worthy of such money invested in it Not in any way including one concerning visuals While at times the effects really looked amazing i ve seen movies with smaller budgets that look as good if not even better It was quite obvious from the very beginning that the men who were making this movie were not taking it seriously That stands especially for writers And when i say seriously i don t mean something like a whole lot of drama or psychological stuff in a movie about a guy who puts a ring on his finger and turns green but some intelligence can never really hurt a movie You don t have to make it smart but at least you can do since you have so much possibilities with such an enormous amount of money is not make it dumb The bright side of the movie is that sometimes the visuals really do look amazing but even the most spectacular scenes don t look all that impressive because of the highly uninteresting music Not for one second was i scared had an adrenaline rush or anything like it And suspense is something you really need to make movies like this one work Also the main character Hal Jordan a k a Green Lantern is a lot more like some sort of a funny sidekick kinda character than the bad ass he s supposed to be And by the way the jokes are terrible I never laughed Maybe once and that is questionable because i do not remember it Peter Sarsgaard does well with his role as he always does even though it s not the kind of role that anyone will notice no matter how well it was played And reasonably so Mark Strong did a good job as well but the same thing i mentioned about Peter S stands for him too Ryan Reynolds was playing the same role he always plays so it s more up to you weather you like him or not to decide how good or bad his performance was I personally don t dislike him nor really like him so i m gonna say it was fine And Blake Lively wasn t irritating I ll leave her acting abilities for someone else to comment on Some people told me that they were bored by the movie I disagree I didn t find it boring but rather minimally entertaining for it s genre and budget capabilities Not good not worth a watch but i guess you wont feel too sorry for your self if you do,4.0,0.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2497195/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2012,Script problems,Unbeknownst to mankind the entire universe Earth included has been under the protection of a group of intergalactic peacekeepers called Green Lanterns The only limit on their abilities is their imagination and the source of those abilities is willpower along with a ring and an actual green lantern But for the first time in recent history they are vulnerable A dark force that draws his power from fear is picking off Lanterns one at a time Wounded one Lantern crashes on Earth and his ring seeks out his replacement Enter Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds A test pilot for a private aerospace firm Jordan is brash sarcastic and reckless The ring and lantern find him and bring him against his will to his predecessor who informs him of their purpose Going into this I kept referring to it to myself and others as The Green Hornet without meaning to Leaving the theater afterward I still struggle to distinguish the two Of course the characters are immensely different as are the stories The similarities are the tone and the fatally flawed execution I actually like Reynolds generally but maintaining dramatic tension while practically winking at the audience and his fellow cast members is a near impossible task and Reynolds falls far short of accomplishing it The supporting cast doesn t really help but the failure lies with director Campbell and writers Berlanti Green and Guggenheim,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2709618/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2011,A huge failure,CONTAINS SPOILERS This movie sucks in almost every single way Since I can t just address every flaw in a list I ll provide a summary of the film that includes my judgment We are introduced to the Green Lantern Corps an organization of guardians that protects the universe There are 3 600 Lanterns and each one protects a different sector of the universe The movie then shows an incredibly fake looking CGI villain Parallax sucking a yellow colored energy out of several Lanterns killing them Parallax then goes after Abin Sur another Lantern and after being wounded Abin Sur heads for Earth and commands his ring to find a worthy successor We are then introduced to the main protagonist Hal Jordan a cocky test pilot Abin Sur s ring chooses him as his replacement and Hal is teleported to the crash site where he is appointed a Green Lantern and is given Abin Sur s ring and lantern which powers the ring At his apartment we are given a humorous scene in which Hal tries to get the ring to work with the lantern then it immediately turns into an extremely cheesy scene where he says some cheesy dialogue while under a cheesy trance At some point after this Hal ends up on the Green Lantern s home planet where he attempts to go through training but he is resented because he s a human and he decides to quit And now the government has Abin Sur s body and some random person who we know nothing about is called to perform an autopsy then this random person discovers he was only called because of his father s influence Then this person gets psychic powers from Parallax s traces on Abin Sur and becomes an utterly pointless villain that doesn t contribute to the plot at all He tries to kill his dad but Hal as Green Lantern stops him Then later Hal and this random person whose head randomly swells face off again and Big Head discovers Hal s secret identity which at this point isn t so secret as pretty much the only person who doesn t know it is Parallax who doesn t even care This kind of ruins the movie or what s left of it Sometime later Big Head and Hal meet again then Parallax appears out of nowhere and we re supposed to suddenly accept the fact that Parallax has been traveling to Earth this whole time and had commanded Big Head to kill Hal but because Big Head failed due to his completely pointless nature he is killed by Parallax Hal then kills Parallax and he s now a hero among Green Lanterns Yay Then at the very end some Lantern that used to hate Hal puts on the yellow ring of fear that was made earlier in the movie and the movie ends in a cliffhanger but I doubt there will be a sequel considering the reviews and the fact that this movie cost 200 million to make hard to believe considering how fake Parallax looks and only made around 143 million The movie is 2 hours However the plot is so rushed and underdeveloped that it only feels 30 minutes long Probably one of the biggest wastes of 2 hours or 30 minutes ever,0.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2458571/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,The Green Light of Will is Dull in this movie,Review The first green Lanter Movie should have been spectacular However as with several other similar movies the Cruddy utilization and overuse of CGI is what ruined the movie Takeaways Ryan Reynolds was a good casting choice for Hal Jordan the Script was decent Could have been better but I liked how most of the characters were written Except for Peter Skarsgard s Hector Hammond and the Parallax entity Blake lively was also good as the love interest Carol Ferris And of course Reynolds and Lively would famously hook up in real life after this movie I think if sequel s did happen Carol would have eventually become Star Sapphire Again The CGI Stinks And I wish the GL s had actuall costumes and I wish OA was not green screen It s like the Star Wars Prequels all over again lol,5.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8056390/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2021,Anything I see in my mind I can create.,The movie is incredibly CGI heavy I dont think I have seen a movie quite like it in terms of merging live action with CGI backgrounds and costumes I m not sure they could of done the film any other way mind you when you think about the Green Lantern and his abilities or even his general backstory of being an intergalactic peacekeeper His Green Lantern ring can do anything he can think up The story is pretty cliche and doesn t exactly reinvent the super hero origin story There are flashbacks to Hal Jordan reliving childhood trauma with his Dad dying a love hate relationship with his work colleague bosses being disappointed in him powers being thrust upon him that people dont think he is ready for because he s a bit of a slacker etc Ryan Reynolds does an okay job portraying Hal Jordan he hams it up on occasion and his emotional range is limited but it s a silly film anyway so he was a good fit The story is a bit confusing and there are plenty of characters that could of done with further development A lot of them are just there but you dont care about them one way or another Even the main bad guy is confusing and he just starts developing powers for the sake of it with little reason The 3D at the start of the film was really good I felt as it was explaining the history of the Green Lanterns with the beams of light and the planets but then after that it became almost unnoticeable for the rest of the film Final Verdict CGI CGI CGI Outside of the CGI action there really isn t too much else to this film It s not horrible just a by the book super hero film with a surprisingly better cast that it deserves I don t actually mind it if I m honest it was kinda fun in a mindless cheesy way But it s certainly not a must see,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6817422/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2020,Owe-dont hurt me!,The Green Lantern 2011 The the point about how the green lantern works and its origins are fine but this story had much more potential than was visioned being focused on the main character created with daddy issues from his untimely death to justify his behavior detracts from the glory of this while also taming down the brutality relevant to the drama unfolding including taming down the characters themselves means if you are 4 years old ya going to love this but if you are over 12 years old with good education and a sense of the world we live in even when this was made its a let down and quite boringly predictable,3.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5936947/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2014,Underrated Superhero Film,This movie is predictable and a lot of it is pretty hammy but isn t that exactly what you should expect from watching any superhero movie Superman Batman Spiderman all of these movies are very predictable We know what s going to happen What matter is will it get us there in an entertaining way This is not the best superhero movie out there but it has a lot going for it For one thing Ryan Reynolds is a great star for this kind of a role He is likable and he is very funny and you actually believe he s the kind of guy who would care Also Stellan Skarsgaard is an amazing actor and he steals every scene he is in I hope there is a sequel just so we can see more of him Also the effects are amazing and much better than I would have expected from this movie On the down side The Green Lantern is definitely one of the poor boy superheros not as well liked as the other superheroes and there is good reason for that But if you re a fan and don t mind the further out there more campy superheroes this movie is definitely worth watching with some fantastic effects and a couple of great fun performances The final fight is also excellent,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2940699/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2021,Missing the Fun Factor,Not as bad as is reputation Green Lantern is a standard Superhero movie that fails to stand out in the genre The big problem here is not in the acting graphics or the dialogue but rather the overall mood of the movie which just isn t as fun humorous and light as it should be Green Lantern is a fine movie but not one that is much fun to watch,5.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7239294/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Green Lantern,I ve been reading Green Lantern since i was 10 So i have a fairly good knowledge on Green Lantern The first thing i have to talk about is the acting 3 Actors in my opinion were not just OK The First is Peter Sarsgaard as Hector i found him the best Actor in the whole movie but its not saying much The Second was Mark Strong as Sinestro Even though he had very little screen time he was the second best Everyone else was OK Then there was Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan I m not saying he was bad i m saying he was too too Ryan Reynolds Some of the stuff that happen didn t seem like Hal to me People just going to see the movie wouldn t notice though OK not with the effects They were great overall Although it wasn t that great at times i was impressed The effects were nice and clean when needed and edgy when needed Just the effects could make some people to go see it Now with the plot I read Green Lantern comics so that made it easier for me to follow For people who are new could be confused It jumps from earth to space quite often and i was confused at times For a first movie in a new superhero series it was based mostly character development too much There wasn t enough action and when there was action it seemed really rushed and they had to have the movie had to be under 100 mins Well that is my personal opinion on the movie As a green Lantern fan now for many years i felt good watching the movie and i did enjoy it 7 10,7.0,5.0,12.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444882/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,"""green lantern had all stuffs in it..but it just wasn't enough""",i saw green lantern today i had very high expectations sadly not all of them were fulfilled to begin with the positives Ryan suited well as green lantern it had some humorous moments Blake Lively was hot the special effects were awesome and the background score was good it has a wonderful opening scene too the negatives are the story line was very weak it had a fantastic start that looked so promising only to end in a messed up climax Mark Strong as Sinestro looked good but sadly he appears only in smaller parts Peter as Hector Hammond did not form a worthy villain and finally the parallax which looked freaky ended banal the bad part of the movie was the last few minutes it seemed as though film ended abruptly allover this film demanded more character development Tim Robbins was wasted too thus to conclude this film has every element in it to become the best blockbuster but unfortunately failed in its execution anyhow i hope the sequel will do good,7.0,3.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444846/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2012,Really Bad,I was excited to see this movie I expected a funny action packed special effects extravaganza that would receive critical acclaim Instead I sat through a conversation between a guy in tights and a girl with a few scene that had green light picking things up It was 2 hours of my life that the producers owe me back I yawned and tried not to fall asleep or leave hoping that the end of the film would bring some excitement but was disappointed Horribly written I can t stretch that enough and mediocre directing and acting from some people that we ve come to expect more from Avoid this movie and go watch a good superhero movie that doesn t bring you into a state of depression,2.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2604860/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2013,Don't watch this movie.,Being a DC fan since I was a child it pains me to see such a beloved character be portrayed in such a bad way The acting is god awful and the stupid cheesy lines serve absolutely no benefit to the film I ll admit Blake Lively played a good Carol Ferris but Ryan Reynolds played a terrible Hal Jordan that throughout most of the movie is beyond dramatic and everything is so cartoonish Parallax was a stupid choice of a villain and the Lantern s along with the Guardians looked like shriveled up unappealing aliens This whole movie was really aimed at little kids Your kids will love it you ll probably snooze through it Do yourself a favor and don t watch this movie,2.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2836920/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,A Flawed First Attempt,Green Lantern rides that fine line between just good enough to call it decent and bad On one hand it sets up the characters really well and lays the ground work for what could be a really great movie but on the other hand the story goes off in too many different directions and doesn t allow enough time to give any of them a proper telling It feels all at once reluctant to show you too much of Oa and the Green Lantern Corps lest your average non nerd movie goer get confused but at the same time asks you to accept a bizarre non traditional villain without a lot of clear set up or focus There are a lot of things to like about Green Lantern there s some good action cool set pieces and Ryan Reynolds does a wonderful job as Hal Jordan but there are just as many if not more issues with the movie that hold it back from being good The biggest of these issues is a story that doesn t feel coherent or intuitive You can almost see each of the film s four writers fighting for their personal favorite character to have screen time in the film at the expense of a consistent story Green Lantern can essentially be summed up as wasted potential There s enough good elements in this that I hope they continue the series rather than starting over from the ground up with a reboot however if this series is going to succeed in the same genre as The Dark Knight Iron Man Spider Man 2 and The Incredibles Green Lantern 2 really needs to step up its game and take this series to its full potential Rating C,6.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449620/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,A Non-Epic Movie,I guess the moral of this movie is that some people like Sinestro and the Guardians are uppity and won t face their true feelings because of their pride And also that a lowly human like Hal Jordan has no secrets or pretensions and does not hide from his own fears All this secrecy and pride creates problems for Sinestro and the Guardians as they are unable to face their own fear but Hal Jordan is able to face his fears and save the day It sounds like an interesting plot but this movie was just too dumbed down Hal was probably the dumbest person in the movie With the exception of some of the villains he was also the most unheroic person in the movie Hal was kind of like the Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer of the Green Lantern Corps or Dumbo who flys with his ears Tragically they spent a ton of money for this ugly duckling story Special effects can make a movie more dramatic and epic but Ryan Reynolds s character is earthly and mundane The nature of his mundane character may have actually sucked all of the epic ness out of these special effects,6.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448449/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2011,"Better Than Expected, But...",GREEN LANTERN is one of those comic book superhero movies where I want so much just to be entertained and yet the movie has obvious problems that can t be ignored to the point where they become a distraction Marvel as a whole has figured out how to minimize this problem Get on screen talent so compelling to watch that the audience is less likely to start checking their watches while they check off the mandatory origin movie constructs See Tobey Maguire in SPIDER MAN and Willem Dafoe as well or Robert Downey Jr in IRON MAN for specifics DC seems to only get this right when Christian Bale is owning the screen as Bruce Wayne in BATMAN BEGINS So what s the verdict of the latest origin story to hit the screen two weeks after the really interesting X MEN FIRST CLASS How does GREEN LANTERN hold up under the origin story conceit The good news first This isn t nearly as bad as the mainstream critics are making it out to be In fact it s a LOT better than I expected There s a lot to like here and it starts with Ryan Reynolds whose performance here one could probably compare contrast w Robert Downey Jr in IRON MAN Unlike Downey s surreal smoothness from the start you spend several minutes watching Reynolds and saying No no OK that wasn t bad all right THAT S what I was waiting to see That moment is reached when Hal Jordan finally takes The Oath and Reynolds finally takes hold of the role in all its cheesy glory and from there the movie revs up and then stalls out again That s the main problem with the movie It s easily 15 20 too long because scenes that should crackle with life sputter out between big set moments Even the first time GL saves the day on Earth which itself is amazing drags so o o slowly in its setup Yes I know this is an origin story and yes I know pretty much ALL of these origin story movies have similar issues SPIDER MAN and IRON MAN aside That does not make it right for them and it s not right for this movie either Clip 30 seconds here a minute there speed up the action sequences and you d have a LOT better movie The third act insert showdown between unbeatable foe and reluctant hero finally coming to terms with who he s become here folks is truly a thing of beauty it rocks and it rocks HARD but man it s a slog to get there 3D Worth it ONCE GL s constructs do look amazing in 3D but after that the punch is lost and it s just more budget filler It s as if someone said Hey we re spending 300M on this movie isn t it great No It isn t Spend your money where it counts not on ridiculous 3D gimmickry Movie as a whole Definitely worth it once though thanks to a projector failure I got to see it twice both for free so I m probably a little more charitable than any fan paying full price So DCers go out and get your popcorn and sodas take your seat in the multiplex and remember to refrain from checking your watches during the slow grinds Oh and don t forget to stick around for the mandatory post credits sequel tease Worth it,6.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445735/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,It was disappointing.,Green Lantern is simply disappointing Just about a month ago there was the amazing mythological story for the Greek god Thor and then a couple of weeks later came the dream team cast for X men First Class a start off from the X men trilogy Yes Summer is pretty much packed with superhero movies and eye popping special effects Then comes the Green Lantern a very disappointing film The special effects are lets just say its very green I m pretty sure the crew didn t have a huge problem with mistakes mainly because they use a lot of green screen but I didn t care for any of the effects It all looked fake and sitting on a seat for an hr and 45 minutes watching different creatures wearing tight green suits it just wasn t my thing The only reason why I bother to watch this movie was because I remember reading about this lantern when I was about 7 8 years old and it was cool reading it on a comic book but on screen it was an epic fail Hal Jordon played by Ryan Reynolds fail You never really took him seriously and his facial expression in my opinion seems fit only for a comedy role I found myself cracking up whenever he delivered all those scripted wisdom and besides he already has a role as the swordsman in X men Sorry I forgot Although the jokes fall bland especially if you ve seen the beginning part of the trailer there are some action extravaganza that covers for some hits and misses Story Plot It explains itself and then it goes into details and info and then at the end turns out all that leads to nothing new or big 5 7 The only thing that kept my attention was the human interaction between Blake Lively s character and Mr Ryan Reynolds Hey he s a good actor but as a hero he comes off flat I know the lot of you will disagree but who gives sh t nuff said,5.0,4.0,14.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444715/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2011,This Lantern is Very Dim,I don t expect superhero movies to be Oscar worthy but I do expect them to be interesting enough to keep me awake until the end Put plainly Green Lantern is boring I m a big fan of action movies especially comic book movies I wasn t expecting the next Spiderman or XMen but this wasn t even on par with Ghostrider or Punisher Warzone This movie made Superman Returns look like The Godfather Why Other than being boring There were too many suspend your disbelief moments When Hal first 1st encounters the space alien Abin Sur washed up on the beach it might as well have been a human being laying there His reaction is simply Hold on there buddy Ssme when he brings his friend back with him the friend simply says Oh wow a spaceship huh And that s an alien Gee whiz And how is it that Abin Sur crashlanded just a couple of miles away from where Hal Jordan was at The ring hadn t yet chosen Hal so is it just a big coincidence that Hal was right down the street Or was the ring feeling lazy Yeah this guy will do One more question why did Abin Sur need a spaceship Can t he fly through space with his ring The female lead Blake Lively was nothing but eye candy for 13 year old adolescents In every single scene she was dolled up to the level of ridiculousness Even her flight suit was sexy In one scene she was wearing a tight fitting dress in full makeup even though she was sitting at home on her laptop at what appeared to be daybreak I was just hoping for a scene of her wearing sweatpants something to make her feel less like a prop and more like a real person I didn t mind her acting so much I was just sort of indifferent to the character The action in this film Wow How did they screw it up this bad Example the big showdown between the Lanterns and Paralax it lasted all of about 20 seconds They all shot out some big green net thing which Paralax quickly and easily broke out of and then proceeded to kill all but Sinestro in about 4 seconds It was just lame We re supposed to believe that the GL corp are these awesome badasses and all they do is toss a net and then die Later there is a scene where Hal goes to a hangar to battle Hector Hammond how the hell did he know where to go There was no lead in to that scene whatsoever Speaking of which WHY would Paralax follow Hal away from earth It came to earth to destroy it and feast on fear which it was doing a fine job of Hal shows up and flys away and it just follows him directly into the sun s gravity Huh The projections as stated by many others here are also lame The Hot Wheels track was just so dumb I rolled my eyes and shook my head in disbelief That whole scene was just embarrassing to watch i actually felt bad for the filmmakers It was as bad as the Emo Peter Parker sidewalk dance scene I could go on and on and on It was a struggle not to leave the theatre on this one that is something I have done only 2 times in all of my 35 years The main problem is that the film drags on and on and on and on,0.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2452207/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2013,Disappointing,This movie like the character Green Lantern itself has so much potential A superhero capable of creating anything he can think up has almost limitless power Superman could easily be defeated by a simple Kryptonite gun Batman a simply gun and all other superheros of the DC universe would be nothing against a hero with this kind of power Yet for some reason we see our hero Hal Jordan conjuring up swords and bricks The CGI is disappointing for such a high budget movie especially with other superhero movies coming out with breathtaking visuals The story is neat but a lackluster performance from Ryan Reynolds who thought of making this guy a superhero in the first place ruins what the story could have had On the bright side good performances by our antagonist Peter Sarsgaard and our supporting character Mark Strong provide much needed support for otherwise weak leads The ending is my second biggest problem with the movie the first being Ryan Reynolds The main character fends off the giant fear beast long enough to lure the otherwise all knowing and all powerful creature into the sun which they get to in 5 seconds flat THE END What Could the writers come up with no creative ways to finish the movie The hero finally gets himself an imagination and conjures up some super weapon that he uses to smote down the enemy maybe NO NO NO NO He lures the creature into the sun and its killed Yippy happy fun times,2.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2738030/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2011,Classic popcorn Superhero-ness,Finally a Superhero film that everyone can enjoy Very simply SFX are top notch In particular the location of space other worlds and technology of the suit Nothing too dark or risqu in the story or love interest I can actually watch this with my kids this can t be done with The Dark Knight or The Hulk too scary for the little ones I felt that Ryan Reynolds was perfect for Hal Jordan if not a touch restrained Not knowing the history of the characters or story Green Lantern seemed strait forward and easy to follow until the final act Hopefully there is a sequel as they have built in some openness to the finale that keeps non comic book fans guessing I suppose the hard core fans will be wondering how true they will stay to Green lantern lore and therefore hang in there for another ride This reminded me of the classic animated cartoons from Saturday mornings of old Innocent and action packed The bottom line Enjoyable ride from start to finish,7.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2539900/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,enjoyable but.......3D,You are looking at my review and thinking why enjoyable but Simply put I enjoyed this very predictable movie and as long as you forget your brain and enjoy the action what there is of it you ll be fine I read the Green Lantern for a few issues in the 80s and knew the green lantern back story as I am a comics fan in any case My problem is this I have to be careful of movies I watch as I have terrible eyesight registered blind and colour blind I saw this movie in 3d which so far I have been fine with and I have seen a few 3d movies about 5 so far Not too certain whether it is me but I came out of the theatre with a really bad headache in particular my eyes were aching My advice to anybody is simple be wary of this 3d Again I emphasise it may just be me I hope it is,6.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445365/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2014,Contrivances abound,This is one of those kinds of movies where events happen simply because the plot says it should For example the movie opens up with three aliens exploring a random asteroid Why Was there an energy signature Resources perhaps These characters don t need a novel of history but a few lines from inside their ship about what they re up to would have been nice Ultimately it doesn t matter because their mere presence awakens the big bad of the movie and it promptly kills them Speaking of the big bad his motives are unclear It randomly attacks Abin Sur who fans of the comics will recognize as the alien who gives Hal Jordan the GL ring How did it find him Did he just happen to be in the area Either way it wounds him and turns its attention to attacking a random planet But then it decides to attack the GL Corps base Oa Oh wait no it s going to Earth at the end of the film with no mention of how fast this thing is moving When Abin Sur crashes on Earth the authorities don t notice until directly after Hal has the ring and a ride from his friend to leave the scene Very convenient Hal gets taken to Oa for training and just happens to arrive when the largest meeting of GLs is taking place so he can get some exposition that the audience is already privy to Convenient AND redundant I could go on about the pointless characters like the obligatory love interest that is always complaining about the defects in the main character sound familiar fans may also recognize her as the future Star Sapphire one of GL s more powerful foes or the best friend that exists simply to give Hal a ride or Sinestro who crafts a weapon of great consequence or so we re told but not shown off screen or even the apparent death of Amanda Waller who was too inept to quarantine a person who clearly should have been but I will leave off with the flagrant misuse of the GL ring One scene in particular showcases my point A helicopter is about to crash on a bunch of people attending an upscale party In the much better Justice League cartoon Jon Stewart would catch the falling vehicle in a bubble and set it down In this movie Hal conjures up a race car to carry the helicopter on a racetrack At one point he loses his concentration to stop a wall from crushing some bystanders and the racetrack disappears Oddly enough the car does not which could have very easily killed even more people than just the falling chopper alone would have Why Was this the most efficient way to do things No It s there simply because the producers or directors thought it looked cool This is subjective but I m the type of person who can t just turn their brain off Questions arise in my mind when things don t make sense Anyway the acting is passable and the special effects hold up decently The editing is a little sloppy but the final product looks okay 5 10 for me just the middle of the road It doesn t do anything special but it is forgettable and a little insulting at times about talking down to the audience Watch it only if you re blessed with the ability to quiet down the analytic part of your brain for a couple of hours I unfortunately am not one of those people,5.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2958973/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2018,"Cookie-Cutter film, still enjoyable",Green Lantern is a by the numbers superhero film even then it doesn t lack imagination and an easy to follow story They try not to overcrowd the canvas by giving us tons of exposition Though there is some information to take in from the story it s just enough to keep us entertained Green Lantern is still an enjoyable flick though it is like alot of superhero movies before it it s still entertaining,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4335118/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2013,Way better than expected,All I had heard was poor things about this movie however I really did enjoy it Maybe the fact that i am a big DC Comic fan helped and someone with less knowledge wouldn t like it as much but I thought it was very good Although not entirely true to the comics I did find a bit of warmth at the end when we see Sinestro praise Hal for stopping the agent of fear I would definitely watch and buy a second green lantern movie especially seeing as the new Justice League movie is likely to be connected to this movie My only complaints would be about the beginning where they try to introduce us to Hal I think that the piloting part did a good job of capturing his lack of fear and great willpower however I think there was too much time with him just being him not having the ring I would rather have seen more of his training,9.0,3.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2849413/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2011,"Green Lantern was an OK summer Movie, but fell flat",First The GOOD The graphics in the film were some of the best I had seen The ultra villain was very very cool looking of course I saw it in 3D so that probably helped The Green Lantern was very cool looking My favorite part of the movie is when Hal Jordan visited the other planets Also the entire supporting cast is what I thought carried the film minus the leading lady The other Lanterns the lead Lantern especially of course all these other Lanterns was really a testament to the CG Now The BAD Unfortunately everything else Ryan Reynolds was Ryan Reynolds think Van Wilder So he wasn t acting he was playing himself playing The Green Lantern It was really hard to care anything about Hal Jordon at all because I felt like I never saw what Hal Jordan was supposed to be The story or plot also felt very rushed the epic battle in the end was over before it began or at least it felt that way With such an epic villain you would think the final fight would be just as epic Thank god I saw this movie in 3D The female lead had a story line that wasn t developed very well or maybe she had crappy lines to work with either way she didn t work almost as much as Ryan Reynolds didn t work Overall I was really impressed with the look of the film hugely disappointed with the main characters I thought all other supporting class kept me engaged with what the story was supposed to be So don t expect too much this is Comic book movie does NOT belong in the same realms as Batman Begins The Dark Knight Thor and the IronMans,4.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2472205/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2018,"Not the best superhero movie, worth a watch now and then! A flat villain though.",It s good not amazing The movie brings interesting visual effects and is very much a fun superhero movie adding popcorn and some coca cola the story is good and details very well on how the pilot becomes the hero Reynolds gives it his all however the movie flops a little bit with it s villain The villain is quite weak but it doesn t show any negative points about the whole movie The movie exceeds with the origins of Hal Jordan and how he becomes the Green Lantern it fails with its villain but the universe and the other Lanterners still pick up good performances to make this movie watchable It s a good one now and then however there has to be a better villain if the hero would be to return onto the big screen once again Still watchable Reynolds is still God s Perfect Idiot,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4288473/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2011,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Green Lantern,12A 105mins Action Crime Sci Fi 17th June 2011 First off I have to say my knowledge of the Green Lantern extends as far as knowing that somewhere along the line a ring a lantern lots of green and a rhyme are involved and that s about it Before the film I didn t even know our hero s name so in that respect I know not if this did the comic justice and stuck closely to the ideas and themes or it varied wildly On the plus side this means I get to learn about a whole new character from scratch and that s what I love about the movies The story follows Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds a jet fighter test pilot following in the footsteps of his father However his life is turned upside down when he finds himself face to face with an alien who gives him a ring which bestows unto him magical powers that enable him not only the ability to fly but allow anything he imagines to materialise He is not the only one with a ring though and but part of a larger collective known as the Green Lanterns who are tasked with looking after the universe and protecting it from evil Unfortunately I found the action somewhat disappointing not only in its quantity there wasn t much but also in respect to its quality The options available to our green lanterns are endless whatever you can think can become real it s a scriptwriters dream as anything is feasible as long as they could think of it and yet we are treated to an array of shields and various guns where just a bit more thought could have given us so much more CGI was a massive factor in this movie as well and for the first time in while I noticed it with the effects feeling slightly incomplete on occasion In the supporting cast there was one impressive performance with Mark Strong as Sinestro who should have had more screen time and no poor ones as the cast went about their parts with a minimum of fuss Reynolds does not quite suit the superhero role but that could just be because I cannot see past him as any character other than a comedic Van Wilder type My main gripe with the film though was the characters who were mostly underdeveloped Hal s friend picks up Hal in his car and says wow when he sees him showing off his suit That was it no other point to him at all Even stranger Hal s sibling s and nephew were in the start of the movie and then completely cut from the script never to be seen or even heard of again Also Hal s love interest Carol Blake Lively added looks but no real emotional connection with Hal questioning the inclusion of her at all As enemies go Parallax never had me worried and I never felt Hal was in real trouble The Green Lantern has no weaknesses Superman has kryptonite Spiderman has limited powers but the Green Lantern can create anything and go anywhere which led me to never be concerned and so for a rather average viewing experience I m assuming in the lifetime of the comics there were better villains that could have been used for the big screen than Hector Hammond the giant head Peter Sarsgaard and Parallax the giant smoky head I think that if this had been released before Thor or X Men First Class then it might have faired slightly better but it never captivated me in the same way those movies did It seems set slightly more towards the younger generation with a few too many plot holes for my liking and I just hope that if a sequel does come about from this who am I kidding WHEN a sequel is made more effort is put into developing the characters It seems a bit like I hate this movie but it s not a bad film remember Catwoman and Daredevil it s just I d rather save my cash and go with something else instead For further reviews feel free to check out http www fanaticalaboutfilms com,0.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448725/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Great FANTASY movie!,I was going to reply this to a person who was criticizing this movie with a number of objections all based on its implausibility but I figured my point of view would maybe help some people to make a decision whether they should support or turn their backs on a movie like Green Lantern X Men the Avengers movies Iron Man Thor Hulk etc and the new Batman movies especially the Batman movies are strongly anchored in our reality and that s a good thing it gives credibility to the story and characters taking away the burden from the spectator to suspend disbelief by showing everyday situations locations and people as the basis of the fictional world where they then unleash the presence of a superhero I love the movies mentioned above but this is not the only way these movies can be done This style appeals mostly to people who like me have gone through the totally fantastic worlds of the old superheroes movies and comic books and now crave something more mature But what about our kids Why would we stole these superheros from them just for our enjoyment I m not saying that these new superheroes movies are not appropriate for young kids I have kids and they love most of them but they as most kids I know have also mentioned like those movies in spite of the boring parts Now we re talking about kids from 6 to 11 years old so don t be to harsh on their concept of boring parts I remember how I loved Flash Gordon in the 80 s and Superman II Tron was the best because after some 30 minutes of boring real world the whole movie was set in a fantasy world just like The Dark Crystal or The Beastmaster That s what Green Lantern brings now a sense of FANTASY without sacrificing it for the sake of making it more gritty or realistic Yes of course it has real world scenes but the movie doesn t linger in them in an effort to make you feel that this is real it just so happens that the characters live in this world but the important parts are when Green Lantern appears or when his world with all the funny looking aliens make an appearance That s what other movies don t dare to do so they can appeal to older audiences The sad thing is that they forget about the young ones or the young at heart ones and this movie proves that a movie with more fantastic elements than logic can stand still make a great movie for old and young I m not saying that Green Lantern is a kids movie what I m saying is that Green Lantern is a superhero action movie that doesn t shy away from its own fantasy and that s what makes it great,9.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446905/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,"This film did not deserve the hate, but it had it's problem.",To be fair this film was entertaining enough with it s action sequences the parallax an exposition through other Green Lanterns The downside to this is the writing and CGI Ryan Reynolds did his best with the material given and that is what made this film watchable and entertaining The CGI suit is what bothers me a lot It gives the uncanny valley feel along with the green mask They could have used a real costume and let CGI do the work that the green lantern ring gives I really hope they reboot the series There s a lot of great potential in the Green Lantern comics,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5553320/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2023,Why did I like this movie so much!?,Why did I like this movie so much Maybe because I watched it umpteen years after it was first released I m not a huge fan of Reynolds but he was appropriately cast Superheroes need humility and humor or we get bored The film was more fantasy than sci fi and that works in its favor Yes there were a few plot holes that I won t go into but for me they can be explained away and did not distract me too much It also oddly jumped from one place to another several times with no explanation but also can be explained away I avoided watching this movie for so long and I m glad I did It works better today than it would have when released It s less polished and less dependant on effects than the oversaturated superhero movies that have come since,9.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9394030/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Beware his power!!!!!,All this years we have the chance to see our beloved Marvel heroes on the big screen and they were very good most of them But DC once again proves they have something great in their sleeves too First Nolan s Batman and now Green Lantern Lets get the obvious stuff out of the way the CGI is incredible Trust me it is despite what some people used to say But besides that the filmmakers did a pretty good job with the huge mythology of Green Lantern I mean in the movie we get everything we need to now at least for an origin story We learn about the Guardians our favorite Lanterns Kilowog Tomar Re Abin Sur and of course Sinestro the energy of will and the energy of fear Krona Parallax s story and Hector Hammond The casting is excellent Ryan Reynolds does a real fine job portraying Hal Jordan Green Lantern he is serious when he needs to and cocky of funny when he also needs to although he is not as good as Christian Bale was in Batman Begins Blake Lively is also good and sexy as Carol Hal s love interest and she has a good chemistry with Ryan Peter Sarsgaard is creepy and weird but hey that s what Hammond is even before his transformation begins and provides a quite memorable villain And finally Mark Strong is without question the best one in this movie He IS Sinestro I was very impressed not only by his make up but also his performance Bravo Mark The story is good but after Hal s second visit on Oa it felt a bit rush and the action scenes are longer than Thor s but shorter that I would ve expected they are intense nonetheless That s the only weak part of the movie for me it s too short and sometimes I got the feeling that the filmmakers were cutting out parts that they had to be in there So to sum it up Green Lantern is a very entertaining film go check it out despite what some people claim that it is crap it s not It has great potentials it could become a great franchise please Warner Brothers don t f k this up A sequel must be made We are waiting,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446874/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Fun time at the movies,Let me say this Green Lantern is the first movie of a series That being said they introduced everyone and got a good story with it They introduced the core the villains and his family and friends plus I think they added a little teaser as well but I may have been mistaken thought the acting was done well and the visual affects were fun I wish they would have done more fight scenes but what was done was very enjoyable Introducing of Kilowog John Stewart Tomar Re and of course Sinestro make future movies a high chance of happening I never thought Ryan Reynolds would have made a good Hal Jordan but he pulls it off very well adding his own flair to it makes the old stuff shirt Hal Jordan that I remember reading makes him a lot more likable Blake Lively doesn t add anything but she also doesn t take anything away from the performance Now Mark Strong s performance was very well the look in his eyes makes me believe that he may turn one day I can t wait to see that I would put this in my top 10 comic book movies but be prepared for a sequel,8.0,5.0,10.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2444973/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2011,It's not easy being Ryan Reynolds,The green lantern is about a dude I say this because Reynolds brings no major characteristic to his portrayal of the iconic character The Green Lantern What we get instead is Ryan Reynolds being himself but in a green suit with a poorly CGI d mask In fact one could argue that all the CGI in the movie was below par for a movie of this year with the budget it had Some of the effect specifically of Reynolds were reminiscent of the old superman series There are more bad points too A lot of the other actors don t seem to be trying the movie is to predictable and there never seems to be any major boundary that Reynold s character cant easily overcome All this aside though you will have some fun watching the movie even if it is just laughing at all the bad jokes The movie starts up well and ends with a corny nod to the inevitable squeal that is going to follow and rips off a million movies all the way through Hopefully next time Ryan Reynolds reads the script before he goes on set so his character can actually mean something in a movie industry with more super heroes than you can poke a stick at 5 10 stars,0.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2478124/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2012,Middle of the road with some plot holes,Film was mishandled from go From screenwriters directors and actors down through to special effects we have experienced individuals who have previously produced some quality work of varying degrees How they pulled off this hot mess is a mystery Poor script writing Plot holes abound How does Abin Sur a great powerful Lantern get mortally wounded in a spaceship crash Let s put aside the reality that he can fly through space like other Lanterns in a protective green ball If the ship is malfunctioning or attacked can t he create a giant green pillow to crash into or use green energy to heal Doesn t he have a suit that helps to protect from injury No signaling to the immortals or other 6k lanterns for help Hal buried Abin With what shovel or jackhammer did he dig the rocky ground And it took that long for the army police to get to the crash site Only UFO that has hit earth in a flaming ball and there was time to dig a grave and hangout sitting on the rocks next to the crash site In the span of 3 days or a week at best Hal becomes a superhero masters the power of will that is streamed from the entire universe and filters through as a power from his ring learns to fly and fight gets the girl kills the eternal monster Parallax that has been around since the time of the other immortals and could not be killed but just bound even with an army of 6k other lanterns who have thousands of years experience Reminder to self Send memo to Batman Superman Spiderman Thor Captain America Iron Man and others that they are hideous underachievers who have taken way too long to develop skills and evolve emotionally Add self to memo list Reynolds decent performance but not really noteworthy Lively bad wooden and NO chemistry In real life these two actors are supposed to be together All I keep thinking is this they must have some of the most boring sex ever Sarsgaard above average but a bit on the cheesy side I am going to attribute this to the script and directing because usually this guy is a winner Mark Strong as Sinestro scene stealer of the movie and most interesting character Wished there was more of him and his back story Ending lame and anticlimactic Final note There s a lot of dislike for the superhero outfit and complaints because it is CGI I liked it and didn t mind CGI as an alternate to costuming,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2593299/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2013,"Not as bad as many make out, but not that good either.",I think a lot of the extremely negative reactions to Green Lantern come from disappointment This film could have been so much better and pales in comparison to other much better films in the superhero genre such as Iron Man and Thor Why is it Marvel s live action movies are consistently better than DC s The film has some positive points the special effects are superlative the action sequences are fun GL s costume design is extremely cool and the performances are decent Although they try to pack a lot in I found the film reasonably engaging and didn t get bored But I didn t get thrilled either The music which is pretty crucial to the epic operatic world of superheroes was forgettable Speaking of lacking epic quality a more threatening villain should have been used Parallax looked like little more than a big cloud monster and Hector Hammond Seriously While the performances were adequate no one shone or got a chance to I also think the lead should have been cast differently I ve seen Ryan Reynolds in a few films and while he has the good looks of a leading man he lacks the charisma necessary for these sorts of roles I mean just compare him to Robert Downey Jr Ultimately though I think the big problem with Green Lantern is that the screenwriters and filmmakers were overwhelmed by the sheer weight of the Lantern mythos and tried to cram too much of it into one film The space opera elements didn t mix properly with Hal s all too human sized issues at home and the constant switching between Oa and Earth were jarring rather than building tension It would have been better I think to just have Hal obtain the ring fight Earth based evil as he learns to use it and leave all the exposition about the GL Corps and Oa for a sequel,6.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2731443/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2012,"Under-appreciated, here wanting to see a sequel",Just watched the Green Lantern movie after having failed to watch it through a few months ago Of my opinion it was fine to watch obviously not keeping you at the edge of your seat or something you can watch on a repeat more than once through the week or month Yet I felt this was the same with the first Iron man movie it was the origin story and you had to give some leeway for less action although there was fights through Green lantern anyway something Iron Man 1 lacked As for the idea they may or may not be making a second one due to bad box office reception and only just making over 100 million the story pretty much follows Iron Man the first one was not welcome completely the second one kicked ass and people loved it including myself so I would be all for having a second green lantern film too especially since they gave you a little hint at the end of the first one what might just be happening though I will give no spoilers My only begrudges are 1 Ryan Reynolds was also Deadpool but that will hardly matter as DC and Marvel are separate franchises and as long as they don t try to make a Deadpool movie at the same time as a Green Lantern Reynolds wont have to make a choice between the two 2 The CGI I know there was a lot of bad commentary of questionable looks of the costume used in this to be specific the mask worn by Hal Jordan Reynolds and I wouldn t mind seeing a little change done to it to make it more a material costume rather than a glowing suit Thanks for reading those who actually made it so far Please give it a chance when you watch it yourselves,6.0,1.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2541980/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2011,When did everyone get so serious?,I am upset but not because of this movie I am upset that every time someone goes to watch a superhero movie these days they are expecting the next Dark Knight Critics expect the next Dark Knight and a lot of movie goers like to pretend they are critics Green Lantern is not the next Dark Knight but importantly it is not trying to be It is however desperately trying to be DC s answer to Iron Man Let s face it with the exception of Batman s recent on screen exploits DC have been left floundering following the quite frankly brilliant Marvel Studios movie adaptations the incredible Hulk being the exception So does it deliver Well yes and no I will be honest with you now the movie is laden with clich s some of the dialogue is cheesy and it does kick off at fairly unreasonable pace for the uninitiated If you have read any Green Lantern comic books you will be familiar with the premise If you haven t you will feel a little left out to start with but my advice is to stick with it it gets easier to follow after the first 10 minutes There is humour that sometimes feel forced but for the most part there was an appropriate amount of laughs in the cinema Mark Strong and Blake Lively were great in their respective roles but I did feel that Ryan Reynolds could have pulled out a few more stops in some of his scenes The rest of the cast to their credit give solid performances All in all this is a movie that hit the target in so many areas but in others missed but just slightly If you want a movie that is not clich ridden with cheesy dialogue see something that isn t a superhero movie If you are prepared to switch your brain to popcorn and have fun climb aboard DC s answer to Iron Man Not quite but it did a damn good Thor To steal some now immortal words from another DC franchise Why so serious Lighten up everyone and remember how to have fun,0.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2474244/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2011,The foundation has bet set...,This movie has been getting a bad rep from so many So many people complain about too much time being spent on building characters but this is the first Green Lantern movie of this generation so let s cut them some slack One thing you gotta love is when he can t full his love interest with a simple little mask That alone scores bonus points Then once the foundation has been laid and any true comic book movie fan knows not to leave til after the credits the sequel has been set starting with the new villain on the Lantern home planet this will be huge My only disappointment would be waiting and not getting the anticipated sequel Definitely worth the money going to an evening show but buy the large popcorn instead of seeing this in 3D,9.0,2.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451079/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2011,It could have been so great,A great comic An entertaining up and coming actor A good director and a strong supportive cast this movie should have been one of the movies of the year but it just made to many mistakes Comic book movies have gone from pretty average to highly entertaining over the last 3 5 years with Nolan s Batmans The Incredible Hulk Thor Iron Man Captain America X men first class and many more Green Lantern on the other hand falls way to short There was a lot wrong with this movie and not much that went right The main issue was the CGI Now CGI has become unnecessarily used at time in movies over the last few years and it has come to the belief that if you throw in heaps of CGI and cool effects the movie will be great well look at transformers and that should answer that theory Not only is the CGI overused in this movie but it is really poor it makes the whole thing go from what is meant to be a serious comic book film and adds so much colour you think it is just a comedy without the jokes Also this is a movie with a huge budget why not spend maybe a few hundred on making Reynolds a real suit instead of digitally applying to him it makes him seem ridiculous The Villain plot in this was also a real let down The whole storyline went through so quickly that it made me thinking their must be either a really cool villain about to come or this is a bad movie turns out it was the latter Credit does go to Ryan Reynolds though for being bearable throughout the film it isn t his fault this was a terrible movie Maybe my expectations were high or maybe this was bad but this has put a very bad name to the name of Green Lantern and if they want to have another crack at it write a good plot and focus on making it good instead of what cool things you can make on a computer 3 10,3.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2512962/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2011,Edited Into Oblivion?,There is a good movie in here somewhere But it looks like the original cut was at least an hour longer after which it was trimmed down to the current length The result is a emotionless and incoherent story For example at the start of the film Hal Jordan the lead character meets four characters three adults and a kid One presumes these people are family or friends or something Who knows They never appear in the story again making their very appearance pointless At a later stage the main character meets with a prominent group of elders and talks to them as if he s met them before but he never did And the final fight is frankly appalling after the build up towards its supposed menace These are just a few of many major plot holes and crack filling during Green Lantern It s hard to get sucked into this yarn and the special effects while nice soon become so commonplace that they don t do anything for the experience,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2497990/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2011,Visually out-weighs the narrative,Green Lantern stands next to a long list of DC comic s which have been brought to the big screen over recent years Whilst being marginally enjoyable i can t help but feel the film was lacking some element in order to make it a bigger success or as compelling as other superhero movies which have been released Cocky test pilot Hal Jordan finds himself being presented with a green ring and the magical powers this ring holds bestows hims There is an elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro who are having trouble battling a giant alien Parallax As the only human Lantern he is earth s only hope The characters in the film are underdeveloped and its hard to engage any emotion with the main protagonists even that of Hal Jordan who is the central character This film may of been more successful at the hands of a different actor I m only guessing that Ryan Reynolds was meant to be portraying arrogance throughout although at times it comes off as cheesy Other characters just come and go with no sense of where they came from or where they went to when not on screen On a positive note the vibrant colours of green used are electrifying and in some ways quite entrancing Also the creativity for what Hal can form with his mind when having the ring on was interesting But i m afraid that s were my positivity ends The action at parts was satisfactory but what i really feel let the film down was the overall pacing Scenes within the narrative did not flow into one another and it seemed to cut between several scenes which did not make any sense One minute you were on earth then Oa then back to earth again with no reasoning Although visually this movie is spectacular it is lacking and has no hold against the recent superhero films which have come to the big screen It appears that the filmmakers were more interested in the visual effects that the overall narrative Although i was slightly entertained by it i feel that this movie is easily forgotten,5.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2514450/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2012,I REALLY didn't like this film,I d been wanting to watch this film for a while as I was curious about the latest superhero addition to the Avengers however I was very disappointed This film was predictable and cheesy the dialogue was making me wince in places This wouldn t have been too bad if it had some interesting characters and good acting but it didn t There was virtually no character development and I was simply not convinced by the lead actor It didn t help that his character was obnoxious and annoying not in a good way like Iron Man and the lack of character development ensured that he always was Whilst the love interest seemed nice enough she shared the element of being a 2D character The only person I sympathised with was the villain who was rather sweet The only good part about this film was that in one place the hero shows up all high and mighty with a gruff voice trying to impress his love interest but she immediately realises it is him She yells I ve known you my whole life Hal Do you think covering up your cheek bones will stop me from recognising you or something along those lines It was a brilliant moment because it is what should happen in SO many superhero films But apart from that Green Lantern was really not worth the wait,2.0,1.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2617455/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2011,A very good start to the Green Lantern story,I believe this to be a great start to the Green Lantern story Although it wasn t perfect it left hope for what the story and series will become I enjoyed the way the constructs were shown and the flying effects with the green glow that have always been GL symbols The choice of actors to play each character in the movie seemed to be spot on Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan while at first I didn t get it I realized after seeing Wolverine that he was a perfect choice and watching the movie only backed it up Mark Strong as Sinestro looks was another perfect choice He air of better than thou comes off brilliantly After seeing the movie and realizing that this seems only to be the beginning I can t tell you how excited I am to hear about the next installment and the beginning of the Sinestro Corp,7.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445379/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,It's not easy being Green,The bottom line if you really wanna know is this movie isn t great but that doesn t mean that it s bad either The movie has a lot of fun stuff in it mostly spewing from bucket loads of really cool visuals The Green Lantern headquarters on the planet Oa is awesome and I loved every second of it Toss in a couple decent action scenes and you can at the very least sit back with some popcorn and enjoy yourself for a couple hours BUT like I said this isn t a great movie First and foremost there s just way too much going on for a 2 hour movie It falls into a similar category as Spider man 3 just too much stuff to tell a coherent story But Spider man 3 was a sequel this is the first one this is the origin story this is supposed to be the easy one Here s the basic origin The Green Lantern corps is the police force that protects the galaxy from all harm It s made up of hundreds if not thousands of alien creatures who are supposed to be the best of the best and each one of them is equipped with a power ring that enables them to construct anything out of energy that might help them in a fight One of their star players is killed in a fight and it becomes his ring s duty to seek out a successor and it finds him in Hal Jordon the first human to ever be picked for the corps Hal is a test pilot for a military aeronautics company and when the ring finds him he s automatically recruited and whisked away to the planet Oa for his training This is a fun origin story and it s unique among most superheroes the origin itself has enough going for it to fill a solid movie but things get bogged down with our villains There s this evil alien named Paralax who wants to destroy all the Lanterns and he also infects a scientist who develops telepathic powers and turns evil We also get a lot of attempts a character development that do nothing but slow things down We meet Hal s nephew and see them share a tender moment this was obviously put in to show Hal s soft side a change from the brash side we re introduced to in the beginning but the scene just feels slotted in it s too short to carry and weight and thus isn t very effective If certain elements of the plot had been stripped down or removed we could ve spent more time in these character moments and gotten what we needed to out of them We get ample back story on the Lantern mythology but we really don t need it We could easily learn what we need to through Hal s eyes when he meets the other Lanterns and any detail beyond that could ve been saved for a sequel At the same time though other details are omitted Evidently our infected scientist has known Hal for most of his life and has a history with his girlfriend too we don t get any indication of this at all until they bump into each other at a party and already know each other The movie also falls victims to unnecessary superhero clich s Hal s first public appearance as the Green Lantern happens at a large outdoor party when a helicopter malfunctions and crashes into the crowd culminating in the final moments when he saves his girl Carol from the final impact of the chopper We saw the party scene in Spider man We saw the helicopter in Superman and Fantastic 4 and we saw the damsel in distress in every other superhero movie There s also a later scene where he confronts Carol on her balcony in the night very original Clich s like this really stand out like a sore thumb too because the basis of the plot is so different from the others why forcefully fit it into the mold that the others were built off of There s just too much stuff in here and it all bounces violently off one another We should ve cut down the Green Lantern corps back story to the bare minimum and removed the opening narration all together We could ve started on our doomed Lantern watch him die in an epic battle to tied us over for action and then flashed back 24 or 48 hours to meet Hal in his final hours before meeting his destiny and until the ring finds him there would ve been no need to even go into space again We could ve developed our characters naturally he could ve then spent more time in Oa meeting Hal s comrades and getting some actual training instead of the 5 minute sessions we currently get Paralax should ve been no more than an entity for the time being he could ve showed up in a sequel but for now he should be looming in the shadows at most so that Infected Hector could be properly introduced and serve as the real threat And we could ve cut out Hal s tech buddy altogether because he s just a useless character seemingly only thought up so he could utter the line you re a superhero Just in case that wouldn t have been otherwise clear to the audience In spite of the many flaws the story is now set for another instalment and theoretically with all the excess baggage out of the way a sequel should run much smoother While this movie ideally would be standing out on it s own as a great movie it could at least serve as the first chapter in what could be a great franchise over all as long as the lackluster reviews it s been receiving don t blow it s chances A fun movie none the less just nowhere near what it should ve been,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449646/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2011,Green Lantern?,I try not to judge a movie based off of other peoples opinions or just the TV trailers alone but when I went and saw the green lantern for myself I was throughly disappointed Im not a die hard green lantern fan by any means but I do know the basics of about the Green Lantern and I felt that even though this movie was almost 2 hours it was somehow rushed within that time The cast that was picked for this was perfectly fine the action was acceptable but not great and i was willing to look past the CGI look they gave Ryan but the story for this movie and how it was rushed was just unbearable not to mention they picked the lamest villain of all time with the only lines of screaming very loud Examples of this movie being rushed are when Hal fights Killowog in about 3 minutes loses and somehow makes him look dumb then on to Sinestro for another 3 minutes Sinestro and Killowog should have had more than a combined 6 10 minutes in the movie And when Hal was in the building with the air planes fighting the big headed cloud villain and was tossed something by his chick he just magically busts out of the building and on to the next scene The point is if your going to make a movie based on a super hero don t just make it because you want to finally check it off of your list of things to do make it so that the fans actually enjoy it Christopher Nowlen s batman is a very good example of what to do right in a superhero movie Make the movie long well thought out and bridge the gap on things the fans can actually nit pick on,2.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2493762/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2011,Just OK,I just couldn t take this movie seriously and that s pretty bad when 2 3 of it is supposed to be deep personal drama Everything from the villains to the jokes and costumes made it impossible to take seriously I felt like the creators were trying to make something along the lines of Batman Begins showing the struggles that result in creating the superhero however it really just didn t work at all It seemed a lot more like the Batman movies that came before Batman Begins Just ridiculous and cheesy I give it a generous 5 though it really deserves a 2 for ruining a great opportunity,5.0,3.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445892/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2011,Big noise for a big disappointment,When I decide to go see a movie at a theater I watch the trailers read some reviews and so on For this movie I ignored the scores the reviews and even the trailer hoping everyone was too harsh on the movie But in the end I draw the same conclusion it s disappointing at all levels The acting is good Ryan Reynolds fits into his character well the other characters do a good job to sustain the action but the plot is awful It s inconsistent jumping from a scene to another without any linkage some things that happen must be deduced by the audience So many things happen at the same time and many of them are unimportant They spent a lot of money on the special effects yet I wasn t so impressed by what they did It lacks imagination and vision for a superhero movie Other movies with less special effects are a lot better due to the storyline take for example Captain America The First Avenger or XMen First Class All in all I rate the movie with a 5 because of the cast and good act and for being the first Green Lantern movie I really hope they will learn from this failure and make the next not better but good enough so we can be satisfied and forget about the first,5.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2472340/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2011,Mildly disappointing,Well to be honest after you ve seen tons of trailers about the amazing VFX constructs which the power ring is supposed to make including the mini gun now a favorite anyone like me would be excited to watch the movie as soon as it hits the screens After coming out of the theater though I d say I was mildly disappointed The story familiar with Green Lantern First Flight and adapted from other comics too and the screenplay weren t satisfying or should I say weren t worth a superhero movie I mean the direction was good even though the director had worked on only James Bond movies before so this is like a whole new realm for him But for whatever the reason I personally think the writes could have come up with something better or at least a better ending fingers crossed for the sequel On the plus side amazing VFX including the constructs and the fully CGI power suits of the lanterns Some people complained about a lot of green well my reply to them would be look at the title Well choreographed fight scenes and entertaining to watch at least once If the story screenplay would have been a little more thought out I d happily given it a 9 A only for comic book fans one time entertaining movie,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454558/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,Green Lantern's light is not too bright... just bright enough.,So I saw this over the weekend and I ll say that I don t think it s as bad as most of the critics made it out to be Maybe that s the reason I enjoyed the movie All those horrible reviews got my expectations lowers or maybe it just simply wasn t as bad as most had suggested in general Not to say that the movie was perfect This is no Dark Knight or Iron Man Not even close Firstly I think the casting in this film was really good Ryan Reynolds was perfect as Hal Jordan Mark Strong was amazing as always as Sinestro and I didn t think Blake Lively was that bad as the love interest Peter Sarsgaard was also great I just thought his character Hector Hammond was a bit too weird for my tastes but I guess that was the point The story was pretty much your simple superhero origin story which is not a bad thing considering this is Green Lantern I can see future sequels going to the next level if this film does well in the box office It seemed the writers wanted to make a simple story for the first film to get the origin out of the way so it would give them more freedom on where to take the character in other films the SFX were top notch I know many people that complained about the suit being in CGI but I thought it was an interesting idea from the beginning It gave the suit an aline ish feel to it which is what the suit was supposed to be right The movie did have it s problems though The pacing of the film could be much better and score wasn t memorable like John Williams Superman score or badass like Hans Zimmer s The Dark Knight It s very forgettable I also thought the two main villains were pretty weak and not as interesting as villains like The Joker Lex Luthor Doc Ock Magneto etc Again hopefully the problems in this film will help improve the quality of the next Green Lantern film if there is one I hope so Though for Green Lantern i d have to admit it s only worth renting unless you re a crazed superhero fan such as myself We re rooting for you DC It would be nice to get more DC superheroes other then Batman or Superman,4.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446193/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,Edit this movie down to 70+ minutes and it's a fun time!,I recently re watched this movie and it isn t as bad as everyone makes out In fact if it were released today it would be considered an average MCU movie The major problems with this movie are the major problems with so many of the DC movies and MCU movies and not specific to this movie First why do movie studios feel the need to drag out the first movie with an origin story Can t this just be a two minute voiceover explaining what happened with jump right into the action of the movie The second problem with this movie is again universal The Josh Wheaton effect A K A Buffy the Vampire Slayer tv show drop a joke make a snarky comment in every dramatic situation is so annoying and takes you out of the drama of the moment that ruins most movies The third and final problem is they introduced too many villains and it s too cluttered if a story Why not remove the Hector Hammond character and simply focus on Green Lantern and the corps After all it is his movie Net net This movie could be edited down to about 70 80 minutes and be very loads of fun,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7271711/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2012,Wow! And not in a good way.,Not hard to figure out that this movie probably took a bath at the box office Poor story line and the expected stupidity from an average Joe finding out he has super powers I know its all based off of a comic book superhero but I found this movie to be too cartoony Which is very unfortunate considering they could have really knocked it out of the park And at the end they left it open for a sequel with how Synestro came to be Sorry guys I highly doubt there will be a sequel I seriously question whether this movie even made enough money to cover the cost of the actors in it Clearly anyone that watches this movie will be able to tell that the actors in it have been out of work for some time My advice to Ryan Reynolds if they do make a sequel pass on the part This part made him look like a goof,1.0,6.0,16.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2589578/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Very good movie based on a great comic book,I really liked Green Lantern the movie I have been a comic book fan for years and GL was always my favorite It kind of has the premise of Superman meets Star Wars I have been a devoted fan of the comic since the mid 70 s and I have been waiting for this movie for a long time Finally it came out and I was not disappointed Not an all time classic but definitely a fun summer movie In this day and age where everyone is a critic and their word is law I will say it is a very good movie I am tired of people telling me what to see when just about everything they tell me is really an opinion Give me facts about a movie and I will judge for myself if I should see it If you like high adventure and great fun in a movie then you will love this film If you are convinced you are the next Roger Ebert and the judge on all things movies well then listen to the critics and put a damper on everything It seems all critics and wanna be critics like to do is ruin the fun for everyone else,7.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445393/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2011,"Enjoyable, but could have been so much more!",I was looking forward to seeing Green Lantern I really do enjoy a good superhero movie and I have been a fan of the comic books for years It was a nice decent movie with good acting but there was something that I felt was missing I would have liked a little more character development and a little less eye candy from the visuals The Good Absolutely stunning visuals Honestly some of the best I have ever seen Mark Strong was awesome as Sinestro and Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond really did deliver Ryan Rennolds I believe was perfect for the part of Hal Jordan and was quite convincing and Blake Lively well she is pretty The Bad Character development was poor Very little background story and no chemistry between Hal and Carol It was as if the film makers main focus were the graphics which were pretty amazing to be honest The story was very straight forward very Hollywood with a cheesy happy ending no real plot and no twists Parallax was not at all how I thought he would be I really expected the bug creature from the comic but OK It reminded me for the villain from Fantastic Four Gallactus who consumed planets All in all a nice movie an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours but nothing more,9.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2480330/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2011,Good visuals but terrible script,I am so sad for not liking this film I love Ryan Reinolds and Martin Campbell is a very good director In fact this film s lack of quality is not so much their blame The problem with this film is the screenplay It is a paint by the numbers story filled with characters we do not care and painful clich s There are too many cheesy moments such as the scene where GL saves the helicopter from crashing by building a giant racetrack This film has a big budget but the screenplay is like an early 90 s superhero film Mark Strong is great as Sinestro though,0.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2478499/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2012,It's not as bad as they say it is,I thought that it was decent I think that people s expectations were too high and maybe the reason I liked it was that I expected it to really suck and it didn t Having said that there were some poor choices made The movie could definitely have been cut better The prologue for instance it isn t necessary And why did they make the one guy get all deformed and ugly from the yellow energy That whole side story felt a little out of place to me I didn t know or care enough about that character for his story to interest me Ryan Reynolds did a fine job as the Green Lantern It s actually one of his better performances I d say Blake Lively was alright A little bland perhaps but it doesn t take away from the movie in my opinion Mark Strong did a good job as always Tim Robbins gave a rather boring performance I honestly don t know if he phoned this one in or if he just can t act anymore Not that he was ever a great actor Anyway as long as don t expect it to blow your mind you should enjoy this movie,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2708612/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2011,the surprise of the summer,when the first trailer of this movie appeared I thought that this was going to be by far the worst movie of the year I don t like very much ryan reynolds in a leading role and the special effects looked very poor at some point very close to ridiculous The first 20 minutes of the movie got me into the story I was expecting nothing else than bad frankly but this was a huge surprise Characters are well developed I liked so much when Blake Lively tells Green Lantern to take off the mask but there is a symbolism there since she talks about the mask of fear there are very deep concepts in this movie peter saarsgard is simply phenomenal as a villain and basically all the actors are amazing at their roles in the end it was worth it Yes the special effects are poor sometimes and for that I would give a 4 but then acting script and pace are great so that makes a 10 final score 8,7.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2474923/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2011,"Green Lantern, a repetitive superhero movie with same motives",Critics said that Green Lantern is not Batman nor Spider man from popularity point of view well I may add it won t also be as popular from a motion picture point of view as well Many will argue that Green Lantern is not as popular comic hero Well Ironman is as well not as popular as many other Marvel Comic heroes but it s movie did great was performed beautifully so in this case Green Lantern was a repetitive superhero flick that didn t add as much except for special effects action sequences that were identical in other movies Ryan Reynolds tried the best to introduce a new superhero flick it could have been better script was written in a repetitive way and was used in a lot of other superhero flicks from a normal guy becoming a superhero to battling the bad guys to everyone is happy a sneak peak for a part 2 well been there seen that I won t recommend for fans of superhero fans as it won t add new just watch it for the sake of curiosity,6.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2498765/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2017,Feels like animated green lantern movie.,Green Lantern 2011 was an Origin story of most popular lantern Hal Jordan The movie delved into origin of Hal which was good but not necessarily great But it was necessary to make the point the movie wanted to make by letting Hal learn to overcome his fear so in big picture the time needed to set the character was well spent Aside from that the visuals were good but not best of the time Although most of the visually superior seen took place in far galaxy so it was so both amazing experience to see different galaxys aliens but at the same time a bit underwhelming because of lack of good effects the later movie like Guardians of the Galaxy was able to make The villain was not the best portrayed parallax but it s a comic book movie and most of the movies that came afterwards had similar problem and were unaffected Actor Ryan Reynolds did perfect Hal Jordan He was funny careless and human in expressing Rest of the cast did good job Story was good for the origin movie I think they did try to make a few bold experiments by making parallax as the villain and making suit complete CGI which I think worked for the movie If not for the harsh reviews the movie got it would have been start of new universe As for me I was happy to see first live action movie not based on Superman or Batman,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3639591/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,too long on developing character,The movie wasn t terrible It wasn t great It was a nice way to blow 40 bucks to spend time with the family Well when I put it that way I feel I lost out 30 bucks I should have waited for the DVD I mean it wasn t bad It just wasn t great Hal Jordan Green Lantern has lots of issues in his Hal Jordan life He has a doting nephew that we see just once a family still recovering from a tragedy in the 1990 s which gives the film an excuse to introduce us to his brothers but um just once Peter Sarsgaard brother in law to Jake Gylenhall was pretty good He was worth the 10 bucks In the end though it was 90 character development and by the time they got to the fight scenes which obviously didn t take that long If they had focused on his ring and use of his willpower it would have been better Instead we get to psychoanalyze Hal Jordan for most of the movie So it was okay Nothing great,5.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447239/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,Just bad,I had thought this was filmed before Iron Man and the modern era of Comic Book movies Sadly this was after it It s as if they went out of their way to ignore everything that made Iron Man successful This was basically cheesy unimaginative predicable and worse boring It matched the old difference between Marvel and DC and why Marvel passed up DC Marvel wrote deep comics that talked up to their audience DC wrote corny stuff that worked for the younger set but lacked depth for the older crowd Why waste 200 million dollars putting together a film only to ruin it with a poor script It was a dead end at the box office with the franchise starting and ending with this movie It s a shame There were a lot of possibilities I give it a 4 because well it s Green Lantern And of course there are going to be good special effects It s just a shame there wasn t more,4.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4937593/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Why I Walked Out After 40 Minutes,I really wanted to like this movie It just in my opinion was awfully done The 3d effects were awful Maybe if I d seen it in 2d I would ve stayed in my seat longer but in reading one review it said the opening sequence about the beginning of the universe was worth admission alone I don t think so Anyway throughout the screen was dark at many times I wondered What am I wearing these glasses for there doesn t seem to be 3d nothing was coming out of the window and there wasn t much depth Ryan Reynolds doesn t play the f up too well Plus how can he have no fear and be a test pilot for a huge company while at the same time being so irresponsible And overall he looked weird in this movie He was off his game Also as I m not big on GL s backstory I thought Am I going to have to remember all of this different space stuff or can I dismiss it This might seem stupid but I thought this movie would be more grounded I thought the space stuff would just set up GL s powers and then we d be on earth for most of the time It so happens that the only GL stories I ve read are like that older stuff Now after I left maybe that was the case maybe And maybe that could have only given us just another superhero movie with different power sets but I think audiences would ve liked it Too much CGI And it didn t feel like good CGI Even the beginning on that lost planet All of those characters looked goofy too cartoony The point of no return was when GL was walking around in his uniform for the first time on that CGI planet He didn t even look human His whole body looked CGI And he was so buff he almost looked like a lady with breasts and a big butt Even when it wasn t necessary there was CGI in this movie When GL first touched the lantern and his face and eyes got all wonky Goofy not cool Character design First let me say that I love the GL uniform except for the nose bit It would ve looked better had the people in them looked better but they didn t The bird fish guy was just insanely goofy looking And the guardians looked like wizened old smurfs And Sinestro He looks like the devil his name s Sinestro and we re supposed to believe he s a good guy Although that guy was a great actor great voice Overall I think these characters and the CGI sets worked against this movie It was hard to take anything seriously Too much exposition Why didn t they interest us in the characters first Like Hal and Carol The space stuff should ve been toned down and been part of a larger arc maybe culminating in the third film while GL dealt with more earth based problems Poorly written even the human drama was poorly done in this movie The family history of the Jordans was overwrought as was the family dynamic at the birthday party Poorly executed it seems like whenever this movie should ve taken a right direction wise it took a left At that scene on the CGI planet O I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to leave and he said yes Outside I asked him at what point did he first think of leaving Right away he said I couldn t help but agree And I usually like space stuff like Trek As a comic book nut I m depressed Even if Captain America does well GL s bombing will affect the future of comic book movies There goes ever seeing some of the B list characters in the DCU Or maybe not Hopefully all the guys and gals who make movies and write about movies will realize audiences aren t sick of comic book movies we re sick of bad comic book movies For any disappointed GL fans you might feel the way I did after seeing X3 But I never guessed then that in just a few years later we d have X Men First Class So don t despair you never know what can happen Maybe GL will do overseas and there will be a sequel and it will be a great great movie,0.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446803/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,Good fun had by all,I went to see this film because the 3d projector broke down on the film we were going to see and this was picked because a it started at the right time b it was 3d and c it was a superhero film So I had no expectations and didn t know about reviews so no pre conceptions I go to the cinema to relax and be entertained This film did just that Decent performances all round although the Green Lantern mask was a bit much so bijou good special fx and it managed to avoid that 15 minute period where you think this is a bit slow As it drew to a close I found myself thinking I really enjoyed this It might not be the greatest film ever made but I thought it good fun and it kept me entertained and surely that is the purpose of a film like this I don t know why folks seem to expect a film with the depth of a Shakespeare or Hemmingway classic it comes from a comic for goodness sake and it does what its source did entertained,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448463/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2019,Behold my power... Green Lantern's Light!,Honestly this film is far better than most give it credit for It came out in 2011 I never watched it just because everyone told me it was terrible and not to waste my time I recently discovered that it s on Hulu and I had a little time to waste so I gave it a shot I couldn t be happier that I finally did The effects are eye popping which is exactly the way this character should be The stunning visuals and detailing in the costumes pay homage to Jim Lee s artwork beautifully and the vibe of the film has an aura of whimsy about it Ryan Reynolds was the perfect actor to cast for the role He has had a lot of experience playing superheroes by now most notably the titular character of the Deadpool franchise As always he brought some much needed brevity to the otherwise dismal story Supporting actors were all good as well particularly Tiaka Watiti s performance Even cast into small roles he still blows it out of the water The story is the only weak point in the film It occasionally seems to lack focus and can feel disjointed at times I am a huge DC Marvel fanboy and I ve always been the kind of person who could enjoy a superhero film simply for what it was To my surprise after all these years this was a film that was a joy to watch It gave a great adaptation of the classic hero and I d recommend it to any fan of the genre if you can overlook an occasionally sloppy plot,8.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5305157/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2011,Finally saw what all the crying critics were crying about.,Looks cool Sounds cool The script is BEYOND weak Moments seem forced Reynolds is a perfect Hal Jordan however I blame the director producers for the mess they made here What purpose did Brainiac serve NONE A wasted villain Jordan s training in Oa was shorter than the stack of stars people gave the movie The movie is redeemed at the very end in the final boss battle In that scene I was finally roused by the character the stakes were established the action was terrific I don t want to spoil it but believe me the last 5 minutes are the best moments in the film IMO For 2 if that happens the direction and script have got to be sharper than this was With a legion of nerds at the internet s fingertips there is no excuse for half assed money grabs,4.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2533994/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,90 minutes is too long to wait for the good stuff!,First I will point out that I am a big comic book fan especially Green Lantern and JLA I really really wanted to love this movie My own expectations may have shaded my viewing of the film The movie was true to a lot of the things fans loved about GL in the comic world Ryan Reynolds was a little miscast but he does a good job with what he has And Mark Strong is great as Sinestro I would actually go watch him play Sinestro in a stand alone title the way he plays the character The scenes with the GL Corps were great There was better chemistry with the Corps CGI characters exclusively and Hal Jordan than the actual human actors The GL movie had the same problem a lot of comics have they hold back the action too long and then the final conflict cannot possibly live up to all of the build up I cannot even say the build up to the final battle was worth watching Nor the final battle I really hope they make GL 2 although I fear that the first movie may do enough damage to prevent the creation of any franchise The potential plot points look good but it will be hard to get mainstream audiences back after the tragedy that is the first movie Finally and saddest of all I most likely will not bring my 8 year old nephew to this movie because the lack of action is so severe He loves comics and can be patient to wait for a great final battle but even that is not here My best advice go out and buy some GL comics even some Justice League of America and read those for an hour and a half,4.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446594/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2012,The worst superhero movie ever made?,I wanted to like this movie but the simple fact is this movie is not good I love Ryan Reynolds i like Blake lively Tim Robbins Hated the script I could have written a better script in my sleep The script is clunky the bad guys are one dimensional The simple fact that they make choices and we have no idea why Plus the fact the suit and mask look unrealistic the story is dumb This movie is like a bad episode of barney and friends its just not good they could have hired a 5 year old to write the script and I m sure we would have had more fun watching it There is also a scene at the end of the movie when the credits roll that makes no sense there s no sign in the movie at all that this person would do what he does in the scene its the dumbest movie ever made,1.0,4.0,12.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2599066/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2011,Could Have Easily Been A 10,Let me start by saying that I have never been the biggest DC fan but I always thought the GL and all things related was one of the coolest characters in the DC Universe Why do I think that He had one of the coolest Rogue s Galleries in DC If anyone has seen other reviews I ve written I stress that one of the most important elements in a good superhero movie is a strong villain This movie unfortunately suffered from having 2 very weak villains In the comics Parallax was one of the coolest villains ever and Hector Hammond though not as awesome was still pretty interesting to read Mistake one in this movie was not giving a proper back story to Hector Hammond You always kind of get the feeling that he s something of a creep and then when he gain his powers he s suddenly a super villain Where s his motivation I do like how they explained Parallax coming into being and you don t really need that much of a motive for a being of pure evil fear But if that is your villain there needs to be some interesting dialogue or interactions with the villain before the climactic fight The character development in these villains was overall pretty weak and therefore they come off as pretty uninteresting I have no reason to want to hate these guys This movie also suffered from some real awkward pacing at points such as when Hal is first whisked away to Abin Sur or when GL just busts through the wall of the lab for his first fight with Hector This and other moments I think can be blamed on the directing A lot of people have knocked on the action in this movie I thought there was just the right amount and it was pretty well done However during the final fight where Hal recites the oath was just cheesy I m sorry there s just no other way to say it The Lantern oath is SO cool and the context they used it in at the end just made it come off as cheesy There were plenty of positives in this movie Ryan Reynolds did an awesome job as Hal and Mark Strong almost stole the show with his short screen time as Sinestro Speaking of Sinestro I m excited for the sequel It s a pretty safe bet that Sinestro will be the villain and because this movie did such a good job fleshing out Sinestro s character he will make an amazing bad guy in a sequel The effects were good overall once I got used to the CGI suits and I was pretty impressed with how creative the ring constructs were All in all this was an entertaining movie It just could have been SO much more if they had given more to the bad guys 6 10,6.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450464/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,Interesting but maybe not pleasing,all Superhero movie conventions aside If you know how films are made you will not be at all blown away by the parts of this film that aren t computer generated imagery anyone with a film major and a few million bucks to spare should be able to put the slap happy scenes together without any real difficulty The computer generated imagery is quite aesthetically pleasing Panning has never been more enjoyable The score seemed very generic like it was copy pasted from inception thats a joke Casting Ryan Reynolds played this part in Star Trek already The girl was hot as usual and the mad scientist was a mad scientist The end Na don t worry there is more to it than that Overall if you are a critic and a cynic like my self then this film will have you entertained until the credits end If you are not a film buff then you should love it until the lights come on,7.0,2.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447311/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2012,Extended version an improvement but still no masterpiece.,Just saw the extended version of GREEN LANTERN It didn t make it a masterpiece but it made it a much better film What was added A whole section at the beginning that makes you care about the three lead characters because you see them when they were kids In turn this helps you understand the rivalry between Hal and Hector as adults There is also a much better relationship exposition with Hal Jordan s father before he dies Seeing so much more of the father s horrific death explains so much better why Hal Jordan feels he isn t as fearless as he needs to be to become the Green Lantern he s expected to be Other scenes benefit from slightly longer takes especially the GL Corps sections and Hal s training scene Cutting these scenes to make the film a more cinema friendly length the distributors buggered up the film The lesson Even in fantasy you have to CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS before you get to the special effects I think I would have quite happily sat through 123 minutes rather than 114 if the film had been allowed to breathe a little Try the extended version You might like it,7.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2640227/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2011,It wasn't that good,This movie was really boring for me seems like it didn t have enough action in it I m not gonna tell exactly what happened in the movie because I don t want to spoil it but if you watch the cartoon movie made by I think WB you will actually know whats gonna happen its almost scene for scene with one difference the cartoon actually shows more and is more developed I m a big comic book fan but this movie just didn t do it for me maybe it was because it was in 3D and within the first hour I was bored and after that I was just counting the minutes till it was over but one thing that would help the movie and I m warning you do not watch the cartoon movie before going to see this if you want to watch it do it after the live action movie I believe that s mostly why I didn t like it because I had recently watched the cartoon movie sorry if this offended you and you thought the movie was the best of the year,5.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454873/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2011,The Light is Always Greener on the Other Side,Green Lantern is bad claims The New York Times and so I ve read the reviews I then bought my ticket to which the cheerful man I bought it from said enjoy your film As you can see her I m getting enough mixed signals to scramble a radar This film is going to come down to what I think The film begins it s green theme surrounds the Warner bros logo Nice touch I know but now onto the film The opening presents a beautifully landscaped universe filled with planets of all different colours and sizes However this is not as breath taking as lets say when you first saw the beautiful effects conveyed when you first see Star Wars It s actually quite generic for today s standards The narrator then speaks explaining a clearly elaborate plot built up over years of comic book mythology and in only five minutes In away five minutes is enough for how tedious it actually is Just think back to that one teacher back in school with that monotone voice that so subtly tightens your eyelids and assaults your ears with worthless knowledge That is exactly how I felt Luckily for me I knew a bit about the Green Lantern mythology enough so this could be bypassed However be warned do some research or be punished with a monotonous Green Lantern 101 Back down to earth we are introduced to Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds a stereotypical underachiever accentuated by the fact that he is late for work as a test pilot To be fair on Lantern I actually enjoyed a well done set piece involving Hal and wing woman Carol Blake Lively as he proceeds to destroy two costly military aircrafts With that fun over the film continues in its starting fashion Hal becomes a Green Lantern goes to Oa where fellow Lantern Sinestro explains there is no way Hal can beat the movies super antagonist Parallax Faced with adversity and a ton of budget crunching special effects Hal saves the day from Parallax and his human sidekick Dr Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard Oh and he also wins the girl in an exasperatingly spontaneous amount of time Now picture that in the space of two hours I was bored to say the least It checked off all the conventions of a normal comic book movie and failed to even attempt to go the extra mile That s why everything about Lantern is downright derivative It has solely wasted an impressive budget on mixing the fundamental ingredients of a comic book movie In this summer I don t believe Lantern can afford to do that Going up against the likes of Thor X Men First Class and soon Captain America The First Avenger Lantern has come dead last trust me I ve seen the first two Albeit I d like to say if you re looking for cinematography filled with miraculous special effects go see this film but frankly I can t because if you wanted to see that you should go see any other superhero flick and get even more In comparison and when stood alone Lantern falls well beneath standards Trust me when I say I think I should have listened to the New York Times rather than the cheerful man who sold me my ticket,4.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2452873/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,Best superhero movie yet,I went to this film with a friend who met me at the theater You do know he warned me when he got there that this movie has been savaged by the critics Never being one to be guided by other peoples opinions I said So what And in we went Two hours later my friend was raving on the way out Hey that was a really GOOD movie I hope there s going to be a sequel So do I This was the kind of eye popping thrill ride that superhero films are supposed to be but seldom are Never has 3D CGI been so perfectly appropriate I had never seen any of the principal actors in anything else before so I had no preconceptions about any of them All were exactly right for their roles with an extra tip of the hat to Mark Strong s Sinestro Origin stories always have to cram a lot into a single film and this one is no exception Yet it does the job far better than most and rarely lags in spite of all the explaining it has to do Having super powers is supposed to be fun and exciting not dreary and angst ridden and the movie captures that fun and excitement perfectly without skimping on the inevitable dangers and self discovery along the way I m old enough to have read the Green Lantern 1 comic book and boy do I wish I still had it and I can say that this is as faithful a version of Hal Jordan s beginnings as Green Lantern as we re ever likely to see The childish feeding frenzy of nay saying over this movie has been appalling both from those who originate it and those who blindly follow it Green Lantern is one of the best perhaps THE best sci fi fantasy adventure superhero films of the past decade I ll be buying the DVD when it s released and eagerly awaiting Green Lantern II,9.0,1.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448108/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2011,Would receive higher ratings if labeled MARVEL.,I entered this movie with very low expectations since most reviews bashed it calling it noisy predictable and pointless Wouldn t have happened if it were labeled MARVEL comics It offers a lighter story some warm humor and visible CGI effects The action scenes aren t dragged at all and I found a nice balance between character development story and special effects But it s labeled DC and after Christopher Nolan set higher standards with his outstanding Batman films critics and possibly even hardcore fans tend to be overly critical of any other projects This is a movie about a guy who basically receives a magic ring that gives him the power of flight and the ability to create any object of his desire through will power so enjoy it for what it is a decent entertaining flick that would have fitted the Marvel studios universe very well with the Green Lantern eventually joining the Avengers 7 10,7.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2503786/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2011,Fairly Well Done,Okay first of all I ve never even heard of Green Lantern before this movie so I may not have a good comparison of what it should be I will give my opinion on the movie however Not the best movie in the world but it isn t the worst either thought that Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively were cute together and like any other super hero film it s going to be predictable To be honest not a lot of action happened and it wasn t all that thrilling If that s what you wanted your better off will some other super hero That being said the plot wasn t bad good graphics and I would watch it again Blake Lively is better off in Gossip Girl I don t think she can pass as someone being overly smart like her character Carol is I like her and all but I think she could have put more effort into the role Ryan Reynolds seemed to enjoy the film I sort of get that vibe from all of his work and I think he proved himself capbable of being a Green Lantern,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2453465/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2012,America rocks! Humans are the best!,The only thing you need to know when approaching this film is that the filmmakers can t differentiate willpower from arrogance This is the base lesson and ultimate failure of the story Instead of being about learning to believe in yourself we are given a tale of already thinking you are the best person ever and learning to work the hardware There are other criticisms to be made The dinner party helicopter crash sums up how desperate the producers were to cash in on the 3D craze And people seem to rebound from these impossible events within the hour But worst of all is how they ve taken the core failing of the Abrams Star Trek Kirk the jerk and amplified it to insulting levels Not only does Hal save the universe he does it alone with the rest of the Corps out of commission All of their lifelong training and experience gets swept aside to prop up one human trainee as The One And the whole Sinestro yellow ring subplot gets dumped as well Will he put on the evil yellow ring to help defeat the enemy No he ll wait until after the movie is over,2.0,1.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2559819/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,CGI cheese fest,It may not be quite as bas as many say but it s still terrible The writing is really what drags this down You can sense an incoming awful cringe line from a mile away and they just don t stop Reynolds does what he can but his charm only goes so far The story is somehow hard to follow but at the same time super cliche You have 2 bad guys The little baddy is pretty much pointless and does nothing and the big baddy is of course a big planet devouring floating head blob with tentacles in space So obviously this movie relies heavily on CGI The problem is it s bad and overbearing and poorly integrated Some directors mesh CGI well not the case here There are so many cuts and angles that take you out of the moment and make you think about how it was shot to hide things Totally immersion breaking It honestly should have just been a cartoon It s too bad this was such a stinker because the foreshadowing of a sequel at the end would have been great,4.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6899027/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2023,"Even as a Green Lantern fan, I hated this film.",Chief Complaints The CGI is absolutely horrendous beyond belief You can see Ryan Reynold s tendons in his suit Michael Clarke Duncan is in this movie and he clearly deserves to be in a better Green Lantern film Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi are afraid to admit it It s extremely ugly Heath Ledger and Paul Walker could both beat up Deadpool out of this dimension if they were alive to see it It spawned a terrible Six Flags rollercoaster that gave its passengers massive groin pain The movie Cross is more enjoyable to sit through despite being a poor man s version of Green Lantern in which the hero has a magical cross instead of powerful rings Look I have previously stated that I love Green Lantern and that I consider him as an underappreciated superhero in DC Comics but when your film that s supposed to be the origins of your intergalactic superhero is constantly shot in the dark and that the actor who played him would ruthlessly mock his appearance in 2 superior Marvel movies you know you ve got the wrong one Go read the comics or watch the TV show and its DVD specials instead because I ve read Green Lantern fanfiction that is much superior in its writing than this ugly mess Still it s way better than Catwoman 2004,3.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8801955/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2013,Entertaining - If you don't take it too seriously.,I ve always been a fan of the comic book style movies Not because they offer depth and substance but because they allow me to escape into a completely ridiculous dimension of fantasy None of them should be taken seriously With that said I really don t understand why so many people slated this movie It was shallow corny and unbelievable sure but it was also entertaining full of action drenched in fantastic CGI and fairly well acted for the most part Even the plot wasn t so terrible Ignore the teen scoring here on IMDb for this title Or to put it another way Vampire Diaries 8 Green Lantern 5 Something is definitely wrong with the voting system here,7.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2864774/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,What A Let Down!,Green Lantern is a movie that is a big let down once you have seen the trailer it looks brilliant but thats where the best bits end Green Lantern is the comic book adaptation which follows Hal Jordan a test pilot who is given amazing powers The story sounds like its going to be a great interesting movie but let me tell you is is not The acting is not great either Ryan Reynolds is only OK as the superhero nobody lights up the screen The run time is too short and the complected story is packed into the opening 2 minuets which instanty looses you and the rest of the movie is the same Whats more is that you really really don t care about the superhero the story dose not devolp any characters and by the end The Green Lanterns big fight is a let down you don t care wither he lives or dies i would prefer him to have some time to save more people in the city he lives in This movie is not a good one if you have not read any of the comics i would stay clear at least you would have a little insight which might make the movie less of a drag For me Thor was a masterpiece compared this The Green Lantern is as close to what you could call a waste of your time don t even bother to view this at the cinemas i didn t get the chance to watch it in 3D but from what i have read it isn t any better i missed the extra scene which means there could be a sequel but i would not watch it The story is not strong the acting is poor and the villain is pointless i thought this could be a brilliant adventure how wrong was i The main selling point of this is the amazing effects they are great plus they are the only thing really from stopping me giving this movie a 2 or 3 stars Green Lantern dose have its funny bits but by the end you are soo glad the movie is other Believe the bad reviews that you read they are true children under 10 will love this but if you are a teenager or an adult this should be a must miss its pure mindless entertainment which they think a few spiecal effects would sell this movie and with the likes of The Dark Knight and Spiderman things have changed in the superhero world The Green Lantern is one movie to avoid it is a real disappointment the trailer thinks it could be something amazing it just is not,5.0,0.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447852/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,Green Lantern is not as awful as the critics say,But don t expect it to be a hallmark achievement either The film had a lot of potential given its all star director and cast as well it s 200 million dollar budget but it appears Warner Bros was so concerned with people not taking the goofy looking aliens seriously they cut out all of the really interesting moments with the Corps explained the entire background of the Green Lanterns in stilted exposition heavy monologues and filled the rest of the film with cringe inducing jokes A big problem with the script is the constant shifts between slapstick humor and violence humans get thrown through brickwalls without much harm coming to them to Schindler s List style drama Whole planets are destroyed without so much as a blink of an eye The acting while very good in parts performances that really shone were those from Peter Sarsgaard Ryan Reynolds and Mark Strong really isn t given room to breathe by the script Hal spends the majority of the film either being an arrogant ass or whiny bitch Carol Ferris played by Blake Lively has some very cheesy dialogue that is delivered with no emotion Hector Hammond is given a heart wrenching backstory and then the next minute turned into a power hungry stalking creeper who is constantly screaming as if he is receiving an enema and the other high profile actors Tim Robbins Angela Bassett Geoffry Rush and Michael Clark Duncan are reduced to glorified cameos with no substance or import However the single worst aspect of this movie is its villain Parallax Its origin is clich its lines laughable and its mode of destroying the universe stupefying one planet consuming cloud in a comic book movie wasn t enough It lacks the presence and gravitas of other graphic novel villains this summer and doesn t appear even remotely threatening The only true saving grace of this movie are the effects which are some of the best I ve ever seen Clearly the budget didn t go to waste in the flash department too bad is was sorely lacking in the script The concept and delivery of the energy created suit and its constructs are stunning as is the integration of Ryan Reynolds and Mark Strong into the completely CGI environments on Oa No off looking bobbing heads here Every alien seen on screen is surprisingly creative and realistic which is amazing given how many sci fi films like this there have been over the years and the organic feel of Oa is a nice deviation to the typical metallic and cold look most outer space epics seem to have All in all I was expecting much much more from Campbell Co However I knew that having four screenwriters on this movie was a very big mistake especially since some of them worked on the holy grail of comic book adaption fails Smallville and in the end even the pitch perfect performances and some of the best CGI in movie history couldn t save this train wreck of a film,6.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445093/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2011,Green Lantern doesn't have enough greatness to pull in the green,This movie has placed itself among the bottom ranking comic book movies that have plagued our society The movie is better than marvels worst movie FF FF2 GR DD etc but Green Lantern has put WB studios and DC movies further behind Marvel recent films and next years The Dark Knight Rises and the new Superman have to tread softly to save the dying DC brand Both DC brand films Green Lantern and Jonah Hex fell way below the audiences and critics liking and put WB studios in a bad position for establishing future comic book films The thing that saves this movie from being the worst comic book movie is Ryan Reynolds He grasps the viewer s attention when the plot and CGI is failing all around him He also has a sort of flare when he is on screen and makes the character he is representing feel life like I for one thought that he would be the down fall of this franchise but he seems to take handle of this iconic role He is not your typical superhero choose such as Robert Downy Jr was with Iron man but owns that role and makes Hal Jordan Green Lantern story interesting Other than Ryan Reynolds strong performance there is Mark Strong who is amazing and nails the role of Sinestro He does a decent job of giving the audience another character to enjoy but he was not explored enough to get a feel of who he really is and becomes Some of the other cast members are passable to watch at times but roles serve no purpose to the plot and are there just to advance the movie along These members include Blake Lively who gives a wooden performance and brings nothing notable to the film as the same with Peter Sarsgaard who looks like a new version of the elephant man You never really got to know their character better to really care for their role Reynolds and Strong keep the film afloat any time they are on screen but the movie takes a downward turn when they are not present I just wasn t blown away by the whole Green Lantern universe that was set up and never exposed much throughout the film There were spare cool Green Lantern tricks here and there but nothing captivating The film lacks togetherness and falls flat during the course of the film The Paralax evil creature of smoke looked very unbelievable and fake at times He seemed too big of a villain to be placed in the first movie and look really silly and took away a lot of interest from the movie In addition to that the action never seems to fit in quite right with the fight scenes The director seems to just throw them together at times just to look cool but never quite accomplished its task The CGI was poorly done in my opinion and looked like something that was created back when CGI technology was first introduced to cinema Had a strong cartoonish look at times and felt like I was watching an animation and real life movie mash up To sum it all up I just didn t feel the whole cosmic universe that the movie was trying to present The film maker never explored Oa and the lantern core enough to get us really attached to the film The earth scenes could have been cut from the movie to shed more light on the cosmic elements that should have been understood Thor had the same cosmic establishment like this film but sold it far beyond this movies approach This movie feels like an hour and 30 minutes of foreplay and 15 minutes of action I really can see what the director was going for but he was overshadowed by a horrible script that poisoned any attempt of this film actually being good The movie felt down played by a terminal case of origin fever telling too much and showing to enough You can go ahead and add this to list of this summer failures and all time box office flops,0.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2457119/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,Another basic super hero flick,I did enjoy Green Lantern BUT it does has some very poor points to it The good stuff Ryan Reynolds plays the cocky and arrogant Hal Jordan well much to the fact that in my opinion it suits him as a person The world of the Lanterns if well done and looks nice The special effects are pretty good and will keep you entertained and the story is okay if very predictable Tha bad stuff The story is predictable and most of it has been done before One thing that annoyed me is that after a ten man assault on the fear failed the lanterns seemed to give up and turn to the power of fear instead of using every lantern to fight the fear The cocky arrogant hero has been done before All in all its a good film but don t go in with your hopes too high Worth a watch but the summer has a lot more to offer,5.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2450041/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2011,"I hate you, Martin Campbell.",I ve read some reviews before watching the film More of them are disappointing and they focus in the bad CGI lack of action and epic even in Reynold s bad acting Always the same negative points I thought to myself and how many times after reading some bad reviews I have found out that the film was actually amazing This is not the case trust me Firstly I love the character Green Lantern is my favorite superhero matched with Superman Secondly I love the complex story the characters and its wonderful and plenty imaginative setting But the film fails in everything As I ve said before another reviewers focus their angry in details a lot of them but the problem is bigger is an overall problem The plot is horrible how is it possible to tell such a big and epic adventure in this poorly way I can t believe it The CGIs aren t good but they are probably the best of the film The dialogs are amazingly stupid even for this kind of film The conversations between Hal and Carol are worse for example than the ones of Annakin and Padme in Chapter II or even worse than the romantic ones of Spidey and Mary Jone in Spiderman The acting doesn t make the cut too And here comes the worst part the directing Stupid direction of actors the worst sense of rhythm that I have never seen in a blockbuster like this Not epic not emotion not laughs not cries not screams not surprise If it wasn t Green Lantern and if it was a new for movie created character I would give to this movie a worse note 4 out of 10 and thanks Go to watch it with friends cause it s the only way to enjoy somehow with this piece of trash,4.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2469076/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2011,disappointed,Very disappointed with the film wasted my time and don t bother watching it in 3D There were some decent action scenes hence my score of 2 Other than that the film is a loser Story very very light unconvincing The biggest disappointment is when GL reveals him self at the party scene to save the crowd and his lovely girlfriend The whole thing looks unbelievably s t Crowds do not react as if someone suddenly can fly and create things with his ring When GL visits Carol at her office she doesn t look surprised and treat him as if something very very normal To conclude don t waste your money watching the movie,2.0,3.0,8.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451043/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2011,The Colour Of Money,You know those people who spend an entire film asking you in a hoarse stage whisper who all the people are and what they re doing now Well this is just the film for those people because the entire plot is explained in loving detail by a series of alien voiceovers convenient side stories and an overexcited score that frantically signals every emotion required of the audience I don t know why more films don t do this it makes it so much easier to watch the film instead of all that tedious concentrating and analyzing you can just relax and enjoy the show To be honest I may have misunderstood some of the exposition in this film since I took the opportunity to nip out for some popcorn but as far as I could tell the premise of the film is that there is a a sort of inter galactic security force for rich sentient beings called The Green Lanterns that derives its extraordinary energy from the power of money which manifests throughout the universe as fat beams of green light Down on earth a spoilt self indulgent American test pilot called Jordan is chosen by the magic money ring of one of these inter galactic security guards to take his place when he dies after his space ship crashes and the nice alien men explain to everyone that the power of money embedded in his ring will allow Jordan to physically create anything his mind can imagine Unfortunately being a spoilt self indulgent American the only thing Jordan s mind can imagine appears to be racing cars nice jewellery for his girlfriend and a number of unlikely but really big guns Jordan s first job as a Green Lantern is to protect a party of very wealthy industrialists and a powerful senator when the senator s helicopter breaks and tries to kill everyone at a terrifically swanky corporate party for rich people He manages this very successfully by imagining a racing car and gets to impress a wealthy industrialist s beautiful daughter who Jordan then chats up by using the power of his money ring to imagine her a jewelled necklace There are a couple of mildly amusing episodes where people recognise Jordan despite his cunning super hero disguise of a green lone ranger eye mask but since he happily tells anyone he meets who he is anyway it doesn t seem all that important In order to alleviate the boredom of this trite and tedious super boy meets girl story the alien narrators introduce another power in the universe to rival that of money which is a yellow colour and is the power of the envy of rich peoples ugly children Fortunately on earth Jordan has a childhood friend called Hector who is the ugly son of a powerful senator so he is able to absorb the power of envy to become the film s antihero and indulge in some massive overacting It s easy enough to separate the goodies from the baddies in this film because the goodies are all incredibly handsome and slightly green whilst the baddies are all hideously deformed and jaundice yellow I suppose it makes a change from the baddies all being black and I liked how it made the film so much easier to follow Jordan quickly assembles his team of standard supporting sidekicks instantly recognisable from groundbreaking shows such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer and proceeds to visit a massive expensive lab where rich people take their ugly children to get them treated so he can have a huge fight with Hector In which he mostly imagines some really big guns I think I might have fallen asleep after that cos I don t really remember much else about the film I m guessing that Jordan uses the immense power of money to beat up all the bad ugly yellow guys in the universe probably using some really big guns that the earth is once again made a safe place for rich people and that he gets the beautiful rich girl I also imagine that Jordan s geeky sidekick gets some sort of awful injury and dies at the end as he wasn t really as incredibly handsome as all the other wealthy green people because he had to wear such thick glasses But I don t think I ll be watching the film again to find out,0.0,0.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2494340/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2011,to fear or not to fear (this movie),Although the comic book series might be intriguing the film fell flat with its cocktail of stereotypes and insistence that fear is bad because it leads to evilness missing the fact that fear is a natural response that serves a vital purpose and it s really the underlying pain that if untreated has a tendency to lead to violence against others The hero must be feeling so much pain that he completely numbs his fear but to bring light into that side of his personality would be much too deep for this shallow roller coaster ride The only thing I can take away from this film is the bad feeling that some writers still think that when women say no they really mean yes like when Carol repeatedly rejects Hal s invitation to dance just to then lose herself against his large shoulders when they are dancing together in the next scene which of course leads to more eventually That s just low,3.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2532421/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2011,Not great. Not great at all,I am not a comic book fan What I know about the Green Lantern can fit on the back of a postage stamp but then I could say the same thing about Iron Man and I really enjoyed that film So I went into the Green Lantern with an open mind and with the hope I would see and action filled enjoy fest What I got was a slow moving snore fest The character development took way too long For the first 30 mins of the film I thought had walked into Top Gun 2 with Ryan Renolds playing Mavericks younger brother Lil Mav The plot was basic enough and easy to follow but there were too many holes I know when you go to a movie like this you are supposed to suspend disbelief But you have to ask questions why a whole group of Green Lanterns with years of experience and much power are no match for the main bad guy but Ryan Renolds seems to have no trouble with him If you are a true Green Lantern fan you may get some pleasure with seeing your favourite comic book character on the big screen but if you are after a cool action film with a likable hero watch Iron Man again the first one not the second one,2.0,2.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2468377/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2012,This had promise,Green Lantern seems to the underdog to Superman and Batman franchise there is a lot going for it considering how much into sci fi it delves into but it has always stuttered in its progress though not as bad as Wonder woman that seems to be the most outdated of all DC characters Green Lantern has had more success with animation mainly with the justice league but comic sales it hasn t been the best seller and now it has done surprisingly poor on the movie frontline The problem isn t the budget of the film the special effects is quite impressive but that the directing and general acting is just bad with a mashed up plot that does the same mistake that spider man 3 did which was to throw in too much too soon The story of Hal getting the ring isn t the muddle but the completely unnecessary plot points that tag along with it such as Hector Hammond examining alien body to bad guy with super telekentic powers What makes this even more laughable is this character is beaten slammed into objects even having a gas canister slam into his back and yet is able to get himself a Stephen hawkings like chair to plan his next scheme It begs the question how he could even flee if he is depicted as immobile the next scene I m sure Ryan Reynolds is a good actor but Hal was just a complete jerk with gags thrown at the movie goer at every possible second to show that their trying to be witty Ryan s guesswork on the lantern s mantra was nothing short of cringeful The writing is weak though the idea of making Ryan depict Hal as smug brat flying a plane looked utterly unrealistic in regards to keeping things within acceptable context Same with his co pilot carol who starts as strong woman to someone who needs Hal in her life And whatever happened to the three guys hal beat up one flying through a wall never mentioned at all A superhero movie has to be consistent with a hero s flaws his mistakes etc to turn a blind eye to Hal forcing everyone out of a job because of his ego smacking people into a wall or delaying saving a city because he wanted to hug his gf has him turned out to be a self centred jerk Amazingly Sinstero wasn t all that impressive either there is little character development other then that he is never happy or impressed There is a plus the CGI is amazing some of the acting is good but the direction and story telling is just shallow if DC makes a sequel of this then their taking a gamble they should just put this to one side and move on,4.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2558261/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,Not as horrible as I heard but still not wow.,Just now I got the time to watch the movies that I didn t watch because everyone said they d horrabl I enjoyed the movie in general it was not boring at all It didn t drive me to break my laptop This movie is an orgion story so everything happened at the buggering was well expected Some scenes were just in the middle with no purpose and only at the end they put something connecting it to the story We got some scenes of Hal Jordan and his girlfriend not girlfriend woman that I didn t like casting her at all and still I don t feel connected to them It s inconvenient how a group of lanterns were handling Parallax That fight was too much idiotic for a group of super heroes guarding the galaxy for ages Like make the battle be stronger or tell me that these people are beginners or something And the final battle come on Okay it was great but one person could do it with a punch to the sun and a group of people didn t You want to tell me that just because he got fearless he could defeat that Yellow thing Hector was actually able to see people s fears not memories in general The thing that when he touched Joedan he saw him with his girlfriend I don t get the fear here exactly Is he afraid of loosing her cuz he kept missing things up and she never left him when he got the powers he decided to fly for her which doesn t make any sense He flew all that way so we get to the line that she talks about how he keeps quiting things and how how he wleven quoted the Green lantern coupe Couldn t the writer find a better way to do that As a character development it was not bad The main theme is about the battle between fear and will And we could see a character arc He learned something he overcame his fears and decided to take the responsibility My advice if you didn t watch it yet watch it when you are bored and not looking for something wow,5.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8169007/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2019,Ridiculous stack of cliches,Huge disappointment Expected a nice action movie with some humor interesting plot emotional hook Got a coloring book Typical hero story love story Full set of boring tricks dead seriousness And hey why steal the final scene from another film That s not even funny There were 2 3 interesting and original scenes though total length 10 minutes Thank you goes to their author The rest is wasted time yes I regret,1.0,2.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4560600/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2019,Certainly a Darkest Night,Just recently rewatched for our podcast After Credit Cast I m going to drop my two cents here EVERYTHING that can go wrong with this film basically did Ryan Reynolds performance is laughable but that falls on the direction of Martin Campbell who basically didn t even want Reynolds to play Hal Jordan From what I ve read Ryan was asked to take many more takes than needed and it seems like the worst takes were used here The CGI is atrocious and smacks of the uncanny valley when the mask is rendered I understand the ring makes a costume but an actual physical costume would have looked so much better The villain is another big CGI cloud Fantastic Four Silver Surfer and it s name is Parallax If you aren t familiar with comics Parallax as a concept wasn t introduced until the 80 s or 90 s decades after Hal Jordan became Green Lantern And it was part of the most convoluted and hated change up on the Green Lantern series not to mention the concept of Parallax is difficult to shove into just ONE film and still have it make sense alongside an origin story Whoever felt Parallax was the best choice for the origin villain REALLY should have been fired from the writing job day one There are a few easter eggs showing an attempt to start a shared universe like Marvel from Carol Ferris appearance to Sinestro s sudden turn in the post credits to Amanda Waller showing up and maybe dying off screen somewhere That last one wasn t especially clear Sinestro s turn in the post credits seems unearned as we didn t get any character development for him or ANY OTHER Lanterns There s also Hector who I think plays a decently goofy but ill fitting secondary villain He is mutated by the yellow space cloud of fear to get psionic powers But exactly what his goal or motive is beyond creep incel stuff is unclear He never really gets any information from Parallax And when Parallax finally bothers to show up he kills Hector for failing him How has he failed already when you really didn t give him much to go on The film looks ugly in every shot The music is bland an unmemorable The writing is cliche when it isn t just stupid There is nothing I can recommend about this film unless you need an example of how not to make a movie In that case this is excellent for film students needing such examples Skip this If you find it in the wild bury it or burn it Not even Reynolds looks back on this one fondly,1.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4600981/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2011,"A good, entertaining movie.",It s not the best super hero movie in the world But it s entertaining and it occasionally made me smile Ryan Reynolds as the green lantern was a good choice He does a good job in playing the bit lazy pilot Hal Jordan Blake Lively looks stunning the Gossip Girl star is turning into a real film actress I think we are gonna see a lot more of her I certainly hope so The make up is very well done but some CGI aliens are very ugly and look fake and very computer generated Story wise there are some funny moments the action scene s characters it s all there Peter Sarsgaard does a great job Only i think that the story of the bad guy should have been better He is very easily defeated and there is not a real thread of all people in the world dying And why didn t they kill him in the first place The music score is good and i left the theater with a good feeling I give this movie a 6 9 10 not a real 7,7.0,1.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2478943/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2011,Narcissism Glorfied By Marvel Once Again (a tiny spoiler),Like Thor the director failed to recognize that a sociopathic person is not going to suddenly become good and really that s just common sense Since when do people who ve lived a self centered life risking their and everyone else s life who think they are an immortal god and go around beating everyone up and so on suddenly become good Never People are grow up and show no sign of a conscience stay that way It s called psychopathy or narcissism disorder though narcissists have a twisted conscience Whoever directed Iron Man understood psychology because in the second iron man a little spoiler prepare Iron Man admits to being a narcissist and clearly the director was trying to show he was mentally ill Now that s realism But in Thor and Green Lantern you re given a psychopath or sociopath or narcissist who suddenly turns good And it s bad to show movies like this to uninformed kids because they can grow up as narcissists thinking they can be evil all they want and be good any time they choose or that there is good in evil people or that you merely need to risk your life to be the good guy Such portrayals can turn kids into narcissists if they actually believe that and have bad parents raising them If the directors had shown Thor or Lantern as having grown up moral but slowly becoming evil over time or morally corrupt or suddenly becoming bad then you could realistically portray these people as going backwards to their better days and snapping out of it but there are no such scenes in Green Lantern or Thor Please Marvel stop putting out this nonsense you ve been raising narcissists for decades now and it s ruining this country and the rest of the world who buy into your beautiful nonsense and take such characters as idols to imitate,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2506828/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2011,Worst Comic Book Movie,And yet another movie that I feel I have wasted my hard earned money on This movie was just awful I haven t been this bored in a movie since Avatar First of all if you re going to make a movie based on a comic book stick to the story of the comic Don t add a little bit of this and a little bit of that because you think it ll spice up the story 9 time out of 10 it ll only slow the story down so it s best if you leave well enough alone Second stick to one plot Don t introduce another plot and if you do at least wait until the end of the movie and not the in the middle I understand that gives us the viewer and movie goers an insight as to what the sequel will be about but like I said wait for the end of the movie Third yes we like a little romance Key word in that sentence was LITTLE We don t want half of the movie to be dedicated to two people who want to get together but won t The plot was way too slow There were too many scenes between Hal and Carol that were unnecessary We want to see Hal as the Green Lantern not an on again off again lover of Carol Ferris Here s an idea it s called Green Lantern put a few scenes of the Green Lantern in it Just a thought The acting We ll start with Ryan Reynolds I normally enjoy movies that Ryan is in but this was his worst performance EVER Yes Hal is cocky but not to the point were we re rooting for the bad guy to get the girl And no one likes a whiny hero We don t even like whiny so get rid of whiny unless you re playing a teenage girl who s spoiled and can t get her way Blake Lively wasn t bad but she wasn t amazing Like I said most of the scenes she was in were too slow but that wasn t her fault She just isn t interesting to watch on screen Peter Sarsgaard was hands down the best actor in Green Lantern I didn t even recognize him when he came on screen He made me feel sorry for Hector Hammond and in the end I was rooting for him to get the girl Not Hal Overall this movie was really slow it lacked a clear plot and the acting was mediocre Just because over half of the movie is special effects it doesn t mean it ll be a hit This one was a stinker,1.0,1.0,9.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447816/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2011,A weak attempt at a lesser known superhero,I m just gonna go ahead and say it Green Lantern is not a good comic book movie I would say its down there with Thor and X men Last Stand It compares itself to Thor in that there are two different worlds In the movie Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds is chosen to be part of a force of universal guardians known as the Green Lantern Corp When the universe is threatened by the yellow fear driven villain Parallax voiced by Clancy Brown the corp needs someone who is truly fearless The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a meteoker comic book movie Reynolds had his funny moments but couldn t seem to pull off the rest I didn t buy the relationship between Hal and his love interest Carol Ferris Blake Lively It s not that they re both not great actors they really are it s just that their chemistry on screen doesn t mesh Under the circumstances everyone in the city seemed surprisingly well unsurprised We didn t get that classic whole city panic that was portrayed so well in Batman Begins The villains in this movie were identical Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard was a very low key character and was only there to show the origins of the real villain He could have been taken out of the movie entirely We almost got too much back story on his character The layout of the story was quiet unintriguing There were so many simple subplots that were so separate from one another They switched back and forth between them in such an obnoxious way and I found myself getting bored in the most intense scenes In order to determine whether or not the film is relateable I think the film has to make me ask a question Did Green Lantern Yes actually I found myself asking what is it to truly be fearless Another positive aspect was that even though it was filmed in 3D it didn t have that 3D in your face feel Not everything was being thrown at the camera and it felt like a 2D movie in 3D space If we insist on filming in 3D thats the way it should be So Green Lantern is barely a good time Seeing he other planet was new and interesting The characters whether hero villain or citizen were all very dull A lot of the action was borderline ridiculous Even though it had the best 3D cinematography that I ve seen in a while save your money and see it in 2D the way film was meant to be,0.0,0.0,4.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447654/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2011,Undecided,The story was great and the movie is worth seeing but wait until it comes out in DVD There were some weeknesses such as the special effects like the costume fakeness But what bothered me the most was the editing I am not talking about it cutting in the middle of the scene it was more along the lines of too much They could have cut out a half an hour and it would have made the movie better there were a lot of parts that I felt could have been skipped over and parts that dragged on But the story and actors were just flawless Ryan was perfect Totally worth seeing but like I said wait until it comes out on DVD Its worth renting for sure,7.0,1.0,6.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445984/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2017,An Under Appreciated Contribution to Super Hero Cinema,The theatrical cut of Green Lantern is far better than many people may lead you to believe The movie is all at once a science fiction horror action and romance adventure with terrific special effects and a great score to boot While the insecure masses wrote it off with broad strokes fearing it as some kind of threat to the Marvel universe the more astute viewer will recognize the brilliance of this magical genre blender The film delivers wit and high concept science fiction that succeeds at capturing the magical weirdness of Green Lantern without much compromise in an effort to make the concept consumable on a grand scale Part Star Wars part Exorcist Green Lantern dares to be different in an exciting way that will be appreciated by anyone unafraid to try something new,10.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3642633/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2013,Oh my...,A wise plagiarist once said Brevity is the soul of wit In other words I ll keep it simple Sure I could carefully analyze and list in detail everything that is wrong with the plot and its inconsistencies or I could simply remark about the ending that happens to be this film s greatest downfall Though the strength of will was able to defeat the power fear in what could be considered the most laughable battle ever Sinestro still feels the need to steal the unused Yellow ring that was proved useless and impotent by will power Green It s like watching an American A 10 destroy a Soviet tank and choosing the Soviet tank over the A 10 for combat Come on Sinestro is never given any need nor is ever tempted to become a bad guy He just defects it in one short scene during the credits,3.0,2.0,5.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2890135/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2011,Enjoyable but still just a shallow bunch of nonsense,So another superhero movie based on comic books we saw in the past that his can result in quite awesome movies like iron man or Mr Nolans s Batman series Green Lantern didn t really succeed to be that good although it s quite entertaining there is decent acting good visual effects but the movie all together is still just a bunch of shallow nonsense there is no real believable character development the story s too rushed there are too many unexplained things the fights aren t really epic but it s not as bad as it seems Some of my problems Ryan Reynolds speech to the aliens was quite laughable the main villain is some giant space cloud of dust with a human head that we know basically nothing about OK it somehow got deformed from a humanoid body to that because it eats fear get it now so that evil is very much not cool and as we saw in the dark knight an awesome villain can pretty much carry the whole movie The other villain actually had the potential to be cool the loser teacher who s brain swollen and he gained telepathic and kinetic abilities but all he does is make things move around him like magic that kind of creepy distorted looks is not justified at all he s just some wizard who looks at an item and makes something happen If i remember correctly there was a physically weak villain with an over sized head in the comics who could manipulate people s thoughts and dreams instead here it s just a very ugly and deformed guy who does random magic and evil stuff not really what you had in mind for an epic superhero movie The green energy stuff is a little bit too crazy i think they try to explain that it s actually not magic in like 2 sentences but there isn t a real explanation of what it is the guys makes all kinds of ridiculous things out of green magical rays like green magical functioning fighter planes and a formula 1 race car sorry that s too much of nonsense should have refined this part in my opinion it s OK in an old comic book but not really in a hyped up movie with Tim Robbins While in the dark knight and iron man they could balance out the minimal required amount of nonsense with great script characters story flow in the green lantern it s pretty much all nonsense and i d say the mentioned movies set the standards too high for this piece What also was a little strange for me that Reynolds was never surprised He got dragged through 100 miles of air by green energy he was not surprised The ring takes him out of space to an alien planet he s not surprised He sees a giant scary alien he s not surprised It s just not credible at all And it wasn t an acting problem it was in the script All those aliens and green magic came so natural to him Also the ending scene is supposed to be very cool and everything it s just lame unexplained and unjustified So the leader good guy after the bad guy is destroyed just out of nowhere wanst to have more power no explanation at all gets an idea becomes evil and looks in an evil way OK you can guess why it happened if you really want to but it is still a stupid scene Possibly everything in the movie happens very fast this is a good thing because it doesn t get boring and bad because nothing is explained and as a direct result of that the story becomes dull and shallow The good stuff The visuals and music were cool not mind blowing but these matter a lot in a movie like this Voice actors for the non human beings were very good This whole green colored theme throughout the movie was actually cool even if it was mostly nonsense So all together the atmosphere was good that s a good start A lot of scenes were good acting was decent we have Tim Robbins in the movie it just somehow didn t come together as it was supposed The script wasn t all together terrible like the one of transformers 3 for example it just would have needed a lot of refining to make a very good movie without that it only made an average one Quite enjoyable overall 5 10 for me,0.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2464160/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Green Lantern: The End to a Winnning Streak,Ryan Renyolds has began to enter the world of Comic Book Graphic Novel Based films with his part in Marvel s X Men Origins and now Detective Comic s Green Lantern With rumors releases and pre production of films based on other comic book characters it is obvious that many super hero films will be released in the next few years Personally I am not the biggest fan of Ryan Renyolds With a few exceptions Adventureland he is unable to play a role without the use of quick witted humor and sex jokes involved While this may be a detail that is not directly related to this film it supports the fact that Renyolds was not the perfect choice for the lead role The makers of this film should have realized that an actors body fitting the profile of the main character does not justify a perfect match The acting cannot take full blame This film seemed cheaply written with very little use of originality The writers used action sequences with the use of special effects to make up for the poor attempts at realistic dialog While this effort may work in other films other films tend to use good graphics in the making of their special effects The computer makeup of the other green lantern characters was overdone The costume makeup combined with the poor attempts at special effects could be described as almost animated The special effects of this film remind me of the special effects in the film Spawn which was made over 10 years ago With the production of films to release characters of Marvel s Avengers I believe that DC hopes to compete by releasing characters of the Justice League This film in that attempt seemed very rushed With the critically failing release of Superman Returns Detective Comics has been able to redeem their image with the releases of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight The Green Lantern ended this short winning streak of films based on Detective Comics Seeing this film makes me dread the release of anticipated films such as Wonder Woman and wait anxiously for the release of The Dark Knight Rises Bottom line Green Lantern was not the worst Comic Book based film that I have ever seen but it is definitely in the top 5 If your girlfriend has left you for a close friend your parents have disowned you you have been fired from your job as a floor manager at McDonalds and you just want to relax and watch a GOOD movie Green Lantern is not the way to go,5.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446826/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2021,Solid to be honest,Honestly it s as good or bad as the hype The action and Ryan Reynolds shtick is engaging It s meta watching Blake and Ryan play a role like they re role playing sex night 2 out of 10 for leaving Angela Basset stuck to a window,2.0,0.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7171364/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2016,A Hollywood Cliché,I did not like the movie Because I think it only was a Hollywood clich and nothing beyond it I mean I have seen a super hero who saves the world a thousand times and this one was no different I think Hollywood immediately needs new ideas Although names and costumes of the superheros change the main theme always stays the same I do not know how long will they be able to make such kinds of movies but they should immediately revolutionize their ideas If you ask me I would say it did not worth my time and I would not suggest it to any of my friends Watch it and see it for yourself Of course I appreciate their effort It is not easy to make a movie But if you are going to make a movie at least make a new one,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3497394/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2023,Green Lantern Core!,I ve heard a lot of booing and bad reviews from critics about this movie but I find it entertaining I too have seen a few animated movies about the Green Lanterns Some animated in styles I didn t particularly like respectively of course but the imagination and creativity of the movie is nothing short of awesome The only disappointment I had in it was the fact that it wasn t quite long enough for what i thought it would be and there wasn t quite enough action Great performances from everyone involved Hal may be a cocky test pilot but he took those planes to boundaries other pilots wouldn t have considered and that makes him an amazing pilot to me He went above and beyond thinking outside the box and proving something otherwise,10.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9075915/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Definitely not my favourite,I am not a big fan of DC and have not heard of Green Lantern until I watched the movie I find this movie not impressive at all because it really fits many criteria of a typical superhero film from how the bad guys destroy the world how the hero saves the world cheesy lines to bad guys are always the uglier ones I don t mean disrespect towards the Green Lantern fans but I burst into laughs several times accompanied with some frustration simply because the story line is really predictable and simple or the lines are too cheesy At some point it may seem to suit audience of all age but I find that it may not be favoured by adult audience who may prefer a little bit more complexity or surprises in the movie This is a movie about the war of imagination and creativity between the good and evil in which the movie lacks of these both itself I was disappointed because I was expecting something different but it was just made up of combination of many familiar scenes from other movies such as from Superman Scott Pilgrim versus The World and random man made stuff as major part of the fighting strategies Besides their main character seemed rather too well adjusted to the sudden unexplained things happening to him Comparing this to X men First Class the reaction of the mutants when they first found out their own ability seemed to be a lot more acceptable No doubt the CG effects are acceptable and there were a few really funny lines but that s it For a comic that has its first appearance in 1940s it is totally understandable how popular it could be for those who grew up with it just that I could only say this movie is not my cup of tea in this era,3.0,2.0,6.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447098/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2011,Not bad but not good,I have never followed the comic Green Lantern so I do not have anything to compare the movie to The movie was not anything special but it didn t disappoint me There wasn t much action like most comic book movies have and the little action that there was in the movie I had already saw from all the trailers Even though majority of the movie was back story it still felt like I didn t know much about any of the characters The acting wasn t so bad either but this was not one of Ryan Reynolds best performances but you just can t help but love him He may be one of the best looking super heroes they have cast This film felt predictable and clich to me but I still enjoyed so its not such a bad movie after all Since they leave with an open ending I am assuming there will be a second movie and I m thinking that movie will be better since they got a lot of back story out of the way in this movie,6.0,0.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2451298/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2011,Brilliant film!,Don t listen to the reviews or critics this film was a credit to the green lantern character and the DC universe Ryan Reynolds played the act brilliantly and perfectly the CGI was stunning admittedly the 3D was rubbish but isn t it always The costume for the green lantern looks so real with every detail fine tuned to perfection There is intense and awesome action scenes there is comedy and there is a brilliant backdrop and plot all these things come together very well to make the perfect superhero movie If you don t believe me rent this film when it comes out and judge for yourself don t let me or the critics sway your opinion,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2473730/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2014,"What should have happened,,,",I was so excited when I heard that this movie was being made I thought of all the things it could be Then I saw the movie and I was greatly disappointed Here was a chance to create such an interesting universe The most interesting stories that I have read and watched on TV and in animated Lantern movies have always been the ones about space That was probably the best part in the movie this movie as well Instead the studio director focused on a mediocre love story and a weird daddy issues villain Hell if they were going to do a love story they should have focused on a Star Sapphire story line That would have given us a better love story and a kick ass female villain This movie had the chance to be equally as great as Star Wars with so many planets and aliens to choose from and a universe of some of them most bad ass villains They could have focused on Sinestro and a bond between Hal and Sinsetro only to be broken in the second movie I am pretty sure there were many ways it could have gone Instead it pandered to a wide audience comedy romance Ryan Reynolds wasn t bad in the movie they cast the right actor for the script that was written Romance comedy is his thing He does it well The problem is the way the character was written and if Hal were written like the animated movies or the comics then the casting of the actor would have been different my choice with a better script would have been Chris Pine Tom Hardy or Channing Tatem Ryan Reynolds could still play Hal but he would have to tone it down like Chris Evans does when playing Capt America The problem with this movie is it ALIENATED lol fans Even the cartoon that played on Cartoon Network s DC Nation had a more interesting story line The red lantern drama was very cool so was the Aya romance and story line Its like studios don t want these franchises to succeed but TV does It looks like Guardians of the Galaxy will be like this instead I hope I am posting a good review of that movie when it comes out Fingers crossed,1.0,2.0,7.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3038663/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2012,My Preview on Green Lantern,The film is about a pilot who had an accident discovered an alien who got crashed too and decided to help him And alien gave the power he has to him trough the ring What got this film so wrong is that the film is only a film It feels too animated and it doesn t live in our heart Even animated can move our feeling On the paper it seems like Ryan Reynolds is the perfect choice But he made Hal Jordan look annoying and doesn t get my sympathy I think i m not the only one with this And the love story is so cheesy There are two element that actually bumped this a little bit Mark Strong and the Make Up department If you re a DC Comics Fans be ready for the worst,4.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2550785/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2014,Tried going too big too early,I wanted to like this movie Green Lantern is by one of the most interesting characters in the DC universe However I think what went wrong here is how they did no character justice The good The depiction of the Corps Despite the poor CGI seeing hundreds if not thousands of Lanterns on screen was fun Sinestro played my Mark Strong was a great fit The British accent is great for monologues and even better as he becomes Sinestro Corps Ryan Reynolds is the perfect Hal Jordan He s sarcastic cheeky and fits the role as the greatest lantern ever The bad Too much CGI From the CGI suit CGI corps CGI villain It s a miracle Reynolds wasn t CGI d himself Obviously GL needs a lot of it with all of the constructs but it doesn t mean EVERYTHING has to be that way The suit looks weird on Reynolds It looked like someone poorly Photoshopped him and made a little too many adjustments The mask itself could have used a bit more work as well The story Campbell could have followed canon with the villains but instead he pulls the biggest baddest one out first and fails at it Parallax plays such a huge role in the DC universe and just like that he s killed Of course you could bring him back but I don t see how anyone but superman surviving the sun Too early to intro Sinestro corps Hal Jordan and Sinestro fight alongside each other for at least a little bit before Sinestro turns yellow This movie throws him into that spot way too fast There s not enough character development for Sinestro for him to be a full on baddie so quickly Sadly this needs a reboot already,5.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3050810/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2011,Just wrong time wrong place,This movie is a victim of bad timing rather than bad filmaking to start off the film as a whole is a good film yes it s no masterpiece but as comic book movie it s good The only issue is that we are now spoiled by so many great comic book movie as a genre it s so strong now and most of the characters are so more well known and easy to identify with The movie as a whole is solid the casting is good and the story is acceptable but the fact the green lantern is not known by a majority of people leads to a lot of building of the initial story and beginnings of the green lantern this makes the movie a bit slow paced and tedious at points The main problem with this film is the complete overuse of cgi and the cgi is not bad in the film but it leaves the film lacking charm almost and this is a issue with so many films today If your looking for something to watch and enjoy this is a good choice but don t expect fireworks but hopefully they get at a chance at a sequel because they built the character and story they could really do something with the green lantern if given the chance,6.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2453596/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2011,Only Human,It seems every summer blockbuster season fans and critics alike seize upon a particular film to victimize and this year it seems Green Lantern is the chosen candidate Warner and DC s first big effort to success fully bring one of their lesser known characters to the big screen GL had a decent pedigree Martin Campbell has made some very good pictures in his time Goldeneye Mask of Zorro Casino Royale some decent efforts Edge of Darkness and some downright awful ones Vertical Limit so he has was seen as a fairly safe pair of hands for this Ryan Reynolds when he wants to be can be a very likable and effective leading man and again seems like ideal casting for the cocky test pilot turned inter galactic hero Mark Strong as Sinestro is largely perfect casting while Peter Sarsgaard is creepily effective in his under developed role as villain Hector Hammond and Blake Lively is pretty too look at but don t blame her too much her role is essentially your typical love interest Where GL does succeed is in visual effects which are largely effective Reynolds likable hero Strong s Sinestro who really should have been the main villain Sarsgaard who gets the most out of his villain and fan boy pleasing winks to the audience Amanda Waller Corp member cameos However the film also has many serious flaws chiefly the lack on time spent on Oa which largely reduces fan favorite Lanterns like Kilowog and Tomar Re to little more than cameos The Guardians meanwhile are almost totally sidelined popping up only to deliver exposition Blake Lively gorgeous though she is is given little to do other than provide a love interest The choice of Parrallax as the main villain and the movies depiction of him also irks basically coming across as an evil cloud of space vomit Also the film s obvious attempts to ape the Marvel formula doesn t really work out DC s characters have always been more mythic than their Marvel counterparts The best DC movies Nolan s Batman series Donner s Superman realize this but GL tries to inject too much humor that doesn t connect All in all GL has more pros than cons and is nowhere near as bad as the reviews would have you believe But compared to this year s other superhero flicks the superb Thor and the excellent X Men First Class it falls somewhat short A sequel may well shore up the problems but given the movies dismal reception critically and commercially don t count on it happening anytime soon,7.0,1.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2463163/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2019,Perfectly Mediocre,First off I would like to say that the hate for this movie isn t entirely deserved There are glimmers of a better movie and ranking it alongside horrible movies such as Fant4stic and Catwoman as one of the worst superhero movies just feels wrong By far the best part of the movie is Mark Strong as Sinestro The man nailed it The main problem with this movie is it s blandness The film is very unoriginal and quite forgettable The handling of Parallax in this film is awful visually story wise you name it The mediocrity of this movie is overwhelming which is frustrating because as a Green Lantern fan I know that this movie can do better and at times it does There was one scene that really resonated with me however It was towards the end when GL was fighting CGI diarrhea and he s all but lost He s on his knees and reciting the Green Lantern oath Something about the way that scene was executed really resonated with me However it s easily balanced out by scenes like the race car track scene I wish the characters had been stronger which could have caused the movie to be more emotionally relevant All in all not a bad movie just an average one,5.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4900460/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2012,Simply underrated..,So let me start by saying that I ve personally enjoyed every single second while watching this movie When I first knew that its average rating was a 5 9 I asked could it possibly be that bad Well the answer is no I think all of the actors did a great job and the characters fitted them perfectly This movie wasn t as strong as Batman Begins Transformers or Iron Man but it was definitely a very good introduction to the character From where I am no one knew who the Green Lantern was before the movie The movie did its job and introduced the character perfectly I d choose Green Lantern over Captain America The First Avenger or The Incredible Hulk any day The movie was far more entertaining and exciting It is definitely not as bad as the critics are saying and I highly recommend it It established a good basis for later sequels and I m sure it will only get better from here This movie is for sure not a bad one nor a waste of time Critics shouldn t have expected another Batman Begins they were only just getting started I m personally satisfied and currently awaiting the next movie eagerly,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2632006/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2011,"Bad, but not too bad",The best thing I can say about this movie is that it s not as bad as I expected it to be from the reviews I read It s primary fault is similar to the equally bad Fantastic Four movies it doesn t take its source material seriously at all I realize it s a cheesy comic book movie and comic book superhero movies really blow when taken TOO seriously see Ang Lee s horrible Hulk movie but the filmmakers should at least care enough to treat Hal like a real character rather than just a cartoon character They completely RUINED Parallax when you compare the character to Jeff Jahns original books which are great by the way People have described him as The giant poop monster and I tend to agree Hulk Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer and now this movie have all committed an unforgivable sin Having a main villain that s just an amorphous blob of special effects Blah Considering how much they spent on this movie the CGI looks pretty bad Where did that 200 million go Also directors need to learn from the errors of George Lucas and the awful Star Wars prequels Coach your actors well if you re going to have them do scene after scene in mo cap suits in front of a green screen Otherwise they re going to look awkward and stiff The editing is bad A lot of the times the film just cuts to Hal showing up somewhere without explaining how the hell he got there or even knew to be there This happens multiple times and really annoyed me when I was watching it Also this is a nitpick but the early scene with the jet fighters is loaded with factual errors For one thing the F 35 is a strike fighter not an air superiority fighter If they were testing the new drones air superiority capabilities they should have used the F 22 which is the most advanced air superiority fighter in the world Also Hal beats the drones by flying to 50 000 feet which somehow causes his and their engines to flame out This is stupid For one thing the F 35 s service ceiling is 60 000 feet But besides this service ceiling doesn t mean your whole plane frazzes out It just means it s ability to climb diminishes after this point You won t harm a plane by hitting the service ceiling Also the whole dog fight scene is inaccurate because the F 35 can target other planes without being directly behind them But there are some good things about the movie I really like Sinestro and some of the scenes on Oa are very impressive Also there s some good humor in certain parts of the movie Ryan Reynolds does the best he can with a bad script but he s not particularly likable in it Parts of it were enjoyable and I don t regret seeing it It might be worth renting and watching with some friends and some beer so you can give it the Mystery Science Theater treatment,4.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2471098/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,Not As Bad As Some Are Saying... But Should Have Been Great,As a long time Green Lantern fan I hoped this film wouldn t completely suck It is not as bad as some are saying but definitely has it s problems It s main problem is that it just tries to cram too much information GL history into the under 2 hour run time It is a little chaotic and those unfamiliar with the comic are bound to be scratching their heads Ryan Reynolds is OK in this movie but not really the perfect Hal Jordan He was great as Van Wilder but brings too much of that typical character to his portrayal of Hal Mark Strong on the other hand is great as follow Corpsman Sinestro He translates the character to the screen perfectly While his screen time is brief Lantern drill instructor Kilowog is awesome with the voice of Michael Clarke Duncan If there were less goofy Van Wilder esque jokes from Hal it would have had more of a comic book feel Plus the antagonistic force of Parallax basically looked like planet sized poops with a face on it should have been saved for a later film Hector Hammond should have been the sole bad guy But enough should haves and grievances While this movie could be way better it does give hope for a great sequel if you stick around through the closing credits,6.0,1.0,5.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446282/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2020,An underrated Film with Overreactions.,Its not the best Superhero Movie and not the finest origin Story But the critics are awefull and not rational and in my opinion not even Professional Ryan did a a wonderfull Job The Movie itself and the Story could have been better But come on People thats the Origin Story in Form of a live action Film And it is true to the Comics I dont want to review the whole Movie here and Talk about every single Scene and whats been done wrong or right Its an entertaining movie and a good way to introduce the Green Lantern to the DCU Yes they could have done it better but it is not the worst way to start Good Job Ryan Reynolds And like they Marvel did correct their Mistakes with the Deadpool Character i hope that DC will do the same with the Green Lantern and we get to see this important Character in much more movies,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5966554/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2012,"I don't hate this movie, nor should you!",When talking about this film adaptation of the popular DC comic one can not just bash it because of the obvious because what makes a movie bad isn t always just the obviously bad traits Yes Ryan Reynolds is just eye candy to attract female viewers and yes Blake Lively gives probably one of the worst female lead performances I have seen in a summer blockbuster I just found her bland but it s no huge issue and yes the villain is just an essence of pure evil that has no development whatsoever With Green Lantern you have to look beyond all of the obvious things that would make you hate a movie you have to compromise with it and take it for what it is Otherwise it ll be a pitiful experience when really it could be something to be enjoyed In this review I will refuse to name off the bad because it s all already obvious just by seeing the trailer or the cast I d rather promote some optimism and support it and show people what really this movie has to offer and also my own personal changes that I would have done if I were Martin Campbell and Greg Berlanti 1 Villains When I previously bashed the villain in the beginning of this review I was talking about Parallax the giant entity of evil Aside that point I think the real villain this movie should have stuck with was Peter Sarsgaard s role as Hector Hammond I mean MY GOD I don t think I have ever seen such an interesting and tragic story for such a villain He starts out as just an everyday man but when he gets infected by Parallax he goes through his own personal story arc They make him seem more like a victim of this disease and society I love how they play off the idea how he s tortured by the thoughts of others that he can hear That s a great villain to me not Parallax Who s name always makes me giggle because I just think of a giant space laxative I think Parallax could have been interesting but he really just needed more character development I personally would have put him in the second movie and put Sinestro s story into a third movie That would make it a great way to round off a trilogy have three story arcs that move in a grand sweeping manner rather than having a shabby start and a sequel that s hopefully going to better 2 Action This is a bright and flashy DC comic book adaptation you have to expect seeing some flashy action scenes with interesting elaborate fights What you get with this movie is most of that It s bright flashy but most of the action is almost cartoonish because of the whole idea of the ring holding the power but honestly it works The rings work off of the imaginations and wills of those who use them So it only makes sense that a childish and immature person like Hal Jordan would construct things like jets and hammers and swords and guns It s just what he thinks of since he s only human There s not much I would change with the action other than I would have made it darker Yes people burn and die and bleed but when Hal Jordan fights he doesn t really never physically seemed harmed he stays clean and bruise free I think it would have been more interesting if you could just see the pain he was experiencing when he was getting beaten down by Hector or heck even Kilawog for that matter 3 Drama This movie was completely advertised as a summer action blockbuster style of movie Yes it has its fair share of action but what really drives it is it s characters despite how bland they might be and their relationships and how they grow to understand themselves and each other By the end Hal does learn how to pull through desperate times he gets the girl sorta and stays with being a lantern He didn t quite in the face of danger that was what he was supposed to be written as and that s how he was conveyed which is very good Hector driven mad eventually gives up and accepts his fate as being this freak of society and he wants to wreak revenge He gets his revenge in many ways but he gets what is coming to him like any other revenge based villain No changes here just better casting choices for the female lead is really all I can point out Other than that everything about Hector Hammond was already said If you pay attention to all of these little things and try to understand the characters on a personal level then it s not hard fining at least some enjoyment in this movie I still can only give it a six because yes it is a shabby start to the film career of the Green Lantern but being a fan of the comic books since childhood I personally give this a 7 5 because of nostalgia Thank you for reading and remember to always look for what is truly great in a movie because that is what cinema is about seeing what you love and accepting it for what it is FryeGuy,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2546659/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Average,This movie is too far away from Green Lantern Comic book If you are hardcore Green Lantern comic book and if you are planning for this movie then Sorry guys better buy some Donuts Some of the graphics are good in this movie but in the end Story Matters Martin Campbell has done a good job again in Direction But after Golden Eye Casino Royale this movie is not that much good like his earlier films Well now some good news for Ryan Renolds fans Well its a very good start for him Yes after this movie we can imagine him as a superhero character Angela Basset is okay as Amanda Waller but the character is really only in the movie for about fifteen minutes so there s nothing particularly bad or good about her performance Mark Strong is spectacular as Sinestro He perfectly captures the essence of the character from the comics At the end of the movie the character does have an abrupt personality change which makes no sense when compared to the after credits scene The script had major problems I don t know what they want to show It s like 90 s flick Production design of this film is good background score is good Totally for Kids Not for Adults,4.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446898/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2011,'Green Lantern' is solid and dependable...,Only mildly interested in viewing this movie after the lukewarm impact of Thor and X Men First Class I was pleasantly surprised to discover Green Lantern to be a fun and artistically inspired romp through a universe monitored by the Green Lantern Corp an intergalactic police force that is imbued with great mind bending powers via the the green light of universal willpower The brash and irreverent earthling Hal Jordan is the latest recruit discovered and appointed by the ring of a dying Lantern Abin Sur and he steps in to take up arms as the newly appointed protector of our universal sector Abin Sur s murderer is the all consuming and nebulous villain Parallax a former Guardian of the Universe who was literally and figuratively consumed by the noxious and unstable yellow power of fear itself Earth is next on the menu and it s up to Hal Jordan Green Lantern to stop Parallax in time and save the day Now I don t know why but it s very easy to buy into the idea of Ryan Reynolds as a superhero even a shiny green avenger like one that vaguely resembles seaweed His Hal Jordan character is both comedic and light hearted and hides an inner angst that stems from losing his father in a routine test flight for the same company he now flies for as a test pilot He is single minded in quelling the pangs of fear to the point of recklessness The premise is that this is the very reason the ring chose him audiences will enjoy the joyride from the discovery of the existence of Green Lanterns to the sanctuary of Oa their home world to the sinuous graphics of Parallax s tentacles and gastropod like body Parallax has a minion on Earth the tremulous Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard whose inferiority complex rises against his as he is infected by a piece of the Parallax and slowly loses his sanity while gaining super kinetic powers The transformation of Hammond is both hilarious and grotesquely fascinating which for a summer time flick I find a terrific combination Mark Strong plays an excellent Sinestro the Green Lantern Corp leader and friend of Abin Sur His distaste of Hal Jordan and the human race is palpable as are those wickedly expressive eyebrows of his and he is harsh to the point of brutal I loved the concise lore behind the rings and the lanterns sometimes too much intricacy makes my head spin and I kind of enjoyed the silly schoolyard romance between Hal and fellow test pilot Carol Ferris played by the nubile Blake Lively She evokes Iron Man s Pepper Potts as a type A personality with a thing for Hal despite his crazy impulsiveness and consequent irresponsibility for the repercussions Terrific scene in which Carol discovers the identity of the Green Lantern and conveys the unspoken thought experienced by those who have witnessed the perplexing dynamic between damsels and their masked crusaders in the movies it s just a mask people It s no procedural drama that s for sure But it s got great special effects lively no pun intended action scenes that keep you rooting for the Corps and impress upon the audience the simplistic notion that the antidote to fear has always been and will always be courage It s like grilled cheese with tomato soup people Comforting in its familiarity never out of style,0.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2457623/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2011,An almost beautiful movie,Some people have some difficult baggage to deal with in their lives Hal Jordan is one such man but I can only conclude that he dealt with it all before this film began The potential of this film was nearly infinite Take a character who is chosen without reason or logic to accept a power that allows him to do virtually anything at any point and then pit him in a literal battle of wills with a power we all instinctively fear Magic right Not quite if you do it like this The difficulty is trying to work out how it didn t work All the major elements are there and although I was somewhat surprised even Ryan Reynolds was an excellent choice for Hal He plays it as flippant and yet complex and then the script fails to do either Where was the struggle In fact where was it in any of the characters Each lacks in their own way right from Silestro to the love interest The result is a film that as the marketing people played on is much anticipated but then leaves you wondering was that it I love a superhero film Reason being that for a brief moment and with millions of fans across the globe we get to access a part of ourselves that is more than we can be We do this by watching a character who can do the same But not in this case The plot is there the actors too the premise is a given but the delivery is poor Next time and I believe there will be one find a writer who can create a character in the same way Jordan can create a chainsaw It s not subtle but it does what needs to be done,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2505614/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2012,There was no thrill...,Green Lantern at first I didn t know it was a movie based on a comic book Maybe that was the reason why it took some time to get in to this movie The story unravels quite fast which at the same time enables you to predict what s going to happen even without knowing the real story The storyline is a bit strange to me you are taken to world and are introduced to well over 3000 other lanterns But instead of working together he has to do everything alone After having watched it all the way I can only say that it s a good story but when made into a movie they didn t got everything out of the plot The story offers so much options which they didn t use For me it was just all going too fast and you get the feeling that one scene isn t yet ended while the other already starts It just doesn t give you that exciting feeling that keeps you on the tip of your seat Very unfortunate maybe the second movie has more to offer,5.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2548503/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2019,"It wasn't all that bad, just not all that good either",I actually saw this movie in the cinema and felt it was a waste of my money especially because it was painful to watch physically I had to go to the toilet about 1 2 through but thought that if I went I would miss the movie getting better It Didn t But ever the hopeful person I was I waited it out and of course was thoroughly disappointed If you ve never seen a superhero movie before then this was probably an ok show but it set up different expectations because it followed such great movies before it,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4688299/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2011,My feelings over the Movie,This movie in general was not awful don t believe the people who are giving horrible reviews I am a huge Green Lantern Fan read the comics since I was a kid and the movie yes was not as good as I expected but then again because I Love the Green Lantern so much I expected so much more The movie is basically something to keep your Super Hero movie appetite going something to hold you off I don t think it was ever meant to be the next Dark Knight But all in all I want to say it s worth the money you will pay to watch it Plus you won t leave angry comic enthusiasts just partly disgruntled at most because of Hollywood Magic messing with some back story Spoiler coming up Ps If your a huge comic fan you will appreciate the Amanda Waller insert,6.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2446223/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,A great although flawed attempt at Hal Jordan's Lantern.,I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed and I must say that I came out surprised and satisfied Sure it s flawed but what movie isn t I m also not here to tell you about what s flawed with the movie Let s focus on what s good First let me warn all of you who are expecting to go into it expecting hero verses villain struggle throughout the whole film this isn t what this movie is at all Sure there is a villain sure there is a brief confrontation at the end where the hero saves his world from impending destruction but this movie is more about establishing Hal Jordan as his role as the Green Lantern than it is about any foe In that aspect I found the movie incredibly well done I also enjoyed the way the movie looked There are so many complaints about how the movie looked but I don t understand why When you look at the characters and compare them to the comics they look amazing I also felt that they effects made it resemble more elements from the comic and animation world and added a different type of charm to it It establishes the role of Hal his rise to glory as the fearless lantern and left open for the epic battle that a lot were expecting in the next one Think of it more as a Part One than a stand alone movie and I m sure you ll enjoy it more than you think Now having said all of that I would like to say the two things that kept this movie from being a 10 star for me One it seemed a bit fast paced I m sure most of the budget went to special effects and caused the shortening of the movie but it could really have used an extra 20 minutes Then for the second one I wish they would have used a different villain This is the foe from Hal Jordan s darkest hour and I felt that the seriousness of this enemy was down played a good deal It should have been someone small insignificant not one of the Green Lantern s most formidable foes It didn t ruin the movie it just left doors closed for future options to be explored,8.0,1.0,3.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447382/?ref_=tt_urv

Great movie for 3D,Awesome The graphics were so outstanding The acting was great and Ryan Reynolds made the perfect Green Lantern I hope he will be in the sequel For a change advertising for the movie did not over hype and ruin it for the viewing public It s a great movie for all ages I was with my husband My Son Grandson who is legally blind and enjoyed it as much as we did and my brother Be sure to watch in 3D it s worth it Do not pay attention to the critics or you will miss a great show We are all looking forward to a sequel real soon Green Lantern s love interest in the film is very tastefully done The flying scenes were not overdone and Ryan Reynolds innocence and sex appeal makes the movie exciting and funny For a change they are not trying to scare the life out of children but instead add very interesting graphics and fun without blood sex and swear words A very refreshing change from the last couple of Batman Movies,8.0,1.0,3.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447426/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2012,A Movie that could have been EPIC!!!!,This is My Review of the highly anticipated movie Green Lantern I ve been a fan of green lantern comic since the sinestro corps war so continuity really is not a problem since I m a young fan Having seen the film made me a fan even more since the CGI s really catches your eyes the costumes are mouth watering and the ring constructs are rendered beautifully Regretfully there are flaws to every film and green lantern is no exception the film fails on 2 parts first the transition of some characters from comic to film is blurred by the script Hal Jordan is a reckless poactive hero and the film made him more IRRESPONSIBLE Jordan is not irresponsible he takes charge of his every actions For the comic fans this is unacepptable since the core character should not be touched in any way Senistro in this movie is also really different in paper where s the bravado we loved from him Senistro is the Hitler of green lantern comic ruling with an iron fist I did not see that in this film and the major flaw of this film for me is minimally using the power of the green lantern corps i did not even see lantern boodika take center stage or get even the glimpse of the spotlight The ending where he hal defeates parallax is really dumd and stupid in comics it takes almost half of the corps to repel such powerful entity Green lantern is a good action movie for mainstream audience but let s not forget that the filmmakers should please their core audience also the ever important fanboys out there DC should bring more continuity and should not change aspects about their characters that made it popular,6.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2584159/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2011,Okay movie that just doesn't live up to what it could be,I had some expectations coming in to this movie as I m sure many people did The biggest things I was looking for out of this movie was good story and good effects I was fairly let down on the story although the effects were pretty decent SPOILER ALERT My problems with the story was the writer s expect you to believe two things about Hector that don t work and the biggest problem with Hal Jordan First lets talk about the 2 things with Hector 1 You are expected to believe that Hector is the son of Tim Robbins character Hard to believe this because Hector looks as old or older than his Dad Tough sell on that one 2 You are expected to believe that Hector Hal and Carol all have a history together from when they were young Hard to do when they have no foreshadowing of that and are just kind of mashed together at the party It came off dis connected from the story and just felt thrown in to try and show a relationship Very poorly done Now for Hal The problem I had with his story was the whole Top Gun freak out in mid flight Nothing up until that point led you to believe that he would have any problems like that while flying Again some foreshadowing of his childhood would have been nice It could have made a lot more sense but instead it came off as cheap and lazy writing Overall if you can get past the mediocre acting although you can only act as good as the screenplay and just enjoy the effects and action sequences then you will be okay and probably enjoy Green Lantern In hindsight I d wait for the blu ray through the mail,6.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2449507/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2011,Just a copy of First Flight.,Short and sweet This was nothing but a copy of Green Lantern First Flight the animated film If you have seen that you get nothing but seeing actors pretend to be cartoons Can t really say anything more about it They just replaced all the animated characters with actors Save yourself the trouble and watch the animated version of this film at least then you will see something more in line with the comics There is nothing new here at all other than Hollywood grandeur certainly nothing to make this film worthwhile I guess to people who have no previous connection to anything to do with Green Lantern this might be entertaining but I just felt like I was watching a rerun having already seen First Flight,0.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2501270/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2012,not so convincing......,a budget of 200 mil for some enough said let us accept that no one imagined RR in the lead role of the green lantern the problem with the movie though is something else i feel it took a lot of time to really tell the viewers about what it wanted to project maybe just maybe a keanu reeves in the lead role may have brought the color and attitude to the character Blake lively as the smart yet subtle girl was definitely not best cast PETER was brilliant but then it was expected i feel the screenplay was above decent but the problem was the awkward direction which has not been seen in superhero movies often there was something wrong with the pace too coming out in year which also released excellently made X MEN FIRST CLASS AND CAPTAIN America GREEN LANTERN lags way behind again i say better casting could have made a huge difference,5.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2547439/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2012,Kiddie Movie,Green Lantern with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively had some great special effects but that s about it If you are hardcore Green Lantern comic book fans then you were disappointed Some of the graphics are good in this movie but the story bombs Martin Campbell has done a good job again in Direction But after Golden Eye Casino Royale this movie is not that much good like his earlier films Well now some good news for Ryan Renolds fans its a very good start for him Yes after this movie we can imagine him as a superhero character Angela Basset is okay as Amanda Waller but the character is really only in the movie for about fifteen minutes so there s nothing particularly bad or good about her performance Mark Strong is spectacular as Sinestro He perfectly captures the essence of the character from the comics At the end of the movie the character does have an abrupt personality change which makes no sense when compared to the after credits scene The script had major problems I don t know what they want to show It s like 90 s flick For kids only,4.0,1.0,4.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2590033/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2011,"Fans will have to ignore some flaws with the comics, others will enjoy themselves rather nicely.",I would say that this movie is only slightly above average The action was good and the story was pretty well told There were just some flaws I saw in the movie when compared to the comics such as Paralax being the main villain I also had a bit of a problem with the fact that parallax was not trapped in the source of the Lantern Corps power parallax in the comics I ve read was not trapped in sector 3600 he was in the power source They also never really bring up the fact that the Lanterns can t use their rings against yellow They DO mention them as Fear yellow and Will green but it doesn t really play a huge part I also felt Hal Jordan was written rather out of character It s not glaring and maybe it s just me but that s my take on it I don t know I ve only ever read the origin and the parallax plot of Green Lantern my other knowledge coming from Lewis Lovhug from That Guy With The Glasses and the super hero cartoons with the Jordon Green Lantern So my knowledge of the Green Lanterns isn t that huge but I did have some trouble getting past these flaws I d say fans would find odd flaws they can try to get past and people who just want to see an super hero movie will have a really good time,6.0,0.0,1.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2454176/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2014,Great superhero movie,Green Lantern has always been one of my favorite superhero movies and I too think it s misunderstood Abin Sur was treated respectfully as he was in the comics Carol was also treated well The planet Oa looked awesome This also comes from someone who read comics through adulthood and only quit because they were getting too darned expensive I will be 49 this year I also loved how the guardians were treated Sinestro was also pretty cool Kilowog was also one of my favorites and was treated pretty well SPOILER If I recall even Ch p made an appearance Loved him and Tomar Re who also made an appearance The battle at the end was awesome and Hal even impressed Sinestro and Kilowog Not easy to do Was it a fun film too Oh YES There were funny lines in it that fit in just right The effects from the rings weren t disappointing either All in all I thought it was a great movie and I wish people would quit trashing it,8.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3026116/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2018,Sometimes it's the overall vibe you get from the movie,Ok let s be honest the script was not the greatest but we can make an exception for just how well Ryan fits in with the character and gives you this overwhelming feeling of goofiness in a good way and the chemistry between the two lovers was just fine I mean there s a lot wrong with this movie but leaving the theater I was smiling and I left with a nice vibe,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4176324/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,This suffers Spider Man 3-idis,This movie isn t the worst superhero movie The CGI is the same as any other movie the roles are fine but it has Parallax This would have been fine with just Hector and Sinestro but it through in Parallax kind of like Spider Man 3 Sure some things are stupid and I m not a DC fanboy or Marvel hater but I don t think this is the worse Its not good I just think its just a run of the mill superhero movie,5.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3770794/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2023,Enjoyable,I do not know why this received such bad reviews after all it was based on a dc comic I have seen worse shows it is a pity that some people expect way too much from a movie that is based on a comic Ok there was quite a lot of special effects but again it was based on a comic not reality I would have liked to have had a follow up Ryan Reynolds was his usual entertaining self I loved the special effects and the characters They also had quite a good cast of actors Good entertainment for an afternoon Something to watch while chilling out don t forget the junk food Give it another try,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9009803/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,"Fun Entertainment, nothing more.",Green Lantern is a movie I ve been looking forward to for a long time and I am a really big fan of the comics Now that I have seen I thought it was a lot of fun but it has a lot of problems in script and with a couple characters With the script there are problems with some of the dialog and the way they could have done so much more with I have a problem with there characters in the story The first is Sinestro He isn t given anything to do here but make a few speeches and that was it Parallax one of the villains isn t very good because he looks like a big turd cloud I thought they shouldn t have made him a cloud it didn t work in Fantastic 4 and it doesn t work here And finally Hector Hammond He doesn t really need to even be in the movie He is basically a beacon for Parallax to come to Earth I love the actor Peter Sarsgaard but his performance in this movie is kinda hammy Having said that I thought Green Lantern is a very enjoyable movie with some great special effects good acting from Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively and Mark Strong and starts what could be a great trilogy,7.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2445473/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2021,I can see why the rates is a 5.5,To be the whole movie was boring that it made me tired But the last 50 minutes the movie was good because the fights to me was great and green lanten proves that humans is strong and will fear,6.0,0.0,0.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7671367/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2011,"Green Latern had the elements there, but missed with the script",While I enjoyed the Green Lantern there were definitely areas that were lacking I think the script was okay but could have been far better It was the ad libs that help save it Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan was endearing likable and yet strong and focused I found him believable in the character role He was smart funny charming powerful courageous and fearless Mark Strong as Sinestro was clearly the strongest actor in character He was excellent in the role He played a power hungry cold and steely character well Blake Lively was the weak link in the story and possibly because of the way it was written and possibly because of the way she interpreted her character She was dull boring and even her attempt to be a vamp failed I felt her character could have been completely cut from the story and it could have been strengthened It would have allowed an earlier entrance of the evil enemy and more interactions with Hal and Sinestro which was the best part of the film Was this the best super hero film of the summer No but I don t blame the acting other than Blake s which I thought was dull and boring It was ill paced and a poor script that hurt this film Did I find the film still worth a ticket to the theater Yes It still entertained which is ultimately the real purpose of a film,6.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2452712/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2019,Not Bad Not Great,I didn t think Green Lantern was as bad as everyone let on The CGI was ok but a little bit to cartoonish The story line could of been better Ryan did the best he could I say give it a go and don t take it to seriously and you might be pleasantly surprised,6.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4918558/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2011,shoulda used the black green lantern,yeah the black version of the green lantern is way cooler we need some diversification in the super hero movie spectrum most of the kids don t know that there are many green lanterns so the most recent one from the justice league cartoons who is black should have been used in the movie pretty sure it woulda sold more i think more kids of this generation would have gone to see it the guy who plays the lantern invthis movie just looks cheesy he doesn t even look tough and then this sets the justice league movie up to be an all white cast which is gonna cause the same poor box office sales that this movie had because of the green lantern not being black i guess theoretically the black green lantern could replace this one since the lanterns are chosen replaceable,0.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2460112/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2012,I liked this Green Latern movie despite the poor Rotten Tomatoes rating.,GREEN LATERN There are enough detailed reviews I just want to say that even the Rotten Tomatoes ratings can be wrong sometimes They gave a rating in the 20 range for Green Latern but I thought the movie was well done and I enjoyed it I didn t have any trouble accepting Ryan Reynolds as Green Latern and Green Latern was one of my favorite comic book characters when I was growing up I could have wished for more action and interaction with other fellow Green Laterns but the ones who were presented were so well done that each additional Green Latern character might have run the risk of presenting one not up to par with the others,8.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2546162/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2012,Green Lantern,Superhero films are growing more and more popular every day with the release of masterpieces like The Amazing Spider Man The Dark Knight Rises Avengers Assemble and more However I regret saying this but DC have disappointed me yet again with the release of their film Green Lantern many comparing it as being nearly as bad as Batman Robin Green Lantern lacks originality and follows all of the clich s of a standard superhero film When films lack story substance or style the audience usually looks to the action scenes and special effects to film the void however in Green Lantern it fails to execute a successful action sequence that fully engages the audience and leaves them on the edge of their seats,4.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2714773/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2015,"I'm sorry, fellas. The bakery's closed.",I d give the comic con hype a solid 10 10 The movie itself about 4 10 Comic cons have taught me one thing Don t judge the movie quality on the hype displayed by rabid fan boys during comic con Even if the actor recites the famous oath of the superhero The hype flop ratio is about the same as Wolverine Origins Interestingly enough Wolverine and Green Lantern both have Ryan Reynolds in there somewhere The movie is a generic cookie cutter superhero movie It starts with the origin of the villain and hero builds up some character development the the final battle against the villain The usual teaser at the end hints at a possible new villain 10 minutes into the movie and I thought this was the true sequel to Van Wilder Ryan Reynolds is the king of one liners Maybe I should have waited until after he did a few more movies before I saw Van Wilder Maybe they should have renamed it Van Lantern Green Wilder Blake Lively s performance was wonderful The chemistry between her and Van Lantern was believable Mark Strong played a strong Sinestro Peter Sarsgaard did an amazing job as the villain Not sure what happened when Martin Campbell went from Casino Royale to this,4.0,0.0,2.0,True,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3282246/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2016,Pretty good movie,All these reviews are saying it is really bad but it s actually a pretty good movie There is fighting the whole time and it s not like a marvel movie where the fighting doesn t start until the last half hour It is very time consuming and fun to watch It is a great movie for 10 or 12 year olds who are into sci fi and fantasy I thought this was going to be an awful move when my son wanted to watch it but I have to say I was impressed Don t listen to the other bad reviews The reason why I say it s pretty good is because some parts were not well written similar to Disney movies but that was only 3 or 4 scenes and I don t understand all the negative reviews,7.0,0.0,0.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3456862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2011,Wasted screen time!,Nothing personal against Taika Waititi but his screen time is a testament to how bad the screen play was for this film Its a waste of time There was so much opportunity for a true development of characters story arch rivalry anything of depth but instead the writers insisted on filling the screen with buddy banter and fan boy blather What this movie needed was less of Taika and Ryan chit chatting about b s and more time dealing with the demons that plague every good hero The pity is that there really is promise in this franchise the acting is solid for all the lead characters The FX were solid I was very impressed with Max Strong and Peter Sarsgaard and feel that if the next project does get green lit it ll need to be with a whole new writing team to put those excellent nemesis portrayals to good use,6.0,0.0,2.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2501126/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2018,Better than Most,Aside from the expected and less than attractive alien extras this superhero movie is pretty damned good The action is fun and suspenseful the origin story cleaves closely to the DC Canon without devoting the whole story to backstory and the villain Hector is somewhat sympathetic a sort of evil genius Elephant Man gone wrong The casting of supporting actors was in some ways too good Angela Basset is somewhat wasted in her role but who doesn t like to see her in any movie Mark Strong s makeup detracts a bit from his credible chops as a tough guy but there again the Canon rules in his depiction But the strongest part of the film is the character arc of Hal Jordan Whatever you may think of Reynold s acting he executes the character exactly as directed and stays within his limits Blake Lively too doesn t overact in a role that sometimes invites melodrama Finally the sometimes lighthearted nature of the movie is in stark contrast to some of the other depression inducing DC films like Batman and Superman are prone to Green Lantern is fun but not silly it is also serious in its treatment of Jordan s flawed character but doesn t try to turn a comic book hero into a tragedy a major mistake in the Batman series by Christopher Nolan,8.0,0.0,1.0,False,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4542330/?ref_=tt_urv
