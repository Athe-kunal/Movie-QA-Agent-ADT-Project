27 March 2022,"""remember the Fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot""","While the Visuals look dated, the Vibe is Very current. The parallels in this Version of reality is ominously similar to our own 2020. Viral disease, politicising Vaccines, at least this pulls the Veil on what a true fascist totalitarian regime is like along with government control media.

19 March 2006,A Bloody Masterpiece!,"I am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V for Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels on all three of them.

First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.

Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be nominated for an academy award.

Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.

Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time, an eternal classic.

16 November 2019,Among the best stuff you'll see from DC Comics.,"DC Comics has a rather poor reputation lately. Despite having some great superheroes, the films based on their characters often have sucked. However, one of the best and most worthwhile films based on their comics is WELL worth seeing...""V for Vendetta"".

The story is placed in a dystopian future. According to this future, the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And, the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos, the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.

The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero, V. V (Hugo Weaving) is determined to bring down the government and give the country back to the people. But how? And what part does Evey (Natalie Portman) play in all this? See the film.

This is a very exciting and intelligent film. It definitely kept my interest...much of it because the whole thing (aside from the near indestructable anti-hero) seemed possible! Well worth seeing and exceptionally well made.

By the way, if you like this film, try the 1960s Italian film ""Danger: Diabolik"". Both have very, very similar themes and both are wonderful movies.",9
15 November 2022,V for Vigilance at all Times...,"A masked messiah seeks to topple fascist rule, despotic government's so brutal and so cruel, all diversity has gone, being different is now wrong, poor Britannia is no longer calm and cool. The police have spies and cameras everywhere, their eyes and ears observe the wires, seize and snare, but disguises cause surprises, hero V knifes, Fawkes and prises, to derail those, that sit in the top chairs. Removing dread, concern and fear is the key, which V does tormentingly to friend Evey, enables her to have the power, as the clock counts down the hour, to raze a tomb that sets the shackled people free.

A fantastic piece of storytelling with outstanding performances all round.

11 February 2020,V,"Some of the action might be a bit choppy, but V for Vendetta is extremely entertaining. Its great visual effects and Hugo Weaving's iconic portrayal of ""V"" is more than enough to satisfy even the strictest of viewers. There is also a great message about rising up against political propaganda within its great style and environment. Another great film from the Wachowski's is now on your hands.

8 March 2006,Utterly Spectacular!,"I was a fan of the ""V for Vendetta"" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.

The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Closer"". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it's too late.

The Wachowski Brothers' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit ""The Matrix"". Unlike ""The Matrix"", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn't show off, and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.

With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another ""Matrix""-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in ""V"" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. ""V for Vendetta"" is a must-see.

12 August 2006,Ideas Are Bulletproof and One Man Can Make the Difference,"In a near future, a totalitarian state is ruling England. On November, 5th, a man self-calling V (Hugo Weaving) explodes a symbolic monument and starts fighting for freedom using terrorist technique. He also rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from the claws of the abusive secret police and later she becomes her allied. The man in charge of the investigation, Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea), discloses the truth about his leaders while chasing V.

""V for Vendetta"" is in my opinion the best action movie of the year. The story, about a totalitarian state that uses fear and terror to win the elections and dominate the population, inclusive forging terrorist attacks, is much updated. There are many excellent lines in this Orwellian story, but I would like to highlight the following ones: ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""; and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". The awesome Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" fits amazingly perfect to both scenes of explosion. ""V for Vendetta"" is not only a brilliant tale of revenge as the name suggests, but mostly a magnificent message and hymn of freedom. This is a movie that deserves to be watched many times as a lesson of freedom and citizenship. My vote is ten.

28 March 2006,Very powerful even if it makes Thatcherism look heavenly!,"'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.

The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.

Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.

I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up.",10
8 December 2020,"Remember, remember, V for Vendetta, the writing, character and plot, i know of no reason why this movie should ever be forgot!","First, I have to give credit and praise the team behind this film, for releasing a movie so politicly powerful and sharing a strong message how ""we"", as ""we"" the people living in our country shouldn't be afraid of our governments 4/5 years after 9/11 and during the massive political protests in many countries around the world.

It is sad to think that 15 years later in this rough, chaotic 2020, when I saw this movie for the first time, I realized that my countries government isn't far away of being like the government presented as a villain in a fictional, sci-fi, DC made film based on a graphic novel. Hope that in the future things will change for the better, but we should not stand low and keep on fighting.

The movies writing and characters have so much emotion, care and love put into them. The plot and the story are powerful, heartwarming yet entertaining. Action is well filmed and exciting. And the acting is just, WoW! Hugo Weaving kills it as V, and Natalie Portman's character Evie's growth through the story from beginning to end was so well done that id had me tearing up!

In my opinion, a MUST WATCH! Honestly my favorite DC movie ( yes, love it more than the Dark Knight ) and one of my top 5 favorite movies.

A perfect 10/10 from me.",10
14 December 2020,More relevant now than when it was made,"We haven't watched this movie before and it has been out for 15 years. It seemed a tad too cartoonish in the first few minutes so we gave up on it when we first tried to watch many years ago. I am glad we gave it another view tonight-it could be a movie about the events happening today and so very realistic it is frightening. It has a good storyline and the acting is well done. More importantly is the message it carries and we should all take that message seriously if we don't want to end up living in a country governed by martial law, fear and loss of freedom.

10 October 2020,An eerily prescient indictment on the trade between safety and freedom.,"It's a little weird watching a dystopian movie like V for Vendetta (2005) in 2020. I watched this film each year around the 5th of November, but life eventually got in the way and made it difficult to continue the tradition. At the time, I enjoyed the ""underdog"" of V (Hugo Weaving) protecting art and freedom of thought from the tyranny of an oppressive government. Having gone back and re-watched it in the current global climate, I'm honestly shocked at how prescient it was in predicting a lot of our future. Hopefully, things don't become worse to the point of completely fulfilling this prophecy.

I think part of the reason this film remains timeless-other than the flawless performances of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving-is how it shows the amount of freedom people in society give up in the name of ""safety."" Fear-mongering is a common political tactic to get individuals to vote for a particular party. All we have to do to be ""protected"" is to allow those in power to do what's in ""our best interests."" Except, rarely are the actions of leaders in the best interest of their constituents. After all, absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Fortunately, V for Vendetta provides a glimmer of explosive hope. Where tyranny is exposed, the one force that can stand up to it is the Populus's combined force. No political system is perfect, but the will of the people-if unified-can overcome great oppression. People die; ideas live forever. Now, whether or not our current global situation can garner enough unity to shatter this broken system without resorting to V's explosive measures is an exercise left up to the reader.

An eerily prescient indictment on the trade between safety and freedom, I give V for Vendetta 4.0 stars out of 5.",8
7 October 2013,Anonymous wants you,"V for Vendetta is an allegory. It is rather apparent the Wachowski Brothers wanted to make a critique of George W Bush's post 9/11 USA.

The vehicle they used was Alan Moore's graphic novel with the setting a futuristic and fascist Britain.

The film that inspired Anonymous. We have a masked anarchist voiced by Hugo Weaving exacting revenge on John Hurt's High Chancellor whilst trying to save Natalie Portman from the secret police. She later becomes an ally.

V for Vendetta deals with issues relating to a repressive state. Totalitarianism, homophobia, Islamophobia and terrorism. The film with its controversial themes has attracted both criticism and praise, although author of the graphic novel Alan Moore is unhappy with the adaptation.

The acting from the cast is excellent. Portman, Weaving, Rea, Hurt and especially Roger Allam all excel.

It's a brave and a cutting edge film packed with entertainment values and also thought inspiring. A real must see.",9

25 March 2006,This is one of the best films I have ever seen...,"...I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, and given the nature of my comment those retorts may very well be resoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right."" To the makers of this unique and wonderful film, I salute you.",10
20 May 2007,One of Those Rare Films to Really Earn a 10,"In the future, England is controlled by a fascist, 1984-esque government. One man, who calls himself V, has taken on the guise of Guy Fawkes and has made it his personal mission to destroy Parliament and get England to rise up. He befriends Evey (Natalie Portman), who sometimes sees his side and sometimes doesn't.

I've given out a handful of 10s. I think out of the nearly 500 reviews I've done, I've given out maybe 7 or 8 of them. I'm not quick to throw a 10 on something because of some whim, you really have to earn it. This film earns it in spades.

Natalie Portman is the perfect actress: obviously beautiful, but also a real actress. Some of the other casting considerations (such as Scarlett Johannsen) I just don't have as much confidence in. And Hugo Weaving, although never seen on the screen (at least not his face), made a great V. It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film, because unlike ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"", this is a winner. (And I liked ""From Hell"", even if Moore didn't.) I'm a little partial to this film. I love the musical themes, the alliteration. I love the anti-government, pro-populace message. I do own the graphic novel. But underneath all that, this film offers it all.

There's romance (and I mean actual romance, not just people screwing around on a gaming table). There's action, fighting and explosions. There's intense drama (I cried a few times, especially during the prison sequences). I suppose the humor might be lacking, but I hadn't really noticed because everything else is done in just the right amounts.

If you like Portman, like good dramas and action films, and are willing to suspend your disbelief for two hours (there are some things that might be just a small stretch of impossibility) this is a must-see. Already firmly planted on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250, I have no doubt it will stay there for a great many years.",10
9 March 2006,Riveting and Exciting.,"This marks the fantastic return of the Wachowski brothers.Those who were disappointed with their last two efforts will not be disappointed here,there is no doubt that the Brothers are talented.Here they make their comeback.But not as filmmakers,but as producers and writers.And to be honest ,this film thrills you from beginning to end.You'll be blown away with this adrenaline excitement and dramatically intense thriller.

A finely complex storyline about V, a reluctant freedom fighter , a rebellion who fights for freedom against the government in London in another time line.Set against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain,a mild-mannered young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by""V."" Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of combat and deception, V urges his fellow citizens to rise up against tyranny and oppression. As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.

This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.

This film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.

There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insane,but it's just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives.

Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.

V is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.

A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.

If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you.",8

14 February 2006,An amazing feat of Cinema,"""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.""

I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie. This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long after you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow.

22 November 2020,Frighteningly prophetic and blisteringly relevant,"It's remarkable how this film came to us before Brexit, before Trump and before the pandemic. Granted, it was borne out of disillusionment and rage over Bush and Blair's corrupt handling of domestic and foreign affairs back in the day and post-9/11 (hence the themes of Islamophobia). But with time the film has only become more topical than it was in 2006, when I was asleep and didn't even know of its existence. More than a decade later, I have finally now seen it and I am left wondering what lessons we as a people still have yet to learn about our governments and their descent into totalitarianism. There's no telling if it has predicted even more of our future. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone.

19 October 2021,It all starts with a pandemic...,"I saw it back in 2007 and the impression was positive, just a good dystopian movie, well made, well played, a little alarmist and filled with witty dialog and symbolism.

Fast forward to 2021 the movie becomes a reality in progress and it makes me wonder weather the creators were merely visionaries, or part of the elites that use misinformation and fear as a tool to shape the world into an open prison. While i cannot answer that question, the fact remains that what we see in this movie , we will get to live real soon, without the hero or rebellion of the masses, of course.

21 April 2022,"a Story of suppression, dictatorship and rebellion","What is freedom? What is vengeance? Who would resemble a nation's long-suppressed anger and hatred of their government?!

'V for Vendetta' tells the story of a fictional England which had been suppressed by its newly formed government after a long dark era of disease and war with the USA. The story is the resemblance of many countries under dictatorship and suppression which we have seen throughout history, and definitely will see again. Dictators ruling by suppressing free media, omitting the opposite voices, curfews, killings, and tortures are not unfamiliar to us nor will be. From the darkest corners of this England rises a light, a vigilante names himself V. Someone for me was very much like assassins in the assassin's creed series in the video game world. The story is great, thrilling, mysterious, and also dark and violent at the same time. The script, however a little different from the comics is unbelievably perfect. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are the shining stars of the cast. Other actors were really good too in their roles.

The soundtracks are really good and were composed beautifully in harmony with the scenes. Overall, 'V for vendetta' is a great movie that wasn't appreciated in its time. I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes dark drama.",9
26 April 2022,This is an underrated gem and one of the greatest comic book movies ever made,"V for Vendetta (2005) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline follows a tyrannical British Parliament that controls the news, societal television and rules the streets with tight curfews. A man emerges the government calls a terrorist but some believe he could be a hero to free the people. A young lady named Eve gets caught in the middle between her job at the television station and the efforts of the ""terrorist.""

This movie is directed by James McTeigue (The Raven) and stars Hugo Weaving (The Matrix), Natalie Portman (Leon: The Professional), Rupert Graves (Sherlock), Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), Stephen Fry (Gosford Park) and John Hurt (Alien).

This storyline is absolutely magnificent with intricate storylines, subplots and characters. The setting and circumstances are well presented and the action scenes and choreography are first rate. The costumes were excellent and the cinematography was beautiful. The acting is well done and the cast perfectly selected.

Overall this is an underrated gem and one of the greatest comic book movies ever made. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10

14 March 2022,"""Fear became the ultimate tool of this government""","V for Vendetta is a wonderful dystopian film. The film makes it's own world, and thus it's own identity. V's opening speech is nothing short of a masterpiece. The majority of his words begin with the letter V, and it's such good fun pausing the film ever second, and looking it up in the dictionary. It's such a shame that he didn't speak in this way for the rest of the film. The action sequences are decent, the tension builds up really well, the reveal of V's identity is really well written, and just generally it's a solid film.

However, the film wasted too much time with Natalie Portman and V's relationship. Out of all the aspects of the film they could have focused on, this was the least entertaining. It could be argued however, that this focus was due to the idea that their love was interesting, as Natalie Portman didn't need to know V's identity to love him, and instead she was in love with his world view.

All in all, V for Vendetta is a very good film. It's certainly not the greatest film of all time, but it's well worth a watch.",9

13 March 2006,OMG! Absolutely Amazing,"OK, I only went to see this because of the Wachowski brothers involvement. I went totally expecting to hate this movie about a terrorist but it was so much more. I'm amazed to say that it's AWESOME! While not an action picture there's plenty of action and at least one funny homage to The Matrix. You've gotta see it. It's very inspiring, believe it or not and it didn't make me want to blow up buildings either. It just made me appreciate freedom even more. Hugo Weaving is terrific and Natalie Portman leaves Princess Amadala far behind with her performance as Evey. Everyone's great. Stephen Rea is terrific too. I just can't believe I liked this movie. I'm still in shock.

6 November 2006,O is for Oklahoma,"V for Vendetta: 6 out of 10: Ah the law of unintended consequences. You seek to adapt a 1982 graphic novel about Thatcherism and convert it to a too clever by half attack on the Bush administration and the war on Terror and you end up with a love sonnet to Timothy McVeigh. Uh-oh.

V is Timothy McVeigh from the fertilizer bombs to the horrible Waco style fire flashbacks it is of all people McVeigh behind that mask. (In reality Guy Fawkes and McVeigh shared a similar philosophy. The only difference being Fawkes is famous for failing.) Now obviously the filmmakers were to busy ripping off 1984 and Phantom of the Opera to notice this. The film itself is actually quite entertaining in a mindless sort of way. The script is full of self-referential pseudo intellectual quotes and all the cute little British people say things like bullocks. (I have never actually heard an Englishman say bullocks anywhere besides an album cover. It's interesting to note that the British press hated this film with a passion unmatched by any in recent history. I guess they aren't as pro bombing of Government buildings as Americans are.)

The films bad guys are all evil mustache twitching, child raping psychopaths while the good guys are all innocent liberals. The idea mind you that the people will automatically rise up and support the bomber against the big bad government is a fantasy right up with we will be greeted as liberators and Jodie Foster will love me if I shoot the President. Needless to say nuance doesn't enter into the picture.

Which is a shame because the movie had a good chance to really make a statement had it been willing to go off the rails a little bit (pun intended) and put some shading on these characters. In all fairness to the filmmakers Timothy McVeigh was also a pretty one sided character. The only difference is where I come from he is the bad guy.",6

15 April 2018,Most Captivating Comic Book Adapatation I've Seen,"After being told over and over again from friends to watch this film, I finally got to it. Despite it being overhyped by them, I still found myself captivated by V For Vendetta. There was something brilliant about seeing our ""hero"" at face value just like every other character along the way. There was no Batman/Bryce Wayne, there was only V and because of that it made him more of a myth and much more intriguing for what he stood for.

Vengence is in the title, but it so much more than that with a deeper meaning that rivals some of the best in Hollywood. I found myself reading more into the ""idea"" V represented. Now one of my favorite Comic Book Films.

26 August 2006,five'll get you ten,"When ""V for Vendetta"" came out, maybe reviews called it the first pro-terrorist movie of the post-9/11 world. And seeing what kind of society the movie portrays, it's hard not to sympathize with the terrorist (or is he a freedom fighter?).

The movie portrays an arch-totalitarian England sometime in the future. Because of the wars waged by the United States, the whole world exploded into war, the US got reduced to a third world country, and the fascistic Adam Sutler (John Hurt) seized power in England. Imposing devout Christianity on everyone, he rules with the slogan ""England prevails!"".

However, Sutler's days just might be numbered. A masked man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) seeks to overthrow this dictator on November 5, to commemorate Guy Fawkes trying to blow up parliament. V had gotten disfigured some years earlier from an explosion in a chemical plant where he was a test subject, and thus wears this mask.

One night, V rescues young Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from Sutler's thugs, and slowly but surely draws her into his world of rebellion. As it is, Evey has a reason to go along with V: her parents were political activists murdered by Sutler's forces. So what will this all come down to? I must say that this movie really draws you in. While uneasy about supporting terrorist activity, one realizes that there's no alternative. Naturally, that brings up the issue of the current state of the world. Is Sutler Bush, we may ask. (No, Sutler actually has a brain.) I think that my favorite line in the movie is ""We report the news, not fabricate it. That's the government's job."" All in all, this gives movies based on graphic novels a really good name. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Also starring Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and Tim Pigott-Smith.",10

5 May 2013,"Ahead of its time, but set in the wrong country IMHO","The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in ""1984"" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in ""The Crying Game"" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood in the 21st century.

The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.

I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read ""While Europe Slept"" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.

Instead, this film looks more and more like a futuristic vision of the U.S., and not even that futuristic. I can easily see a theocratic fascist regime set up in the United States, citizens hassled endlessly by security forces over minor infractions of countless rules, and Americans just sitting back and taking it. Europeans would be more likely to protest under these circumstances than Americans, in particular if you could convince large numbers of them that it was ""God's will"" or it was for the sake of ""national security"". Mix Calvinism with an extreme form of nationalism and you've got a recipe for exactly what happens in this film. In the U.S. we have plenty of both.",8
13 March 2022,Very good,"Very good movie with a great storyline, great direction and really really good acting. In general the film is entertaining and keeps a good pace for most of its duration, too bad for some parts that are a bit slow but pass well looking in general at the whole complex.

24 March 2008,"Some movies are arguably overrated, but this is just pathetic...","If this had been a children's-movie rated by children getting the 8.3 it got, I would have understood. But grown-up boys and girls surely have better things to do with their time than to overhype this celebration of averageness into the top 250 of this website.

The grown up boys 'n gals haven't rated a movie, they have rated subject-matter as it would appear. I guess that showing some concentration camp imagery, an evil Hitler-like character (a grumpy old man version of an Adolf anyway) and rehashing '1984' is enough these days to make something profound.

I mean, why else would a movie which has obvious pacing-flaws, a script so full of nonsensical alliteration that it would even make a Vogon gnaw off his own ears, anything but a lavish plot, a pedestrian view on politics and an agonizingly bad performance by one of its leads (Nat Portman (God bless her soul and looks) couldn't act her way out of a high-school drama even if she tried it without a fake foreign accent.) be regarded so highly?

Watching this borefest, my eyelids cramped from fighting gravity. I won't get into all the complaints I have with this talky and plodding twaddle, it has all been pointed out by other reviewers in the 'hated-it' section. These are just my two cents to warn anyone with an education about the incredibly inflated polling-numbers for this cringeworthy exercise in film-making, scripting, casting etc. It certainly isn't thé worst movie ever made, but it's average rating shouldn't be higher than a 5.5 and not a decimal more.",1
9 January 2022,Ideas are bulletproof,"One of the best movies I've ever watched and that is so underrated.

26 February 2006,Truly Unique,"There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.

The acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of this film all lead me to believe that it will likely receive a cult following. It is only my hope that the message of this film will come to summarize the history of our future ascendancy to true liberty.

Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. In the meantime, go see this movie.",9

6 November 2021,"Remember remember, V for Vendetta...","This film is so much more than a comic book film related to Guy Fawkes. Its intricacies regarding politics, morality, sense of self and what it wholly represents; liberation.

V for Vendetta shares a relationship with anarchy, shown through V's belief in the absence of government. The film depicts a corrupt and totalitarian government in which V aims to destroy.

The symbolism behind the mask is one of utmost genius! V strives for anarchy and freedom and therefore a disbelief in hierarchy. The mask is a perfect representation of this as it implies unity. As the identity of V is never revealed, we understand that the identity is not of importance, the sole importance is the message behind the mask - and the message the mask seeks to tell... We are also invited to observe Evey and V's ever-blossoming relationship, with V's eventual admission of his love for her. It seems strange to fall in love with an onscreen couple where one partner remains masked and unknown, but the way their relationship is built upon yearns for me to have a complete adoration for their deeply personable and honest chemistry.

It matters not what is behind the mask, V's identity lies within his actions.

Every year I watch this film and every year I love it a little more.

Remember remember V for Vendetta...

""Evey, please. There is a face beneath this mask but it's not me. I'm no more that face than I am the muscles beneath it or the bones beneath them."" - V

""He was Edmond Dantés... and he was my father. And my mother... my brother... my friend. He was you... and me. He was all of us."" - Evey.",10

If there is one flaw I can find is that it's a tiny bit long and slow during some parts, but other than that it's one of my favourites.

You have civil war closing on US. You literally have a whole package of 2020-2021 and it feels as if it was filmed yesterday. People can only dream of blowing up parliament.

14 May 2023,Powerful stuff,"It seems more remarkable than ever that V for Vendetta was made in 2005. A visionary film - much of what V foresees in the UK has, by 2023 become reality.

A cynical, repressive and hysterical regime has England in its grip. Lying, fact-changing and manipulation are some of its weapons and the people go along with it as they know no different.

One man: ""V"", wants to make difference, right the wrongs.

V for Vendetta is powerful stuff. Great script, strong imagery, good acting. The story flows with some high-octane moments.

Although we don't see him - Hugo Weaving is behind that mask and he's excellent. Portman also excellent. Stephen Fry - good cameo. All in all - V for Vendetta is well worth seeing. Dark, good vs bad - it's all here.",9
4 August 2006,More than just a movie; an iconic statement.,"Just like the main character itself, this movie is an icon, for fighting for freedom and liberty in the widest sense of the word.

The movie is multiple layered, filled with symbolism and deeper meanings but with one clear main message in it; People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. It shows that if enough people are behind something, things can be achieved. Even killing and acts of terrorism can be justified. As the character V's says it; A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world.

The movie shows obvious interesting parallels to western leaders and governments but also that of the middle east and beyond. The parallels to the Hitler Nazi period were perhaps a bit too extreme and over-the-top to find it credible but in this case I can forgive the movie for that, since it still makes its point clear and works powerful as a thought provoking movie. For this movie truly is one of the most thought provoking movie of the last couple of decades. The movie forces us to use our minds constantly and makes us see how certain acts of violence can be used for the good cause and how symbolism and one act can inspire people for coming into action and to doing the right thing. Leaders shouldn't just be able to get away with everything they do.

Almost every aspect of the word freedom is present in the movie. Some in a symbolic way, others in a more obvious way. Such as freedom of speech and censorship in the media, freedom of religion (some people see this movie is anti-Christian, quite frankly I really don't see why) and freedom of being able to chose your own sexuality and being able to do what ever makes you feel good and happy. The movie also shows interesting parallels with recent issues and issues from the past, from all over the world, such as the earlier mentioned censorship in the media, which still is the case in certain middle eastern and communist countries, the ex scandals in churches but also the use of violence and terrorism against a governments their own citizens, to control and and form the people. It's refueling the conspiracy theories that the American government itself was behind the 9/11 attacks, to put fear into the people so the government was more able to do the things their way and gain from it, by getting the people behind them and exploiting from the people's their fear. But also less recent issues such as performing medical tests on prisoners, in order to create a super-race and more Nazi like references. In other words, more than enough interesting parallels to make you think about the world we're living in today.

What ""V for Vendetta"" also does well is mixing action entertainment with thought provoking, almost poetic like elements. In the essence the movie is still an action movie that is fast paced and has a fair amount of violence and fight sequences in it. The action sequences are shot spectacular and form some of the highlights of the movie. But of course ""V for Vendetta"" is far from your average 'superhero' movie, it's a too important and relevant movie for that.

The characters are also symbolic. Of course the character of V is the best example of this. Behind the mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea and ideas are bulletproof. I quote V a lot, since everything he says in this movie is true, even when your initial thought might suggest otherwise. Evey is a character who begins as a normal person but slowly starts to becoming just a fearless, determent freedom fighter as V is. Inspector Finch is a normal cop who start to discover and see through the lies that his government, for which he works, spreads and he slowly begins to see the whole picture and V's true intentions. And Chancellor Adam Sutler is symbolic for basically every dictator that ever lived and ruled.

The movie is a very good looking one. The cinematography by Adrian Biddle is truly spectacular and this movie was a worthy last picture for him. The special effects are also what makes this movie a really spectacular one.

The acting is also of a very high order. Hugo Weaving is great, even though he wears a mask during the entire movie. He acts through his mask and manages to give the character an own personality, complete with working and sensible emotions in certain sequences. Natalie Portman is also great but it sort of makes you wonder why she was cast in this, since she isn't British. Her accent just doesn't sound right but I have to admit that she never looked any better in a movie. She is absolutely beautiful. It was also great to see Stephen Rea in a big production again. John Hurt convincingly plays the villainous dictator. Is there any role that John Hurt can't handle? He is a very versatile actors that has already played a wide range of different characters. Really amazing.

But as a movie it is a rather flawed one to be perfectly honest. The story doesn't always flow and the character development and treatment is also lacking at times. It's obvious that James McTeigue still has a lot to learn when it comes to directing. But it however doesn't take away any of the movie its power or messages. The movie succeeds in what it tries to achieve and because of that I consider this movie as an absolute and important relevant masterpiece.

See this movie for its action or its messages. Either way you'll be pleased.

28 February 2007,Pitiful piece of film making,"Wow I wish I had seen the same film that the people who gave this an average of 8.3/10 and put it in the top 250 films. I tried to keep an open mind as I sat through the worse action scenes I'd ever seen. I tried to find some redeeming qualities for the poor actors, I like Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, who had to spit out the worse duologue I've heard in years. The Brothers Wachowski must have still been taking their psychedelic drugs, you know the ones they were on when they made the second and third Matrix films. This movie suffers from the same types of issues as Aeon Flux, no story or a poorly told story. Even a bad story can be made good by a storyteller who knows how to pull out all of the best elements. Too bad 1/10

30 October 2019,There is still hope for humanity,"The protagonist of this movie can be considered an antihero, hidden behind a mask, but very different from characters like Batman or Superman. Although he wants revenge and he shows no pity for those men who destroied his life and made many people suffer, he is also a romantic hero full of dreams and hopes for humanity. He believes in a new better world and he is ready to die for it. The character is inspired to Edmond Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo. It is a very good movie, deep and full of quotes.

30 October 2021,The mask hides the truth,"March 1982, I bought that first edition of 'The Warrior' from a local shop in south London.

This was the first time that I encountered the genius that is Alan Moore.

Enraged by Thatcher's destruction of the status quo, and high handed approach, he wrote V. The grainy black and white strip belied the complexity of the wordsmithery. There is pure venom in the script.

I kind of wish that this movie was in grainy black and white, so that I could once more experience the explosive effect that comic had on me.

Moore went on to write wonderful strips, like Watchmen and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen that played with and remade the format for a grown up late century audience.

But V is where it all starts.",10
25 July 2022,"A very, vivacious, vernacular movie","Words cannot describe how much of a performance Hugo Weaving put on. This might be the highlight of his career. The film brilliantly explores the darker side of what happens when a government is ruled by one party alone that controls everything. It makes me think of today's world. The dialogue in this film is one of the best in cinema. It remains faithful to the story and it's a good watch for a November 5th.

10 September 2006,"Visually impressive, but surprisingly shallow","An alternate futuristic vision of England has the country being run by a ruthless totalitarian government who will stop at nothing to remain to in power. People live in fear and are remarkably passive as a result, save for one masked freedom fighter known as V who fights with cunning and cleverness to rally the people of England to end the dictatorship.

Visually this film is quite a stunner. No excessive computer effects, but nonetheless the sets and cinematography are first rate and do a great job and creating a dark world. Also there are many visual symbols as well as creative uses of words that start with 'V.' Added on top of solid acting and direction. For such a faceless performance, Hugo Weaving (who's behind a mask the whole time) plays very well at conveying the character V. However that's the movie version of V, the one in the source graphic novel is quite different.

The problem is the film's message and it is ridiculously shallow - ""facism is bad."" That is really it. For a such a lengthy and well produced film it is a real shame, though not much a surprise, that the attention was on the visual, but the metaphorical and philosophical are hardly attended to. There is a lot of dialog and room for for what could have been interesting thoughts of characters reflecting on their world, but it ends up being just routine. For instance when Finch is discussing with his partner the possibility of a government conspiracy they do nothing, but state the obvious - is it worth going against such a powerful government, are we afraid to, and so on. Nothing really that hasn't been done before in countless other stories.

Added to the fact that the film ends in an amazingly dull and ridiculously cliché big explosion. It makes sense as you watch the film, but that doesn't mean that it is interesting. How much more interesting would it be when the shadowy freedom fighter V would think of a way to topple the government by not using methods that it uses against it's own people? The film just ends up being almost a more mature version of the Star Wars story - eventually the good triumphs over the evil with a big bang. Star Wars had the Death Star and here we have several buildings in London. So it is good, but retreading on old ground with nothing new to present has never scored a film big points. 7/10

Rated R for violence",7
9 August 2006,Entertaining and intelligent,"V for Vendetta is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Alan Moore. While V can be seen as an action film, it's much more. Although set in Britain, and originally conceived and written by a British artist, this film seems designed to speak to American political sensibilities. V probes the purpose of government and brings up themes which contemporary Americans seem to have forgotten - the basic concepts of the separation of church and state, government by and for the people, the right to overthrow leaders who exercise their own will at the expense of the nation. V reminds us of our duty to resist and rebel against megalomania and totalitarianism. Though grown in England, and tapped into English history, the message applies everywhere and to everybody, but seems especially appropriate for those of us living with the Bush administration and fearful of its legacy.

Natalie Portman plays a young woman who is afraid of her own shadow. Out after curfew one night, she is approached by a pair of ruffians and rescued by the verbose, masked V (Weaving). V is a man who has lost his identity as a result of events in his past which are mysteriously connected to the fascistic government (presided over by John Hurt). He draws his identity out of a relatively obscure event in British history, an attempt to blow up parliament, and dons a mask which is a caricature of the leader of this gunpowder revolution.

The plot and characterizations are complex, with adequate but not overbearing back-story. The script is occasionally goofy but excellent - retaining many elements of the comic medium without losing any credibility. The acting is simply wonderful. Natalie Portman is phenomenal. Weaving carries a difficult role very nicely, giving powerful humanity to a man who remains shrouded in mystery. Stephen Rea and John Hurt - always great - both lend strong support. The cinematography is very good and fits the story nicely.

Since this film involved the Wachowski's many have seen fit to compare it to the Matrix. Although there are some similarities, I think the comparison is unfair to both films. V is a much less subtle and, in a purely practical political way, a more intelligent and less playful film. It is also less cinematographically innovative and less reliant on scope. Where The Matrix unfolded in the playground of ontology, V is firmly situated in the gladiatorial arena of social psychology. Besides, V was directed by James McTeigue, not the Wachowskis.

Even if you don't get it from a political point of view, you are very likely to enjoy this film. I recommend it to all free-thinking individuals who have not lost hope for humanity.",9
28 August 2009,"V for Vendetta, D for Disappointing","Morally aggravating and cinematically direction-less and pretty dull, V for Vendetta strikes me as yet another over rated Hollywood picture which may seem to have something going for it but ultimately does not

Set in a totalitarian future in England, (a vision pioneered by legend author George Orwell), the story follows a strange masked individual who dresses like Guy Faukes and is planning a conspiracy to over throw the government. The only person with whom he shares his secrets is a pretty young lady who he rescues from thugs one night and he brings her to his lair. both their lives are suddenly taking a strange turn as mutual feelings for each other start to emerge.

Pop culture tends to like stories which attack power, authority or religion, but this one is a bit absurd. It praises one of England's biggest traitors. Guy Faukes was caught trying to blow up the parliament buildings in 1605. This is not however what bothers me most about the film. the real problem is the writing. With the exception of a few moderately neat scenes, most of the film boring, with not much plot progression, and the script includes a lot of silly and pretentious lines which sound clever but arn't. A good example comes after our hero survives a round of gunfire, he says to one of his attackers 'Behind this mask there is an idea, and an idea is bulletproof'.

Whatever else V for Vendetta has to offer isn't worth your time. Some bits of charm and wit shine through here and there, but all I really saw was a barren film.",5

1 October 2008,"Cute rip-off Orwell's 1984, but seriously, come on now. In the top 250 movies ever made? Excuse me as I laugh.","I can't point to a single film by the Wachowski brothers that wasn't cheesy, over-hyped, unoriginal, and just downright pathetic. I guess the first Matrix film was alright, but that's the closest they have ever gotten to deserving even half the acclaim they get from mindless ""fine cinema""-whores. Or, in other words, ""People who do not have the ability to disagree with the critics, because they have no brain to make their own judgments."" If they critics call it original and daring, they call it original and daring, even though they've seen a hundred other movies just like it. That is the only reasonable explanation I can see for the mass love for this film.

Here are my ABCs of V for Vendetta: A for Annoying. The directing and camera-work are so bland and typical I felt like I was watching a children's TV show. The two main leads are okay acting, but every single secondary character, EVERY single one, are so bad at acting I occasionally had to pause the movie so I could stop and laugh. And I'm not someone who usually cares about bad actingthis was just terrible. What also annoyed me was the level of pure cheese the movie carries and sustains. Gunshots don't bleed, typical stabbings are off-screen, and even some fistfights are off screen. It just added to the children's TV show feel the directing and acting started. How did this movie get and R-rating? I've seen PG-13 movies (like Cloverfeild and The Dark Knight) that have more violence/blood than V for Vendetta. The MPAA puts this on the same level as Saw III and Hostel: Part II? Dear God, our rating system is so screwed up it's not even funny. V for Vendetta did not deserve and R-rating by any means, and I think they honestly slipped the MPAA a little cash to rate it such.

B for Boring. Just so anyone out there who hasn't seen this yet knows: this is not an action movie. If anything, V for Vendetta is a political drama. There are maybe two main action sequences that last about five minutes each, and the rest of the runtime is old men rambling about terrorists. The plot is no more complex than you're standard, cliché James Bond plot: terrorist appears, and old men with guns talk about him for the majority of the movie, then in the last ten minutes when the ""climax"" starts they finally stop talking about the terrorist and try to do something. In V for Vendetta, when I say the majority, probably 95%, of the movie is nothing but repeated dialogue, I mean it literally. If you were to fast-forward through all the all talking scenes, you'd still understand the plot because it's so generic. You'd also have a fifteen-minute long movie.

C for Cliché. As I said, the plot is a rip-off of the books that ripped-off 1984. Giant speakers, evil dictator, TVs used to make mass announcements, people have no freedom . . . blah, cliché, blah, blah. V leaves a rose after he kills, just like every cliché ""sentimental"" killer in movie history. The reason he wears a mask and why he seeks vengeance is also the biggest cliché in movie killer history. Also, the ""government lies"" jokes were so cliché and annoying I was about to turn it off. As if we haven't heard a thousand times that the government is evil! The movie doesn't even give the audience credit for having basic intelligence of political issues. I cannot name a single aspect of this movie that was original, or even close. The entire movie is the biggest cliché ever.

Overall, V for vendetta is a waste of time. It is just a boring drama with a cliché ""moral"" that we've heard all our lives. Sure, V himself is cool for a few minutes, but when you realize the knives he carries are just a sales gimmick because there is less action than you could see walking down the street, just know I told you so.

18 March 2006,Never Mind The B*ll*cks,"It's difficult to see who exactly James McTeigue's 'V For Vendetta' is aimed at. Even given that Alan Moore's complex tale has been stripped to the bone (perhaps inevitably, as otherwise we'd be looking a looong film), it's far too wordy for most action-movie audiences  and, by the same reckoning, too violent for more thoughtful patrons. There are allusions to 'America's War' in the near-past, and of how religious fundamentalism and intolerance have come to shape the dystopia represented, but these connections are astonishingly heavy handed and unsubtle. This, plus the Wachowski Brothers fondness for cod-philosophising reduces Moore's incisive wit into something more blunt and unsubtle. That said, there are a few genuinely interesting comments made about the nature of terrorism which I'm surprised survived into the final script. No wonder the Daily Mail hated it.

The biggest problem is the main character, the man known as V. In the comic book world (where masks are the norm) V's blank, unchanging gaze adds to his mystery. Here, though, his only expression is vocal, a great limitation of the talents of Hugo Weaving.

A Prologue  intended, quite clearly, for American consumption  explains a little of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot to destroy Parliament. To some extent I can see why this is done, as very few Yanks will have heard of Fawkes, and may wonder why our hero, V, dresses in the style of this historical character. This introduction sets the plotter up as an idealist, a crusader against injustice, which taps into part of what our hero is supposed to represent  the Freedom Fighter. It's a simplistic interpretation which does rather defeat the essential message of Moore's character and book. Fawkes wanted a new order, yes, but he fought on behalf of an authority no more democratic or tolerant than the one he sought to destroy. He also wanted vengeance on those  the Protestant King James, especially  whom he felt has persecuted his Catholic brethren. The bulk of the population considered him a terrorist  which is why his defeat is celebrated each November 5th. Moore's character is complex  recognising that Idealism, Terrorism and Vengeance are all part of the same destructive impulse. In the graphic novel V quotes, on occasion, from the Rolling Stones' 'Sympathy For The Devil', which is the best indicator of what the character represents  his own personal vendetta aside, he's an Anarchist, a catalyst for sudden and bloody change.

V's 'origins' are hinted at, but by depriving us of the detail of the original source material he becomes more human, more the 'wronged man'  and, again, I can see why this was done, as audiences are expected to empathise with their hero  but it does make what he is (as opposed to who he is) less frightening. And V should be frightening. Another attempt to humanise V  the hint of romantic feeling between him and Natalie Portman's Evey  completely misfires.

There are a few equally misjudged comic moments, the worst of which  a grimace-inducing 'Benny Hill' skit (more trademarked 'British' humour for the Yanks), but there are a few changes that actually work. Stephen Fry's Dietrich is virtually unrecognisable as the character from Moore's book, Dascombe, upon which it is based  but does, as a gay man masking a liberal outlook within a totalitarian regime, serve as a potent all-too-human counterpoint to our mask-wearing 'hero'. Portman's Evey is also a million miles removed from her source-character, but her screen persona is less successful than Fry's  a shame, as she could have probably made interesting work of that more ordinary, desperate Evey. For all the many changes I'm glad to say that the touching Valerie sub-plot survives intact.

Tim Piggot-Smith enjoys a fine return thuggish form, and John Hurt overacts his wrinkly little head off as the Chancellor. Steven Rea is excellent as the dogged, sad detective Finch  probably the most loyal transfer of character from page to screen.

Visually it has it's moments, and it is very stylish  as one would expect from the Wachowski Bros and Joel Silver - but very few of them are truly cinematic  save, perhaps, for the final Tchaikovsky accompanied scenes of Parliament, which was genuinely impressive.

I was prepared to hate this film with a fiery passion, but didn't. It wasn't  to use what the scriptwriters seem to think is the only British expletive  'b*ll*cks', but it has no real excuse for not being considerably better, given that so many of the plot changes were so unnecessary. It's the best adaptation, thus far, of any Alan Moore subject  though given how bad 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'From Hell' were, that's not saying much. That said, it is seriously flawed, and most of those flaws arise out of a basic misunderstanding of the nature of the central character.",5
14 April 2006,Eye for Itself,"Sometimes the world throws a snowball so perfectly it both amazes and depresses me.

Imagine a story of an extreme threat, delivered through the visual media, with all sorts of personal triumphs woven into it. Suppose you gather groups of people by the millions to overtly support your enterprise, wrapped in gloss and foreshadowing. Suppose you decide to make it humorless and obvious; and to make it whole and logical not because it is those things but because your confidence makes its seem so.

Well, you'd have what this film has built itself against. But you'd also have what this film is.

Will we never learn? Do the brothers suppose they aren't paving the way for simplistic munchkin politics? If you want a subversive film, go to Greenaway.

Yet, I can admire how this thing is put together. It is highly cinematic visually even though most of the thing is talking. But even that is tricky because the talker is behind a mask, so we largely invent the images in our own minds, prompted from time to time with inserted visions.

The first half is the Count of Agatha Cristie, where we are presented with an old fashioned detective story except presented from the criminal's perspective. Serial killings are ticked off and we want to know why. Though we follow the killer, our inquiries are handled by the on screen detective.

This is followed by an ""Oldboy"" segment, a radical shift, perhaps equally well done. And then we shift into ""Irreversible"" mode as we slide into the sappy movieland happy ending. Fireworks.

Along the way, we are pounded with self-reference to video media: our heroine and her pal work in TeeVee. The central Valerie character is a filmmaker who incidentally creates the film we are watching indirectly by writing it on toilet paper and passing it as if behind a mask.

Our hero is motivated by a certain old movie. Until the very end, we only see our political nemesis on a huge video screen, as his millions of victims do.

This IS worth watching, but only for the way it is constructed. Generate your political philosophies the old fashioned way, okay?

24 August 2022,Outstanding On All Accounts,"Combining super-heroism with a dystopian future, V For Vendetta is a truly outstanding film.

The script and dialogue come from excellent source material, and this is brilliantly presented on screen. Intelligent, vicious and witty, the scripts are masterful, and the storytelling reveals the next stage of the plot at the perfect times. The plot is so good and it is a relief that such depth is able to be kept within the confines of film.

Performances are superb across the board. Weaving conducts himself beautifully and is brilliant whilst being so limited by being behind a mask. Facial expressions are removed from view but his execution of the dialogue bring that emotion to life. Hurt is fantastic and the perfect casting for the 'Big Brother'-esqe tyrant, showing he can do both sides of the 1984 story. Portman is wonderful throughout and portrays such emotion in her characters development, expressing a great range. The supporting cast all play their parts well, particularly the villains.

Excellent choreography and visually stunning, there are many memorable images throughout the film. The costuming and settings do the graphic novel justice and support the movement of the story.

8 March 2023,Amazingly clever,"I see tons of reviews going over one version of the movie that is fluttered in front of the audience like a bull fighter would do with a piece of red cloth all while hiding his true weapon. Shockingly this is not (only) about a fight against tyranny. It is about relinquishing your freedom on an artificial fear. Fear fabricated, fanned via media, profitable, and in the end generating the tyranny. It is funny, as the movie is 15 years ahead of time. Alas, for its true story the audience needs to pay attention, let aside the so easy to see and follow surface. For me, even at its time, this was a masterpiece. On par with so many gems hidden in other movies that will masquerade as action movies just to have again a hidden clever side (Winter Soldier..)

4 April 2006,P for Pathetic,"Comical, overblown, poorly written and a delicate subject given the 'Hollywood treatment'; all of these can be used to describe 'V for Vendetta'. The film kicks off far too early with the evilness surrounding the state thrown at our faces in a very sudden fashion. We aren't given any build up to Portman's character, nor to that of 'V' and as a result, it takes a lot longer for us to 'get to know' them as the film goes on. This twinned with the fact that when we should have been properly introduced, we're given a brief and rather ugly introduction to Guy Fawkes and the history surrounding him, obviously one for the Americans as anyone who has been to a November the 5th BBQ or fireworks party really doesn't need this sort of beginning, in fact the film would've benefited from more of a build up involving the corruption in the state and the past trauma's surrounding the main characters. As a result, we see this later on in the film  at the wrong time, emphasising the evidence that the film was written badly.

The initial incident of V and Evey meeting each other happens far too early on and the relationship between them dies a quick death between them meeting for the first and second times. The gap is just far too long. This is very disorientating as from then on, they are inseparable. Another example of the poor writing is where a 'mock' television programme episode is created by one of the characters. Clearly a suicidal act within the film world and a huge question mark is raised as to how much the writers really 'knew' their characters. 'Would he have really done that?' From this act of the mock TV programme being shown, the film twists down another road as this stupid, suicidal act propels the film forward and spawns a few extra events. I'm not giving too much away but there's a death, a kidnapping and a mini-twist within the narrative, all creating the ILLUSION of good film making and although it's directed well, the fact is that it should never have happened in the first place(!) The writers clearly ran out of ideas and realised the dead end they were heading down before coming up with this narrative revelation.

Another flaw in the writing is the dialogue. This is a very American film and was clearly written by the Americans, FOR the Americans. The script is clearly lacking in research as the British stereo-types flow out of here like water out of a power shower: thick and fast. Another thing is that English people don't say 'bollocks' in every other sentence when faced with an awkward/life threatening situation, they swear like every other person in the world and if you're writing for a 12-17 year old audience whilst at the same time keeping in the violence shown towards the end and of course, the element of terrorism which is obviously present then shame on you for not getting your priorities right. Yet again, an example of terrible writing and not any where near to what I expected from the Wachowski Brothers. The laughable monologue at the beginning of the film which used as many words as possible that begin with the letter 'V' was ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It was an obvious hint to what was to come.

I think the people who REALLY like this film are suffering, in some way, from some sort of brain washing. I think they've realised the Wachowski Brothers are involved, they've realised it's a comic book outing, which most people enjoy given success of films like Underworld, X-Men and Spider Man in recent years, they've realised that it's got a big cast and they've realised it's dealing with current affairs in the form of terrorism. Everything seems so perfect, when really it's very far from it.

What has happened here is the makers have cleverly set it away from America and in the pretty distant future, thus thinking that they have a bit of a license to overcook certain things and audiences have lapped up the fantasy. Little annoying things such as the fact V's face has the same expression on it over and over due to the mask he wears. This makes it very difficult to relate to the main character as we never even see him and I found it very difficult to motivate myself to even care for him. The poor casting of Stephen Fry, who emphasised the stereo typing with the accent and attitude of his character and the annoying invincibility that V seemed to have throughout the film. Things like this drag the film further down.

This wasn't spectacular in the cinema and will look even worse when it comes to the small screen.

One last thing is that 'Remember, remember the 5th of November' has got to be one of THE most annoying taglines in film history.",5

27 March 2006,V for Vacuous,"*** CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS ***

Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta is an elegant, thought-provoking and complex exploration of the meaning of freedom and the politics of protest. The Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue have somehow reduced this to a film that pretty much says 'Whoa, dude! Terrorists ROCK!!!111!'

It's hard to imagine how anyone who is a fan of the book could have produced this film. The novel is clever where the film is dumb, engaging where the film is boring, and subtle where the film simply blows stuff up. Where Moore's V is erudite and sophisticated, the best McTeigue's V can manage is a big speech of words mostly beginning with the letter 'V'.

Principally to blame for this must be the screenplay, which is full of unwieldy clunking additions which are supposed to make you think REAL HARD YOU GUYS about how this is LIKE RELLEVUNT to NOW. The screenplay takes a piece which is about Thatcherite Britain and tries to use it to bang home a message about George Bush's USA. So, instead of Moore's extreme conservative regime, we are presented with a 'British' government of the religious right, which seeks to ban homosexuality and Islam in the name of Christianity. Anyone who is actually British will find this confusing and nonsensical, as there is no popular religious right in Britain. And Americanisms like 'lever' (pronounced 'levver' rather than 'leever') and 'elevator' don't help.

Still, no one could really have expected the Wachowskis to produce a subtle or clever screenplay. But you might reasonably expect that this would be a super-stylish, high-action thriller. It isn't. The production design is sloppy - we're expected to believe that, thirty or forty years into the future, people are wearing exactly the same clothes and using exactly the same technology as they are now, with the sole exception of a little red bleepy machine which doesn't seem to have a function but might perhaps be a dictaphone. And, as for your high-octane thrills, well... don't get your hopes up. The action moves at around a quarter of the pace of the Matrix, and fight scenes are few and far between. In the climactic fight at the end, wherein V slays a whole troop of men, the film's signature visual effect finally kicks in: and it's... *drumroll*... knives leaving vapour trails. Wooooo. No need to bring a spare pair of pants to the cinema. Bullet time, it ain't.

There are many problems with this film: poor editing, appalling performances, the pointless addition of a love story. But the main crime is undoubtedly the sheer stupidity that the Wachowskis have brought to the table. Moore's novel deliberately does not end with firm conclusions, but asks you to consider relative evils: the government is obviously oppressive and fascist, but V is no less totalitarian in his own convictions. When he blows up symbols of democracy and justice like the OId Bailey, murders those who don't agree with him, or tortures Evie to 're-educate her', he becomes more and more like the government he despises.

In the film, this duality is forgotten, and V is presented as a straightforward hero. The conclusion, therefore, is that terrorism works, terrorism is good, and the ends always justify the means. The film of V for Vendetta misses the principal point of the novel, and ends up being offensive as well as boring and rubbish. Read the book, please, but don't waste your time watching this. And let's pray they never make Watchmen.",1
27 September 2017,I was expecting something a lot better,"Having read some glowing reviews beforehand, I was really looking forward to seeing 'V for Vendetta' for the first time. Now I've seen it, I must say that I was underwhelmed. Maybe the reviews gave me false expectations, but the film just didn't come close to being the 'masterpiece' that many reviewers before me have called it. Aside from an intriguing main character and some great visuals, it left me cold.

From the get-go, the film is more interested in showcasing a bunch of knife fights, explosions and firework displays (timed to music, of course) than telling any sort of story. As a result, the film becomes repetitive and tiresome very fast. The excessive action and violence is only interesting for so long and when it finally wears thin, the weak and poorly executed plot is clear to see.

'V for Vendetta' isn't the film I was hoping it would be and I was expecting something a lot better to be honest.",6
24 May 2021,Definitely top 100 movies of all time!!!,"More millenials need to watch this (before it becomes our next chapter in the U. S.).

V is the most spectacular character, maybe of all times! He's almost every emotion summed up into 1 person. He has RAGE and ANGER from his past - and he's spent a while now letting that build up - he knows exactly how to enact his revenge and to whom. (oh... and it's good!!)

Then on his other side, he's FUN, GENEROUS, and LOVING loving towards Evie (as any close friend). Yet, he knows it's his duty to teach her a lot if she's going to make it in this soon to be liberated world! Sometimes it's your best friends who tell you the TRUTH, no matter how much it may hurt!!

RECOMMENDATION: PUT DOWN EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW - AND GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!! I'm thinking about watching it again right now too!",9
6 November 2021,Still amazing after all these years,"Pay attention to the details: reflections, parallels, every song & its lyrics, V's & Gordon's art collections, the Shakespeare quotes, everything is deliberate.

16 April 2007,V for Very Rubbish Film,"A new yawn! With no story and action all they do is go on & on about 5th of November big WOW! I was about to fall asleep after the first half an hour and I wanted to turn it off but I kept on watching it hopefully that the story-line might pick up but it didn't. My attention was on the timer of my DVD Player and I was more interested in the film's ending not because the twist or anything would reveal in the last reel but it would end the discomfiture. I can't believe that it is one of the top 250 IMDb movies! It should have been in the bottom 100. The film had nothing but that stupid Guy Fawkes mask if I wanted to see someone wearing a mask I would go to a Halloween party or something. When Evey kissed the mask that is the dumbest thing I ever seen in any movie. James McTeigue must have pulled the script from his bum and was running around his house with it and his wife hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said, ""You promised me no more rubbish films!"" It was a complete load of garbage, junk and crap right from start to end of this 2 hours 10 minutes torture device. Recommend this movie to someone you really hate.",1
14 September 2006,"Pretentious, and not even for a good purpose","Well, the critics have spoken, the box office has spoken, the fans have spoken, and now I will speak:

This movie is junk.

Anyone who thinks this is high-flown political allegory should take a remedial class in civics, and another in history, and yet a third in rhetoric. Anyone who thinks it's art needs to take a shower.

V for Vendetta has none of the flash of the Matrix, but all of the pretentious pseudo-intellectual ""philosophizin'."" It oversimplifies both politics and human nature to the point that none of the characters are remotely believable, nor is their situation. Despite this, it manages to fail even at the level of popcorn fare, yielding not even a satisfactory final scene. Simply put, it's not even technically successful.

Statements which should be the clear bulwark for the opposing forces are mumbled unintelligibly through several layers of cardboard (Mr. Weaving' voice is often-times inaudible. Don't believe me? Go look at the message boards: half of the threads are requests for clarifications on the inaudible dialog). Confrontations like the final fight scene, which should be titanic, are instead grungy and poorly lit (seriously, someone buy the cameraman a mining helmet or something).

And then there are the characters wandering through this pasteboard wasteland. The main bad guy is never seen, and never provides his rationale, rendering him beyond flimsy and certainly no threat. The main hero is similarly opaque, since the filmmakers decided obscurity would somehow seem like wisdom to the sweating masses of fanboys who elevated this dreck. The most emotionally affecting voice comes through a long flashback sequence from a character long-dead. That should tell you something about the characters.

And finally, the politics: shoddy, ill-researched, and venal. All the characters we're supposed to think of as 'noble' seem motivated by the most pettily personal of reasons, with the arguable exception of the main police officer investigating V's actions. That the system would rise, then collapse so spontaneously is not only unrealistic, but irresponsible since young and foolish filmgoers are apt to mistake anarchy for freedom. My worst possible curse upon them would be that they get precisely what they ask for.

Thank all Gods that may be that their safety, the arts, and the world, are in better hands than these.",3

2 March 2007,"Intelligent film with political criticism , thrills , action and suspense","The movie tells how a strange freedom fighter named V (Hugo Weaving) in a ¨Guy Fawkes¨ mask -who was a historic terrorist who tried to blow up the British Parliament- wants actually emulate him . As ¨V¨ utilizes terrorist action against London landmarks but his objective results to be the fighting against the fascist state ruling over Great Britain and governed by a dictator , chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) . The authoritarian tyranny rules over citizens with oppression and violence and ¨V¨ is urging the London citizens to rise up and overthrow the government . Meantime , he saves a beautiful girl named Avey (Natalie Portman) from the violent deputies . She decides becoming his ally and confront the atrocities of the nasty chancellor and his underlings (Tim Piggoth Smith) . Meanwhile , a detective (Stephen Rea) and his helper (Robert Graves) are investigating the terrorist events .

This is a thoughtful and broody story containing a clever political criticism and is based on a graphic novel by Allan Moore . The film gets diverse influences , as the myth of ¨the beauty and the beast¨ ,¨The phantom of Opera¨, the anti-Utopian literature of ¨1984 ¨ by George Orwell and , of course , ¨The Count of Montecristo¨, but we are seeing images from the classic film and ¨V¨ acts like Edmond Dantes . In fact , the screenplay of the film is remotely similar to that of the Alexandre Dumas novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo' as both stories revolve around characters who escape from imprisonment and proceed in seeking revenge on all of those responsible for their incarceration . The original comic series was originally created by Alan Moore . However, following his negative experience with ¨From Hell¨ (2001) and The league of the extraordinary men¨ (2003) , Moore decided to reject all money and credit from Hollywood on any adaptations of his work . Thus , he gave all the money he would've gotten to the artist who drew the character with him, and rejected his own ""created by"" credit from the film . The movie has a stagy and carnival stylish but with a breathtaking production design by Owen Patterson . Colorful cinematography by Adrian Biddle , he died during the filming and is dedicated to him . The motion picture was well directed by James McTeigue . James , previously , was assistant direction of Wachowski brothers (Larry and Andy) , film producers in high budget along with another great producer , Joel Silver . The flick will appeal to the comic books enthusiastic and Natalie Portman fans . Rating : Above average , well worth watching.",7

14 February 2006,a work of monumental genius,"well... all i can say is goddamn.

keeping in mind that anytime you see a movie as part of a major film festival world premiere, where the cast and creators are present, along with hundreds of avid film fans and press, it tends to raise the experience a notch or two... but having said that - i found it to be a work of monumental genius. i thought it was so amazingly good in fact that i actually had to say something as extreme as that to express my current mood towards it, which is still only a mere fraction of how i felt when i actually left the theatre. it was seriously that good.

and yes, i'm biased, if you can call it that. but i like the wachowski's for a reason, not blind admiration. they're geniuses, and they've trained mcteigue well.

naturally, i think it will be under-appreciated by much of the general public as its not nearly as action-packed as the trailer would have you believe, but whether it makes 100 mil or 200 mil, it should at least completely redeem the wachowski's legacy in even the most critical of critic's minds.

i have to say, the rush of adrenaline i felt when...well, you know if you've seen the trailer - made me want to stand u and cheer. when a movie can make you feel like that, it's succeeded.",9

But was i in for a BIG treat, this movie is so superbly acted by all the actors, especially Natalie Portman performed according to me to an Oscar nomination next year. The movie is perfectly put together, so if you haven't read the comics you will be on the edge of you seat the whole movie. Its really that good folks. And lastly, the visual effects is fantastic, and the action scenes is nothing but spectacular. Watch this movie :-).

29 May 2006,Style without substance,"It seems appropriate that the 1812 overture is part of the soundtrack for this movie: Tchaikovsky might dazzle for a short while, but you wouldn't want to listen to it for over two hours.

Even those who have not yet seen the movie, probably know that the Wachowski brothers have jumped on the anti-Bush bandwagon. The political message is not too blatant, but knowing about it helps to understand the symbolism.

The movie is set in a future dystopian Britain (confusingly called ""England"": perhaps Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have become independent?). There is a second civil war in the USA, and ""England"" has fallen under a dictatorship with Christian theocratic overtones. By the look of the regime logo, the official religion seems to be Eastern Orthodoxy.

For some reason, the title character thinks that blowing up the Old Bailey and the Houses of Parliament would help to restore the rule of law and democracy. He styles himself after Guy Fawkes, a Catholic terrorist who tried to blow up Parliament with everybody inside.

Actually, the entire script appears to be written in blissful ignorance of the real world. For example, the dictatorship bans the Koran. What are the reactions of the 1.6 million Muslims in Britain? the movie does not acknowledge that they even exist. Another example: the movie opens with a British televangelist saying that America has fallen because it is more Godless than Britain.

The internal logic of the movie world is just as shaky. The regime is only nominally Christian, so why does it waste police resources in persecuting apolitical homosexuals? and why does it impose a late-night curfew?

It gets worse. One might think that an American civil war would generate enough fear to sustain a few dozen dictatorships, but the British regime fakes a few terrorist attacks for good measure. This conspiracy looks useless twice over when it transpires that people do not believe in the regime propaganda.

On the other hand, people immediately believe the first TV broadcast from a masked man who speaks against the government without offering any evidence whatsoever. This is what I call the ""Running Man"" plot device: an anti-government video is shown on prime time TV, and popular opinion is immediately turned around. It is becoming a popular plot device.

One might also wonder why V prefers knifes to guns, or how he manages to live in style in the very center of London, but this is nitpicking.

There is a pretense that the plot devised by V is very clever. To support this idea, we are shown how very clever he is with falling dominoes. In practice, the entire scheme devised by V can be reduced to the following:

BEGIN SPOILERS: The regime Security Chief has been plotting to murder the Dictator and take his place; V asks the Security Chief to carry out the execution in front of him; the Chief obliges (for reasons known only to him); finally, V kills the Security Chief. Incidentally, this is the only significant action scene, and it is poorly choreographed: the Chief's bodyguards stand like mannequins, waiting for their throats to be cut. END SPOILERS

This is not much of a plot, so it had to be padded with a revenge sub-plot, some prison scenes, and some explosions.

In summary, this movie has two confused and illogical plots (the movie plot and V's own plot) which show no knowledge of the real world; and no points of interest other than a character with a cool costume. If you want to see what life might be like under a modern theocracy, see The Handmaid's Tale: it has a low-budget look, but what do you expect in a theocracy? If you want a well-told dark story with a masked super-hero, see Batman Begins. And if you want exciting sci-fi action with a decent plot, see Terminator 2: Judgment Day.",1
11 December 2006,A surprisingly effective social satire within a Hollywood film? It is not perfect but it is very enjoyable for what it does,"Evey Hammond is heading out after curfew when the Government's Finger Men catch her and decide to enact their own form of justice on her. Her only rescue comes in the form of a masked man in a cape. This man then proceeds to show her the destruction of the Old Bailey. The Government spring into action to spin the story, control the people and find the terrorist. The police track Evey from CCTV and head to her work place (the Government controlled television station) to detain her. ""V"" arrives before them and uses the emergency station to broadcast his own message of unrest, elevating his ""terrorist"" stance against the Government in a year long war that will culminate on the 5th November one way or the other.

It probably helps to be in the UK to really appreciate what this film does well. I don't mean that in a snobby way but it is a success of the film that it produces a vision of the UK that is both futuristic but yet recognisable as our current condition. It does this most easily by visually mixing the design of homes and people's lives with all the trimmings of a totalitarian state but it also does it by making the links to our current political state of control and Government intrusion in the name of ""terrorism control"" and protection. Although it is only a year old, the film still shows a lot of foresight when viewed with hindsight and in doing so it produces an effectively bleak attack on our current political climate. It is effective mainly because it doesn't ever feel that far fetched thanks to the details but mainly thanks to the overriding themes of fear and control being used by a Government.

The surprise and joy of finding this level of social commentary in a what appeared to be a Hollywood action movie helped cover up some of the weaknesses. Some viewers have complained about the lack of action in the film; personally I do not see this as a weakness because this is more to do with how the film was sold rather than how it was made. The weaknesses are minor and include the asks the plot makes in regards the ability of V to do what he does and how far-fetched some of it is etc but, like I said, these are covered by how relevant and interesting I found the story. The cast are mostly good. It took me a good twenty minutes to accept Portman's accent but after that she won me over. She is very much in the shadow of Weaving, who shows what a great voice he has by producing a wonderful character without a glimpse of his face throughout. Rea is a bit dour but he does convince as a worn-down public servant faced with the truth about his masters. Fry wasn't that good but does what he had to do in a small role. Hurt and Pigott-Smith are both very good; Hurt particularly convinced as the sort of person who rises to power and delivered convincing lines in a convincing manner  it is telling he has little screen time but a large impact. McTeigue direction was surprisingly good and he delivered the whole affair with a real downbeat air while I'm sure some pressure must have been on him to deliver a big budget action movie for the summer season. He is well supported by the designers behind the visuals.

Those seeking action to compare with the Matrix (or even action) will feel let down and I can understand why  the trailers have talked up this side and talked down the social commentary side (and this is a damning verdict of how public tastes are viewed from Hollywood) but credit to the makers for producing a film that surprised me by how relevant it was. Over the coming years this will either become a thing of its time or more relevant than ever (I hope the former) but right now it is an effective story, told with the unreal air of graphic novel but with enough to link it to the present to keep it relevant. I was genuinely surprised by how good it was and how engaged I was by it.",
21 April 2007,Behind the mask,"If you want to know who plays the man behind the mask, just look through the cast listed here. What I mean, are the ideals behind the man/mask. Because this movie has ""balls"". It does not shy away from a critical theme (which is terrorism) and does not pull any punches either.

It's bold and it might leave you with a bad taste in your mouth or at least might make you reconsider a few things, you thought were right or wrong, before you watched this movie. If you haven't watched the movie yet, you might not understand what I've written, but you will after you watch it!

I even wanted to rate this movie higher, but there is one part in the movie, that I didn't like at all and it just didn't feel right (I can't go further into that, without spoiling, I'm just going to say that, this happens, before one of our main characters ""changes"" her hair style), but being as it is, if you like the sort of films I described above, go watch this one too!",7
21 March 2010,Misguided interpretation of political history,"First of all this movie confirms my belief that if you make a film flashy and fast paced with quick editing then you can get away with murder. It seems this is the preferred method these days with comic adaptations, keep it fast so people don't notice the plot holes and unbelievability.

I guess this movie makes attempts to have a message, but I was constantly reminded of it's comic book, sorry ""graphic novel"", origins because of the existence of the ever present male pubescent fantasy super hero who can beat all the bad guys and is impervious to pain, physics etc without any real explanation as to why. V for Vendetta seems to fail on both sides, there is not nearly enough action for it to be a true comic book movie, and the political commentary is so ridiculous that it can't be taken seriously either.

And for those who credit it as updating the old 1984 story of big brother to the present day war on terror really don't know their political history and i think we listening to too much Air America radio when this movie was being made. 1984 was written in 1949, and was a commentary on the Soviet State, NOT a capitalist democratic state. The ones who are truly pulling the strings TODAY are the corporations, not the government. Politics is essentially a game between these two forces as how best to carve up the world's resources. The people don't really enter into it except as consumers and tax generators. Some parties are more pro corporatist than the others, but let us never forget who is really in charge. George Bush didn't wake up one day in late 2008 and decide the banks needed 750 billion dollars, it is the banks that commanded that from him. Also, everyone who makes all these Nazi Germany comparisons don't really understand what Hitler and the Nazi party represented. The Nazis were both pro government and extremely conservative, these things don't really exist today, except perhaps in China. Most conservative people are extremely anti government, especially in the United States because of all the evil the government does with taxes, like build roads and schools and stuff. Bastards! Present day neo conservatism preaches that the only role of the government is to wage wars and have a police force, each of which performs essentially the same job, protect wealth and access to resources.

Anyway, back to the movie, even though it is shot beautifully it is really fairly empty in its heart, I never sympathized with any of the characters and every time it seemed to saying something interesting, something unbelievable would happen and all of a sudden we are back in comic book land. Everything happened so quickly that I couldn't grasp what was going on half the time, or if I did I was rolling my eyes. I also liked Natalie Portman, she at least redeemed herself from her horrible performances in the Star Wars movies (which I blame mostly on George Lucas) but I think Kira Knightly would have been better cast, at least she is British.

So in the end, not a bad attempt, but he rehashes the same old dead ideas about big government and anarchy and ends very similarly to Fight Club, which is not a good thing. It's message is pretty childish, when in doubt, blow everything up and it'll make everything right. Isn't that why were are in this mess in the first place?",3

24 May 2010,Bland and empty political commentary with some cool explosions.,"Another movie based on Alan Moore's work, another failure in every way. Written by the geeks who created (and destroyed) the matrix franchise V tries so hard to be two things at the same time: an action movie and a socio-political commentary of sorts. It mostly fails at both, but specially at the second area.

The premise of a single man taking over an entire government is not an easy premise to develop in a believable and convincing way. In the case of V we have a character that want's to revolt the masses to turn against the authorities. The problem with this script is that it never makes up it's mind on how it wants to present ""V"", he's a terrorist, but he's looking for revenge, he's a loony but he's sophisticated. At the end he's really just the charismatic Shepperd leading the flock. He's just another authority figure trading places with the other authority figures. He just happens to wear a very cool mask, and a suit full of knifes.

The movie also has no idea what to do with all it's political commentary, how to aim it properly, how to give it any weight whatsoever. England is controlled by a cartoonish religious/fascist state, complete with an evil big brother guy in a big TV always throwing orders at his inept employees. Went it comes to dealing with V this forces of the law seem to be unable of doing even the most simple and logic task. How can a man that is searched by the entire state can ship a bunch of masks to thousands of people across the country? Using every-day shipping service?

Once more, is not that the premise can't give us a good story, and good characters, is just that the wachachoskis have not even the slightest idea of how to handle the material. Other phony ""evil"" characters appear here and there, and at the end the entire logic of the movie is nothing more than a black and white picture where V is the good guy and the state is bad and that's it, there's your entire plot development right there. There's a very solid supporting cast doing what they can with the material. Sthepen Rea cringes at every line he spokes, Hugo Weaving at least has the mask to cover himself from the embarrassment. John Hurt hams it up, Stephen Fry brings some charm. Natalie Portman on the other hand gives yet another high-school-musical level of performance. This woman has nothing to do in front of a camera.

Sure, watching stuff blow up with the 1812 overture is cool to watch, but when there's nothing to back up all those images then there's a big problem with the material. The wachowskis should never, ever try to write anything else in this vein again. Think of the children please.",4
30 April 2022,The idea will never die. This movie as well.,"I watched this movie when I was a kid. And swear to God, this movie changed the letter V in my head forever.

It can be said that this is the best movie about the riot - the overthrow of the dictatorial government and the best honor of heroism movie ever.

This is proof that movies are not just entertainment, they can do something else.

It's rare in a movie where an important character can't reveal his face and still can express his emotions like V.

Unfortunately, in the area where I live, no one sells this mask.

8 October 2010,"Pulp Political Posturing, Just an Overgrown Comic Book","OK, with the budget, crew and actors, it was well made, no doubt top shelf UK production on a technical side. But as a political parable it just sucked. It mixed modern left leaning tropes about 9/11 Truther nonsense about the government staging false terrorist attacks to gain power with some straw man right wing Xtians as the all around bad guys. It had John Hurt as the erstwhile dictator, just like those other movies where he played some 30s style dictator or subject of one. I am no fan of the Xtain right here in the US, and while this film was made in the age of Bush, I also found the insinuation that those backwards moralizing phonies, fundamentalists & geeks are really blood thirsty tyrants to be too much of a stretch, considering NONE of those 30s style dictators were vary religious, with the exception of Franco, who was the least insidious of that crew.

Also, the typical one man army concept, our V, who can kick ass and slash 100s of armed opponents is so freaking stupid & stale, it deserves to be knocked flat on that count alone. He also seems to have unlimited resources, like the money and cut outs needed to mail 8 million Guy Fawkes masks to random people, and access to all sorts of explosives & public buildings etc. that any totalitarian police state worth its salt would detect in less than a month. There is no subtlety. A gay TV personality played by Stephen Fry, a friend of our put upon heroine, makes some lame TV satire of the terrorist and exalted leader. For this you'd expect him to be maybe fired and exiled unless he recants, but the evil leader has him killed in front of the cowering heroine, who was hiding in his house.

Finally, as proof of stupidity masking as the profound, Guy Fawkes, the 17th Century Catholic who tried to blow up Parliament with barrels of gunpowder, is the proto hero and the inspiration for our un-named V, who wears a Guy Fawkes mask throughout the movie as more than a disguise. To English people this is known as the Gunpowder Plot and its thwarting is celebrated as Guy Fawkes Day. Well, weren't the Catholics back then the religious zealots who were trying to get England back in the Roman Catholic Church fold? For a movie that pans Christian fascism and exalts freedom, it would be like having whores and strippers march for chastity. So much for comic book politics!",4

(Did I really just make a DIVING reference?) Yes, I understand that this movie used a graphic novel as a source material; this is why most comic book movies have less entertainment value than Laffy Taffy wrapper jokes.

The visuals and performances were top-notch, but the message delivered inside of the story was pure rubbish. It was the ""slippery slope"" rhetorical device typically used so nauseatingly by social conservatives (The whole world's gone to hell since (pick one) long hair on boys/the slam dunk/the birth control pill/rock and roll) - only this time, the slippery slope falls to the far right: If you're against gay marriage, it leads to the internment of gays. Opposition to radical Islam leads to the criminalization of the practice of Islam. Opposition to illegal immigrants leads to the deportation of all immigrants. There was also fodder for conspiracy buffs: the government knows and sees every last thing. And the government is waaaaaaaaay bad. I mean seriously - like, EVIL. There was even a Rush Limbaugh sighting, complete with prescription drug addiction!

It's obvious that this movie is anti-conservative, which I don't mind at all. We need honest disagreement (which we do have in this country) as long as we are willing to work together (which we have not had in this country since the 1810's). However, I really hate to see sophomoric distortions like these presented as some sort of provocative satire. It's not. It's got all the thoughtful gravitas of ""Rock Against Bush"".",6
11 January 2007,Socio-political allegory?,"What a frustrating experience this was.

A pseudo-historical philosophical hotchpotch slowly unfolding into a film with an alarmingly nihilistic resolution, that completely undermines the film's initial outlook. Some images are pleasing to look at, but the film's philosophy is incredibly pretentious, with some gratuitous references to Shakespeare and Goethe's Faust along the way, that have no bearing to the story at all. The main character is V, for which Hugo Weaving provided the voice, who looks like a 21th century reincarnation of The Count of Monte Christo. He is constantly - when not wreaking havoc on other people - proclaiming various philosophical cliché's, supposedly referring to totalitarianism or tyranny. Very annoying and they might as well have used a computer for his voice since his lips aren't moving.

The film is totally deprived of humor or even the slightest wit or irony, as one can expect from the Wachowsky brothers. For me, this overbearing seriousness is killing. Do these guys ever laugh?

V (for Vendetta) has rather dubious and elitist views on how to ""liberate"" the commoners from tyranny, let alone in his relations with Evey. He even tortures her in a specially built cell to force his viewpoint upon her. I thought our hero was supposed to fight these practices. He's worse than the system he's fighting against. I'd rather live under the reign of chancellor Hurt than under V's, with all his bombast and self-righteous flowery speeches about the world we live in.

Hardly a thoughtful film. Makes you wonder what audience the makers had in mind. As an action flick is disappointing, as drama it's hopeless. The performances don't really matter for the total lack of material to work with here, but even in this department it fails. Nathalie Portman cultivates a strange BBC-broadcasting accent and gives another bad performance. Stephen Rhea does his mumbling police inspector thing again (how often has he played these kind of roles?). He's not bad, but why is a simple police inspector put in charge of stopping a threat that could put the whole world order upside-down? What kind of character is this anyway? Stephen Fry as a TV-presenter is the only one to breath some live into his character.

As a political allegory, it's nothing more than postcard philosophy, completely trivial. Perhaps the Wachowsky brothers should stick to making action flicks like THE MATRIX wherein their wretched views of reality and fiction belong. With this film, they exposed themselves as two little boys with the basic understanding of a twelve-year old. Depressing.

20 March 2022,Now I get it,"When i first saw this flix i really didn't like it at all, I like Natalie Portman shaving her head for real,I just didn't understand why Guy Fawkes was until I looked up various versions of his history. For me I see this film as an agitator film, much like the Purge, Joker or Django, you know cinema created to stir the emotions and anger of the masses. Now every pansy has a Guy Fawkes mask in their bedroom to prove they rad and anti establishment. The Wachowski BROTHERS wrote this and when I see those names I know that there will be a story about an anti hero who saves the world from some sort of evil system. OK, kewl, just don't drink this kool-aid either, watch it for entertainment purposes only not as a political life style choice.

24 March 2006,So Why One More Comment?,"I don't need to say too much more if you've seen this...and if you haven't, there are literally hundreds of well written and well reasoned reviews here that should motivate your tail into a theater

The bottom line is that this wonderfully entertaining and dare I say, enlightening, movie will be (after all is said and done) a FAILURE if it just gets forgotten in the dustbin of commercially successful media.

I urge anyone who ""gets"" the message to become politically involved...and to do so at the grassroots fundamental levels as well as on the big sexy issues like Global Warming or the vaingloriously viciously vacuous venomous vehicle for vast profits known as the Iraq war.

The grassroots level means actually registering and voting in EVERY election...by absentee ballot if you can't get to the polls......it means running for party committee person in your local precinct and ""taking over"" the county party apparatus so as to reflect a truly people oriented freedom oriented truly American (in the original Patrick Henry/Thomas Jefferson sense) set of values at the local levels of government. If we do this, if the millions of people who will see this nifty flick actually are inspired to GET EVOLVED in political action; then the movie (and us;-) will have served it's(our) higher purpose.

Please make this work of art more than a merely entertaining diversion, let's use the emotions and the IDEAS in ""V"" to inform and motivate ourselves and others to commit nuts and bolts political activism! Let's do it now...while it's still quasi legal!!! :-)

The kinds of violence and death and totalitarianism seen in this flick can ONLY become actual if YOU allow it to happen!!!!!!!!

We in America are fortunate to still have enough shreds of DEMOCRACY remaining to prevent the world of V from becoming any more of a reality than it already is.

Let us USE our freedoms while we still have them; or we shall surely eventually lose them all.

3 August 2006,A movie the world needed,"V For Vendetta is a stunning adaptation of Alan Moore's science-fiction graphic novel that is faithful to its ideals, albeit with some updates which make it seem more relevant to today's world. What makes it truly unique is its believability. While the masked freedom fighter V is the stuff of comic books, the background story of the world's fall into ruin and fascism seems frighteningly possible.

The most powerful part of the movie occurs when Natalie Portman's Evey reads the autobiography of Valerie, a remarkable woman who was persecuted, tortured and killed because of her lesbian sexual orientation. Valerie refused to give up her integrity or her dignity, in the face of tremendous evil.

The graphic novel was written in the time of Thatcher and Reagan. Today, the forces of greed and ignorance are once again ascendant. Conservatives threaten our values and want to turn back the clock on all the progress made by good-hearted, progressive people. The story of V For Vendetta is a powerful reminder of what could happen if we ever let them win, if we ever give them that ""last inch."" It is also a hopeful film, however, as the forces of wisdom win in the end, just as they always have and always will. Perhaps the very fact that this great film could be made and distributed by a major studio provides the greatest hope that its events will not come to pass. Liberty prevails.",10
9 February 2022,"Valid, Veracious, Vital","I am of the mind that there is no true 10/10 film. Something can always be improved upon, and the same can be said for ""V for Vendetta.""

Perhaps it drags on a bit too long. Perhaps the pacing is less than consistent. Whatever the case may be, any film, no matter how masterfully crafted, could always be better.

So, why then would I give this movie a 10/10 in the first place?

The cinematography is brilliant. The writing is impeccable. Sound design, world building, character dynamics, all of it is truly exceptional. And yet, if this were any other movie, I could only ever rate it a 9/10.

It earns that additional point for doing something else that, for me, no other film has done. ""V for Vendetta"" changed my life forever. The philosophies shared by one of the main characters, the way that they see the world and the way that they want to shape it... I resonated with all of it.

This movie has encouraged me to take on these philosophies as my own. My life is BETTER because of this film and I can't imagine going back to a life where I was less than who I am today.

Any film that can change my life in such a fundamental way... I believe that is the only justification for a 10/10.

And so... 10/10. Definitively.",10

19 March 2006,"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the best big budget blockbusters to come out of Hollywood in years.","""V for Vendetta"" takes place in the future when Britain is in a fascist state. The people of Britain are no longer free to stand up for themselves and are being controlled by their government. The story begins when a girl named Evy (Natalie Portman) is attacked in an alley way and a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving) appears and saves her life. V's goal is to help Britain reclaim its independence and V will stop at nothing in order to help his fellow citizens' rise up and take back the rights that were taken away from them. But Evy is a key part to this story as it's up to her to discover the truth about V and herself in order to bring freedom back to a society that is overruled with cruelty, fear, lies and corruption. A great movie ensues

Wow! Why can't all big budget mainstream films be as good as ""V for Vendetta""? I literally think this movie is one the best mainstream films to come out in the last 5 years. The movie not only contains some great special effects and action sequences but also a well written thought-provoking script and some great performances. Finally, Hollywood has made a film that is a perfect mix of both an independent film (great writing and acting) and a mainstream film (great action sequences and special effects).

""V for Vendetta"" is a film that surely didn't disappoint me at all. The thing most movies like this lack is good acting and a half way decent plot. Not this movie, this movie is golden with a great plot and great acting. I think the main problem with Hollywood movies is that they lack one element or the other. When watching this film, you are hooked to it from the opening credits all the way till the end. The special effects are solid and aren't overused like in ""The Matrix sequels"" or ""King Kong"". There is enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. The movie keeps its audience both excited to see what happens next but it also keeps them thinking which is rare for a big budget movie.

At times, ""V for Vendetta"" seems to hit a little too close to home. Certain events the film addresses such as the fear element and government cover-ups don't seem like fiction at all anymore. I think this movie allows us to be entertained but also question what is going on in our world as well. It's a movie that provides everything that a normal Hollywood movie will contain special effects, action, a fictional hero but it also contains some realistic and thought-provoking ideas that many films of this nature don't normally produce.

This movie was directed by James McTeigue, a man who worked as assistant director on ""The Matrix Trilogy"". For being a first time director, this guy has the skills to pay the bills. Maybe the Wachowski Brothers helped him out but regardless he did an amazing job capturing all the excitement moments and the emotions of the characters. There are several amazing scenes in this film that just blew my mind including the final scene.

The Wachowski Brothers wrote the script for this amazing movie and I guess this movie can serve as their apology for the 2nd and 3rd Matrix which I deem as really bad films considering the first one was a Hollywood masterpiece and a one of a kind film.

As far as the acting goes, I am falling in love with Natalie Portman all over again. Her acting in this movie is superb. Her character is likable, realistic and believable. She has really come a long way since her career in film began. Her roles in ""Closer"", ""Garden State"" and now ""V for Vendetta"" prove that she has the ability to be one of the new leading ladies in Hollywood. Although Hugo Weaving's face is not seen during the film, I still feel the man did an excellent job as V. Even though he wears a mask during the entire film, you can still feel the emotions his character is feeling. It was a job well done. Stephen Rea also did an incredible job as Finch, the detective who was trying to solve the case of Code name V during the entire movie. He gave a fine performance. And finally all the rest of the supporting cast was great too. Everyone in this film did a great job.

So In Conclusion, if you're tired of seeing a big budget action movie that is all special effects and no substance, go see ""V for Vendetta"". If you like movies that have good stories go see ""V for Vendetta"". If you like movies in general you will probably like ""V for Vendetta."" It's a rare movie that so many audiences alike can enjoy and unlike most big budget films you can actually leave your brain on during it. It's an amazing feat by Hollywood and I can't wait to see it again. It's truly the first great movie of 2006. Let's just hope they don't ruin it with a sequel.

MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""V for Vendetta"" is 9/10. A big budget blockbuster that really delivers!",9
18 March 2006,"Courageous, fascinating movie signals a cultural shift","Dramatically, it's a little flawed, but I'd blame that on its considerable thematic weight. It's a courageous, fascinating movie that questions and attacks US and ""Coalition of The Willing"" fear-mongering in the pre- and post-9/11 era. In an effort to not-so-subtly mask its primary target, its setting is post-Thatcher Britain where Big Brother, John Hurt, fans the flames of fear and spews bald-faced lies on giant TV screens to a zombified populace totally reliant on mainstream media for its ""truth"" and moral compass.

""V"" (Hugo Weaving), which stands for both Victim and Vendetta, initiates a series of incendiary subversive acts he hopes will destabilize the government and cause it to fear its people rather than the other way around. Natalie Portman, in an important but not always crucial role, plays Esmeralda to V's Phantom and undergoes an interesting transformation that locks itself into V's dramatic journey.

The pacing is sluggish in places and the exposition is thick, but ""V For Vendetta"" is a work of ideas and outrage, and it wears its heart sincerely on its sleeve. It addresses issues not only as topical as terrorism and government deception, but it also shakes up subjects as diverse as sexual intolerance, secret prisons, the media's snug relationship with the ruling party, and the purpose of violent rebellion.

That a multi-national such as Time-Warner made and released this movie is, in itself, a sign that we may be emerging from a dark, cloudy period in which basic human rights have been ignored by folks claiming to be championing them with missionary-style zeal.

The action set pieces, which are not numerous, are not staged on a grand scale, but they are exceptionally well directed, smartly edited, and threaded with the blackest of humor. Performances are all excellent, with Stephen Rea and Weaving stand-outs.

The film is funny at times because it's truth is so raw, but the audience I saw it with in a large LA cinema was, for the most part, not laughing. I predict that this film's value may not be immediate, but it is assured.",8
14 March 2006,"Matrix-lite semiotics in a confused, if mildly entertaining, grab-bag of popular elements","V for Vendetta throws together a remarkable melange of elements, bringing them together in an attempt to be overtly political. We have a dystopian future, an England ruled by a Hitler-lite version of the worst of Blair and Thatcher's governments (multiplied to a horrifying degree); a slightly crazy Guy Fawkes -style figure (V) who is conducting a vendetta against those who kept him in a detention centre; a mild-mannered heroine, Evie, who is almost gang-raped at the hands of corrupt government thugs; and a rather lovable Stephen Fry playing a closet homosexual TV producer.

What was originally a comic-strip, updating an Orwellian tale of revolt against an authoritarian government to the eighties, has become a movie that updates the same themes to the present day. There's mention of rendition, an all-male cabinet that hearkens only to its leader, extensive use of 'spin', people detained without trial, secret police putting hoods over people's heads Guantanamo bay style, and most importantly the theme of 'terrors that we all face' as an excuse for government clamp downs and erosion of freedoms. For people pulling their hair out over the antics of Bush and Blair, V for Vendetta must seem like great fun in true liberal tradition. Indeed, there's a very intelligent film there somewhere  but this isn't it.

In one scene, Portman (Evey) is about to be abused to the extent she will wish she had never been born. The masked and near-invincible V appears, slays her attackers, and treats her to a barrage of alliteration in which whole paragraphs use words starting with the letter 'V'. Thankful for her deliverance, she is wondering if she has been rescued by a mental case, but V demonstrates some of his pre-arranged demolition jobs set to music. As terrorists go, he's the thoughtful kind, respectful and artistic. Yet any considered analysis of the film gives us little help in deciding whether V is a true hero, saving the nation, or just someone with a heavy personal vendetta that might have the side-effect of getting rid of the bad guys. V's hero, Guy Fawkes, was not a liberator, even though he wanted to blow up parliament (as does V)  he was a Catholic dissident who wanted to destroy the Protestant aristocracy by blowing up the House of Lords and killing the reformer King James I. V wants to overthrow the government not because they are bad, but because they hurt him (and his family) personally, and is quite happy to murder extravagantly and with a certain panache. The two aims do overlap though, and he realises Evie must play a crucial part as the representative of more regular society.

The (Matrix) Wachowski Brothers, who wrote the screenplay, indulge their love of literary association by referencing Shakespeare and the Count of Monte Cristo extensively. The use of colour is striking, jumping from violent red and black to smudgy warm interiors with artistic treasures or the white utilitarian rooms of plebeian offices. Natalie Portman's acting is tolerable, but the film's weakness is that it fails to convey any sense of reality, whether as a believable future society, a symbol of modern day ills, or a political thriller. We are left with the Watchowskis' portmanteau of assorted skills thrown together in an inadequate script, and central characters that add up barely as well as the Joker from Batman and Robin, but with the added baggage of trying to ride the crest of left-wing political comment films without having done the necessary homework. Bereft of its pretensions, V for Vendetta is just about acceptable fare for comic-to-film fans, but otherwise fails to rise above the mid water mark for a night's viewing. Like Superman before him, V is a hero who is portrayed as physically and emotionally emasculated, unable to have normal sexual relations, genetically modified with super strength and near invulnerability  a comic-book fan's wet dream. He ensconces himself in a fortress, venturing out as a god-in-a-cape messianic figure. But when the masses rally to support him in their look-alike masks, we can't help but wonder if they will be capable of instituting an intelligent democracy to replace the order that is overthrown. As a superhero, his philosophy has little to recommend it beyond listening to Julie London classics and imitating the Three Musketeers (unless we add a sympathetic ear for gays and lesbians). Bereft of V's remarkable powers, the pub-soaked working classes watching him on a TV screen seem to offer little hope for an enlightened future.",6

21 February 2023,"Magnificent, Insightful and Very Entertaining - Fantastic Performances and an Intelligent Story","V for Vendetta is a thrilling and capturing film that explores issues of freedom, government control, and personal responsibility. Set in a dystopian future Britain, the film follows the story of a masked vigilante known as V, played by Hugo Weaving, who seeks to overthrow a totalitarian government and inspire the people to rise up against their oppressors.

The film visually is absolutely stunning, with a dark and brooding aesthetic that perfectly captures the film's dystopian setting. The action sequences are well choreographed, and the use of slow-motion and stylized camera angles really adds to the sense of drama and tension. The score is also impressive, with a mix of classical and electronic music that complements all of the film's themes and tone.

The standout performance of the film comes from Hugo Weaving, who portrays the mysterious and charismatic V fantastically. Despite being hidden behind a mask for the entirety of the film, Weaving is able to convey a wide range of emotions and create a compelling and sympathetic character without needing to show his face. Natalie Portman is also excellent as Evey, a young woman who becomes caught up in V's revolutionary plans and undergoes her own personal transformation.

One of the film's strengths is its use of historical allusions and references. The film is set in a dystopian Britain that draws heavily on the historical context of Nazi Germany and the rise of fascism in Europe. The film's exploration of these themes and historical allusions adds depth and richness to the story, and helps to make it more resonant and impactful.

Overall, V for Vendetta is a well-crafted and thought-provoking film that is as entertaining as it is insightful. The film's excellent performances, stunning visuals, and intelligent storytelling make it a must-see for fans of dystopian fiction, political thrillers, and action movies. While the film's themes may be challenging for some viewers, they are handled with skill and nuance, making this an important and worthwhile film that deserves to be seen.",9
8 July 2023,Vehemently Vibrant Visualization of Valiant Vendetta,"""V for Vendetta,"" a visionary venture, vividly visualizes a volatile, vicious version of a vindictive future. V's virtuous vendetta versus a villainous, venomous government vigorously validates the values of vigilance, valor, and voracious validation of voice.

V, a veiled vigilante, valiantly vies against villainy. V's verve and vehement virtuosity are vividly visualized. Hugo Weaving's voice work as V is vibrant, velvety, yet venomous, bringing veracity to the vindictive, but virtuous vigilante. Natalie Portman's valiant vulnerability as Evey verily vibrates with vivacity, her voyage visibly vital to the film's vivacious vitality.

V's volleys of verbose and vaunted verbiage, veritably a vexing vortex of vocabulary, veer from verbose to vibrant, but never verge on vapid. His voice vibrates with a vehement vision of victory against villainy, evoking a vivacious, virulent vehemence.

The visceral visuals, varied and vivid, validate the film's voluminous verve. The V-inspired violence, though at times a bit vexing, are very much a visual vehicle, underscoring V's vehement vengeance.

Visibly, ""V for Vendetta"" ventures to vivify a vision of valiance against villainous vested interests. Its vitality and vigor are visible in its vehement visualization of vehement valiant vindication. A virtuoso venture, vibrant, visceral, and voraciously vocal. A validation of the vivacious, virile spirit of vehement victory against vengeful villainy.",10

17 April 2008,"Vermurkste Verfilmung Von Visionärer Vorlage""","(=""Screwed up theatrical adaption from a visionary tale"")

The Wachovskies continued here what the already did with their Matrix trilogy: while the first part was an interesting and highly entertaining variation of Descarte's methodic doubt (do I really exist, or is all that I see, hear and smell just the coincidental one-second-glimpse imagination of a one-cell bacteria which I truly am?""; watch Carpenter's Dark Star"" for more details), they dismantled it themselves with two sheer-below-mediocre sequels with virtuous but pointless action, plot-hole-chains, horrible performances, grotesque attempts in coolness and hazardous dialogs.

When I read Vendetta"" first in about '91 or so, I was once more reminded that we're yet not safe from the menace which my country unleashed over the world in the 30s and 40s last century and that it can occur anytime anywhere again. The vision of the novel was as credible, authentic and fearsome as many news-broadcasts today. Which is what the author tried to accomplish as he mentioned in his foreword in the trade-paper-release I owned then. If I recall correct he mourned about cheeky (cheery?) and cheesy, soaps, comedies and music-shows"" and about ... people who turn off the news..."" there. He dedicated the novel to ... people who don't turn off the news...""

The Vendetta""-movie-adaption is for people who turn off the news.

A valuable blueprint of a possible dystopia which played in the same league as 1984"", Fahrenheit 451"" or Brazil"" has been turned into a useless action-flick, lacking any political ambition or any attempt to subversively play with the viewers perceptions and political convictions. You leave the theater without anything to cut your teeth into or a matter to discuss controversially. And that despite the fact that the story today has enough actual events to function as an allegory for, as it had when it was written (war-propaganda, media-control, cutting of civil-rights, unbalanced and misanthropic economy etc). Hell, even Mad Max II"" was probably more political than this flick.

All the characters were real in the novel and became comic-characters in the film. Especially V"" is now a one-dimensional clown who rushes through the dialogs like a rabid rocket and through all the fighting-scenes like the energy-cell-rabbit: It has no blood, no animae..."" (Grosse Point Blank""). All those brilliantly placed quotes from literature-history that V used on any given occasion and during any terrorist action in the book turn into a what-did-he-mumble jelly here. Too fast for everybody who didn't read the novel, hell even too fast for those who did and -worst of all- too fast to celebrate the punchlines behind them. Who swaps drama for dynamic, deserves to lose both.

The story is an only fast forward. The fear of a fictional but credible fascistic regime that drowned out of every page of the novel got replaced by constant sensory-nervous-system-attacks and by the annoyment and anger about todays regular one-cut-per-second-editing-for-the-Mtv-generation; If it's too slow, people can't follow."" God, I miss Alfred Hitchcock...

I paid much attention on the Konzentrationslager-background of V but it didn't struck me at all as it did while reading it. Au contraire: Look what a cool fighter V has become there. Gee, Concentration-Camps can't be that bad..."" Folks, this is dangerous!

It's plain obvious that it was the wrong decision to let some non-UK-filmmakers do the project; some British would have better done this. No anti-americanism here, not at all, but the priorities would have probably been set elsewhere then and for sure on the more essential aspects than just on the visual and martial-arts. All the important side-stories were cut too. They should fold the Watchmen""-project right now.

Turn on, Turn on, Turn on - THE NEWS!!!"" (Hüsker Dü)

My recommendation: Das Leben Der Anderen""",3
13 June 2021,Unfortunately still relevant today,"Some stories lose their relevance relatively quickly. Others transcend time and find eternal relevance, appealing to diverse audiences as the years go by. 2005's 'V for Vendetta' falls into the latter category, as the story of hope springing eternal for a revolution to usurp a tyrannical government is one that will unfortunately be viewed as an allegory until the end of time.

In 'V,' we get the perspective of both the oppressed (Natalie Portman's Evey and Hugo Weaving's V himself) and the oppressors (through the eyes of Stephen Rea's conflicted detective Finch). We see the slow buildup to a revolution in a future dystopian Great Britain following a second American civil war, which sadly doesn't feel too far from reality. This central plot is what drives 'V' and sets it apart from so many other stories, and many can view the horrors and atrocities committed by the ruling authoritarian government led by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) as representative of who they consider to be their political enemies.

But 'V' succeeds in painting a picture of how to stand up to protect your rights, how staying silent can destroy the fabric of society and the importance of never giving in, never giving up. It does this, mind you, in a way that still manages to be entertaining.

'V for Vendetta' may have achieved ""cult"" status, but there is no denying the impact and reach of its message.",8

The major theme of the movie is resistance against oppression and tyranny and struggle for rights and freedoms. It describes politics and its effects on human life, the relationship between the state and the individual, and the the political rights of the people. The protagonist of the movie practically demonstrates that ""When injusitce becomes law, resistance becomes duty."" He proves that one man can singlehadedly start a revolution and mobilise the people against oprression.

In times when the authoriatnism and fascism is again encroaching upon the rights of the people, the democracy is on a backfoot and governments are becoming increasingly autocracic, this movies provides a hope. There is always a hope.

My favorite quote: People should not be afraird of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.",10
21 November 2019,Visionary,"Solid characters, actors of absolute thickness, remarkable direction. The subject addressed is tremendously current; unfortunately today the dictatorships in our society have stopped assuming the appearance of a villain to take those of untouchable holdings, multinationals and banks against which it is much more difficult to fight because they are not a physical enemy and sometimes are not even perceived as such. To see and review.

20 May 2007,"Winston Churchill Flashes No V Sign Here ""V For Vendettal **1/2","2018 and England is in the midst of a dictatorship by a crackpot who has brought death to 100,000 people by unleashing a virus and then blaming a dissident group for doing this.

Natalie Portman, a gifted actress, stars in this mess. The film has a good premise with a totalitarian regime in England while the U.S. is having a civil war. It soon falls apart as the bodies begin to pile up. The man with the mask begins to bring revenge on all those who concocted the virus.

The film is even a little bit silly and the ending is totally ridiculous.

There is one good performance and that is by John Hurt as the lunatic ruler. Stephen Rea, who was so good in ""The Crying Game,"" plays a police officer who is trying to capture the terrorist with the mask.

Portman looks like she has boozed, drugged and been through the mill. Unwittingly, she becomes an accessory to the masked man. When she denounces him, he imprisons her and then releases her. Along the way, we find out that her young brother was a victim of the virus and her parents were executed for their anti-government activities.

Stop with the nonsense. Too much of the film is all so predictable. I upped the rating to **1/2 because of the premise of the film, but that's about it.",6
23 December 2021,Should be a required watch for high school social studies.,"This film is a loud and brassy message that it is our responsibility to not let our governments gain too much control.

The references to classical literature throughout are either a reward for those who are well read, or an encoragment to enrich one's self.

24 March 2006,Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that?,"I was fortunate enough to watch this on the opening night. Having returned from the cinema, just a few hours after it ended, and with the movie still fresh in my mind, I write this review. My main interest in the film was and remains that the graphic novel upon which it is based was written by Alan Moore, arguably one of the best comic writers and without a shadow of doubt one of my favorites. Allow me to address the fellow fans for a moment; a lot of the story is intact(if the conflict is shifted, with measurable loss of effect, to the current political climate, rather than Moore's original, anarchy versus government), though some is changed around to being more visual(even though it does have images, the original comic book is still that... a book. Words can convey more depth than moving visuals with few exceptions, and the transition from one medium to another, it is pointless to deny, requires some changes). However, several images are recreated to the very last detail(something I haven't seen the likes of which since Sin City, which used the comic as storyboards, something I suspect may have also been the case here, at least to a certain extent. I recognized so much. Some subplots and such are cut for length and pacing, but they did fair in keeping all that they could without it being difficult to keep track of for new viewers(I watched it with three people who had never seen a single frame of the comic, and each of them 'got it', and enjoyed it, just as I... one asked where he could get the comic itself). And I'm very happy to tell you that the famous torture sequence hasn't been removed; if my memory of the comic serves me right... is hasn't even been trimmed. The first trailer told me this, and ever since I saw it, I've been eagerly anticipating its premiere, and I don't regret hyping myself up for watching it in the least. Albeit, that trailer(and the following one, even more-so) also claimed that the film was action-packed... something one of my fellow viewers accepted as true, and expected. He didn't leave disappointed, though, merely surprised. Know, dear potential viewer and reader of this review, that this is not an 'action' film/flick... don't go to see this expecting constant fight scenes. If you watched The Matrix and all you saw were the fight scenes... don't watch this. There's considerably less action. What there is, however, is rather remarkable... it's clear that these are the people behind aforementioned film, and it's clear that they read and dig the comic, and comics in general. The visuals are breathtaking. I don't remember when I was last gripped by a film like I was by this one. The direction is quite good, although there are points where you can tell that the man in the chair has not sat there before, as well as the fact that he had strong guidance from the Wachowski brothers. The plot is excellent. The pacing is near perfect. The acting was flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The film is very involving and intense, it pulls you in and doesn't let go until the credits roll. It's very stylish and cool. The film relies greatly on dialog(which also means that most of the humor is verbal, British... marvelous choice, if I do say so myself), much like the novel... although some things are obviously more visual than the source material. The Voice of London gets a face and V's fights get easier on the eyes(and obviously, the explosions are very much there). What I really enjoyed, while watching this movie, was that it was hardly toned down... it was almost all there. The perverseness, the 'different' human beings, and, most importantly, the message. The moral. The question that is asked, that we must consider: Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that? I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who is willing to open their minds to the themes within(though the book contains more), and especially fans of Alan Moore, the Wachowskies and/or comic books. 9/10",9
17 March 2006,Adolescent and boring,"This film plays well to those of us who have already made their minds up concerning current events(that certain governments are evil). So what? Government gets away with all kinds of bad things, no matter who runs the show.

Aside from this, this movie reminded me a lot of ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" in its negligent desire to reach a more mature audience. I am tired of ""R"" rated films for adolescent mentalities. Young minds are easy to propagandize, especially with easily digestible, non-thinking, fiery slop. Since the story comes from a comic book, maybe it is just for the the intellectually lazy.

There are better films that portray similar ideas. ""Brazil"" and ""1984"" are such endeavors. They are far more frightening in their depiction of evil police states.

But ideas can be whispered and still change the world. ""V for Vendetta"" came close to putting me to sleep, not only because of its naive storytelling, but also because of its tired imagery. Entertainment is what it's all about, and this isn't that much fun to watch.",4
3 August 2006,A Spot-On Movie for our Time,"Though the packaging of both the theatrical release and the DVD suggest that V FOR VENDETTA is yet another action hero comic book foray, nothing could be further from fact. James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.

Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving) appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine. The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry. One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government. But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host. Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film. The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.

Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding! Grady Harp",8

6 November 2022,One of the best!,"This is one of my absolute favorite movies. I watch it every Nov 5. I hope that the message continues to be spread and that we never get to the point where it becomes a reality like Idiocracy is. It's hard to believe that this movie is 17 years old now. But it is still a lot better than new movies that have come out recently.

I think that everyone needs to see V for Vendetta at least once in their lives. It sends a big message to not allow the government to have an insane amount of control. That some things need the fight. It's not all just vengeance, as the movie is called. It's just one part.

The story flowed well and the character progression for V was beautiful. I constantly had the urge to see Hugo Weaving underneath the mask, but I guess that was not the point. Fabulous performances from the cast, more notably John Hurt as he played Adam Sutler. A classic film that I would place in my recommendations list. Happy 5th November!

18 June 2009,apparent meaning where there is none.....,"There are two central problems one faces when representing the realities of human life in fiction. One is that our modern world is bewilderingly complex and intricate, and the chain of cause & effect is sometimes so incredibly tangled as to all but evade comprehension and mislead even the keenest of artists & social scientists. The second problem (and this is more relevant to cinema) is that reality is too prosaic to be marketable. Its why a film like 'Seven' sells and one like 'Zodiac' doesn't.

The guiding principle behind this film seems to be to toss together a bunch of half-understood, superficially provocative ideas that add up to nothing, mix in some glossy production design, an overbearing editing style and a wholly contrived sequence of events that are explained by character voiceovers (we have no faith in your intelligence so we'll spell it all out for you), stir liberally, and voila! You have a ""subversive"" work of fiction, ready for mass consumption. The bright colors and slick execution delight and distract the passive viewer, and the presence of simplistic & half-baked notions fools him into thinking that he's actually watching something worthy.

The film is so tight and enclosed that never for a moment do you believe that the world within it exists. And its so hopelessly literal and non-cinematic that its difficult to imagine that the Wachowski brothers wrote the screenplay. Its filmed straight, with little interest in the relations between the viewer and the narrative. VFV is not as dumb or empty as Equilibrium, but I find it horrifying that anyone could compare this to 1984. The two have as much in common as a swimsuit and a bulldozer. I'm guessing that the reason why this film is so highly rated is that most viewers cant wait to congratulate themselves for having seen a ""political"" movie. Contrary to arguments voiced on IMDb and elsewhere, VFV has little to do with life on this planet. Really, how can people think so little before giving their assent to something ??

The greatest scourge of modern life is not totalitarian government or even extremist religion. Its mass-marketed consumerism. There's comfort in knowing that what you like is also liked by at least a few others, and this comforting feeling, along with the equally grotesque phenomenon of shallow novelty intellectualism is what drives our current ""globalized"" world. Its what creates wealth disparities and leads to poverty, resentment and crime. It allows greedy hacks to thrive. Its why facile projects like this one get greenlit, and its why there are no writers like George Orwell anymore.",5
19 March 2006,Despicable -- And Yet Amazingly Boring,"If Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who shot up Columbine High, were still alive, ""V for Vendetta"" would be their favorite movie. Never has a mainstream film so romanticized the grandiosity, the narcissism, the petulant grudge holding, the anal sadism, and the infantile paranoia that make up the terrorist personality.

""V for Vendetta"" *is* marketing despicable ideas, but it's doing so in a flatfooted fashion. Director James McTeigue and the Wachowski brothers, who wrote the script, are not Leni Riefenstahl; unlike that Nazi master, they don't know how to make their evil ideas cunningly attractive or interesting.

The plot: authority figures like medical doctors, TV newsmen, politicians, and cops, are all really, really bad. Now there's a plot device that every immature seventeen year old who is convinced that his parents and teachers are out to get him will applaud.

There's only one really good hero out there, and he's showing how good he is by blowing things up, and, along the way, torturing a beautiful young woman. Wow! That immature seventeen year old is going to love that plot device. His urges to destroy, and hurt pretty girls, are actually virtuous? Wow. Let's give this movie a ten.

For much of ""V for Vendetta,"" you are watching other people watch TV. When the filmmakers want to tell you that there is a scary government-manufactured virus on the loose, they don't actually dramatize that; rather, they show a man looking up old newspaper articles about a scary government-manufactured virus. This is such inept, and such incredibly boring, film-making that the mind reels, and the eyes look at the watch.

""V for Vendetta"" tries to stage awesome images of fascists on the march, but there was only enough cash in the kitty to cast and costume about twenty or so fascists, which is less awesome than pathetic. ""V for Vendetta""'s big, scary special FX is mostly poor John Hurt's very bad teeth magnified to six feet high. ""V for Vendetta""'s fomenting of hatred against persons with bad dental work is shameful.

Even the action scenes are boring to the point of being inadvertently funny. V rescues a woman from evil police officers. And then he just stands there stiffly, spouting a boring soliloquy in which every other word starts with the letter V. I could hear people walking out at that point.

Ed Norton did much better work as the masked leper, Baldwin, in ""Kingdom of Heaven."" Norton must have studied how to make tiny body movements convey expression, even though his face was covered by a mask. Hugo Weaving offers no such acting talent. When you are looking at him, you are looking at a piece of immobile plastic. If nothing else, the cinematographer could have lit the mask in an interesting way. But that would have taken talent, and when you can blow things up, who needs talent?

Comic book movies are supposed to be unbelievable, but this one sets a new low. In an oppressive fascist state, a costumed crusader is able to walk unimpeded into government offices and the private homes of top leaders. Come on. These filmmakers aren't George Orwell. Their dystopia is about as scary as a hangnail.

Let's run through the movie's main ideas, either stated or suggested: 1.) AIDs is a government-manufactured virus. 2.) The US is the world's greatest threat to peace. 3.) Terrorism is the only way to make a contribution to society, because the people in charge are so evil and corrupt that there is no other way to contribute anything positive. So, oh, say, teaching children to read or working at a hospice or being an investigative reporter who gets to the bottom of corruption, or doing anything that requires patience or training or self discipline - that's just so uncool. 4.) Christians are really, really, really bad people. The Nazi swastika was not a pagan symbol; it was really just a Christian cross. Christian leaders have sex with child prostitutes. 5.) Islam is really friendly to homosexuals, and homosexuals run to Islam as a refuge from evil, oppressive Christians. 6.) Film footage we have seen of hostages taken by Islamic terrorists is really just dramatizations invented by our government in order to get us to hate Islam, so that we don't hate whom we really should be hating - Christians. 7.) 9-11 was really orchestrated by the American government. 8.) Terrorists are incredibly sweet and sensitive guys who rescue damsels in distress, recite Shakespeare, and have a connoisseur's appreciation of films from the Hollywood Golden Age. 9.) Terrorist acts are not so bad because no people die in them, they create beautiful fireworks, and they are a good excuse to listen to Tchaikovsky.

You get the idea. No, the movie doesn't say many of the above things directly, but it implies them. There is a government invented virus, there are government invented hostage tapes, there are homosexuals who are oppressed by Christians and turn to Islam, etc.

It's exhausting trying to catalogue the ironies that abound in this film. Here's just one: the film claims that it is all about protesting fascism, but the film's climax involves a celebration of individuals surrendering their individuality and acting as a faceless, violent mob. Folks, that's what fascism is. You could look it up.

Another irony: George Bush and his mistakes do need to be interrogated. But criticisms like this, which childishly and hysterically equate Bush with Hitler, give real criticism a bad name.",1
7 August 2006,Amazing,"Remember, Remember the 5th of November the gunpowder treason and plot. I see of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.

This movie starring Natalie Portman and Hugh Weaving was amazing. I saw it on my birthday and I couldn't get it out of my head. This movie was based on the comic books. I haven't read them but I don't think that you would need to read them to love this movie. This movie was about freedom and the way that some countries might end up. People control government. Not the other way around. This movie was heavy at times but really made me think. I think that this movie was wonderfully done and exceeded all of my expectations. The performances were brilliant and Natalie Portman really did a great job with her character. See this movie!!!

22 September 2015,One of the most underrated comic book movies of all-time!,"V for Vendetta is the movie that I thought was a great comic book because at first, a lot of people attended this film to be the biggest joke ever released in theaters, but after the film was released, I saw the film for the first time on DVD and then I watched a few times of FX and they still show it on TV today.

The film follows an anarchist freedom fighter named V, who attempts to ignite a revolution against the brutal fascist regime that has subjgated the dystopian United Kingdom and exterminated it's opponents in concentration camps.

A girl named Evey, a working class girl caught in V's mission and the detective Finch leads a desperate quest to stop V.

The film has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; libertarians and anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. The film was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. Pictures on Friday November 4, 2005 (which was a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night), but it was delayed and was released on Marrch 17, 2006 to positive critical reception and box office success.

I liked the story and screenplay by The Wachowski Brothers, who directed and wrote The Matrix Trilogy, Speed Racer, Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas and the dialogue is just wonderful on screen.

The cinematography is good and I have to give credit to the late Adrian Biddle for doing such a fantastic great job. The music by Dario Marianelli is just spectacular and amazing. The action sequences are just spectacular and my favorite scene at the end and it was amazing.

The acting is amazing. Hugo Weaving plays V and he does good and I liked him in the Matrix films as Agent Smith and he is good as the vigilante and he is spectacular with Natalie Portman in his scenes. Natalie Portman plays Evey and she is good as she was as Padme in the STAR WARS prequel trilogy and her performance along with Weaving is really amazing.

The supporting cast includes Stephen Rea as Finch and he is amazing, Rupert Graves as Dominic Stone and John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler and they all done a good job in their roles that they are in.

Overall, while I was scared that V FOR VENDETTA would be stupid as hell, it turned out to be one of the best comic book films ever made.

8 October 2021,"Prescient, entertaining, thought provoking, classic Wachowski brothers (as they still were at the time of filming;)","The film is prescient given the current state of surveillance, the ever increasing police state, and the manipulation of authority in the UK in 2021.

We will say nothing of false flag operations and ""gain of function"" virus manipulation because that would be inappropriate, controversial and speculative, but the parallel and parable is plain as day. The story is by definition dramatic and extreme, yet Orwell, amongst so many other free thinkers and visionaries throughout history would agree with the underlying premise. Fear and manipulation/narrowing of consciousness is of course what any authoritarian power is derived out of.

Unfortunately this is not one of Natalie Portman's best roles, considering some of her superlative latter work, her character is stilted, wooden timing throughout. And yet, it is a thoroughly entertaining film from beginning to end.

I could almost see Boris in John Hurts place if he didn't present as quite such a mop headed muppet vs the 3rd Reichian role called for. Not sure which is more dangerous, but I digress. Lastly, I am jealous of V's art collection. I believe that was a Blake canvas in there amongst all the other gorgeous art and architecture.

If you haven't seen it for a few years, check it out!",7

19 March 2006,Street Fightin' Man,"Greetings again from the darkness. First time director James McTeige has to feel like he won the lottery. Handed an outstanding cast, a terrific screenplay based on a popular graphic novel and the magic of the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix""), McTeige must be giddy just being part of this spectacular production.

Hugo Weaving stars as V, a revolutionary terrorist out for revenge and some overall world-saving. Wearing a very cool mask and twirling ultra sleek ginsu knives, V takes revenge on those who experimented on him and others with a very nasty virus. Along the way, he stumbles on a real cutie in Evey (Natalie Portman) who just happens to be the offspring of some infamous revolutionaries. The relationship between V and Evey is the heart of the film and very interesting to follow. They are being chased by a detective played by Stephen Rea who seems to be smarter than the Orwellian dictator played by a way-overacting John Hurt. His characters name is Adam Sutler, which is (not coincidently) similar to Adolph Hitler.

The story is kind of unique in that it works in so many aspects of history while staying centered on our fictional characters. Something tells me the fun game to play once this is released on DVD will be counting the ""V"" references throughout. Early on, Weaving has a soliloquy that must utilize 93% of the V words in Webster's. It is quite a challenge to follow the first time through. In addition to the spoken V words, the number of ""V""isuals is astonishing.

Don't be disappointed that we never get to see Portman (with her Sinead O'Connor look) actually fight. This is not really a huge action picture, although there are some stunning moments. This is much more of a political statement that can be twisted to fit any country at any time. The Wachowski brothers once again break new ground and it is definitely worth watching a time or two.",8
4 October 2021,"When Tyranny becomes Law, Rebellion is Duty","Every country of this planet has a tyrannical constitution, disguised as democratic. Fear is the primal and primitive instinct that governments use to control their people, who, to their perception, should be manipulated. Religion is made to control the collective consciousness and guide the esoterism of every subject of the country. Artists use lies and fictions to convey the truth. V is the artist who conveyed his truth and awakened the mass.

This is the most revolutionary film I've ever seen...

25 March 2006,Only Hollywood could have dismissed the Wachowski brothers,"Well, I put off going to this film after reading a couple of reviews. It sounded a little lame, and the last time I saw Natalie Portman she was less than rewarding. This time, however, she captured my attention and held it like you would expect a beautiful young woman to do, though with her own twist, namely that her persona manages to speak of her humanity more strongly than her physicality. It seems Natalie has deepened her skills since The Professional. Still, the movie relies on her performance to the extent that it would have failed if she had faltered. She doesn't.

No, I walked away from the movie tonight totally amazed that this 2 hour plus movie had managed to keep me riveted to my seat like some old Bingo player needing only one mroe square to win the night's big jackpot. And my wife, no fan of either action movies or political thrillers, was miraculously just as mesmerized.

This movie is a towering achievement, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will be the standard in its genre for a long time to come. And if you thought Hugo Weaving a slightly odd choice for Agent Smith in his last big role, watch him win you over in this film. He does it with insight and intuition despite extreme limitations (a Guy Fawkes mask). And John Hurt is every bit as righteous and outraged as some of our real politicians, making him all too easily recognizable.

I love this film! V may introduce himself with about 1,000 more words than necessary, but quickly, this film makes its points like some master litigator building an ironclad case. Oh I looked at my watch alright, but not to see how much more I had to endure, but how much of this cinematic miracle was left before I'd be unceremoniously thrown out into the cold, cold night. To say this screenplay is brilliant is a colossal understatement. It's almost impossible to believe any writing team could have dreamed it up, much less one where one of the team is seeking a sex-change operation in a real-life. And considering that the Wachowski brothers were responsible for The Matrix as well, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't grow up to be in competition with these guys! Quite unlike the Matrix sequels, this movie is very much the worthy of successor of The Matrix.

A couple of after thoughts: If you've heard about the Holocaust allusions, don't worry. You're not pummeled into submission with yet another account of that tragedy. And two, I fervently hope this operation they're talking about doesn't diminish their ability to create mind boggling cinema. That would truly be a tragedy, all around.",9
4 April 2006,"Voilà! A vibrant visual feast, and a veritable variant to a wonderful graphic novel","V for Vendetta is amazing. There is no other word to describe it. It's a visual feast with a gripping plot and a message. You'll be glued to your seat all through-out the movie, and you'll come out sweating with your head filled with ideas. This is easily the best movie I have seen so far this year.

I had my reasons to doubt the quality of this film adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore at first. Although, I must confess, it is reading about this movie that made me interested in the graphic novel, it was simply written so brilliantly I was afraid it would be spoiled. Indeed, it wasn't an easy adaptation. The original graphic novel has very little action, and a mind-boggling amount of text, not to mention many numerous characters and subplots. There was also the matter of the Wachowski brothers. I did enjoy the first Matrix movie, but I was terribly disappointed with the sequels. To say the truth, this was a movie that was easy to screw up, and I had a feeling it would get screwed up. I was wrong, and I am oh-so-glad I was.

The plot was changed for the film adaptation. The year is no longer 1998. The nuclear war was replaced with a deadly virus. But the idea behind the movie remains, even if the chain of events is different. But the film also added something I felt the graphic novel was sorely in need of: more action. I enjoyed the graphic novel immensely, but I felt it would have been more interesting with more action. And the fight scenes in this film are incredible: swift, stylish, and exciting. I did not like the changed made in Lord of the Rings. But in V, I did not mind the changes. The Wachowskis created a story of their own, based on Alan Moore's original, but different. And it works.

There was, however, one change that was for the worst. In the graphic novel, V was insane, and there was no doubt about it. He wasn't simply weird, he was also unpredictable, mysterious and eccentric. V's character was brilliant in the graphic novel, and it was slimmed down in this movie. Hugo Weaving was great as V, of course, but by making the character of V more human, more sane, by making him romantically involved with Evey (who was also portrayed perfectly by Natalie Portman), he became less mysterious and less interesting. Not to mention, they made him more of a man with an idea, than an idea in itself. And that is a shame.

All in all, this a spectacular piece of cinema. It's highly recommendable for anyone who enjoyed the original graphic novel, for anyone who enjoys comic book movies, and for anyone who enjoys movies in general. But if you want a different, yet more fleshed out plot, with a more interesting protagonist, pick up the V for Vendetta graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's worth it.",9
14 March 2006,"What a truly awful mess of a film. If this got made, it gives us all hope...","I have just seen this at a private screening and was hoping for great things. The general consensus was - How on earth did this get made??? 'V' is easily the longest 2 hours 10 minutes I've ever spent in a cinema. The whole thing is very short on action, and ridiculously long on tedium. A colleague I saw it with - an apolitical Australian - dubbed it 'The worst film I have ever seen..' He wasn't alone.

Where to start?

1/. Well, FOUR script writers. And not one of them with a decent writing credit to their name. Yes, I know there are loads of sad guys with no girlfriends out there, who think The Matrix is a work of mystical genius. It isn't. It is a film that stupid people think is clever. 'V' is the same, but without the good bits. I haven't read the comic novel on which it's based, but I understand the author has disassociated himself from it. AFter five minutes you can see why. From the off we are hit with ranting, heavy-handed, pretentious, meaningless drivel masquerading as commentary or satire, or allegory? God only knows. But given the hysteria of the writing teams' message, you wonder what sort of government such rabid parochialists would form given the chance.. What is obvious, after an interminable first third is: THE SCRIPT IS A MESS. The writers cannot tell a story and leave vast holes in the plot. My guess is they had neither the money, nor the will, to hire a decent script doctor. It would have been expensive.

2/. Hugo Weaving in a rubbish mask is irritating after two minutes. After two HOURS, you've lost the will to live. 'Hey Larry (and the other one). PLASTIC MASKS CAN'T ACT. They're static, and in movies, static=boring. But even his fight scenes were badly choreographed and badly directed.

3/. The whole film looks like it was made for TV. The first scene has a set like a 1970s Hammer horror. We in Britain were used to this sort of thing 20 years ago. Is London supposed to be desolate and oppressed as it would be under a totalitarian regime? If so, what was the production designer doing?

4/. What year is it set in? It's meant to be 20-30 years in the future and yet the police are still using old Dell computers, driving five year old Rovers and using current mobile phones. Details like these added to the veneer of cheapness.

5/. Plot. In Wachowskis' England there is one family, one grotty pub, two policeman who live in an office, five politicians and this girl - Ms Portman - whose parents have been killed by an evil totalitarian government because they protested against the war or something. But the government are bioterrorists experimenting on dissidents until one day there's a big explosion (not sure why) and then a nerve agent kills 100,000 people, (or is it 80,000, we get told both figures) which is falsely pinned on Muslim extremists and then John Hurt becomes Hitler on a chat show and we've still got an hour to go..... I MEAN IT IS SO MUCH JUVENILE RUBBISH. How old are these writers?

6/. Actors. Natalie Portman. Yes, she does a perfectly decent job with a script so full of holes and containing so many terrible lines you actually feel for her. Her accent was fine and I hope she got paid well for this, because she is at sea with this ludicrous script. Scarlett Johanssen and Bryce Dallas Howard - count yourselves lucky. John Hurt is great in these sorts of roles (Contact) Here he was terrible. One dimensional, shouty nonsense does not a performance make. Not in the least bit convincing, or unlikeable. The other bit part actors were pretty low rent, you don't even see them on TV in the UK. Even Stephen Rea was laughable on occasion.

7/. OK, what is the point? Governments are evil? Totalitarianism is a bit unpleasant? Revolution will save us all? Or worse - and I think this is what our angst-ridden writers are getting at - 9/11 was a Bush plot. How original. Simplistic, Hollywood liberalism is eating itself alive right there, up on the screen.....

8/. Cheap, cheap, cheap. 'V' for Vendetta cost $50m. Natalie aside, the acting is so second rate you know the budget didn't go there, the production values were sub made for TV standard, there are no Matrix sfx to speak of, so I guess the cash went on blowing up the Houses of Parliament (still not quite sure why) and shutting down St James' on a Monday night. $50m is cheap by Batman Begins standards. But it looks like it cost half that. And BB is a ten times the film this mess is. The good side? It will make money for fat Joel and his band tedious fat cats.

9/. Do we really need a movie for spotty, Chomsky groupies? The downside of the web has been the growth of the conspiracy theory racket. This has always been lucrative Wachowski territory and their constituency will flock to this nonsense and proclaim it a work of genius. For these people, movies like this aren't really entertainment, they are a confirmation of their own simplistic, childish beliefs in scenarios created out of low self-esteem, paranoia, social failure, limited intellect and laziness. This one's for them.

10/. V for Vendetta commits the greatest crime in movies. It is boring. Bad story telling is boring. Bad preaching is boring, bad acting is boring. This has all three. I was a guest at the screening I saw so I couldn't leave, and had to watch the whole thing. Someone behind me summed it up. With 30 minutes to go, they hissed 'For the love of God. End now.'",1
20 March 2006,The vendetta is against the audience,"..and you might wonder what you did to deserve it if you're forced to sit through this imbecilic, pretentious candy floss. If Brazil and Nineteen Eighty-Four are the perfect fusion of botanicals and base spirit in bleak totalitarian terms then V for Vendetta is the tasteless engine lubricant that passes for gin, served in Victory Square. Ripped from the soiled pages of Alan Moore's 1989 Anti-Thatcherite fantasy, it envisions a Britain (though in the movie this is freely interchangeable with England betraying the ignorance of the screenwriters) that's been taken over by a tyrannical despotic government. All freedoms are curtailed, though sadly not the freedom to talk in long-winded sentences but we'll come back to that. 'V' is a terrorist who plans to change all this by dressing as Guy Fawkes, that other, er, champion of the oppressed masses, - hatching a plan to destroy Parliament, by now a symbol of repression and intolerance thus liberating the populous  Guido redux if you like while John Hurt, inverting his Winston Smith role, grimaces and gesticulates as the Stalinesque Chancellor who V plans to permanently deselect. I've not read the graphic novel and this is something I share with the filmmakers if the result is anything to go by. In fact so muddled are the politics, so flat the direction and so poor the performances that it feels from start to finish like the filmic equivalent of a dirty protest. Vendetta's conception is a washout in every respect. The poorly structured, badly written screenplay by the Warchowski Brothers is primarily to blame. Why are these people given so much latitude? Didn't anyone see the Matrix sequels? The brothers grim commit their own act of cine-terrorism by creating a sort of England USA where the English speak a sort of Californian-cockney. Listening to it recalls the scene from Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home is which Kirk suggests that they try to communicate with the space probe mimicking whale song. Spock points out that this would be pointless as you'd be copying the sounds not the language resulting in ""gibberish""  its as if all the dialogue in this film has been channelled through the same translation software. The brothers know some English colloquialisms but have no idea how they are naturally used in real speech. American audiences won't care of course but for the real English it will be an effort not to laugh your way through the whole thing  it'll be all you can do to stay awake. This is like grit in the eyes but sadly, it's not the worst of it. The dire-logue aside it's the total poverty of ideas that really gets to you as it drags on..and on. The government of the future has been so successful in crushing the will of the people that's it turned all Londoners into clichés who helpfully sit on their sofas and watch the telescreen all day, lapping up V's simplistic messages of dissent or alternatively they're the proles, drinking in dank pubs  looking downtrodden and fixated on drink. Yes indeed, this is very much British life as I'd imagine it to be were I from Illonois. The screenplay is incredibly wordy  very long speeches, exposition follows exposition. Those hoping for some action to liven up the proceedings or break up the dull patches will feel their heart sink into their stomach long before it crawls to its plodding climax. The worst points? There are so many but V's demented Dandy routine accounts for most  Natalie Portman sounds like a New Zealander who ever so often remembers to enunciate an English vowel (badly)  the scene in which she dresses as a school girl so tow curlingly embarrassing as to make her work on Star Wars look Oscar winning by comparison.Hugo Weaving is wasting his time as the man behind the mask as he could be played by anyone  in fact Eryol Flynn's corpse could have matched this level of performance and for Steven Fry, an intelligent man so we're told, this should be a deeply depressing episode. I'm sure the idea of playing a repressed gay man who appreciates classic literature but can't openly say so must have been a lure but my goodness, it's the febrile complex on the film's pallid, diseased face. In bonfire night terms, V for Vendetta is like a knocked off firework in an expensive looking box  once lit it doesn't go off for 2 hours and when you go to check it, the thing blows up in your face scarring you for life. One mark for the use of the Julie London song (very droll) and one mark for those dominoes but that aside this is a hideous waste of effort. The rack, noose and knife for all concerned please.",2
19 March 2006,It's Time To Make A Stand,"This is the absolute ""GOD"" of anarchy movies. This movie is intelligent, sleek, new and creative and totally violent, it can appeal to everyone (unless your in love with Hitler or even the government now). It takes place in the mid to late 00's, the only notification on time is a paper that is written awhile ago when the government started taking over which is dated at 2015 (although the original comic took place during 1997-98). This new version of the Nazi's even have there own symbol but unlike the swastika this new symbol isn't a Hindu good luck charm it's more of a cross with an extra horizontal line. V for Vendetta is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd with the same name. The story revolves over the next rain of a fascist government, though Jews are never mentioned, they pick on Muslims and homosexuals mostly. The government is in complete control and makes sure the people keep thinking that they need them.

Code name ""V"" is the main character and as you may have guessed he has set out a Vendetta on the people that have ruined his life and the government who is ruining other people's life's. He's a sword wielding terrorist (a terrorist that you root for!) who dresses like Guy Fawks and quotes Shakespeare. He longs for things the government has kept from the public such as art, freedoms, music and literature. He follows Guy Fawks's plan and does all of his destruction on November the fifth. Hugho Weaving plays ""V"" and should win a golden glob or an Oscar, his performance should not be missed. Then there's Evey, played by Natalie ""Mrs.Skywalker"" Portman who's had a life full of tragedies but still follows the powers blindly. Until ""V"" influences her to rise against the oppression. Mr.Finch, played by Stephen Rea, is the police officer who tries to catch ""V"" but while trying to find him discovers some tight lidded secrets. And of course there's the leader, Adam Sutler, played by, John Hurt, and has a hair cut just like, Hitler.

A completely astonishing movie which teaches us about the power of one and what we can accomplish. It also teaches us to question our leaders and not to believe the media, because they are all owned by people with ties to the government and only give their point of view. Best movie I think I've ever seen, complete thumbs up, this movie covers every emotion and does it well. This is how a movie should be made and will become a classic that in 30 years people will still remember remember the fifth of November.... and this movie. (too bad they didn't release this movie on the 5th of November but maybe it will come out on video on the fifth)",10

9 December 2008,Standards have got so low it's not even funny.,"I can't fathom it. Acting is bad, dialogue is really bad, directing is in your face bad, atmosphere is non-existent, plot/story very, very contrived, clunky and childish.

People getting excited about this movie can only have been swept away by their feelings for the Matrix brothers or have been blinded to all the films failures because they have just discovered their first taste of political comment. Either that or they all wish one day they will marry Natalie Portman and that some how by giving this film a good rating she'll find out and come around to their house and thank them.

One day people here will rate Barney the Dinosaur the movie highly, because it has an inkling of social commentary, a nice looking actress and well known creative duo behind it. All those who love this film will then lament the fact people could like Barney the Dinosaur the movie, saying how low standards have dropped. That's how I feel now about the fact this movie has achieved such a high rating.",1
22 June 2013,"Things I learned from V for Vendetta""","1. EVERY priest is a pedophile . Or a sadist.

2. If you love your country automatically it means you're a fascist. EVERY patriot is a fascist.

3. EVERY homosexual is smart , sensitive , beautiful and so on. Homosexuals are the best people in the world.

4. If you don't like homosexuals you're a monster that hates them.

5. If you don't hate homosexuals and you just don't like them , you're still a monster.

6.When you're a dictator it's only normal to allow yours biggest enemy to send thousands of costumes . Because you are a dictator that controls EVERYTHING , except post offices.

7. When somebody cuts your long hair it's incredibly HUGE TRAGEDY . So big you have to cry.

8. If you want to make your hero look smart he should say things so obvious as :""Violence can be used for good"" . Because the audience it's too dumb to know that .

9. One facial expression and a lot of shouting is enough to make you a menacing dictator (shame on you John Hurt ).

10. When you're Natalie Portman you don't have to act in a movie. It's enough that you are in a movie . People will still say you gave good performance . God knows why.

11. Bullets in slow motion were cool (""The Matrix"") , so let's put knifes in slow motion into movie. It doesn't matter it looks incredibly cheesy , like from video game . The director thinks it looks COOL .

12 . Put some unnecessary and unbelievable romance just because people like movies with some romance in it.

13. Put some anti-Bush propaganda in the movie , because you can't put anti-Thatcher propaganda that was in the comic book.

14. When you don't have anything smart to say use a cliché slogan – TV lies .Don't expand it .That's enough. People will still think you're movie is DEEP . It doesn't matter that movies like ""The Network "" or ""The Running man"" had so much more to say on that subject.

15. Put a lot of pathos into your movie , so people won't be bored. MTV style rocks , right James McTeigue ?!

The movie isn't boring and Hugo Veaving gave a good performance (voice). That's all good I can say on Wachowski's primitive movie based on less primitive , but still bad comic book by Alan Moore . Long live left-wing propaganda ! I give it 3/10.",3
17 March 2006,Terrible,"This film is easily one of the worst I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Loud and overbearing, lacking in any subtly or nuance, heavy-handed message, repetitious and drawn-out. At so many points in the movie, I thought to myself, ""Ok, I get it already, please move along."" It got to a point where if it cut back to John Hurt barking at his subordinates from his giant video monitor one more time, I'd be heading for the exits.

In almost all cases, I can understand why critics and/or the public enjoy a film that I dislike, but this case baffles me. I can only imagine that with such a large number of people currently in disagreement with the decisions/actions of the US government and others, a story of rebellion satiates their state of unrest.

However, I fail to see the entertainment value of watching a guy who reminds me of one of the puppets from Mr. Roger's Land of Make-Believe go from The Phantom of the Opera to Betty Crocker to The Matrix's Neo, all the while prattling on using alliteration and wordplay meant to be clever and thought-provoking, but it's just tedious nonsense.

It's a fiasco, folks. If you can't see that, you just want a global leadership shift so badly that it's clouded your vision of what makes a good film.

As awful as one of the RoboCop sequels. To see others compare it with A Clockwork Orange makes me cry.

Grade: F",1
4 October 2022,"""I remember how the meaning of words started to change""","I've loved this film for many years and now I love it even more. Yes there are some flaws, well one. Natalie Portman is ok. Everyone else is great! The story and direction are amazing - the whole thing is superbly rendered, I doubt we will get many more films like this. Well, we won't.

What started as liberal nightmare about right wing authoritarianism has now morphed into a flipped version of the same story.

We are now in a position where if you don't think and act a certain way, you could imagine being black bagged. Not literally, but digitally.

The meaning of words has indeed changed. ""Racist"" doesn't mean now what it meant 3 years ago. Whose driven that? Not the political right. Division in society is worse than ever. Distrust. Paranoia. Misinformation.

Whatever your take. Watch out for McReady. He's in your greenhouse!

Remember remember the 5th of November.",10
23 March 2006,Simple-minded political message is overcome by events,"As a comic book movie, I would have been inclined to give ""V"" an average rating but for its repellent politics. A key scene is when a gay TV host (played by Stephen Fry) comes out to heroine Evey (Natalie Portman). This scene is used to fill in the political background of the story. Apparently, all the evil that ensued in the U.K. came about through the War on Terror: ""America's War."" It is not implausible that a long-running war could lead to curtailment of civil liberties  this actually happened in the U.K. during the long battle against IRA terrorism and those freedoms have never been regained. If the movie stopped there, it would be tolerable but it doesn't.

As we know, ""V"" was set to come out November 2005 but the subway suicide bombings conducted by Islamic terrorists was deemed to be too much like the final scene of the movie in which the Parliament building is blown up. Now that I've seen the movie, I think there was another reason. The gay TV host has a centuries-old Koran in his secret room and talks about how lovely the writing is. Never mind that, as a gay man, in theocratic Iran (currently the number one state supporter of terrorism) he would be executed. The fact is, this scene must still be jarring for British viewers, even months after the suicide bombings and the more recent Danish cartoon demonstrations. It is so politically tin-eared and clueless as to be breathtaking.

The Wachowski's should have used the delay in releasing the movie to cut that scene, which has so clearly been overcome by events. That they didn't is yet another indication of the insularity of the Hollywood crowd.",1
23 August 2006,Liberal progressive indoctrination at its best (worst).,"An oppressive Christian government hellbent on cleansing the world of non heterosexuals? Rented the DVD because all the rave reviews. Stopped watching it at the prison scene with the lesbian. You've got to be kidding me. The emotional rhetoric here makes me want to vomit. This is so typical of liberals, not able to use facts and reason to explain there self centered social and political beliefs so instead they make some movie that twists things around. The real Nazis in this country are the liberals trying to portray Christians as hate mongers. I myself by the way not even being Christian. Furthermore, they glorify terrorism as ""heroic"". Not that guerrilla warfare isn't necessary sometimes but it sure is coincidental with all the terrorist crap going on. Look I hate our C- president too but put aside your bias (which most never will because there ideologues who blog on liberal web pages all day and take statements made by non-liberals out of context) and look at the movie objectively. It turns out this is just another cliché hot chick hero saving the world movie. We live in a polarized country and the opinions made by people about how great and brilliant this movie was because of the alternative lifestyle theme obviously show the divide that exists between traditionalists and progressives.",1
28 March 2006,Perfection,"This Shakespearean-esquire instant classic gives you a world that appears to be the collaborated work of Edgar Allen Poe, Tim Burton, and Alfred Hitchcock, although it is not.

It feels darkly uplifting, while offering you the light. I found this work to be the perfect reflection of a contemporary society (although contemporary time is NOT the setting for this production) on the brink of self destruction via their own attempts to better their existence through the forced sacrifice of others.

The main plot demonstrates the vicarious venue of a velvety-voiced villain whose verve and victorious visions vie to vent the vastly varlotous valet of vipers.

This work is not merely entertaining, it is thought-provoking and deeply disturbing in a way which almost calls for anarchy from the masses against a totalitarian regime which is run inside the freedoms of Democracy.

More drama than anything else, this work delivers great performances, beautiful execution, and a lovely flowing, blood-soaked plot.

It rates a 9.7/10 from...

23 March 2006,Awful!,"Terrible, terrible, terrible film.

A plot that betrays an amateurish understanding of narrative, with zero suspense, populated by uncharismatic, barely audible characters spouting some of the most inane dialogue ever put into the mouths of actors, all against a dull background of generic production design. The films ultimate sin, however, is being so boring that I was studying the design of the theatre light fixtures for most of the second half.

If you're going to present the destruction of a fascist dictatorship, you have to show us why that dictatorship is so bad. People sitting around watching TV, and politicians talking to giant screens is hardly an Orwellian vision of a nightmare society.

Not every action, whatever its size or significance, needs to be accompanied by a five-minute monologue. We are not idiots. We get it with a silent look. We get it with a single word. Stop preaching.

Oh, I really can't be bothered - A truly dull and worthless film that should be avoided at all costs.",1

25 August 2006,V. Good!,"Based on the Alan Moore/David Lloyd strip of the same name (which first appeared in top British 80s comic, Warrior), V for Vendetta is a thoroughly entertaining adaptation which will most likely appeal to fans of the source material, but may leave others expecting summer blockbuster style action a little bemused.

V (Hugo Weaving, who remains masked throughout the entire film), is a freedom fighter in the near future determined to bring down the bully boy fascist government that is controlling England with fear and hate. Dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume, he plots against the state (led by John Hurt's nasty Chancellor Adam Sutler) and the people responsible for both his mistreatment and the death of thousands.

Although the film is not 100% faithful to the minutiae of the comic strip, the movie's writers (The Wachowski Brothers) have wisely not strayed too far from Moore's basic vision, delivering a script that retains the core ideas (the importance of freedom and individuality) yet still has time for a little wham-bam action.

Whilst the movie is not a complete success (it's a tad too long and drags in a few places), this big-budget adaptation of the relatively unknown (to the general public, at least) V for Vendetta is a brave move and everyone involved should be applauded. Although I fear that the appeal of the movie will basically be limited to fan-boys, I do hope that others seek this one outthey might be surprised by how good it actually is.",8
16 August 2006,The Revenge of an Idea,"It is not often the facade of a character can emerge from disaster to become a hero. However, there are precedents, like Phantom of the Opera, Darkman and The Hulk. They however, lack subtly. beauty, poetry or as the highbrows call it, Panache. Seeking to find an intellectual or sophisticated hero, I give you "" V ."" It is not the usual movie. Indeed, it is quite a bit more. In fact I would go so far as to proclaim it is the best film of this genera, I have seen in years. There are many special qualities of a classic film and this one has them all. There is violence, suspense, drama, revenge, romance, comedy, intrigue, excitement and of course, mystery of character. Most of all, this film has Chancellor Adam Sutlet (John Hurt) who embodies the unbridled and ruthless power of a brutal government. Arrayed against him is V, superbly and adroitly played by extremely talented Hugo Weaving. The story is that of a dark hero who is condemned to unspeakable torture and imprisonment returns from certain dead to strike terror into the heart of an established totalitarian system which created him. Using the facade of a dead anarchist, Wearing plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with the police and the dictator, using both special effects and a dazzling dexterity with knives. His aim, to allow society to awaken from apathy and reclaim it's government. A must film for any modern citizen who remains reluctant to find fault with it's present malevolent government. ****",9
31 July 2006,Sure to become a classic,"Too often films that intend a message become mired in details, and performances suffer, becoming mannered. ""V for Vendetta"" deftly avoids these pitfalls and stands out both as a thinking film and as pure entertainment. The plot is driven by thought and action, increasing its appeal to a wide audience. Upon its release I thought ""V for Vendetta"" would be a sleeper, a cult film appealing only to those of a certain oeuvre; the huge positive response it's generated from film goers of all bents is proof of its success. I attended the theatre with my teenage children who each enjoyed it for different reasons. Viewers familiar with the graphic novel may take umbrage to deletions and changes within the story but the spirit of Alan Moore's vision is intact.

Few actors can carry a starring role without benefit of facial expressions but Hugo Weaving is delicious...his mellifluous voice carries just the right weight for the hefty speeches his character makes, never over the top.

Natalie Portman surprised me: I always considered her a lightweight actress but she gave a well measured performance, earning kudos as her character develops throughout her ordeal.

I've always liked John Hurt; he adds interest to any film and is perfectly cast in a mercurial role.

There's no doubt the years will be kind; this kind of film holds up well and is destined to become a classic.",9
29 November 2008,Could be much better...,"I watched this movie last night and I thought it was OK. Just OK... The story itself is quite interesting, and the concept although its not new its something I find rather fascinating.V for Vendetta is about a futuristic English society controlled by a manipulative and fascist government.People are so afraid and insecure they don't see the dictatorship they live in. ""V"" is a mysterious man fighting for freedom while Evey is a news reporter who unwillingness joins V's quest. What I'm not so fond of is the poetically almost theatrically way things happen. It doesn't feel real.I have to mention the stunning Natalie Portman that once again has proved her value as an actress.

Deserving of a spot in the Top250 ?Not even close. If you like this kind of story read the book Globalia by Jean-Christophe Rufin,its way more interesting. 5/10

22 March 2006,"Loud, Brash and Disappointing","I can't say I've ever heard of the graphic novel by Alan Moore, but I hear he wasn't too pleased with this cinematic vision of his work. I cant say I was too overly impressed with it either; I saw it mainly because Natalie Portman thought the project was good enough to shave her head for, and even though the last two films by the Wachowski Brothers weren't very good, the first Matrix film made it obvious that they have a flair for action sequences. The plot is based on numerous ideas, all of which focus on government. V for Vendetta is supposedly a commentary on Thatcher's Britain, and this is mixed in with ideas stemming from Guy Fawke's plot to blow up the houses of parliament, and a revolution against the Government. The ideas are mostly very good; but there's too many of them, and many of the themes get lost in a convoluted plot that mainly sees a masked marauder calling himself 'V' picking off various members of government, while finding time to plant bombs and share a tentative near romance with the angelic Evey, played by the very talented Natalie Portman.

The film constantly nods towards more intelligent work, such as plays by William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 'Faust', and this serves to remind the audience of the shortcomings in this work. It has to be said that the technical work on the film is very good; the dark and brooding atmosphere works very well when coupled with the doomed vision of London. It would seem that The Wachowski's couldn't be bothered to direct their own screenplay, so that honour falls to James McTeigue, otherwise known as the first assistant director on The Matrix Trilogy. His direction is largely pretty good - he has an eye for aesthetics, and constantly makes use of the dark locations and many of the characters' dark clothing. The masked central character makes for a memorable anti-hero; but his spectre does look a bit silly, and seeing him constantly deliver convoluted dialogue in the style of 'The Oracle' soon wears thin. Natalie Portman looks stunning as always; even when she loses her luscious locks. The action is loud, brash and entertaining; and this provides the film with its biggest strong point, but it tries to be too clever and often ends up looking silly, as the plot is never deep or engaging enough for all the elements to really shine through. A shame; with the right handling, this could have been great.",8
12 October 2021,Now more than just a good movie.,"Wow, this turned out to be very prophetic!

Hopefully it may strike a nerve in some for whom normal common sense is lacking.

Although we are now heading towards Communism, not fascism, but there is very little difference when you truly look into the ideologies.

Natalie Portman is not the best, but the other roles, especially V, are well played.

16 September 2006,It just doesn't know what it is.,"All five of the stars I gave it go to Hugo Weaving for making the best out of a bad situation. This movie has multiple personalities, jumping from thrilling to slap stick in a heartbeat, which is probably because the man who took on the massive project has never directed anything before, and it shows. A lot. The dialogue is, well, bad. It's embarrassing at times, actually. The mask V wears the whole time, along with the hair cut, is down right creepy and, while the creepiness decreases as the movie chugs along, it never really goes away. VfV had me rolling my eyes at more than one point, raising my eyebrow once, and almost laughing about three times. If you can take a hero who's shown cooking eggs in a pink apron seriously, then you might be able to get through this.

1 June 2021,Let Down by Only One Thing,"And that's Portman's English accent. I usually like her and respect her because of her performances in films like Leon and Beautiful Girls, but she could not pull this one off.

With that said, this film is brilliant, explicit and takes no prisoners.

What a brave and overt film.

Imagine a world where more movies were like this!

1 April 2006,This world that I am a part of that I helped shaped will come to an end tonight with me,"****SPOILERS**** Futuristic drama set in 2020 Great Britian about a totalitarian government being confronted by a dark clothed freedom fighter determined to bring it down that it ends up costing him his life. Planing to make himself and intentions known to the British people on midnight November 5, V, Hugo Weaving, first rescues young British national TV employee Evey, Natalie Portman, from two government security men who are about to have her arrested for being outside on the street after curfew.

V takes Evey with him onto a London rooftop as the Old Baily Building in London is blown to pieces by explosives that he planted there to the music of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture. That results in the British dictator Chancellor Adam Sutler,John Hurt, having a fit ordering his entire army of security, as well as the British military, to find who ever did it and then bring him to justice; Which is a kangaroo trial conducted by the state without a jury.

The next day V breaks into the government controlled TV studio in London and after dispatching a squad of security men goes on the air telling the Britsh people that he'll be at war with Sutler's regime with the final reckoning coming next November 5 ""Guy Fawkes Day"". It's then when he'll destroy the British Parliament Building that Fawkes attempted, but failed, to do back in 1605.

The movie ""V for Vendetta"" mirrors what's happening now in the world with terrorism as the weapon of choice by the likes of Osama Bin-Ladin & Co. and has V using these same hit-and-run tactics against the British Government that he feels has betrayed and enslaved the British people. Enormously successful in his battle against the Sutler regime V nevertheless is a one man army with no one, but Evey, joining him in his fight. Which makes him a bit more then just a human being but someone with superhuman powers who can take on dozens of opponents and defeat them without as much as breaking into a sweat.

We get to know V's background in a number of flashbacks that indicate that he was the subject of a government experiment that went wrong that left him scared for life. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and Zorro-like hat V strikes us as someone out of the 18th not 21th century. We also get some idea of how a totalitarian regime like Adam Sutler's took over the government with flashbacks about a deadly biological attack on Britian that resulted in over 100,000 deaths. Were also given the impression that it was the Sutler Regime itself that engineered that attack, making it look like it was the work of Islamic terrorists, in order to get the British people through their representatives in the Parliament to give up their rights and make Sutler a total dictator who answers to no one and to no laws.

As November 5 gets closer by the day It's not V but Chancellor Sutler and his underlings who start to panic as the mysterious masked maestro knocks off key members of his regime including the ""Voice of London"" Lewis Profhero,Roger Allen,who we later find out was the commandant of a brutal government concentration camp where V was later almost killed in a chemical explosion. Using the London tube, or subway, V has a plan to use a train-load of explosives that will go under the Parliament Building at precisely midnight November 5 and blow the place straight to hell but Sutler won't be there. He's deposed by his handlers lead by the secretive behind the scenes Cheedy, Tim Pigoff-Smith, who together with his henchmen ends up confronting V in a battle that the result will be the future course of Britsh, as well as American and world, history.

Thought-provoking film with a really surprise ending, that takes up the movies last fifteen or so minutes, that has you thinking about that famous saying about Freedom & Equality; ""Freedom is not Free and all men are not Equal"". That so perfectly describes the movies sheep-like and ignorant British people in the quotes beginning statement and the courageous and principled masked avenger and freedom fighter V for Vendetta in the quotes end.",8
5 November 2022,"""Beneath this mask there is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof.""","In 1982 acclaimed writer Alan Moore published his comic book ""V for Vendetta"". 23 years later this film adaptation, going by the same name, was released. In short V for Vendetta is an Orwellian dystopia that culminates in a now ever more important satire of the dangers a lack of democracy can bring forth.

On a personal level this film haunts me a little... On one hand it does so many things so well, but on the other, there are more than a few issues I have to take into consideration.

The biggest of the issues unfortunately is the protagonist Evie. Without spoiling anything I can say that she basically boils down to your typical vessel into the film's universe. Her personality frankly isn't strong enough especially when compared to a certain other character this movie contains. Furthermore there are some at times rather goofy action sequences that do pull me out of the film a little. In connection to these scenes, but also just in general, there are some odd editing choices as well as some overblown sound effects.

Getting that off my chest though I can finally talk about the substantially bigger amount of things this film does very well. One thing that shines as bright as the sun when it comes to this here picture, is the central character V. Zed character is a sort of terrorist leader played eccentrically by Hugo Weaving. V not only gives the film something of a backbone in the first place, but also makes the viewing experience a hundred times more enjoyable than it would be without his unforgettable inclusion.

Speaking of V his mask is one of the most iconic in film history and as such leads us to the movie's remarkable set and costume design. The bleak version of London we see in this film (which undoubtedly is inspired by a certain German movement) sets the perfect scenery for a story such as this.

Now the story being told here is also obviously phenomenal which in my opinion is the most important factor to be considered about a film in the first place. Then there is the villain played by John Hurt who acts as striking critique on dictators overall, and so on, so forth.

There is truly so much to love about this film and while there are also unfortunately some quite noticable issues that redact a little from the experience, this is still at the end of the day a wonderful and genuinely important satiric sci-fi/action film.

Rating: 7+/10.",7
20 June 2021,One of the best movies of all time,"This is such a superb movie it will leave you speechless; if you have a soul that is. It is a philosophical and artistic masterpiece that only grows more relevant with time. The cinematography is second to none, but where the movie excels is in the dialogue - the script and plot. The movie explores our need for and questions the essence of love, security, freedom - the most elemental of human instincts and how they can be perverted, used and abused. This movie should be required viewing for any class in history, philosophy or political science. It is art at its finest. It is a study in our basest nature laid bare, a lesson in redemption, love and values. In short, you really should watch this film and encourage anyone you care about to watch as well.

28 March 2006,Remember Remember the 5th of November,"A hero sporting a mask eerily reminiscent of the king from the Burger King commercials (actually a Guy Fawkes mask here) who quotes Shakespeare. Natalie Portman with a shaved head. Hilarious allusions to Fox News and the Bushes. A comic book (pardon me, graphic novel) adaptation with an actual idea in mind and a strong political statement. What's not to like? ""V for Vendetta"" is a better than average genre flick that is as enjoyable for its silliness (when we first meet ""V"" he is a bit too loquacious and seems to exist only to ramble off tongue twisters) as it is for its high-mindedness. The political message may not be so bold or new (totalitarianism is bad, and we the people should rally against it through IDEAS) but it's timely and well played here.

Natalie Portman does a decent British accent in what is basically a natural progression of her breakthrough role in ""The Professional"" where she once again ""falls"" for a vigilante with a heart of gold in the name of vengeance. Roles in forgettable quirky comedy/dramas and her interesting turn in ""Closer"" aside, this is really her first chance to act since she was a child, and it's a joy to watch her here. It really is amazing how wasted and ill-used she was in the recent ""Star Wars"" prequels. This is the perfect type of role for her and she carries the film through its sillier parts to make it the stuff of high drama.

""V"" doesn't have the visual chutzpah of ""Sin City"" or the AHA! factor of the original ""Martix"" or the deep psychological complexity of ""Batman Begins,"" but it's full of great acting, big ideas, and a dense and satisfying plot played out to a proper conclusion. Brush aside some of the British stereotypes (everyone says ""bollucks"" and the people are bit too pleased by a Jack Benny style comedy sequence meant to poke fun at their Chancellor and his war on terror), some clunky pacing in the beginning, and a missed golden opportunity for a release date (remember the 5th of November? unfortunately the studio didn't) and let yourself be entertained. Sure to have a cult following, ""V for Vendetta"" is fun way to spend a few hours and just might leave you with something to think about afterward.",8

4 August 2006,"A for Amazing, T for Terrific, E for Excellent.","The most awesomely well done graphic novel that was brought to the big screen since Sin City. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving give great performances, O'h lets not forget Stephen Rea. In a future that would ask if Adolph Hitler had won the war, this is what our future would look like, a controlled world were no one is free or safe. A man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and dressed in black calling himself V(Hugo Weaving) who has incredible speed and agility, hopes to change all that. Fighting against the evil chancellor(John Hurt) who has a Hitler like persona. One night V rescues a young Woman named Evey(Natalie Portman) from a gang rapists. But she becomes fascinated of who or whats behind the mask. V is no Batman or Superman he pretty much stands on his feet. This was quite an enjoyable film.

Look at 58:30 masked scientists injecting the poor with a vaccine against a plague, particularly spine chilling. Just read Phillip K Dick or Asimov to see how science fiction foreshadows fact!

6 October 2006,This movie doesn't 'do' totalitarian very well...,"After watching this movie, I had to agree with an earlier posting which stated that this movie didn't really present a believable totalitarian regime. When the troops stormed in after the Benny Hill skit, I half expected the bloke to blurt: ""How dare you barge in here during tea!??!"" You need to present a really dour, Machiavellian political atmosphere, where all sense of personal freedom is removed. Where the threat of brutalities is as horrifying as the brutalities themselves. Characters with muted personalities, indicating fearful oppression, but yet moments of humanity peeking through (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Handmaid's Tale, THX 1138) and the hero should begin like all the others, no different than they are, except for a courageous ability to rebel. For as long as there is even only one defiant character, the world is saved. There hasn't been a movie like that in a long time. Just look at what they did to the remake of 'Rollerball' - I'm afraid to see what they'll do to 'Logan's Run'.

21 December 2008,Gunpowder Clot,"Sometimes; when reading the posts on IMDb, it becomes easier to see that common sense is possessed by a declining few.

Even to describe the plot of this second Guy Fawkes as 'preposterous in the extreme' would be an understatement.

One commentator has compared it to a production by Andrew Lloyd Webber. And given a few good songs, with the abandonment of all pretence at reality, it would have made a corking musical. A sort of 'Phantom Of The Revolution', with hints of Darth Vader, Obi Wan Kenobi, Neo, Adam Adamant, Bat Man, and The Joker all rolled into Winston Smith. As a piece of overblown, theatrical pomposity I can think of very few equals.

The problem is; it didn't stop there. It tried to be intelligent. And for under-fives may still seem so. It tried to be realistic; though the same class are unlikely to be fooled there. It also tried to convey a political message, with all the balance and intellectual depth of the Socialist Worker Party. Yep: that bad.

And I am SO tired of super-heroes, who can do just about anything. Where do they learn their skills? Where do they get their training? Why can't the SAS - who spend their lives in the business of all things espionage - do the same? There is a single-line hint that he was infected by a disease which miraculously advanced his strength and reaction times (yawn). It similarly made him a knife-throwing genius, a pyrotechnics expert, and a ghost who can pretty-well go anywhere without detection.

And of course; he's got to have 'issues' from the past, that require endless, tedious, soul-searching, chest-bearing denouements (double yawn).

To begin with; he's tapped into a communications main-frame. He's managed to smuggle about a ton of explosives into the Old Bailey, along with about £100,000 worth of display fireworks for good measure. He's managed to distribute them, conceal them, and fit them with minutely co-ordinated time-fuses. And he's apparently done this when anything bigger than a handbag is searched, and also scanned for explosive traces. Yeah, sure; in wonderland. And all the dumb-asses who've given this 8 or more stars just gawped open-mouthed in unquestioning acceptance. No explanation; just swallow like a garbage bin.

Reality ends there. It was not necessary to waste celluloid on any more hokey explanations. Just get on with the songs and the theatre.

But no; it just shuffles along. Tediously, laboriously, often presented from the standpoint of a senior detective with an IQ equal to his body temperature. The general public are depicted as the sort of gormless, gullible trinkets who consider this a good movie. We learn of his imprisonment, his escape, and so on. We don't need any of it; let's just have the songs!

We see the new big brother, played by an increasingly rabid John Hurt, which looks like a tongue-in-cheek homage to the 1984 movie. In a scene of unremitting confusion in a disused underground railway station, we find a train that's packed with yet more explosives. Our phantom hero has cleared the track and re-electrified it (that took him 10 years, you know). For some reason, once more unexplained, 'Big Brother' is dragged down there by his fellow authority-figures, to be murdered by the 'clot'. They then turn on him, and he proceeds to murder them all in a Tarantino-style blood bath. Though he is mortally wounded in the process.

Oh-yes; and there's the inevitable pretty-sweet femme-fatale who wanders about with her mouth partly agape as if in continuous expectation of providing someone with a blow-job. She, and she alone, carries this tall, well-muscled crusader onto the train and lays him on his explosives. Providing him with a wreath of red-roses, plucked out of fresh-air (if you can find any in a disused underground station).

The train is sent to Parliament, where the entire population of London, dressed in Guy Fawkes outfits - all supplied and shipped by courier at unlimited expense by our hero, have gathered to watch the big bang.

And it's a good one - the best bit of the movie. And there's another £100,000 fireworks display to go with it. To a few last lines uttered by the heroine, so clichéd as to pucker any self-respecting human sphincter, the nonsense comes to a close.

There's a lot more equally daft stuff but insufficient space to describe it.

Choreography's nice. Production values high. Special-effects spectacular, costumes and set-pieces OK. The hero is verbose but hilarious. The heroine suitably sylph-like, dumb and pretty. If only they'd remembered to put the bloody songs in. What a show it would have been.",4
2 May 2022,Amazing dystopian movie,"One of the best dystopian films that doesn't go too far into the future which is a twist most dystopian films don't necessarily do. Plot was very strong, cinematography was great, characters were great, casting was great. I can't give this a 10 because it's just a hair too cheesy at some parts.

15 July 2022,"Quite simply, one of the most superb works of art of the modern era","I have watched this masterpiece many times and each time I find more nuance and subtlety.

Easily Natalie Portman's best performance so far (2022). Hugo Weaving is invisible behind a mask and yet his delivery of the poetry that is the essence of the film is simply sublime.

For me, it's in the equal of Shawshank, The Godfather, Django, Pulp Fiction and Peaky Blinders.

It's 'arty', it's 'cerebral' and it's political and social challenging... I love my John Wicks, 'Pirates' and Empire Strikes Back as much as anyone, this is next level.

18 March 2006,Do Not Waste your money,"This movie was not only boring but beyond boring. I gave myself permission to fall asleep after the first hour and fifteen minutes of fighting my sleep. I was washed away with repetition over and over again. The story line needed serious work. Natalie Portman appears extremely to frail. The V-Character did not hit it as he should. There was something missing. The flash backs were not needed, nor the families watching TV. I see what they were trying to say, but they said it a thousand times as if I or the general population was too dumb to understand. The music(score) was not up to par and did not bring you into the scenes as they should. This movie was completely boring...did I say that...now that is how the writing(script) was. I could have cared less if V revealed his identity or not. I could have cared less about his life. There was no connection between the characters and the movie goer. It failed on so many levels. I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but I really do. But please listen when I say...rent it in the mail.

6 April 2006,Over and under,"7 for the the idea 5 for execution, 6 for acting

the story is strong on ideas. but the film seems not to trust the story. where there are moments that ,IMHO, could be slow down a bit more, be more gentle, be more still, it didn't happened.

instead there are always quick edits, constant flash backs ... is the movie trying to make up for the anticipation of action sequence that would attract the Matrix fans?

and the acting seems out of balanced - that of Hurt, Portman and Weaving. And the action sequence near is kind of doing it's own sequel to the Matrix?

*new* I watched this again and found what this truly lacks is the cinematic. The shot framing are not very inspiring, the story just moves along. The jail sequence is touching but done in a very simple way. Too simple when in fact that is the turning point.

So I stand by my rating of 6. A good idea wasted on execution. Sort of the opposite of Watchmen.. good idea on good (but not excellent) execution.

21 March 2006,From Strangelove to Vendetta: The journey from Lincoln/Douglas to Sharpton/Kucinic.,"If you haven't advanced beyond the second grade, and therefore require that your vilification of the Bush administration be bereft of the slightest modicum of subtlety, then ""Vendetta"" is your cup of tea. Its message hits you over the head like a billy club, and no surprise, the message is pure Hollywood propaganda.

John Hurt (the protagonist from Orwell's movie version of ""1984"", no coincidence) is the head of a police state that ruthlessly exploits public safety fears to implement totalitarian measures. We learn Hurt's character started out as a ""religious conservative"" who rose to power in the wake of public safety concerns over supposed terrorist attacks (no, I am not making this up).

Big brother is evidenced in force as government trucks roam through the city randomly eavesdropping on citizens' conversations (gee, no intended Bush administration parallel there).

Citizens are constantly assured that heightened security / diminished civil liberties are for their own protection, as they are surrounded by peril at every turn around the globe. But have no fear, ""England Prevails"" is the mantra people are taught to repeat. Gee, Bush has never said anything like that either.

The ""regime"" has eerie parallels to what else, Nazi Germany. We know from the beginning that people whom the state deems ""undesirable"" have been imprisoned, and the movie's own Joseph Mengela has performed unspeakable experiments on the prisoners - all for the supposed greater good of the state, of course. Homosexuals (who else?) are prime targets of the state. Soldiers/stormtroopers goose-step down a main street as their leader/Fuhrer pounds on a rostrum in the background. There is even a Swastika substitute.

Enemies of the state are imprisoned, re-educated, or in the case of a subversive element found with a Koran, shot dead (Nope, not making that up either).

So in case you didn't get it (as I will concede it is never written in boldface across the screen), the Bush Administration is exploiting your fears (and perhaps even manufacturing events to put you in fear), and is taking your beloved country down a road towards becoming a ruthless, police state where dissent equals death.

This movie isn't a poor man's Dr. Strangelove. This move is a 1st grade imbecil's Dr. Strangelove. This Cinematic polemic is the equivalent of a political cartoon with all the subtlety of a picture of Adolph Hitler superimposed on George Bush. The far left can, and HAS, done a HECK of a lot better than this. It is a woeful sign of the times that more than 40 years after the release of a great movie like Dr. Strangelove THIS is what ranks as compelling political cinema. Cinematic social commentary has made a sad reverse evolution - from Lincoln/Douglas 160 years ago to Sharpton/Kucinic today.",1

The overuse of bad explanatory speeches/ dialogue combined with its simplistic didacticism really grated - the film offered a cheesy crash course in political subversion/ rebellion for cretins. The love story was irrelevant, sentimental and completely uniteresting because the charcterisation was so lame - princess amrilla's character was nothing more subtle than the pretty scared girlie who grows a political conscience and a bit of courage. The direction and editing were hackneyed, dull and predictable. The photography was stunningly flat and badly framed, just boring -take the shot of the English people watching telly - it was like a particularly tedious Kodak moment from a family album.

8 June 2006,Alan Moore had a good reason to disown it,"V for Vedetta, a terrible excuse for making a film. How could Alan Moore allow Hollywood to make a big budget Bush-era investiment and not have any control over it. Alan Moore, the writer and creator of V FOR Vendetta was not about America's governmental system or Republican-bashing-it was about Anarchy and Fascism! For God's sake, it was about England! I have no problem with Bush-bashing but this film makes it so hard to believe, what may seem to be a beautiful, intriguing sci-fi film about the Holocaust is actually a movie that's meant to get to the box office and not to the true core of emotion and thought that it was meant to be. V FOR VENDETTA is about the man in the mask, but the true men that should be wearing masks, my friends, is the makers of this film.

15 March 2006,Shades of reality,"Watching ""V for Vendetta"", I cannot help but juxtapose it with the political issues going in this country today. It is a film sourced from a material with a strong and intriguing message, although the execution lacks depth to make it more than a popcorn movie.

Based from the graphic novel written by Alan Moore (who I read refused to associate himself with this) and illustrated by David Lloyd, the film is set in a futuristic Britain where there is a totalitarian government run by an extremist right-wing, employing a Big Brother-like system of monitoring, after political unrest and mysterious viral outbreaks had taken their toll. V (Hugo Weaving under a Guy Fawkes mask) is the mysterious terrorist who is intent on bringing down this government.

He rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman caught walking outside after the curfew has been put to effect and is about to be ""punished"" by police agents known as the Fingermen. Shortly after, he takes her to his lair and sets up an elaborate plan to free the people of England from their government that should culminate on the 5th of November.

First time director James McTeigue puts on a visual spectacle on screen but fails to elicit strong performances from the cast. Maybe it's not entirely his fault. As written and co-produced by the Wachowski brothers, the film has that ""Matrix"" feel into it, with some of V's lines reminding me particularly of Agent Smith that even beneath those mask, Weaving is so recognizable and gives an effective performance. But V, as well as Portman's character Evey, although likable, are weakened by a shallow and half-baked treatment of the story.

The action scenes manage to save the movie from the oblivious depths of mediocrity, if only to a certain amount of degree. The best part comes near the ending but it's not long and exciting enough to warrant the earlier parts of it.

""V for Vendetta"" does have its moments but they are few and far between. It is visually striking but just as previous film adaptations of Alan Moore's graphic novels (""Constantine"", ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""), something went lacking upon reaching the silver screen.",5
6 February 2020,Viveri universum Veri Vivus Vici,"A harsher, less exuberant version of 'Brazil' crossed with 'Soylent Green' (and of course '1984') that feels American except it's obviously set in London and has an extraordinary cast of well-known British thespians passing through it at every stage.

1 April 2009,"Meh, somewhat entertaining, except...","I do enjoy films with a message. V certainly has one and it hits you over the head like a sledgehammer. This particularly isn't a problem when executed well, but doing so in a comic bookish fashion with poor acting doesn't make for very entertaining fare. Maybe I was expecting too much from the outset - more eye candy - more ""gee whiz"" from the Wachowski brothers rather then simply a political statement? I suppose if you're an adult whose buried your face in comic books your entire adolescent years you'll find the characters spectacular no matter how drab. I couldn't help but think this movie was a direct rip-off of ""The Man in the Iron Mask (1939)"" and ""The Three Musketeers"", of course minus two swashbucklers in this film. At one point my ""stop button"" finger was getting rather itchy when I was pelted over the head with a pro-lesbianism/homosexuality propaganda segment. Call me a prude, but it was WAY too obvious and entirely unnecessary in the weak story this was supposed to be telling.

I'd avoid this one if you're expecting sci-fi along the lines and caliber of The Matrix. It doesn't even outshine one of the sequels and those were fairly poor in themselves. You have been warned. Face it Wachowski brothers, your best is in the past.",3
5 November 2019,An Uncompromising Vision Of The Future,"A vehemently crafted, voraciously told & vigorously acted cinematic vessel with a valuable & vivified voice that's as vital as it is vengeful, V for Vendetta presents an uncompromising vision of a vile future our increasingly venomous world already appears to be veering towards, and is one of the finest examples of its kind.

Vicariously scripted by the Wachowskis & valiantly directed by James McTeigue in what's his directorial debut, this vividly visualised voyage of a vigilante who veneers his visage with veil, vanquishes virulent vermin of society & incites a revolution with vehicles of violence, is balanced in ways that most films of its genre never aspire to.

Volatile yet vigilant from its opening scene, the film benefits immensely from Hugo Weaving's viciously charismatic performance despite only utilising his vox, and the veteran actor's voice alone vouchsafes life & soul into his vindictive character while his vacant veiled attire compels us to view him as the embodiment of an idea rather than an individual.

Natalie Portman's input is just as valuable while John Hurt chips in with a volcanic work in his villainous role. The execution of technical aspects is sound throughout. Cinematography envelops the images with a bleak tone & dismal aura to illustrate life under totalitarian rule while taut editing, variegated score & brisk velocity make the viewing experience more intense & visceral.

On an overall scale, V for Vendetta viciously combines elements of cautionary tale, politically charged drama & action extravaganza into a visually stunning & thought-provoking cinema that provides a voice to the voiceless, and is a valid & vociferous reminder that every society has the vim n vigour to dismantle any venal regime that violates its volition. Much more relevant today than it was at its time of release, this dystopian political thriller is by all means an essential viewing.",
29 November 2020,Prophetic,"When I first saw this film over 10 years ago, I'd never have thought any of its themes of tyranny, governments lies & propaganda would become a reality but here we are in 2020 & we have all three. Frightening to think this film is now our reality. Film is a brilliant & superbly executed canvas and is such an important statement of how people can be mislead & lied to by those that are supposed to look after them. So many parallels to Britain under Johnson - lies about a virus, lockdowns, draconian laws, violence against peaceful demonstrations etc. A milestone

1 August 2006,"Killing In The Name of who? - ""V for Vendetta""","For those familiar with former political rap-metal collective Rage Against the Machine, then you know that the song ""Killing In The Name"" off of their self-titled 1992 debut is an anthem for those upset with our current state of affairs. More so, ""V for Vendetta"" is a visual manifestation of Rage's innermost fears and rants, and, more accurately, the fears of those in power in our current administration. I'm listening to that song right now as I write this review and it's giving me the creative juices to express myself freely as my fingers reach for the keyboard.

""V for Vendetta"" is more spiritually akin to the liberal fears of the American conservative Right than it is the DC/Vertigo graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. Moore created ""V for Vendetta"" as a manifestation of his political paranoia over a sure-fire conservative victory in the 1982 General Elections of the United Kingdom. This big-budget adaptation, or, revision, is tailor-made for liberal Hollywood for their fears, doesn't take the courage to out-right condemn the powers-that-be, and instead just mirrors the climate without any kind of addressing whatsoever (reasons to which Moore has sought to disassociate himself from the picture).

Most remember that code-name ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) is a free-whelming anarchist instead of a violent freedom fighter. Weaving is acting his way out from behind a mask of Guy Fawkes - yes! - the same co-conspirator convicted and later executed in the foiled 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up both houses of Parliament in an attempt to assassinate King James I of England. Weaving's face is never actually seen, so he has to use his voice and mannerisms to define his character. He's exceptionally skilled with a pair knives, is expertly trained in the martial arts, likes reciting literature and poetry particularly ""Faust,"" and using the letter ""V"" in rhyme form and iambic pentameter. He also has a plan to blow up Parliament, just what his hero was unable to do.

It's 2020 London; in Moore's novel it was 1997 (back in '82, 1997 WAS the future). Years have passed since a viral epidemic killed nearly 100,000 people. The United States is in a state of civil unrest and other political upheaval (geez, the filmmakers, despite their apparent lack of backbone in the political arena, really know how to stress a point of America and Britain's doomed authoritarian futures). And it looks like more war is on the horizon.

The film gets underway when V saves the life of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from thugs. She's a civilian, a pale, sullen home-body who represents the ignorant Everywoman and is naturally unaware of her government's devious plans to subvert public opinion about a guy in a plastic mask who has it out for those in charge. The powers-that-be is a man who's straight out of a liberal's worst nightmare: a gay-hating, woman-bashing, right-wing Christian Hitler/Mussolini/Bush prototype named Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), Big Brother personified, and is never actually seen in person throughout the film but when he is seen, it is always from behind a video monitor.

V has a plan to blow up Parliament on November 5, to mark the anniversary of Guy Fawkes Day, and sweet-thing Evey is going to bear witness over the next 12 months to the fireworks and celebrations. A cop named Finch, played by Stephen Rea, is on V's trail and as he digs deeper, finds himself questioning his own allegiance to his government. V is determined to live up to his vow to bring down that house. Is V a terrorist? Is he a hero? Has he found a kindred spirit in the newly enlightened Evey? Or, more terrifyingly, has he become the thing he has sworn to defeat?

""V for Vendetta"" was directed by James McTeigue, a protégé of the Wachowski Brothers, Andy and Larry, who wrote the script and were the directors behind the insanely popular ""The Matrix"" (1999) and its sequels. Those films too had similar plots of revolution and political retribution and heroes who were seemingly superhuman. But while they defied gravity, our V here defies clear-cut classification as some anti-hero archetype.

The Wachowskis shy away the best they can from their works to give protégé McTeigue enough room to shine on his own. His film does have a rich visual style akin to what we saw in the ""Matrix,"" though it lacks the technical skill and wonder of those films. I was able to sit through ""V for Vendetta"" with a pretty open mind about its politics, (lack of) faithfulness to the source material, but something still didn't stick right with me. I don't know, maybe it's just because ""V for Vendetta"" didn't stand up to my expectations as something groundbreaking or in-your-face about our current administration and its diabolical affairs. But that's just me.

What I do like about ""V for Vendetta"" is how it's still able to not represent any kind of clear-cut ideology or philosophy. It's not liberal-leaning nor is it really anti-conservative, despite my political musings. It stands on no moral high ground at all. It just shows us a guy in a Guy Fawkes mask trying to stop some really corrupt government types; V is one that DOES practice what he preaches. The film's ending will surely leave a sour taste in the mouths of many but one thing's for sure: never has the destruction of a famous landmark been a reason for celebrations, nor for sympathy.

17 March 2006,They got it all wrong!,"First of all, if you know and love the original comic book don't go and watch the movie! Those ""matrix"" dudes did not know what it was all about. They got it all wrong! The setting is wrong. Their is no feeling of total control, despair and starvation created. That sort of feeling you probably have living in a totalitarian state like north Korea today. The classic gun powder treason story is plain unnecessary. The leader is a total different character and his ending is ridiculous.

Warning Spoiler

The story about the self produced virus is laughable. Evey is also portrayed in a false matter.The only good parts in the movie are the ones that stick close to the book like Natalie Portmanns part in the fake prison. V is not killing people randomly in the comic. And they should have used the original speech for his TV announcement. With those pictures of Adolf and Mussolini. And for god's sake ""V For Vendetta"" is not supposed to be a love story!! For those who do not know the comic book, do not watch it either. The action sequences are shitty and have no real motivation. Go and buy the comic. It's probably in the top 5 list of every comic book fanatic. To those matrix dudes: Go and learn what a film based on a comic could have been. Watch Spider Man, Ghost World or Sin City. And PLEASE do not think of doing a film version of Watchmen, Transmetropolitan or Give Me Liberty!!",1

18 March 2006,Thought provoking! - But I don't mean the plot or the dialogue,"The most thought provoking thing about this film is reading the reviews.

The film itself was utter drivel. I had read the reviews before going and thought to myself, ""I can't go wrong picking this one"". It was supposed to have everything that I would want to see in a movie. What a mistake! The action is incidental and third rate. Anyone expecting Matrix type stuff should be sorely disappointed and yet some reviewers praise it.

The acting, with the exception of Weaving and Hurt, was risible. I would particularly single out Natalie Portman as lacking all credibility. It sounded like she had had classes in ""how to speak and comport yourself whilst being tortured"" whilst at her finishing school. And yet many reviewers praise it!

I have not read the graphic novel. I can believe that the characters and setting might work in that format but on film I would have thought that the portrayal of London and Londoners was part of some sort of B-movie comedy spoof - they seem to have been lifted largely from somewhere between 1950 and 1975 with the LCD TV's sticking out as an anachronistic error rather than being the near future (If you put a child in thick black NHS glasses now you would be reported to the social services for mental cruelty). The initial encounter with V is even worse, being clearly inspired by Jack the Ripper movies. The police station was from the 1970s. As for the dialogue, it is not the fact that they keep saying ""bollocks"" that is the problem, it is the way that they say it - It's like they asked the queen to do a rap record and say ""muthafucka"" - it has no conviction or credibility.

I haven't said much about the political message and that is because, despite the reviews, there isn't really much of a message there when you look closely, or at lest nothing worthy of serious reflection. Anyone who thinks that it has anything to do with the present day hasn't watched it. The chancellor is clearly Adolf Hitler not George Bush and certainly not Tony Blair - everyone knows that having an ugly guy shout at people doesn't work anymore - modern politics requires good hair and nice teeth (cabinet members excepted) and that the state is taking over in a much more insidious way than the crude scare mongering of Nazi Germany and V for Vendetta. If you find this thought provoking you are feeble minded! This really scares me because I am genuinely afraid that, if feeble dialogue like this can provoke such thoughts then someone more eloquent could actually incite an anarchist rebellion.

Finally, Guy Fawkes didn't try to blow up parliament because he was a republican nor because the people in general were being oppressed - he tried to blow it up because he was a catholic. True, the suppression of the catholics was bad but it was of a completely different character to V for Vendetta which is more like the general repression of 1984 or the old Soviet Union.",2
19 March 2006,P for Pathetic,"Watching ""V for Vendetta,"" the story ""The birds, the beats, and the bat"" from Aesop's fables comes to mind. That story is of a war between the birds and the beast, in which a bat attempts to ally himself with both sides, only in the end, to be friendless when peace is achieved. The moral of the story was that if you try to appease everyone, you will satisfy no one. This is the main flaw of ""V for Vendetta."" The movie often changes pace, attempting to be a action film, a serious drama, a comedy, and an ""intelligent"" commentary on the dependence on government (""science fiction,"" in the sense of remarking on societal flaws). It achieves no success in any genre. The film is too mellow and the action is too spread out to be a gripping action movie. The dialogue is too cheesy and the characters not developed properly for this movie to achieve the level of a serious and meaningful drama. Additionally, the story is executed in a manner that is too cliché and in-your-face to be an intelligent science fiction flick. The movie is funny at points, but it rarely strives to be witty enough to make you laugh for long.

In penning the screenplay to ""V for Vendetta,"" the Wachowski Brothers have hit a new low. They have once again proved that, like me, they have no writing skills. If you've seen their previous work - such as ""The Specialist"" or even parts two and three of the grossly overrated ""Matrix trilogy"" - then you understand what I am referring to. They take a good idea and kill it. I don't know how they do it, but they do. Despite it's promising commercial, I assure you that ""V for Vendetta"" has none of the soul or flair of the graphic novel (which I highly recommend).

Another thing that bugs me about this film is that it feels the need to make Matrix references, as if they were 1) still funny and 2) hilarious because the joke is being made by the writers of ""The Matrix."" Bullet time has been replaced by knife time and if you pay close enough attention to specific shots in the action sequences of this movie, you may recall them from ""The Matrix.""

This movie is far from an entertaining popcorn flick, with a plot that drags at numerous instances and dialogue that makes ""Matrix Revolutions"" looks like Shakespeare. If you want to see something entertaining, I implore that you to heed my warning and avoid this flick at all costs. Go to Blockbuster instead.",1
4 April 2023,""". . . Governments should be afraid of their people!""","V For Vendetta (2005) -

This film was scarily far too close to the horrors that the world is currently facing, but it was done in a kick ass way that made it cool and not as terrifying as reality or as some of the other films and TV series that I've seen along a similar theme. I couldn't get passed episode one of 'Years & Years' (2019), because the concept scared me so much and it didn't have that funky comic book feel to it that this one did.

For me this seemed like the type of film the earlier 'Batman' (1989-97) attempts could have been with a little bit more effort. The others of this ilk - 'Sin City' (2005) '300' (2006) and although I didn't like the story, even 'The Watchmen' (2009) all had a vibe about them that I could appreciate, because it was obvious that the producers and directors had a clear vision and a theme. The 'Batman' films were just trying to jump on the latest bandwagons of the 90's with their attempts and failed.

So right from the start, with the 'Brazil' (1985) type undertones of this film and the actual tones used, I felt that I knew their was something dystopian about it and that a Hero or even an Anti-hero would be needed to save the day.

The story was very clever, with lots of twists and I definitely came away with the idea that I would have to purchase the original graphic novel to find out just how different it was and see if it was just as good or potentially even better.

I have to say though, that having seen it before, it detracted from its power the second time around, because the surprises weren't new. As with 'The Usual Suspects' (1995), once I knew who Keyser Söze was it took away from the film, because the next time I watched it I was looking for the clues throughout and therefore viewing it in a different way.

But this one was still enjoyable and I thought that the cast certainly contributed to that.

Although, despite how much I love her (Insanely so for a gay man), I did find Natalie Portman's (Evey) English accent a bit dodgy.

I also found the language track really bad in general too and without subtitles it was a struggle to understand it all. It was definitely too quiet in contrast to the backing track and I had to quickly reach for the volume buttons when the Tchaikovsky pumped out.

It was a horrible version of how our future could quite easily turn out in just a few years time, but I still hope for the utopia that 'Star Trek' (1966-) has suggested instead. Perhaps it is time for the ruling parties to hear the people sing and to don their masks and maybe Guy Fawkes wasn't wrong after all, I don't know, but I do know that this was a good film, steered brilliantly by Hugo Weaving in the leading male role and with explosions and epic tension throughout.

25 March 2006,Can the revolution happen without a leader?,"Just saw it and was DEEPLY impressed. Yes, acting and cinematography were top-notch, but it was the updated socio-political commentary that gave the film its punch. The novel, written in the Thatcher/Reagan 80's, was projecting the politics of conservative corporate greed into the future, and look how far we've already come since then....

Most thought-provoking was Finch's comment to his colleague upon uncovering administrative malfeasance -- if your government facilitated and/or perpetrated actions against its own people that were subsequently blamed on domestic/foreign terrorists, ""Would you want to know?"" (Such a question exposes the root of national denial, through which we're all going to hell in a hand-basket....)

V's liberation was by fire, and Evey's is by water. His is mythical, impossible to grasp except through enjoying the fantastical world created in graphical novels. Hers is real and intensely moving. It is the kind of freedom from fear that is faced down by untold others throughout history. Even now as I write this, and as you read it, someone somewhere is coming to terms with the ultimate value of some truth beyond one's own life. Evey experiences and surpasses that unspeakable terror which others (i.e. the great majority of us) prefer to project out into the world as ""terrorism"" -- and without facing such a fear we acquiesce to almost anything in order to believe we're ""safe.""

Evey's name isn't merely similar to that of V, but is a metaphor of the first woman as life-giver, and thus subject to the natural and inherent ""temptation"" of preserving life. Is there ever a war worth fighting for, dying for, killing for? This film says yes.

While the faceless V behind his mask is a virtual No One, he emerges as the voice of Every One -- and the movie's final moments express this beautifully. Only problem is, most folks have to be much worse off before they rise up, with or without leaders and cool costumes. Bread and circuses (i.e. ""Britain"") will indeed prevail a good while. But perhaps some day when a barely literate populace no longer has easy access to graphic novels, and global warming brings the seacoast lapping up the sides of abandoned coastal cities turned slums, the revolution will come....",9

19 March 2006,Brits and Moore fans cringe yet best Moore adaptation so far,"Certainly leagues (hah!) better than Constantine or League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I read the graphic novel (awhile ago, admittedly) and I've read some reviews, so I was prepared for disappointment -- I'm happy to say I was not.

I see a lot of British reviewers giving the film low scores -- and I don't blame them for not recognizing the ""England"" portrayed in the film. I'm sure the movie rings as sourly on their ears as Olive Garden commercials do for me as an Italian-American (""hospitaliano"", anyone?).

Alan more purists will (are) nitpicking away. I don't agree with them - the film did a great job of updating the tale to a post-9/11 reality while capturing the spirit of the graphic novel (still no substitute - go buy and enjoy Alan Moore/David Lloyd's original work!!!).

So Brits will cringe, Alan Moore purists will wail, and the Bush n' Blair faithful will scowl at the updated allegory. The rest of us will be unable to catch our breath as we experience an exhilarating tale. So sit back and enjoy the revolution!",9
28 June 2020,V for vendetta,"It is not muscle, it is not bone, it is thought.

Years from now, people may remember the masked man who led them to cry freedom on television, but they will never forget the supreme thought v left them.

From the night the Statue of Justice was blown up, the country was destined for an unprecedented revolution. With his power to play the symphony of freedom in the hearts of thousands of people, V is indeed an excellent performer. Under his tireless efforts, people came to realize that they should take back their freedom.

Finally, on the eve of gunpowder Plot Day, the revolution erupts, a train full of explosives slowly moves toward the Parliament building, and his mind lights up with fireworks over the land he saves, as countless men in Fawkes masks leap obstacles to fulfill the agreement they made with V a year ago. As everyone looked up at the flames of the explosion in the Parliament building, each and every one of them was a fighter for freedom, each and every one of them was a V.

1.We are told to remember the idea and not the man. Because a man can fail. He can be caught,he can be killed and forgotten. But 400 years later,an idea can still change the world.

2. People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.

The building is a symbol,as is the act of destroying it.Symbols are given power by people.Alone, a symbol is meaningless,but with enough people,blowing up a building can change the world.",10

14 June 2023,"Remember, remember the 5th of November","I might not have read the graphic novel V for Vendetta from DC Comics and Vertigo Comics that was written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd, but after watching the movie it made me want to check out the graphic novel. Do not expect constant action scenes like The Matrix (1999), even though there are some action scenes, the movie mostly talks about government and the character named V taking down the government.

Hugo Weaving as V was fantastic; he was cool to watch in the action scenes he is in, and just in normal dialogue scenes when he is talking to Evey played by Natalie Portman. I like how mysterious he is but also dignified sounding he is when talking to people he is to the people he goes after or just Evey alone, plus the main thing I liked was the relationship between Evey and V throughout the movie. Natalie Portman as Evey was exceptionally good; you understand her and her troubles involving her story with her parents or with the government in general, and I liked seeing her and V bond on similar goals.

When the action scenes happen, V is cool to watch take down people either killing them or just knocking them out in quick motions that are great to watch. The action is shot well, and the way V moves around is cool in the action scenes when protecting Evey or just when he needs to achieve a certain goal of his. There is also a detective named Finch who is a detective hunting V and Evey who then starts doubting certain things and what side he is on, which I found interesting for his development throughout the movie.

The cinematography in the movie is well shot and makes the movie nice to look at, either in action scenes, nice shots of London, or in certain locations where the characters need to go. With the nice camera shots of the locations there are also cool uses of lighting in dark rooms or lighting in outside shots when it is dark outside that can reveal characters in mysterious ways, how V would normally appear.

V for Vendetta (2006) was an incredibly good comic book movie that people who have read the graphic novel will like, and the people who have not read the graphic novel will either like it or not like it. This movie is not going to be a non-stop action movie like most comic book movies, I do think all the government talk in the movie will be interesting and investing to watch, only if you are okay with it. I do not think this movie is for everyone, but I will recommend giving it a watch because I really liked it and had an enjoyable time.",8
30 March 2023,"V for Vendetta is a well crafted and gritty dystopian film with a political story, it has a stellar cast and most importantly, it's cinema - My Ultimate Review","It was actually a long time ago since I watched V for Vendetta, but here we are multiple years later and with the preferred version or so I've read, the 4k blu-ray version. It was directed by James McTeigue (in his feature directorial debut) whilst the screenplay was written by the Wachowskis who also produced the film. What's so interesting about McTeigue is how he was an assistant director on many films; including Dark City, the Matrix trilogy and Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. All five I like. With his work and relationship with The Wachowskis, I can understand why they placed their trust on him, his direction and visual storytelling is perfect and he did create a great adaption. This was the last film Adrian Biddle worked on before his death and as always, his cinematography is stunning and brilliant. The film just looks incredible, with its stellar production and art design, there were so many talented people working on this film. The editing is truly fantastic, Martin Walsh did some award worthy work on this film, without a doubt one of the highlights. Dario Marianelli's musical score is perfect and powerful. The Dolby Atmos track for the 4k blu-ray was spectacular and so was the picture quality. One thing that I really find interesting, more now than last time I watched it, is how the film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in Great Britain. I actually think this film works better on a rewatch as V for Vendetta is extremely detailed. There's a lot of things I liked more this time around than before, the political story, the storytelling used there are so good and is the reason why some of the actors wanted in on the project, and that's completely understandable as the political allegory is brilliant which makes for such a more realistic and interesting story.

In the distant future, Evey Hammond is an average citizen of the United Kingdom, which is under the rule of the fascist and tyrannical Norsefire Party. She is an employee of the state-run British Television Network, but soon, she becomes the number one enemy of the state together with an enigmatic and larger-than-life freedom fighter known only by the letter ""V"". V informs Evey that she must hide in his underground lair for at least one year, and while she is reluctant to the idea at first, a bond soon forms between the two individuals. In the meanwhile, the mysterious past of V is gradually revealed to the police inspector tasked with capturing him, Eric Finch, and it is not long until he starts questioning everything his government stands for.

The film has a stellar cast, both lead actors and supporting cast. Natalie Portman plays Evey Hammond, an employee of the state-run British Television Network who is rescued by V from a gang of London's secret police and subsequently becomes involved in his life. Hugo Weaving as V, a masked, charismatic and skilled anarchist terrorist who had been the unwilling subject of experimentation by Norsefire. Stephen Rea as Eric Finch, the Chief inspector of New Scotland Yard and Minister of Investigations (the ""Nose""), is the lead inspector in the V investigation, who, during his investigation, uncovers an unspeakable government crime. Stephen Fry as Gordon Deitrich, a closeted gay talk show host. John Hurt as Adam Sutler, the former Conservative Member of Parliament and Under-Secretary for Defence. High Chancellor Sutler is the founder of Norsefire and is Britain's authoritarian elected leader. My favorite performances in this film is Natalie Portman and Stephen Rea, their strong acting helps the film in many ways, but Hugo Weaving is absolutely fantastic as V. He keeps the mask on during the majority of the film, so we don't get much acting with facial expressions, but as a character and what Weaving brings to the role, I'm sure he's one of the reasons why the character became one of the most iconic protagonists in media.

V for Vendetta is based on the graphic novel with the same name which Alan Moore wrote, like Watchmen I'm sure this was a hard project to adapt but I think The Wachowskis did a brilliant job at it. It just works so well in this format of storytelling, making use of its themes but also bringing new ones to the table like numerous references to events surrounding the George W. Bush administration in the United States which works quite well as it makes it more real in a way. I haven't read the source material, yet, but I have understood that there were a lot of changes made.

As a film about the struggle between freedom and the state, V for Vendetta takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the Third Reich and George Orwell's 1984. For example, Adam Sutler primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent of the image of Big Brother. There is also the state's use of mass surveillance, such as closed-circuit television, on its citizens - reminiscent of the comprehensive mass surveillance systems currently deployed in many nations, such as China. The name Adam Sutler is intentionally similar to Adolf Hitler. Like the so-called Führer, Sutler is given to hysterical speech. Also like Hitler, Sutler is a racial purist, although Jews have been replaced by Asians and Muslims as the focus of Norsefire ethnoreligious propaganda and persecution. As noted by several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror elements from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks to hide their disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera. V for Vendetta is a film that critics and commentators have pondered about and written about to find themes and interpretations to the story and imagery, the film is rich in all that. V for Vendetta received few awards, although at the 2007 Saturn Awards Natalie Portman won the Best Actress award. The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007.

Richard Corliss wrote for Time, ""It's a terrific movie. I love the look and the verve of the thing, the confidence of its epic design, its smart use of half a dozen noted British thesps, lending weight and wit to the supporting roles"", I after fully with his thoughts. V for Vendetta is an action film, true, and that was the main reason I watched it all those years ago. This film is so much more than a simple action film, there aren't really anything simple with it and that's why I now love it so much. The rich story, its characters and world building, V for Vendetta has such a depth. It's cinema.",10
28 October 2014,"""A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having.""","Exquisite, passionate action-romance-melodrama from screenwriters Larry and Andy Wachowski has the U.K. under martial law and a fascist regime in the 2020s. Working girl Natalie Portman (in a charming performance without too much Sturm und Drang) chances to meet a masked vigilante named V after he rescues her from thugs; turns out his hit list is full of government officials, and she is asked to comply with V and be his accomplice. Despite some confusion in the latter portion of the plot (as well as an unnecessary recap of visual highlights, as if from a TV mini-series), the film is slick and smooth, easily consumed, and often very exciting. Director James McTeigue carries us through the nastier elements of the plot without dwelling on the excesses (this isn't ""RoboCop""), and Portman and masked Hugo Weaving are a scintillating pair. Brilliantly designed and photographed, with amusing soundtrack choices and a satisfying finale. *** from ****

17 February 2008,Boring...,"This movie was c for clichéd...i couldn't wait to leave the theater. And all of this for a guy who loves everything from comic adventure films, to silent oldies, to foreign language, or Errol Flynn swashbucklers, or anything written by Robert Bolt. I've seen a lot of movies and this was at the top of the list for how many times I checked my watch. The only film I've seen in the last 10 years that was more annoying was ""The Happening.""

Why was this film so bad? It was predictable at every level and surprising at none. Further, it was filled with every politically correct cliché in the book..really? A religious right group that takes over the world, and persecutes lesbians? And the only way to stop them is terrorism? I kept wondering if Michael Moore was behind V's mask (now that would have been a truly surprising ending).

22 July 2021,to see it once,"The feelings about it , seeing time by time, are less clear. It is a good film but the references are so obvious, the clash against aspects of near reality so present, than it is very hard to be real enthusiatic. Sure, it can be a warning, portrait of dictatorship, definition of high need of freedom, a form of parody, use of Gunpower plot, Brave New World or 1984 for a sort of manifesto. So, it is good as answer of frustrations, conspiracy theories or people under tyranies. But can it be more ? Sure , Natalie Portman gives a good role, John Hurt reminds 1984 for the change of places, but, after a time, the film, source of enthusiasmus after the first discover of it, seems too... simplistic. But, sure, its virtues are not insignificant.

1 August 2006,What a load of rubbish,"This film is the worst I have ever seen - I had to destroy the DVD after watching the film and that is a first (i might add that horrible movies like First knight, Troy and Titanic have survived my meat-chopper). The movie started OK, but soon it turned into a political-correct travesty. The central morale of the movie is that it's OK to use terror if it has a purpose or an idea behind it (the justification of Nazism, communism and Islam) - and once again under the banner we hate the West i.e. America. But what the director forgot was that this argument could be used to defend the regime V is fighting.

Please stop making movies that presuppose that the audience is unintelligent - it is offending.

13 July 2008,"Not a film, a political propaganda piece","Although it fails as a film in multiple ways (e.g. boredom, repetitions, predictability, ..) I think it is a total failure because it is a political agitprop piece and not an actual movie.

A fascist-catholic law&order government somewhere along the lines of Franquist Spain which eliminated all Muslims, the Labor Party and homosexuals runs Britain in 2020. Yea, right, ..., that's what is to fear judging from the last decades of British politics. Cameron is Hitler and Bush' war made it possible.

I expected a deep study on contemporary authoritarian tendencies (which hold a grip on all(!) parties all across the political spectrum) but was treated to a partisan Liberal agitprop vehicle. Thanks a lot, I'd like to make my own conclusions. It's not like it was the Labour party which holds the reigns since 1997 which has enacted all current anti-Terror laws and has greatly enhanced the power of the state and reduced privacy and freedom of the individual.

Iraq anyone? Nah, people, fear a Catholic-Conservative dictator ...

I'd like my movies thought-provoking and free of at least blunt in your face partisanship. V for Vendetta is lousy.",1
13 April 2006,Vacuous vehicle for a verbose vigilante,"V is indeed for vendetta. But it's also for Vespa, an under-powered vehicle with a monotonous drone that takes forever to get to its final destination. How apt.

Verily, the vessel of vigilantism with the vinyl-veneered visage is a verbal virtuoso who vindicates violence and vexes villains (and viewers) with vacuous values and vows of vengeance whilst voiding his victims with venom. And being such a valiant vouch-saviour of veracity, V's vile and vindictive behaviour is validated.

Ergo, any vociferous vituperation must be vented at the vendors of this vapid and verbose venture because V For Vendetta is a virtual vacuum of vigour, vitality or verve. Or, to borrow the script's most over-used word: ""Boll**ks"".

It's difficult to get behind an effete bore with no face and a Swing Out Sister wig who loves only one thing more than blowing things up: the sound of his own voice. Just when you'd put the bloated cod-philosophical ruminations of the The Matrix Reloaded's Architect from your mind, the Wachowski brothers have effectively given him his own movie.

""Who? Who is but the form following the function of what."" Well thank you, Dr Seuss.

It drones on and on (and on) about freedom of thought and non-conformity before dressing everyone up to look exactly like V in a final scene that would have been deemed too cheesy for an 80s rock video.

And how many times do we have to watch a human kebab emerging from flaming ruins?

Vendetta creator Alan Moore knew what he was doing when he washed his hands of this debacle. Pity Natalie Portman didn't do the same thing. She's dreadful  even if you ignore the accent stuck between Dartford and Durban.

""I wish I didn't have to be here tonight"" says one character. He took the words right out of my mouth.",2
13 November 2007,Viciously Overrated,"I went with high expectations to watch ""V for Vendetta"". The Wachowski's reputation on creating poignant, smart action packed rides preceded them. With ""Matrix"" not only did I get one of the freshest action films but one of the sharpest and deepest scripts ever written. All I can give to this movie as a word is ""pseudo"". V is a pseudo-hero, that prefers to talk and digress than commit the noble acts. James McTiegue knows how to cope with filmical elements, but that's all. V (by Hugo Weaving) doesn't relate to the audience and has no point of contact with any common human, his basis of thoughts are fragile and biased. A hero in an anarchy isn't only interesting (not on the way delivered) but unoriginal. And political. Who could move it to a higher ground? All what it tries to achieve it fails. V is also Pseudo-Cool. His Shakespearean, long dialogs are boring and unfelt. All seems like an improvised catharsis.

What's new on ""V for Vendetta""? Absolutely nothing. No chemistry between the two leads, empty dialogs and many colors and fireworks to dazzle us an distract us from the lack of good action, a steamy screenplay on action or clever and quick on themes and messages. Not only does it fail in delivering a message, ideology or thinking line (no power in communication to the audience) but it also lacks a good atmosphere and tons of action are missing. I hoped for much, maybe. It had many elements to bring new things on the ground. It busted them too soon.

Long story short, this movie is unfelt and shy, keeping a close remark to the comic books, giving it no further nor personal power. Long, it is a feast on neat sound effects an clean CGI (which tries to push us further from the weak adapted script). It could have been a lot more; for you that like new, fresh movies. Skip this. In my humble opinion, it's unnecessary.",3
5 April 2006,I will remember the fifth of November!,"Many people had a very negative reaction towards the second and third part of The Matrix trilogy, something I didn't quite understand but it seems that all the Wachowsky brothers needed to do to get back people's attention (in a positive way) was a change of scenery. Even though they didn't direct V for Vendetta their presence in the film making process and in the dialog is very evident. James McTeigue directs this slightly off key blockbuster and he certainly makes it his own. One could have feared that V for Vendetta would be just another Matrix copy but it isn't. Watch the film and you'll know.

The acting is generally on a very high level in the film but because of great casting but there are a few, just a few glitches. Natalie Portman who we know can act (at least those of us who have seen Closer and Garden State) is fairly good. When I say fairly good it is not because there is anything wrong with her emotional range as she portrays all the emotions of her character with great skill. No, its her accent. Her accent is not always completely believable. I'm not saying that her accent is downright bad because its not (its not like Kevin Costner's accent in Robin Hood) but there are a few moments where it is obvious that she is an American and not British. Stephen Rea does a good job with his character as well and he portrays both the urgency and the doubt of his character in a very satisfactory manner. Tim Pigott-Smith is decent as well. We don't really see his character that much but we see him enough to dislike him which is just what his purpose is. John Hurt is absolutely wonderful as the dictator, Adam Sutler. Even though we only see his face imposed on a wall screen for most of the film he manages to steal every of these scenes with his amazing facial expressions and confident tone of voice. Absolutely marvelous. Hugo Weaving who most people know as Agent Smith plays the title role and he is brilliant. Having to wear a mask throughout the entire movie he has to rely on his voice and on body language and it is here that he proves how incredibly talented he is because his character is incredibly diverse. Also he is given some of the more heavy dialog and he is very good at dealing with it possibly because of his experience from the Matrix films. He also has great sense of comical timing and is sometimes genuinely funny. Hugo Weaving is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. Two thumbs way up.

In terms of style the film is very unique. It isn't like any other action movie spit out by the Hollywood machinery, no. It has its very own style and it sticks to it throughout the entire movie making the overall impression much more polished and believable. The trailer promotes this film as very action packed. Its not. There are only a few excellently choreographed action scenes but that doesn't matter because when you're not thinking about the well written dialog you're looking at some beautifully atmospheric scenes. There are a few slow points in the movie and in these scenes it really helps that there is something to look at because it really helps the movie so that it doesn't come to a complete stop. The soundtrack is a little too vague for my taste, you don't really remember it after the film but at least its not intrusive.

V for Vendetta has come early here in 2006 but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it winds up being one of the best films of the year because it really is a clever, moving and very entertaining film with great acting, suspenseful plot and great action.

28 April 2019,Vengance with a Capital V,"A captivating take of the comic book with the same name, V for Vendetta is not your ordinary revenge or superhero flick. The main character of V is presented like more of a legend then a full flesh superhero bringing justice to a time where everything is thrown into strict government surveillance and totalitarianism. He is more of a whisper and beacon of hope aiming at bringing back the individual in society long overrun government agents and informants killing every thought or action not aligned with the plans and aspirations of the state. It is a gripping story about change, hope, individualism and free will that is surprisingly deep and it leaves a huge impression on every viewer.

27 August 2023,Thought provoking and moving film.,"A wonderful film about consequences, personal integrity, hope and love. This film continues to be relevant and holds up a mirror to the governments of today - who should always be accountable and transparent to their people. The whole cast are outstanding, particularly Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Natasha Wightman. Hugo should have won awards for his performance, he is mesmerising as V. His voice is velvet to my ears.

Dario Marianelli's soundtrack is very moving and adds a beautiful, rousing layer.

I recommend this film to remind us all to keep an eye on what the powers that be are doing.

19 March 2017,A Truly Revolutionary Work of Art,"To sum up the brothers' masterwork in one word is a quite impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that V For Vendetta is 'perfect'. Nathalie Portman as the hapless chick is one weak link because she is not a good actress and her English accent is as bad as the Bridget Jones Diaries but the rest if just brilliant. Making this film all the more compelling is the classical music perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the cult love bestowed upon it, especially the social movements it has aided. It deserves all these awards and more. V For Vendetta is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. The good guys and the bad guys are so complex, so scary and so relevant that it will remain an immortal film forever. Homosexuals, Muslims, freedom fighters, media folk, cops, politicians and regular folks who believe life is just drinking beer and being stupid will benefit from watching this.

12 May 2015,Spectacular!,"V for Vendetta is the movie that I thought was a great comic book because at first, a lot of people attended this film to be the biggest joke ever released in theaters, but after the film was released, I saw the film for the first time on DVD and then I watched a few times of FX and they still show it on TV today.

The film follows an anarchist freedom fighter named V, who attempts to ignite a revolution against the brutal fascist regime that has subjgated the dystopian United Kingdom and exterminated it's opponents in concentration camps.

A girl named Evey, a working class girl caught in V's mission and the detective Finch leads a desperate quest to stop V.

The film has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; libertarians and anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. The film was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. Pictures on Friday November 4, 2005 (which was a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night), but it was delayed and was released on Marrch 17, 2006 to positive critical reception and box office success.

I liked the story and screenplay by The Wachowski Brothers, who directed and wrote The Matrix Trilogy, Speed Racer, Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas and the dialogue is just wonderful on screen.

The cinematography is good and I have to give credit to the late Adrian Biddle for doing such a fantastic great job. The music by Dario Marianelli is just spectacular and amazing. The action sequences are just spectacular and my favorite scene at the end and it was amazing.

The acting is amazing. Hugo Weaving plays V and he does good and I liked him in the Matrix films as Agent Smith and he is good as the vigilante and he is spectacular with Natalie Portman in his scenes. Natalie Portman plays Evey and she is good as she was as Padme in the STAR WARS prequel trilogy and her performance along with Weaving is really amazing.

The supporting cast includes Stephen Rea as Finch and he is amazing, Rupert Graves as Dominic Stone and John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler and they all done a good job in their roles that they are in.

Overall, while I was scared that V FOR VENDETTA would be stupid as hell, it turned out to be one of the best comic book films ever made.

1 May 2010,"Political propaganda full of clichés turn out to be a pathetic, mediocre movie","The Wachowsky brothers just don't know how to tell stories (The Matrix trilogy is barely decent), and they prove me right with V for Vendetta. The story of freedom after repression, directed by the mediocre James McTeigue, is interesting, but the film (script and scenes) is full with cheap political propaganda, clichés and terrible performances (Natalie Portman disappointed me, Hugo Weaving is just ridiculous/stupid with the pathetic detail of the mask and Stephen Rea saved all his acting abilities for this film).

The problem of this film is that, in its mad necessity to do the political propaganda, tries to tell a lot of stories in one. And the result is a horrible, horrible script, where we see the performance of at least 100 characters!! To make the story ""intense"" McTeigue tries to put some ""comedy"" (pathetic humor in the scene where they make fun of the dictator), ""drama"" (the idiotic story of Portman's character entering in jail by the dictator, when later you realize that was V himself who do that (¿?), suspense (not effective AT ALL, of course), and -of course the ""top"" ingredient in American blockbuster industry- action (Not kidding: You'll see fires, bombs, police chasing, bullets all over the film, and, as a closure, a fire games' show).

But why can a movie be so overrated in its home country and so hated in THE REST OF THE WORLD? It's easy: The scenes work as individual scenes, but when you try to put a movie together, the result is terrible. American critics and public liked it since it deals with sensitive topics like totalitarianism, racism, homosexuality and others, and the film at the end has a ""positive message"". Nothing wrong with that, but I won't waste two hours of my life watching a political propaganda that is dressed as a ""movie"". If you haven't watched it, you're lucky. DO NOT WATCH IT!",4
29 October 2009,"""1984"" gone mainstream","While watching V for Vendetta recently, I couldn't help getting a distinct feeling I'd seen something very similar before. And I had, it was a few months earlier and it was called 1984.

1984 isn't as easy to grasp as V for Vendetta. You need to go into the plot to understand what's going on. V for Vendetta makes that a whole lot easier by adding a villain which anyone can get to know and a main character who goes from being conformist to oppositional through the course of the film. In addition there is an ultimate goal instead of the entire film just being a description of life in an completely authoritarian state.

This is all very nice, unfortunately V for Vendetta fails to impress.

The symbolism of November 5th is at times taken too far. Despite the entire plot being built around Guy Fawkes and the blowing up of the parliament, the reasons behind it are too weak to make an entire film out of it. Having said that, I'm sure films have been built on less. Furthermore, the idea of a villain who's there to save the world, or in this case, Britain, has been severely worn out by now. As always, the villain is hiding behind a mask. Why?

All in all, if you liked and understood ""1984"", you'll be disappointed.",
19 March 2006,A hero/anti-hero is out to avenge himself and society against a criminal government.,"I see in V influences of Zorro (the bladed weapons and the costume), Phantom of the Opera (the disfigured face and the mask), Captain America and his nemesis the Red Skull (both products of genetic engineering gone awry), Robin Hood (who robs the villains), The Silent Knight (who, however, unlike V, wasn't loquacious), the comic version of Spiderman (more because of the verbosity than the agility), Alan Ladd's The Black Knight (his chaste devotion to a lady love), Cyrano d'Bergerac (use of the rapier and the look of that Guy Fawkes mask), the beast in the TV series Beauty and the Beast (the elegant prose), and a host of other characters whether masked, disfigured or not.

The storyline is of course similar to those of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. The wonderful difference is that unlike in 1984 where the hero physically survives but loses his freedom of mind, in V for Vendetta, (spoiler ahead), V vicariously survives his death through the many people who take up his challenge to set themselves free by virtually assuming his identity. In Fahrenheit 451, the heroes are really the books which survive through people with the main character taking the identity of a particular book by memorizing it. In V's case, he becomes an idea that survives in the hearts and minds of people. For further comparisons, watch Brazil, another Fahrenheit take-off, which in spite of its inspiring visual effects is quite a ""downer.""

The above having been said, there is no quibbling over the fact that it is a riveting movie. The speeches, repartee and even the obiter dicta which continuously spew from the main character are certainly worth listening to and remembering. I was struck by that quote in Latin on his antique mirror (Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici)which comes from Christopher Marlowe's play The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus based on a German folk tale. Production value is great.

The topic is both current and everlasting : how people in general respond to cleverly manipulative, brutal and tyrannical governments -- initially with timid obeisance until inspired by a few or even one brave person.

This writer should know as he participated in the glorious People Power Revolution of the Philippines, a country under the grip of a rightist and criminal dictatorship for 14 years. Until, one person told us that we couldn't ""allow ourselves to be paralyzed by fear"" and that ""courage is contagious"" made us march in the millions with nothing but flowers and rosaries to topple the Dictatorship.

What intrigues me was V's use of the Guy Fawkes mask and why he derives his inspiration for his revolt from the Gunpowder Plot. Was he a Catholic? Are his creators (Alan Moore and David Lloyd)? The Gunpowder Plotters were disenfranchised Catholics who couldn't bear the repression of their right to worship in the Old Faith. Their churches were confiscated by the monarch and given over to the Church of England while parliament passed laws stripping English Catholics of much of their rights, excluding them from much of public employment and restricting their ownership of property.

The film of course takes deep digs at the proponents of ""The War on Terror"" who use the problem of terrorism to promote their rightist agenda and for their and their friends' power and economic aggrandizement.",8
22 April 2006,Don't be deluded into thinking this is something special...,"...because it isn't.

Unfortunately I went to see this film with high expectations and was totally disappointed right to the end. I am not one of those that has read the novel and think it is a poor adaptation, I have no political agenda and care little for any message that this film may portray.

I didn't find it entertaining, the V character looked like something out of a ridiculous comic book and was overacted and totally pretentious.

If you like batman, spiderman and all those other comic book crap films then go see it, otherwise avoid.

18 December 2006,Masterpiece... mutilated!,"I can't believe what I just saw. This is one of the worst HQ adaptations I've ever seen! They simply mutilated the story, transforming a child into a grown woman (in the original story, she became a woman ALONG the plot), hundred thousands of dead into 80.000, the slow and complicated fall of a dictatorship into the most simple and clean transition of power ever (not one single person of the people got hurt, or had to do anything).

And mainly, they transformed the most ambiguous, complex, mysterious character (he never revealed his sex, or gave any signs of doubt in his actions or love for the girl) into a masked ninja like those seen by the dozens in Hollywood.

Alan Moore was right to deny any knowledge of this.

20 February 2012,Mind blowing masterpiece,"V for Vendetta is a dark and ominous warning to anyone with any sense of history who is paying attention to what is happening in the world today; history does have a way of repeating itself. With a great debt to George Orwell's 1984, the Wachowski brothers have spun an absolute masterpiece.

Britain is used as the country with complete media control, warning the public about protesters who are portrayed as enemies of the state.

""V"" is a masked rebel who travels throughout the land making great proclamations along the way. Hugo Weaving is the undercover hero and he is mesmerizing. He recruits Evey(Natalie Portman's best work, forget ""Black Swan""). Together, they use destructive tactics to awaken the public to the danger of the present fascist government. The great John Hurt is the nations leader and his face is on a big screen with his deep, important sounding baritone, alerting his citizens of the dangers of protest. The message here is important, and it is told in a way which is solidly entertaining. This is one of the best films ever made, a 10 out of 10.",10

20 November 2006,Terrorism is good,"*definite spoilers*

I rented ""V"" because its rating is above an 8 here at IMDb, and these ratings are usually reliable. Not this time. This movie was unbearable at times. The politics were awful. I really needed Hugo Weaving to take off that mask, I wanted to see a human being. Instead we're looking at a psycho clown terrorist for 2 hours, and it's hard to understand what he's saying because his voice is muffled. Although I appreciated some of the fancy English dialogue he spouts off. Natalie Portman was good, but there's always been a soft spot in my heart for her ever since her great performance in ""The Professional"" when she was a cute little girl. She's the only saving grace of this movie, she brings some humanity to the otherwise cold, dark, bleak proceedings.

So his plan is to blow up the English Parliament, and he does. And everyone is happy. Why? Will a new government be formed now? Of who? People, that's who. And those people will run for office, and need a new building to house government proceedings. And these people will then be known as the ""nasty government"". And then everyone will start to hate them to, and then blow up their building. Blowing up buildings is not the answer, but the filmmakers appear to be sympathetic to this ""idea"". They appear to support terrorism.

America and the United Kingdom are not perfect obviously. But they have created the best form of government in the history of civilization, where the people vote and elect who we want to govern us. Fascism is not right around the corner, as much as Hollywood seems to want it to be. Collectively we're too advanced for that. No one is going to let it happen. George Bush? Please, he isn't smart enough for that. And even if he is, guess what, he's gone in a year. In America, we elect our government officials, if we elect a fascist, then i guess that's what the people wanted. If we elect a socialist...etc.

More insulting, the one book in the world most associated with terrorism, is the Koran, yet the filmmakers also seem to like that book. What a joke. And people think this movie is profound? Grow up. It's an insult. Make a movie about real terrorists, not Shakespearean English gentleman who sip tea if they weren't wearing a mask.

So, while interesting and entertaining at times, and Natalie Portman's lovely presence, ""V's"" politics make it an insult to anyone who understands what Democracy is.",4
18 March 2006,Political Satire,"When I go to a movie, it's either to make fun of it or because I really have nothing else to do on Friday nights. Last night, I saw 'V For Vendetta' and I blown away. I didn't go to make fun of it of course, but I was just floored.

The political satire was wonderful. Using Muslims and homosexuals as scapegoats for the things wrong with society and lying about searching for weapons so as to torture citizens in unknown prisons are parallels to today's America, even though the movie took place in the future in England. :) I was amused that the USA had been through a Civil War and was now a Leper Colony. That's a WONDERFUL future for the Americans, wouldn't you say? (I'm being sarcastic of course) I didn't care for some of the slow motion knife twirling, but even that was overpowered by V actually slicing someone. The great thing about this film is that it's almost unbelievable and ridiculous to a point, but because V represents all the people (as Natalie Portman's character states in the film) you feel sucked in and you love V as a hero, you want him to represent you.

I also like how they did have some humor in the film. When Evey wakes up and goes into the kitchen, V is in a frilly apron making her breakfast. When he introduces himself to her in the street, his diction is made up mostly of words that have the lette v or begin with the letter v. He said it all so quickly and it was just amusing.

I suggest this movie for anyone who is in the mood for some Bush-bashing, impressive action sequences, and damn good music.",10

22 July 2008,what a hype... It's just boring...,"It's just boring...

I have not read the comic, and from what I heard, this film is somewhat different and its author does not want to have anything to do with the film. That kinda says a lot.

I'm neutral here, even I'm a NP fan, and that means I really try to like this film. But then it's just boring, and she's definitely not likable in this Evey character.

And when the ad uses ""from the directors of MATRIX"" etc etc, I'm definitely expecting something more. From the trailer, I'm expecting a Sci-Fi action thriller. Sci-Fi, may be... thrill, none can find... action, just don't get me started...

No one needs to argue that it could be a better film, which also means it's not that good as what it is.

THE 2ND RE-VIEW

After 4 years and 9 months, the memory of all the scenes of this film has finally filtered through the black hole of my 'not-so-'Verbose brainwave, along with the unsatisfactory feelings planted unpleasantly 4 years ago...

Of course, not just the stupid ad that frame it with matrix action pack, the tasteless translation of the dialogues, and the crappy visual quality at that time in that cinema...

Simply, this one worths re-viewing!

31 December 2018,A tale for all times,"The message is clear in this film and a decade after it was made it is as relevant now as then, and as in the past and the future.

Today across the world people are being misled by 'fake news' by the press boosting inconsequential stories by fear of 'others'.

Yet we sit there in our own little ignorance pretending it is fine, it is normal to think that children being locked up for no crime is 'right' and 'just'.

Is it a pure coincidence the late and never forgotten John Hurt appeared in V and 1984 from both sides of it ?

We see people march on parliament and the White house, and it does change the narratives, you can not ignore hundreds and thousands from marching but where is today's V to save us ?",9

19 March 2006,Excellent (with some reservations),"Well, just returned from seeing the movie... again.

As a movie, all on its own, I liked it. Obviously, having just watched it a 2nd time is as many days:) If you're looking for a direct translation, you're out of luck. Evy is played differently, other characters are amalgamated, sub-plots eliminated, events transpire out of order, etc -- standard comic-to-movie fare. However, even though much of V's dialog is changed, Hugo Weaving brings V to life in brilliant fashion (although the ""movie V"" is less vicious than the ""book V"").

All the core moments of the book are there, and some scenes are taken verbatim (or close to it) right from the printed page. The general feel has been updated, and subject matter as well to make the story more contemporary.

And therein lies my only major complaint. I have no issue with a film maker creating a *new* film, and injecting it with a current, topical nature (as George Lucas did) but I'm disappointed that the Wachowski Bros felt they had to so alter Alan Moore's work. I can totally understand Moore's reaction to the script, and the simplifying for general movie audiences.

If you haven't read the book in years (I re-read it today for the first time I'm MANY years), or not at all, you may want to see the movie first - otherwise, you may be disappointed. Try to take the movie as an entity unto itself.

23 December 2012,V for Vigorously Brilliant!,"First reaction: WOW!... Second reaction: Why in hell haven't I seen that before?!!... Third reaction: Why did it have to end? I want see it one more time... Fourth reaction: This will unquestionably head to my all- time favorite movies list.

It has been a really long time since I gave a movie the ten stars without second thoughts. And with all those crappy and disappointing movies around, I thought I'd never do it again. Rare are those movies that leave such an impression on me and result in this lingering feeling of enthusiasm. I know, to some people, I might be overrating, but this is exactly my idea of how a perfect movie should be.

I have to admit I was let down knowing that the Wachowskis are the moving force behind this project (I've never been a fan of The Matrix and never will be!) but hell with my prejudices! They have succeeded in turning V from just an impressive comic character to an international, timeless symbol of revolution. The setting of the movie is a futuristic Britain, but the practices of the oppressive government (that strongly reminds me of Orwell's Big Brother) pretty much resembles the practices of all oppressive governments in history. This leaves you wondering: Are the people in power really that stupid? When will they ever learn that peoples cannot be controlled?

James McTeigue did a great job in keeping the movie as symbolic as possible to universalize the experience. The film is not engaged in details; the focus is always on the consequences of the events, not the events themselves. That is why scenes related to the past are repeatedly juxtaposed with scenes from the present so that they would acquire new meanings every time they are shown on the screen (an example is V coming out from the fire in Larkhill). The editing relies heavily on juxtaposition also to stress the unmistakable tone of duality in the movie; fear is juxtaposed with belief, past with present, fire with water, oppression with freedom... etc, there are certainly no gray areas. In addition, the cinematography retains this 'unreal' symbolic effect by using colors that leaves the impression of watching an animated comic book. McTeigue's shots and camera movements are definitely breathtaking - the guy knows what he is doing, without doubt! I also like the fact that the Wachowskis and McTeigue insisted on the anonymity of V, despite the Hollywoodian nagging urge for final revelation.

Hugo Weaving.. Hugo Weaving! How can I possibly love him more?! In V for Vendetta, he has proved that a good actor does not even need a face to perform a role. How did he make me 'see' every facial expression and read his eyes from behind the mask?! I have no idea! It is not just his expressive body language I'm talking about, there was more to it; he character of V radiated a certain aura of grandeur mixed with rebellion and playfulness you can never miss. Hugo Weaving... RESPECT. As for Natalie Portman, she was as great as always, no question about it.

Movies like this one adds up to your life experience, even if you are not appreciative of cinema as art. Watch it, people!",10
9 November 2019,You don't have to cover your face to wear a mask...,"""V For Vendetta"" is a 2005 comic book drama directed by James McTeigue starring Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. As it is sort of a holiday for cinephiles and most of us tend to rewatch it on that particular date, I tried to give it a first time watch myself this year, but unfortunately I had to postpone it due to a punk concert I've visited instead, but now - a few days later - coincidentally on a date that bears a tremendous political importance in Germany, I finally got to see it. So I think this will make it up to it. First of all, this film shows us a dystopian society that has a lot in common with several classic novels. Unfortunately though, there's not enough to it that makes it distinct, it's not as well elaborated as I hoped it would be. There's no explanation of why it happened and doesn't offer any chance to learn about the circumstances. But that's only a minor flaw. What I think was excellently done is the dialogue and the meaning behind every single line. It's so tremendously intelligent and thought provoking and the choice of words is only superb. It effects the viewer to intensively think about the own society one lives in. Furthermore, it's alarming to see how the corrupt government misuses the media for their own, misleading interests and how it is close to it's real-life counterpart at times. It's actually sad to say that the reality doesn't always differ from what is depicted in here. Next to this, the sensational cast really shows that it has top-class actors and actresses in its ranks, especially Portman and Weaving (is it even him, though? Serious question) and it's stylishly filmed and captured the essence of the graphic novel very well. It doesn't recoil to tackle highly inconvenient topics, such as propaganda, mistreatment of human beings and media and the abuse of power. Also, it offers a lot of highly quotable exclamations, but there's still one big issue that prevents it from being a masterpiece: The narrative structure. The film is way to long in general and it has too many scenes that should have been either cut or shortened, but as they are still in the final cut, they perturb the storytelling tremendously. The absolutely well worded scenes and following actions would have had way more impact and would have striked the chord way more unpleasantly if it didn't have so many lengths in it. The buildup of tension was immensely disrupted my multiple scenes that simply lasted to long and, as harsh as it sound, made the tension vanish on several occasions. Each time it seemed to reach the perfect level again, it failed to do so. After seeing this happen a few time it was frustrating. The final act though redeemed the overall unbalanced second act and showed the brilliance it had in the first act. Additionally, it didn't reach the emotional depth I was hoping to see, but that's just mentioned casually. All in all, this dystopian drama knows what it stands for and offers the right approaches, appropriate performances and twists and extremely intelligent lines, besides the disastrous storytelling it's an enjoyable and important flick that makes us reflect our own view to our own society. It's no masterpiece and it's such a pity that it had so much potential to be one.",7
19 March 2006,Has some flaws but the ending makes it all worth it,"I just got home from seeing V for Vendetta and i must say that it was really good. I am not sure what it is but there is something in the story that keeps you hooked. it confuses you but it doesn't you don't know what is going on but you do it is weird but it is not weird it's really good. it is hard to explain just go see it and you'll know exactly what i'm talking about. it is worth the money

Check it out if you miss it in theaters it's not that big of a miss but definitely check it out

If you liked the matrix then you'll like V for Vendetta.

The middle gets a little dragging but don't let that disappoint you be cause trust me. the ending will leave action lovers saying... ""THAT WAS Awesome""

16 March 2006,Showing V for Vendetta in Volatile Philippines,"Now is a particularly interesting time to show V for Vendetta in Manila Philippines.

Bear with me. Let me give a thumbnail sketch of recent political history in the Philippines, which is as straightforward as cooked spaghetti.

Our present President, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, is slowly growing paranoid because she wasn't properly elected. When the previous president, Joseph Estrada, was allegedly caught ""plundering"" the Philippine Treasury, people took to the streets and protested until he got kicked out and Arroyo became president. Then in 2004, Arroyo held real elections this time, to prove she could get elected and not just do a ""Gerald Ford"". She cheated, was elected, and a year later a tape recording of her practically conniving with an election official became public.

Somehow because of public ennui, some savvy political spinning and sheer stubbornness, she managed to survive the crisis (barely) and held on to power.

Last February 25, we were celebrating the anniversary of the February Revolution, marking the time, way back in 1986, when we peacefully kicked out Ferdinand Marcos after he'd been dictator for 20 years. During this year's February Revolution celebration, Arroyo learned of a new coup attempted, and created presidential decree 1017, saying she can close media who are saying something she doesn't like, and she can break up any mass protests. She also arrested known communists and several political opponents under the excuse that they were plotting a coup against her.

Then that same weekend, the Philippine Marines barricaded themselves in their barracks and complained that their commander was unfairly linked to the coup attempt and was replaced. That was also resolved peacefully, but you get the point. The atmosphere right now is ugly. Everyone is frustrated and tense and people are in a ""dare me"" mood, their patience frayed, their tempers are on a hair trigger.

I think she's ignoring this V for Vendetta at her peril. I can imagine her dismissing this ""It's only a film!""

I was watching Vendetta and I was wondering about similarities. The ending was prettier than our original February Revolution, with all those matching masks, but yes, we did walk past barricades, yes the police held their fire. There were no picturesque fireworks to mark the victory, but one frail dictator in a helicopter was good enough for us. Whatever it takes.

I saw the torture scenes and I remember the stories of people (some I even knew personally) who'd experienced similar things. When I was a kid, we also had curfews for a long time. We also heard of the stories of how the privileged, the people in power, had Mercedes Benzes, imported tinned goods, Gucci, Dior, all the stuff that were not only expensive, but unavailable to the politically not connected.

I was watching Vendetta and I was wondering about possibilities, if we could all be outraged again, if we could remember what it was like before she came along, if we could believe that we deserve better leaders because we are not scum of the earth and I remember a saying that people deserve the leaders they elect. We don't deserve her, and we need to show it to everyone.

She's one. She's scared. She's outnumbered. We're many, but dispersed and unfocused. We need to rally together around someone, some symbol.

To be realistic, I don't think this movie will do it. Only the middle class watch movies. Seventy percent of the population, the poor, will watch other movies in Tagalog, or listen to the radio. Movies are bourgeois entertainment.

Maybe some incident, something that will make everyone mad, like the accidental shooting of a little girl. Something will ignite the situation. Maybe in the next six months, something drastic will happen again. SHE knows it. That moled midget. It's only a matter of time.

V for Vendetta, written in the 80's, read in the 90's, filmed in the new millennium, reminding me of possibilities. Hmmm....",8

20 October 2021,A Bloody Masterpiece!,"I am speechless. First of all the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.

Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there.

Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.",8
25 March 2006,V for Vonderful,"V FOR VENDETTA Written by Andy Wachowski & Larry Wachowski Directed by James McTeigue

""I wish I wasn't afraid all the time but  I am."" A young lady speaks these words to a man in a mask who has imprisoned her in his home. This time in captivity is the most free she has ever felt. London waits outside these walls, as does her job, her friends and what she calls home. The insides of these walls are lined with art; the room is filled with history, music, colour, life. The mask the man is wearing is a Guy Fawkes mask, in honour of the man who once plotted to blow up the parliament building in London as part of a Catholic plot to overthrow the British government. The man behind the mask, known simply as V, plans to finish what Fawkes started centuries before and blow up parliament in the name of the British people so that they can reclaim the freedoms of life they gave up to their government out of fear years before. While the government and media, naturally controlled by the government, proclaim V a terrorist, V sees himself more as an artist. For V, the artist is one who uses lies to tell the truth while politicians use lies to cover the truth up. The men behind this brave film clearly feel the same as they make a terrorist into a sympathetic protagonist and draw undeniable lines between the ruling British government of V's world and the current political relationship of the United States government and it's people. As writers, the Wachowski brothers choose to highlight fear as the motivating factor in people's lives but go so far as to implicate the government as the major perpetuator of that fear. This is not a fresh accusation but the Wachowski's go boldly further to accuse the government, fictional or otherwise, of not only maintaining a stronghold on it's people through fear but originating that fear to begin with, subsequently forcing the people to abandon the original motivating factor in their lives, love.

The frightened young lady being held captive by V is Evey (Natalie Portman). Director James McTeigue, longtime protégé of the Wachowski's, instantly links Evey and V together in the opening sequence of the film by juxtaposing the two characters getting ready for their evening. They are both fixing themselves in the mirror, putting on boots. They both watch the same television news program and both shut it off at the same obnoxious point in the commentator's monologue. They are both putting on their armour to protect themselves in the night, her from harm, him from human connection, and they both have similar views and ideals. The major difference, she's going out to visit a colleague and he's going out to blow up a building. As Evey, Portman is composed and confident. Throughout the course of the film, her character learns to open eyes that have been closed in fear since she was a small child when she witnessed her parents' abduction by a government task force. With her eyes wide open, she can finally stare fear down and see there is a grander design that she is but a small yet vital part of. Hugo Weaving plays the role of V although it may be more appropriate to say the role of V is voiced by Weaving, as we never see him without his mask. Weaving's delivery is both eloquent and polite making for a poetic and charming terrorist. Together, V and Evey are a delightful couple. McTeigue puts them in very simple and close situations, like sharing a breakfast V prepares for her or cozying up on the couch to watch V's favorite film, ""The Count of Monte Christo"", which Evey enjoys but finds sad as the hero chooses duty over love.

Evey's quest is in all of us and we all must overcome our fear, as must she. Placing the viewer on par with a terrorist and his apprentice is what makes V FOR VENDETTA so poignant and effective. At a critical moment in Evey's journey, which can also be ours, she must give herself over to faith and allow herself to be the person she wants to be. Her future self must choose to leave her present self behind her for the present self is too heavily controlled by her past to do what needs to be done to effectuate change. Explosions will ensue and life will be forever changed. It is the change that we cannot fear for we have sacrificed so much of ourselves to that fear. V FOR VENDETTA is dark and bleak. The citizens need a deep extremism, shown here in a stylized pairing of bombs and fireworks set to Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"", to wake them from their complacency. This is where my fears come into play. I fear that we are far too comfortable, far too afraid, and far too apathetic to respond to the call to overthrow those who impede our growth as individuals and as a species. I fear we believe change will come but that it will just happen without any work on our part at all.

V FOR VENDETTA is playful and cheeky. It is exciting and insightful. It can be very wordy but I like wordy. Ultimately, its very root is fearless and that bravery will energize and invigorate the viewer.",8
18 March 2006,"To call this ""fiction"" would be an injustice.","V for Vendetta - World War III has come and gone, and the mistakes of the past have come 'round full circle. The people of Great Britain, in fear of the plague and chaos that resulted in the ""States"", have handed their rights away to the church, and a Hitler-esquire ruler (John Hurt) for protection. But not all hope is lost, for an anarchist has come to save us from ourselves. His name is V (Hugo Weaving) and he has not forgotten ""freedom"" and it is not just a word to him.

This is an excellent movie. It hits hard the problems of today. As we find ourselves being robbed of our civil liberties by a pack of sniveling fear-mongers. As we find ourselves in a world where our religion has quickly become the only thing that matters, and crimes committed by those that claim to be heads of religion are allowed to get away with horrid crimes. As we find that the line between ""hero"" and ""villain"" is quite easy to cross, if it exists at all.

Hugo Weaving deserves an Oscar nomination at least. He won't get it, but someones got to admit that it's pretty damn hard to act and show emotion and charisma inside a mask. He is a formidable presence as the charming and devilish anarchist V. Natalie Portman isn't quite as good, but she's still very convincing as the vulnerable, but not too vulnerable Evey.

As one of my earlier comments might have indicated, I was grimly satisfied at the inclusion of a pedophile priest. SOMEONE had to include it in a movie sometime.

The effects are spectacular and the dialog is too. I enjoyed the brutal hard hitting fight sequences quite a bit.

It will be snubbed all around, but V for Vendetta is an amazing movie with numerous references to our own situation with George W. Bush, the 1930s syphilis testings, the the Nazi rise to power and the Holocaust (all four of which could occur over and over again).

12 June 2014,root of evil is not man but idea,"This movie carries an extremely important, i guess one of the most important concepts for the present world. Except for its controversial use of two girls to bring out this concept, this movie is extraordinary. It must be noted that when some universal idea has to be conveyed or told, one must use some other similar universally excepted track.

Some amazingly great ideas find their ways in this movie , including 'evil has no face', 'evil is just an idea in human', 'evil is not man but a thought tree'. Each and everything in the movie made it great, except it being struck to a fixed single idea freedom of homosexual. I wish they should have used something much proper. This shows the haste and a bit less thoughtfulness of the director.

6 May 2006,Equilibrium did it much better.,"This movie is transparent simplified movie logic wrapped around mainly Equilibrium with a little bit of Zorro tied in. With all the great guts carved out and replaced with thinly-vield bombastic allegories and metaphors comparing the current administration to Nazi Germany. I do consider myself to be pretty solidly 'left field' politically--and who dosen't hate Bush, but wow... what brazen left wing propagandistic popcorn. I think a little bit of discretion and couth were definitely in order.

The movie offers nothing new or original, except an extremely thinly veiled jab at the current administration and the direction its heading, dumbed down with 1 dimensional action hero movie logic and the tired old fight-the-power futuristic anti-totalitarian theme.

Also, you can't make honest real world allegories while villainifying your subject to the point of ludicrousness.

19 March 2006,V for Vendetta is V for Very Good,"V for Vendetta V for Vendetta takes place in the near future (2020) in London, England. After disengaging itself from a ""war America started,"" terror attacks  including an horrific biological attack that killed thousands  have resulted in a totalitarian government there. Using tools ranging from strictly enforced curfews to surveillance cameras, and from ""disappearing"" political activists to government-controlled news outlets, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) is firmly in control. That control is exercised, of course, for the security and good of England's citizens.

A man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) disagrees. His stance against the Chancellor's government is two-fold: he hates what the government has done to him personally, and he loves freedom. In a series of violent attacks he personally orchestrates, he sets out to prove his point to the largely oblivious population.

Through no real fault of her own, a young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) meets the mysterious masked V in a dark alley where V saves her virtue from a trio of government-appointed citizen informers (aptly called ""fingermen""). Employed by a government television station, Evey doesn't occupy a place of authority but is positioned quite well enough to know that the news anchors often must relay stories that they personally know to be untrue.

Evey's knowledge is only further cemented when the newscasters try to pretend that some explosions the night before were the result of a planned demolition. It's also more than enough to make her fear that a visit from the state police could be targeting her. In reality, however, it's not her the police are after. It's V himself.

V is at the television station this November 5 to claim responsibility for a bombing as well as to challenge the people of London to join him on the following November 5  Guy Fawkes' Day  to destroy Parliament itself. V only narrowly escapes the police who are there to arrest him, and again by accident, Evey gets involved.

Meanwhile, the ongoing machinations of the Chancellor and his minions serve to show just how far a tyrant will go to hold on to power. But when the anguish of Evey's friend, Deitrich (Stephen Fry) and a woman she'll never meet (Valerie, played by Natasha Wightman) offer a heart-rending counterpoint from the other side, Evey isn't the only one whose loyalties and motivations are conflicted!

Natalie Portman proved she can really act in her superlative turn in 2004's Closer. She stays at that level here. Hugo Weaving's face is never seen, but his voice alone is terrifying, poignant, and powerful by turns. The supporting cast is also very good, particularly Stephen Fry who offers up a wonderful rendering of a publicly resigned man who slowly lets his own disillusionment grow into some brave action of his own.

Though much touted as being a movie from the same men who brought us the brilliant Matrix series, in reality the Wachowski brothers are responsible for the screenplay alone (they're also credited as producers). Director James McTeigue is instead behind the cameras here, and he ably brings a complicated story to life.

The sets are spectacular and the effects even more so. But I maintain that it's the story itself that makes V for Vendetta as impressive as it is. I really enjoyed my movie-going experience simply from the standpoint of suspense and entertainment; but what really got to me was the view of the near future and its horrifying plausibility. Though I had a hard time divorcing the two points for myself, I can tell you that my friend's 17 year-old son and a buddy saw V for Vendetta this weekend as well, and neither has shut up about it since. They don't care anything about politics, and yet they both loved it. So did I.

POLITICAL NOTES: There is literally no moment of this film that doesn't have a political impact.

In the movie, political activists are watched and sometimes punished; in America today, we know that, at a minimum, many are surveilled. On screen, we see ""for your safety"" extolled by government officials; today, more than a few laws, including the freedom-stealing PATRIOT Act, are based on those very notions. In the film, ""fingermen"" are everywhere to report on their fellows; today, we've been encouraged to do the same, up to and including the infamous TIPS program.

There are many more parallels to name, and most of them are at least as awful as the few listed above. V for Vendetta takes place in the near future, and impossible to watch the movie, as enjoyable as it is, without wondering just how ""near"" that future really is. Perhaps an early warning can help us avoid the nasty fate  as well as the very violent ultimate release from that fate  depicted in the movie. And while V for Vendetta is certainly not a movie to be taken literally, there's some very real and legitimate early warning here that I personally believe should be heeded.

FAMILY SUITABILITY: V for Vendetta is rated R for ""strong violence, (and) some language."" This is not a movie suitable for young children either in its overall topic or its rendering. From its opening scenes of the execution of Guy Fawkes in 1605 to the penultimate (beautifully choreographed, I might add) fight, the blood and guts are fairly graphic. In addition, everything from Shakespeare to classic movies are quoted or somehow otherwise involved, and the politics is sometimes complicated in and of itself. This is not a film for the faint of heart or those unable to understand such vocabulary or ideals. But for the rest, whether they consider V a terrorist or a freedom fighter in the end, there's so much of thought-provoking value here that I'm inclined to consider V for Vendetta required viewing.",8

The film does not have that much action in it. When the fights do happen they are well worth the wait. V is very imposing on screen. When the fight scenes happen they are very stylish and well done.

26 March 2007,"Instead of this, try reading Orwell","V for Vendetta was a weak attempt at political commentary and a simplistic illustration of revolution. I couldn't help but laugh at the ending with the fireworks and people. I think I'm going to make a movie that harps on peoples ignorance and emotions. I'm going to fill it with images of death for shock factor, make knives fly in slow motion (instead of bullets like they did in the matrix) because I can't think of anything original, and make my protagonist hero/terrorist speak so ""eloquently"" so that the movie seems smart because no one can understand the alliteration blather coming from behind that mask. The one thing I was impressed by was Hugo Weaving's ability to recite his lines. Natalie Portman was garbage as always. Characters: all 1-dimensional. The action was generic and predictable. When it comes to IMDb ratings, some people jump to say that this is ""the worst movie ever"" and give it one star. That is silly as anyone with a brain can see that there is a tremendous difference between it and ""SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses"" which holds a bottom spot on this site. However, it is not even close to worthy of a top 250 berth. 6/10",6

17 March 2006,Amazingly Bad Social Commentary Flick,"I went to see this movie this afternoon ... opening day here ... and was very, very disappointed.

So disappointed that I left the theatre after waiting for an hour for things to improve. I almost never walk out of a movie. But it was really that bad this time. And I wasn't alone. It was a late afternoon showing, and the rows I was sitting in ... up front (I always like sitting up front) included just 3 other folks. All seated separately. The other 3 had all walked out before I did.

There were two basic features of the movie that really moved it into the almost utterly awful category for me.

One was the figure of V himself. Hugo Weaving's vocalization of the character as far as I could tell was fine; but V and the script built around V were amazingly bad. V is sort of a Zorro with a soft, urbane English accent, and a Mask that seems incongruously similar to that used in the Halloween movie series, and a penchant for quoting Shakespeare. He's sort of a wimpy Bard spouting wisdom and culture and death and murder and revolution in such winning tones that we're apparently supposed to be as captivated as his audience by him. When he appears on TV, the movie shows several scenes of The Common Man, Woman, and Child, watching and listening with rapt mesmerized attention to a vividly unappealing super hero with soft, wimpy tones and patronizing metro-sexual language that I just can't imagine The Great British Nation ... or the Great Any Nation ... finding so deeply appealing. I found especially obnoxious the repeated scenes in an English pub, with several working class blokes staring mesmerized at this clown spouting faux Shakespeare. Instead of cracking jokes and mockery at such (to use a term often used in other connections) Bollux.

The other feature of the movie that rendered it extraordinarily unpleasant from my angle was its ham-fisted social commentary that boiled down to: Terrorism is just Another Name for Legitimate Resistance to Tyranny. In this day and age, that kind of moral equivalence is unusual mostly in its poor taste in this movie: to make the obvious even more obvious, there's a scene where the Natalie Portman character goes into a room full of the most amazing political kitsch and finds it Oh So Meaningful. So we see a portrait of a Union Jack titled ""Coalition of the Willing"" with a Nazi banner across it; and a picture of Margaret Thatcher (I think?) bowdlerized to evidently reflect some mockery that we're supposed to applaud. The Regime is composed of Bishops, Clergy, and other figures of Faith who are all Bad (one Bishop's fondness for under-aged females makes a particularly nasty scene) and other Evil People. I don't mind at all social commentary but when it's this ham-fisted and this silly it becomes to me just coarse and silly and stereotyped. It makes me feel like I'm watching an old propaganda film out of the old Nazi or Communist ""Socialist Realism Theatre"" days. Above all, though, the repeated vision of Terrorism as meaning Justice in Action is to me deeply offensive in these days after 9/11 and other such horrible tragedies. I think even Guy Fawkes ... the nasty real-life English terrorist on whom V is supposedly modeled ... must be rolling in his grave at such nonsense.

Acting was decent but unexceptional, cinematography competent but uninteresting ... there was one sort of interesting scene early on from a London rooftop. Other than that, though, the script was just so horribly dismal as to make this a truly and amazingly bad movie.",2

2 October 2016,ideas are bulletproof,"Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, 'V for Vendetta' is a political thriller set in a fascist-ruled England in the 2020s. A film that delves into the political side of oppression and anarchy, whilst running a somewhat emotive and heartfelt story of a character in betrayal, 'V for Vendetta' is a visually stunning and extremely smart flick with some fantastic performances from Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (whose English accent is rather impressive). The film is nowadays considered a cult classic, and rightfully so, even to the extent that the film has been utilised by governments as an allegory of oppression.

I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.*

21 November 2013,"Beautiful, but missed the point, either cowardly or with an agenda","The movie is as beautiful as its source material. Thank you for leaving us readers at least that. The problem is, V is about politics, and that's where the movie drops the ball. The ending fails to be faithful, smart, or even uplifting, as I believe it tries to be.

In V, Alan Moore shows his understanding and views about anarchy, what it means, what it could be. The comics is an entertaining essay; in great part it's about anarchy opposing fascism. The movie is propaganda about today's watered ideas of democracy, opposing concentrated power. Which is lame.

A strong example is about who and what an anarchist is. Without spoiling, V himself is one type, and the girl represents a very different type. The future of V is carefully crafted in the book and is utterly meaningful to the tale; to his movie's counterpart, things just happen; blandly.

OK, let's just say that you don't care about the book. You're happy with the film's denouement, the democratisation of the Guy Fawkes mask, etc. When you see hundreds of people marching, in silent ranks, all dressed the same, in black, wearing the costume and mask of one man/leader/messiah, do you think of democracy ? I don't. That's the epitome of creepy. Even with fireworks.",5
28 August 2022,Bulletproof ideas,"No matter how you see it, be it by putting the DVD into the player, buying a ticket to watch it on the big screen or by streaming it. Is it not fascinating, when you really reflect on it, how a physical object can potentially be able to project a riveting and powerful piece of art like this one?

While the mature and well-handled theme is not set in the modern dialectal confrontation between anarchy vs fascism , but rather the universal conflict between freedom and tyranny. It consequently becomes an ode to freedom.

It loved V as a character, which mainly due to his smartness and delightful, calm eloquence of V. Weaving is laudable.

He is the center of an elaborate, well-thought and constructed plot, that engages you. You want to unravel the mystery with the characters.

The deliberate grayish cinematography really enforces the institutionalized depression emanating from totalitarian regimes.

The set pieces are well-done.

Furthermore, the movie also delivers on the action, with two particularly memorable vicious scenes.

The ending is probably one of the most memorable ones in recent cinema, due to the symbolic weight of it as well as the pompous use of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Ouverture.

Great, thought-provoking story and direction.",
3 February 2007,"Hey buddy, lose the mask and shut up.","Seriously... ""V for Vendetta"" boldly explores a dark political world that sometimes resembles an ideal frighteningly close to our own. Great material, right? But too much of the story is delivered in tedious monologues and philosophical rants by the title character, V, who has a goofy mask fixed to his face. So you spend half of the movie staring at an inanimate object preaching to you or is that the point? I don't care. The fact that V is played by bad boy Hugo Weaving doesn't even alleviate this. Natalie Portman, however, provides a gutsy performance and a welcome change from that Padme crap. And John Hurt never hurts.

30 June 2015,V for VigilanteStylish and Dark Film with Political Prognosis,"Author of the Graphic Novel, Alan Moore, decided to Remove His Name from all Hollywood Movies after some initial Bad Experiences with His Work being Made into Films. So His Decision concerning this Particular Film is Not singular or Specific to the Movie, it is a blanket Distancing from the Medium.

This is a Divisive, Thought Provoking, Controversial Film and is equally Embraced and Eviscerated by Politicos on both the Left and the Right. It's use of Vigilantism and Terrorism against the State has Raised Eyebrows High, but seeing that it is Set in the Future and a Fascist Regime is ruling with an Iron Hand, the ""Revolution"" is Reasonable.

The Politics here are Not Subtle and Never are the Bad Guys in Question. V is a Vigilante created by Monsters and EV (Natalie Portman) thinks at first He has become a Monster. But as things Unfold there is No Doubt where Things Stand, and what Has to be Done.

Folks looking for an Action, Comic Book, or Superhero Movie might be Disappointed. This is a Dark and Stylish Thriller with Noir sensibilities and a Desperate Disposition.

Hugo Weaving as V, gives a Difficult Voice and Body language Performance that is Remarkable. The supporting Cast also adds Gravitas to the Unsettling proceedings and the Film becomes a Surreal situation Not Far removed from the Present Day in some respects.

The Pacing seems a Bit Off now and then and the intertwining of Plot Elements isn't the Smoothest, but Overall it is a Great and Topical Treatise on the Signs of the Time with Classic References and Romantic Ruminations of Idealism and the Fight Against Evil.",9
10 September 2006,"It's good, but it's not great.","I love sci-fi films. And I also love films that depict a utopian fantasy society, or dystopian rundown waterhole. I lump these into two different categories. Utopian society films are usually films where everything seems to be great, but when in actuality there is something very wrong. The public enjoys great health and luxury, but behind the facade the public is being oppressed. Examples like Equilibrium, Rollerball and Brazil come to mind.

Dystopian films usually depict a society where everything is just outright wrong, but freedom still exists. The world is, pretty much, a crap hole in either a very literal sense or for the people who live there. The world makes no attempt to cover up the fact that it is a crap hole, and the people don't really seem to mind either. Here we have Blade Runner and Gattaca.

The V for Vendetta film falls into the former category, but I wonder if you wouldn't put the comic book in the later category? In the film everything is to black and white. The good guys is too much of a good guy, the bad guy is an over-the-top bad guy and clichés are numerous.

If you just watch the film without prior knowledge about the comic book, you won't really care. But if you've read the comic book and know what it could have been, you'll realize that there could have been so much more to this film and a lot of it's faults are exposed. Stylistically this film is very good, but plot wise it's... not so good.

We've seen all of this before. A revolutionary fighting to bring down the corrupt oppressive society, where a dictator rules supreme. The twist is that this revolutionary is using modern day terrorist tactics, involving murder and bombings to further his cause. But since the film depicts him as very much of a good guy, his motives are never really questioned by the audience, like they SHOULD be. He's a good guy fighting for justice and revenge, what's not to like? Well, the problem is that we've seen this before. To many times, perhaps. The mere fact that he's using drastic measures isn't enough to make us dislike him.

And the bad guy? Well, compared to him, our good guy revolutionary looks like Jesus himself. This makes the film a bit dull, because we can all pretty much pinpoint exactly how the plot is going to develop from scene 1 and in the end we're right.

Now, the film is very well made. It's very stylistic and builds up quite nicely. If you like these kind of films, you'll like this one. The acting is great, the visuals fantastic and the atmosphere likewise. But the plot is lacking, and there's nothing really unique about this film.

So I suggest you watch this film if you're interested in this theme. But don't fool yourself, there are a lot of films out there on the same subject that are better. Including all of those I mentioned in the first two paragraphs.

23 June 2006,In awe of such masterly artistically political propaganda,"When The Matrix came out i was very suspicious, and having just seen V for Vendetta, now I'm sure. The Wachowski brothers may not actually be real life revolutionaries but they sure do understand them. Completely and utterly. Not since i read Jack London's ""The Iron Heel"" have i been in awe of such masterly artistic communication. Virtually everything you see on the screen is designed to heighten the impact of the plot and dialogue - the costumes, bleak weather and mood, everything - it's so interesting to watch. I remember raving about how they didn't waste a single second in any scene of the first Matrix and they've basically done it again with this film. The director could maybe have saved a further 2 to 3 minutes but that's it.

But it's the plot, dialogue, theme and ideas behind the movie that make it so thrilling to watch. As a revolutionary sympathiser that is. For those who think Che Guevara was a cold blooded murderer, and Fidel Castro a dictator, you're probably a bit shaken if you actually sat through the entire movie but you definitely wouldn't say it was much good. You'd probably want people to quickly move onto their next movie fix, like those guys at the end of The Truman Show who wanna know what else is on after Truman signs off for the last time.

For those who think the Cuban revolution is one of the most inspiring & heroic stories of all time, much better than what fiction can come up with because it is real and still undefeated (yay!), then i guarantee there's a good chance that if you go to see V for Vendetta, you're probably going to whoop and sing out ""Yay!"" like I did when something happens to a big building that represents the current political system.

Where the flaw of the first Matrix film was the implication that a saviour would deliver us from the system, Vendetta makes no such mistake. I thought the dominoes was a nice touch in case there were some unclear about the masses part of the answer to the social problems caused by the current system.

This movie will reverberate for many years to come because it manages more than any other in recent times to express the real issue of the day. And that is a tiny rich minority have vast power which is wielded through State machinery. Of the total amount of Terrorism that happens in the world, probably 99% is State Terrorism and the rest individual. The Bush gang think they can get away with the charade in Iraq, but then films like Vendetta are released into the wild and the similarities are just too many and obvious for people to not at least think about it for a bit. But the film also looks into the near future and what doing nothing will lead to. But not in any sappy, liberal way - the message is its gonna take lots of guts and courage and it will probably scare the living sh*t out of you.

One more thing: V for Vendetta introduces a completely new side of politics to all those without much political consciousness. If you go to see the movie, you might just come out a changed person. You might not have gone through the hell that Evey Hammond did (a very effective plot twist, my awe is squared) to experience a sufficient enough radicalisation to become a hard-core Marxist-quoting revolutionary overnight, but again, it introduces a side of politics sometimes completely alien. In any country where the people have no real interest in voting in 'democratic' elections (like Australia where I live for example), I hope they go ""oh, so that's what politics really is ..."". If that is their reaction, the Wachowski brothers would most likely see their film as a success.

Sirs, you have more than made up for selling out with Matrix 2 and 3. I am in awe ... 10 out of 10.",10
11 October 2007,"Varying from Vapid to Vacuous to Vulgar, this Video makes me Vomit","This flicker is badly acted, with hammy dialog and horrible alterations to the comic. If you liked the comic, don't watch this movie. If you like movies, don't watch this movie. All I ask as a viewer is that the movie respect its viewers and itself. This movie is vile, which is a real pity, because it could have been really interesting. The source material certainly is and, no, I don't expect movie adaptations to stick 100% to their source material (like Sin City, which, let's face it, was wooden). I don't expect to be written down to, though. Though I should have expected that Hollywood would remove all the sophistication and cleverness they could lay their hands on. Gah. The dialog. The dialog. Lord help me, the dialog.

Oh, yeah: the costume was cool.

6 December 2006,Unintentionally Funny 1984-Type Movie,"I saw V is for Vendetta with a group of eight. We are the type who likes action and sophisticated films. This film did not make the cut; we came out laughing wondering what a waste of time. Overall, I think we thought it was a 4 of 10. I give it lower since it is a waste of Natalie Portman, John Hurt, and Stephen Rhea and lots of money. What makes it silly is that it takes a neo-Nazi totalitarian regime and gives it credibility in a future-England-like society. I can't see that happening. John Hurt was easy to see through as an evil prime minister. But can millions of people be that naive? Perhaps in a less sophisticated or educated society or a third world culture. But almost definitely not a modern western society. Terrorism conducted by V in his mask becomes justified to combat Nazi-like totalitarianism. OK, but conducted by a man who wears a silly mask? Is that truly credible? Brazil and 1984 (also with John Hurt) are far better films (and still not great films). Furthermore, the political monologues by V were not inspiring. It was like watching a clown trying to recite a serious Hamlet monologue. Hard to take serious. Even the cinematography is not particularly great but at least a bit atmospheric. The ending was downright silly as the climax builds up to a date to remember so the movie claims...but perhaps a date to forget if you watch the end...plain dumb. At least give the audience more credit for a believable movie.",2

5 August 2006,Must see,"A compelling movie with a strong message for current times. In the not too distant future a government uses fear of terrorism, disease, and chaos to keep people in line. Anyone not true to the party line is traitorous and is eliminated. These messages are timeless and have occurred numerous times in the history of mankind. V is the current definition of a terrorist that uses his strengths to try and convince the people of his country to repel the insidious leaders that have implemented a fascist regime. A few simple story lines are all that is necessary to bring the characters to life with a strong script and impeccable acting. How many people would it take to expel fascism and take back a country from evil wearing the garb of faith and armed with the power of governance? How many people are brave enough to choose freedom at any cost? Can individuals find the will among themselves to rise up?

2 April 2006,Sensuality Sets it Apart,"In our present Hollywood time of overwhelming sexualized imagery I really loved the relationship in this movie. The sensual images of the dancing a formal distance apart but arms entwined, the gentle hand on the back and the intimate exchange of breath. No humping butts and naked boobies and yet more erotic. Along these same lines, Hugo Weaving, who played V has an incredible voice and it gave a lot of power to a faceless character which fed into the eroticism.

I would have liked to have known more about V - that part of the story felt unsatisfying but all in all, this was a very good Swashbuckling Zorro Meets Phantom of the Opera Meets A Few Other Things But With A More Sensual Love Story film.

P.S. I saw the film again and I am just entranced by Hugo Weaving's powerful voice for V.

20 March 2006,Visionary,"Some of us read the book by Alan Moore many years ago. Some of us regard it as at least as good as his oft-lauded opus, Watchmen. Some of us were very wary indeed when we heard there was to be a film version... and even more so when it transpired that Moore himself had refused to have anything to do with it... to be credited, even.

Some of us went to see it anyway and are so very glad we did. What an amazing film. In an unusual climate of heavy political movie-making comes this: a fantasy thriller with all the adventure, action and, well, silliness you could want, but nevertheless a political message you cannot ignore to boot. If anything, Moore's strident left-wing opinions are given even more weight than his own original work carries  now that the reader must find them a quarter of a century out of date. Surely, he must be proud of this film and the ingenious way it has updated his ideas to reflect the current political situation?

You can pick holes, of course. I got used to Portman's imperfect accent a lot more quickly than I did the Wachowski brothers' occasionally overcooked outsider's take on scripting English characters, though. And V's introduction  all 'v'-word alliteration  is badly misconceived and had me worrying for a minute or two. But things soon settle down and though it's been a few years, I can say that almost all the major examples of Moore's brilliance that I could recall and was hoping would have been translated from the page are here on screen - meaning moments of considerable shock and horror, beauty, emotion and profundity. The double-barred-cross softening of the fascist-church imagery is a tiny niggle in the face of scenes such as: the padeophile Bishop; Evey facing her fear; the whole Valerie / The Salt Flats story; the bedside chat - victim and villain reversed; and the daring (in light of all-too-recent horrendous real-world events) inclusion of the London tube bomb, exactly as in the original.

Better still, the additional/extrapolated material  lots of stuff about the Koran and Muslims being persecuted, the 'formerly United States', bird flu etc.  and the whole subplot involving Stephen Fry's character (ultimately harrowing in the extreme) are actually improvements on Moore's anti- Thatcher polemic. This story could scarcely be more relevant in the now. Sue Perkins, reviewing the film on ITV, was annoyed that the future fascist British government is depicted as having come out of the Conservative Party - fearing the film- makers had missed a trick, but in fact, herself, completely missing the subtler point that our current Labour administration (which she is not alone in deploring certain actions of), in moving the 'centre' further to the right, is indeed undermining the left-wing alternative for our democracy and making it more likely that a far-right movement such as is depicted in the film could feasibly emerge (the gods forbid). Where else would it come out of? The distopia shown in the film is precisely what the worst subset of Tory supporters  specifically Daily Mail readers  want for our country!

Another critic who got it wrong was Jonathan Ross (on the BBC's Film programme). He absolutely hated V for Vendetta and urged his viewers to give it a miss. Thank goodness I didn't listen  fortunately, he'd mentioned that he found Moore's comic 'overrated', so I was able to add another 'wary' to my expectations  but on the other side of the balance. That balance is now tipping  the film magazines are awarding 3 and 4 stars out of 5, and the mixed audience I sat with on a Sunday afternoon were certainly gripped from start to finish. Don't miss it!",9
19 March 2006,It will make you believe...,"This is probably the most powerful movie I have ever seen and definitely one of the best movies I have seen in the past year (this is counting 2005). From the previews I thought it would be awesome and being a comic book geek I've been eagerly awaiting it for almost a year. Now normally when something gets hyped up like that there is no way it can live up to your expectations, but this simply went above and beyond them.

The movie's theme is not original, in fact it's basically the sequel of 1984 (both movies cast John Hurt as well, though in completely different roles), but that's not important. I love movies that are all about governments going too far and the people finally standing up to them. It inspires me to believe that we can really make a difference in our world, but I've never seen a movie with this theme that has moved me so much. Yes, it's moved me so much that I have begun to use clichés in order to explain my feelings towards it.

""I laughed, I cried, it moved me Bob.""

There were a few things that rubbed me the wrong way, like Natalie Portman's accent. Now, I have nothing against Natalie Portman, I love her in fact. I think she is a great actor and I think she did an incredible job in this movie, but her accent just sounded really fake. I suppose we can't win 'em all... I also wasn't entirely sure if I liked some of the director's (James McTeigue) choices in the fight scenes. In the last action scene with V vs. Creedy and his goons they made it look like a comic book which in turn made it look a little too Matrixy for my taste, but I still think it was a cool scene.

I recommend that you go and watch this movie in the theatres, because it is most certainly worth the money and if you are reading this too late to do that, go and buy the DVD. You will not regret it.",10
16 April 2022,Absolutely prophetic and frightening,"Even though this was originally developed (as a comic) in the 80's and made in the mid 2000s and people think of it as being synonymous with Bush. Unfortunately, and frightingly it reflects so much of the rise of Trump, social media and the Covid Pandemic. But we didn't realise at the time. Needless to say it takes on a different type of sinister and cynicism then it even originally did if you saw this around the time of release.

It's done so well though, with great acting by brilliant actors. And even though dystopian films are not my favorite I really liked it when I saw it about a dozen years ago. So much so I used one of the speeches in an acting workshop. Seeing it again I agree with myself but again as mentioned in the introduction it feels even darker and more concerning. The future is now unfortunately, a thought provoking, solid movie.

16 April 2023,Superb.,"I recently purchased the 4k disc of this, and settled down to watch it last night.

I haven't seen the film for a few years, certainly not since the pandemic, and watching it now shows it was in some ways, quite a prophetic film.

I've always loved the film, but it just seems to have taken on extra meaning with what's happened in the past few years.

I've seen some reviews saying the political views espoused are naive, I disagree.

The performance from Hugo Weaving is fantastic, he gets you to totally believe in his character with body movement and vocal intonations alone, no, mean feat.

A masterpiece in film making.

The only criticism of the 4k disc, is it's yet another where you have to turn up the volume to hear the dialogue, then rush for the volume control when the sound effects kick in.",9

3 April 2006,More than a shoot -'em-up,"V for Vendetta had the makings of a typical Hollywood movie filled with explosions, blood and violence. But the Wachowski brothers created a film with multiple levels of meaning that the trailers failed to even begin decoding. It is set more than 20 years in the future in England where a masked man attempts to change the world. There are elements of Hitler's rise to power through the induction of fear, the mystery of Phantom of the Opera, but most importantly an inquisitive protagonist similar to the one found in Orwell's 1984. The theme is evident: People should not be afraid of their government; the government should be afraid of the people. Through ingenious acts of deception and illusion, the main character, V, shapes Evie, a girl he rescues in an alleyway. As a common woman, she represents all of society. She has the ability to incite change but is unsure how to go about it. V's acts come across as horrendous to some, but for those attentively listening to his rationale, seems so logical. A higher-thinking member of the audience will be able to draw parallels to present life and come the horrific realization we better take care of the future before we fall victim to the same totalitarian rule.",10
30 January 2016,"NIce idea, but some big holes.","It's all pretty slickly made and the ideas portrayed are overall appealing, but I have problems with the story.

First up, V has no problem killing people, potentially innocent people to further his cause. Ironic since that is why he is taking vengeance in the first place. He is in no way forgiving, like the government that he seeks to destroy. He is an extremist, like the government he seeks to destroy. Wars are always fort between 2 or more extremist.

I would have like to have seen more focus on the ideas of racism and religious intolerance as these issues have been at the root of immeasurable violence, suffering and death throughout the ages up until recent times. Even today we have Donald Trump, potential leader of the most powerful nation on the planet declaring that he will ""Ban all Muslims from entering the country"", a scary and relevant real life occurrence of the totalitarian government portrayed in this movie.

Also the phrase that he quotes ""By the power of truth, I, while living,have conquered the universe"" that he attributes to Fuast is wrong, a lie if you like. Again somewhat ironic that such a strong statement about truth is attributed falsely.

On the positive side the ending showing all of the people standing up for change, peacefully is a good ending.",6
20 March 2006,More Then Lives Up to it's Predessessor,"V for Vendetta is pure gold. The style, the action, all perfect for this type of film. But by far, a stand out performance by Hugo Weaving as the mysterious masked man known only as ""V"".

In a future world, London has become a totalitarian system of government, having complete control over all of it's civilians. In a shadow of what the former Soviet Union was, this is a harsh world, where fear rules the minds of the inhabitants of this once free country. Horrible atrocities are committed daily (just which ones, you'll need to see the movie for), and there is only one man who stands against it. An idea.

The trailers would lead you to believe the film is action-packed, with little story, when in fact, it's just the opposite. While there are action segments (and they are PHENOMANOL) there is more then enough story to make you genuinely care for the characters portrayed on-screen. There are moments of great sympathy for the oppressed people, and there are also moments that make you want to stand up and cheer, because Weaving's performance is incredibly portrayed.

V for Vendetta is a spectacular outing by the Wachowski Brothers, and more than worthy of the nine stars I have given it. It leaves everyone with a solid message, a message of how an idea that can change the world.",9
14 March 2006,Most subversive mainstream film ever?,"We, the ""developed"" nations, are a controlled by fear. The media continuously bombards us with stories of terrorism, disease and disasters. The bigger the fear is, the more we allow our governments to control us, to dissolve our civil liberties.

In various nations people can be held with no trial or charge simply for looking a certain way, having faith in non-Christian gods, or being brown and having a beard. Claw for a hand optional. These people are tortured and humiliated.

Terrorism is a real threat, there is no denying it. There is only avoidance of the cause. Very little asking why, but a lot of finger pointing and knee-jerk reactions. These reactions are caused by fear but simply fuel terrorism, like a self-fulfilling prophecy it scares more and more people every day while the reactions fuel the anger of the terrorists. If we, the people, force our governments to examine and eliminate the causes of terrorism we will eliminate our own fear. This is unlikely to happen as the governments will no longer have the power to control us. The power of nightmares is strong, the politics of idealism long gone, we are firmly in the grip of the politics of fear.

This may lead to the situation presented in 'V for Vendetta'. A Naziesque totalitarian government keeps a tight grip on the citizens of Britain. Evey part of the media is controlled and every event is spun for the benefit of keeping the public in fear and the government in power. Until one man decides to fight back.

So is V the most subversive mainstream film to ever hit cinemas? Possibly. Is it a cheesy b-movie with bad acting and forced dialogue? Definitely ... and that's why I think it's brilliant. It's top level allows the subtext to get plastered on thick, and it's all the better for it.",8

8 September 2006,A piece of crap by any other name,"V for Vainglorious, more like.

This film was awful - every moment, every frame. Oh sure, it looked great, and being a serious progressive, its politics (worn with prejudice on its sleeve) were spot-on. But that's hardly enough as a sum-total artistic/movie experience. 20,000 miles from enough.

My problems? The dialogue - atrocious. The story - vapid. The characters - beyond V (and the screenwriter's ""Hey I know big words and I bet if I string enough of them together it'll sound real intelligent-like!"" tendencies re: V's monologues), utterly forgettable. (And that's saying something, considering Stephen Rea and John Hurt were in the cast. If you can waste them, you can waste anything.) The cinematography - gorgeous. The music - wretched, and then some. The politics - like I say, spot-on, but delivered with all the grace of a skyscraper- dropped anvil. The mask - fantastic. And the day you find a mask that carries a film all by itself, please, let me know, because this sure wasn't that film.

I absolutely abhor movies these days; V is a shining example of why. In a nutshell, it's artless, soulless, graceless, and not in the least possession of anything magical about movies. This movie was made 22 years ago, and it was called 1984, and it also starred John Hurt, and it was directed by Michael Radford; see 1984, and stay away from this stinking rubbish. Unless you want a primer on how to make an inartistic blunt instrument that's boring as hell and feces-stupid.",3
25 March 2006,Don't waste your time -- or your $$$!!,"If you enjoyed Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel from 1988 -- as I did -- do yourself a favor and avoid this pale rendition. Alan Moore has disassociated himself from this film, and with good reason. A few of the character names are the same, and a couple of sequences bear a slight resemblance -- but that's it. The fire, the passion, the heart and soul that so infused the novel is completely absent. The screen story was already written, and the filmmakers ignored it, rewriting whole scenes, cutting out others, eliminating a good 75% of the story's power, meaning and resonance. The characters are shallow, empty husks of their original selves, and the pacing is abominable. Nowhere in this superficial yawnfest is the true understanding of revolution made manifest. Nowhere is the audience truly brought in to and made a part of V's tormented motivations or Evey's harrowing journey. That would require some creative camera lingering, and sets that didn't look like sound stages. If this had been made 15 years ago -- as a mini-series -- perhaps some of the gritty integrity and enduring strength of the human spirit might have been retained.

Shame that it ended up in the hands of overpaid incompetents.",1
10 April 2006,Remarkable,"This was an excellent drama akin to the stories of Brave New World or Fahrenheit 451 in its scathing indictment of those who rule through fear and force. I enjoyed the story and the characters immensely. Though you never see Hugo Weaving's face, his dialogue is masterfully delivered, both a charm and an inspiration all at once. Natalie Portman clearly delivers one of her most stunning performances and projects convincing emotion in her demonstration of an internal struggle. The writing for this project was well done and stands out as a remarkable work of drama whose powerful statements will continue to thrill and haunt you for years. Although I know the graphic novel it is based on was written as an indictment of the Thatcher administration, it nevertheless stands as a reminder to all people of all nationalities that freedom is earned and totalitarianism is given away.

6 June 2009,What a pretentious piece of drivel,"Before I am slated as a Terminator-loving twit, let me say that I love films of all genres. I am open for anything, as long as it challenges me and doesn't turn my brain off completely. I always took IMDb seriously, but seeing this film on #173 of Top 250 films makes me strongly doubt the intelligence of this site's average user. The story is horribly copied from other classics, i.e. not original, the plot is full of illogical holes, it is totally unbelievable and the lesbian woman subplot made my toes curl. This film is totally overrated and embarrassingly bad. Even 1 Star seems inflated. If you want to watch intelligent cinema dealing with the future, watch Brazil.

3 October 2006,Ridiculous,"I'm not one to come onto IMDb to stir things up and I know a lot of people get very angry on these boards when someone comes on and slates a favourite movie of theirs but my opinion's as valid as anyone else's and I thought this was a ridiculous film.

Argue all you will but I saw nothing original in this and nothing particularly entertaining. For the most part, I thought the actors were poor quality and the story so formulaic in delivery that I can't believe how high this is rated.

I found this to be deeply flawed and desperately uninspiring. I had no idea the Wachowski brothers were involved until I saw the end credits roll, which added further to my disappointment. It could've all been so much better.

27 February 2008,Of course....,"Vendetta's a completely farcial take on Orwell's 1984 with one of the worst 'acting performances' by Natalie Portman to date. Superficiality of characters, plot and politics and not even slightly in an entertaining way.

Special mention must go to the cringeworthy script with a fetish for sophomore-level alliteration starting with the letter 'v'. I think Shakespeare said it best when he appeared to me in a dream last night and stated: ""AAAAaaaaaaargggghhhh"".

In short, the perfect film for a fine bundle of general acclaim and fit to shelve next to other recent entries in the IMDb top250 such as Million Dollar Baby and Children of Men which most dreadfully shows the abysmal decline in good taste and cinematic appreciation which is sweeping the Earth like a virus gone berserk.

So, if you thought these movies I mentioned were great, have a blast with V for Vendetta. If not, welcome to the human race.

This movie has depth, sophistication, quality acting and dark but wonderful cinematography. It also has a very poignant political and social message that is the very heart of the tale. It is a perspective changing / reinforcing theme wrapped in stylized, visual splendor.

And for those who found that description less than appealing... rest assured that there is plenty of killing and explosions to keep you interested.

P.S. The only reason I haven't given it a 10 is because some of the violence at the end was needlessly graphic and incongruous with the rest of the film. It was presumably added to appeal to the LCD contingent of the audience.",9

1 November 2006,Not overwhelming.,"Am I the only person who didn't like this film? Basically, all it involved is a lot of shouting men, repetitive scenes in offices and V's chamber, the stupid bloke on the huge screen who tried to deliver unforgettable lines that would be remembered in cinema forever (but failed), and that stupid news reporter who kept shouting, swearing and saying, ""England prevails."" The acting is also pretty wooden, and there is no way the action explodes in this film - there is hardly any action in the whole thing. The ending was sadly poor, and though the action sequences were well-done and directed, there were too few of them to satisfy most people's tastes. Arty-farty flashbacks with voiceovers just don't cut the cheese any more, and with forgettable music and acting, this film let me down. It should not be on the Top 250 - no way.

This film also tried to tackle topics that were way over its head, such as sexual corruption in the Church, but be honest, that was better done in the Blackadder 2 episode ""Money"". Dull and way-overrated, V For Vendetta joins Catwoman as a poor graphic-novel adaptation (well, it does in my opinion). Not great. 5/10

3 October 2021,Dystopian Drama At Its Finest,"V For Vendetta(2006)

A Women accidentally meets a mysterious terrorist V who is fighting an oppressive government.

Thought provoking finest drama set in dystopian future. The movie needs to be applauded for its interesting premise, shocking twists and the things it tries to convey. Comimg to acting presence, Natalie Portman excels as Evey a women caught in between the whole ruckus whereas Hugo Weaving proves his mettle with just his sound. The BGM, frames and usage of songs are yet another things to be praised. Last but not the least, the mind blowing climax helps elevating the movie to higher extents than expected.

The only con of the movie is its slow paced dramatic approach but drama lovers won't even feel this problem.

In the end, once in a life time DC Comic book based experience that is surely worth a watch.

30 March 2006,"Many things to amaze and stun, but it's the character(s) that count","In this rather colorful and clean (albeit darkly lit) futuristic British world, a fascist government has taken control. And since we don't like fascists, we need a very colorfully masked character to save us all from being mindless sheep. He also is wonderfully poetic, too, making him more than just a zealous terrorist: he's an artist.

Hugo Weaving is, frankly, amazing. Not only does he have to overcome his (basically) typecast nature (who really saw him as Elrond in The Lord of the Rings? No, everyone saw him as Mr. Smith posing as a zealous elf), but he has to do so without a face. His voice acting is one thing, but its the pantomime that matches the voice acting that gives this character its compelling nature. He's graceful, and poetic, and artistic, and swashbuckling... and straight out of silent film, despite his ""verbose"" dialog. That is why when he does stuff like pretending to be strangled by an empty suit of armor or speak an entire paragraph with words starting only with V, it actually works. No seriously, it's brilliant.

Natalie Portman supports well, but none more so real than when she's really put into a testy situation. She moves from fear to chaos to acceptance to love in a moments notice, exactly the way the audience wants to move with her. Despite V's rather straightforward narration of events, it's at Evey's speed that we try to alternatively catch up and slow down to understand what's going on.

And finally, Stephen Rea. Wow, what a perfect choice for that role. Now the movie mentions that he's Irish (and we all know what that means to England and it's ideals of status quo), but it barely even needs to. Not only is Rea's nationality perfect for the part, but the way he's proved himself through such films as The Crying Game really endear us to the guy who is suddenly shocked out of the status quo... and is now in the position to make a major decision about whether to reject or accept this sudden change. If anyone should be given credit for this film's success, it's the casting director.

Now the story is a ""pretty good one"", though it's really engaging mostly through its in-depth explorations of its characters. I haven't read the graphic novel. I've read enough vitrolic rants about this movie to understand that it gets nowhere near the depth of these characters as presented in the original work. But unlike such adaptations as our infamous Harry potter series and the like, this movie does have a certain care and understanding for the characters, doing the best it can to really give them lives and histories... and sidestories. In fact, it felt like this movie could go on forever, and that even if it did, I wouldn't have minded.

I think there's two major places the story fails to make this film from good to really great. The first is that some of the dialog just simply doesn't hold up to some of the other dialog... V's lines are great (though I understand they are much better in the original work), but stuff like the policemen's constant repetition about coincidences doesn't hold up well.

Secondly, at first it's really unclear why exactly the government we're watching is evil (except with the usual Big Talking Head that always makes us think of Big Brother), then even when it's cleared up, it's hard to understand why the subjects are so ready and willing to jump on the V bandwagon and practice ""Anarchy in the UK!"" (By the way, was that line necessary either? I think this movie had enough trouble from the beginning without having to sound like a stupid punk who doesn't realize the 70s ended more than a quarter of a century ago).

However, that's not to say that this film isn't full of some really strong points. I think what did it for me was the comedy show featuring the Grand Chancellor being humiliated. Both as a loving homage to British humor past and present, and as a thumbs up to satire and the power of daring media, it's a grand addition to the preceedings. The comedian's subsequent arrest places it into a morbid theme: you can't just talk about it or joke about it. You have to act to change it. Hint to the left, in case they're wondering why their ""Impeach Bush"" stickers aren't doing anything.

And about the politics, since it's such a big issue. This movie is very stunted in that it uses discourses we use today, and the Wachowskis are obviously very intent in putting a bit of Bush-bashing into it. It wasn't very necessary, but it worked out in places like the little quip about the Avian flu and whatnot. Personally, I could have used a much broader and somewhat universally-themed approach, especially since this film seems to be almost begging in parts for the Right to get angry at it so that it could get some free publicity.

That said, despite all these things here, all these things here which weren't quite good enough to have me absolutely raving about it, I can't help but really love it for those characters. I think what appeals most about V is that not only is his mask just a wonderfully distinct image, but he has absolute control over a world where power seems to be utterly lacking. I especially love that last fight scene he does at the end with the vapor-trails around the knives. I've heard a lot of scoffing about how that's just pointless bullet-time, but it isn't bullet time. It's V's utter, almost mystical, control over the elements and the energy around him right as he's about to kick some serious booty. I think that's a great way of turning the Wachowski's self-created image into something entirely new.

16 April 2016,A modern-day 1984,"People should not be afraid of their governments...governments should be afraid of their people.

George Orwell is one of my favourite authors and 1984 one of my favourite books, so it was easy to see the parallels between V for Vendetta and 1984. Fun fact: John Hurt who played the Big Brother esque Adam Suttler also played Winston Smith- the hero of 1984.

This was a great film. It has particular relevance in today's society and it has some great performance particularly by Hugo Weaving as V. With his face obscured by a mask, he uses his voice and body language to brilliant effect.

21 July 2016,My Favorite Movie of All-Time!,"This is MY ""greatest movie of all time"" and has been for quite some time now. I often hope something may come along and knock it off the shelf, but it has not happened. (Children of Men came close) I've come to understand what's most important to me in storytelling, Encompassing the entire human experience.

Most will not agree, but I found the film better than the comic book, and the comic was top notch! I know Alan Moore hated it, I think he even tried to get it banned or something, but to me Hugo's performance is beyond incredible. The general fear of a main character behind a mask with no facial expression's is totally beyond comparison here. Hugo, if you're reading this, you have reached Ian McKellen status in my eyes.

It's really difficult to imagine this comic being put onto the big screen and more so, being acceptable, yet I found it truly compelling, inspiring and the overall essence captured. This is a movie that I believe will stand the test of time and is more relevant with every passing day in our modern world.",10
30 April 2020,Too Close For Comfort,"Though this movie is set in 2032 which is only 12 years from now, It's strange how few viewers have spotted the chilling truth in this film and the way it points at how things are today in the UK, especially with the lockdown. We are a hair's breadth away from the kind of scenario portrayed: Mysterious experimental virus's being unleashed on unsuspecting civilians; paralyzing fear fueled by fake news media; people being pressured and shamed into wearing masks and keeping apart from each other; vaccinations now being tested on people who have no idea what is in it with the threat of becoming mandatory; freedom of speech slowly being stifled through the guise of 'political correctness'; the government slowly nut surely taking more and more control of people and their lives. Slowly, slowly catch your monkey...and although other countries are in revolt, the UK remains as a nation of 'do as you're told' citizens. When I first watched this in 2005 I thought it was a chilling prophecy of what soon might come to pass. Now it's fast becoming a reality. That said, I love all the Wachowski movies and believe they must be some sort of time travelers given the content of many of their movies. Therefore I give this one 10/10",10
15 January 2021,Superb,"I've watched this film a couple of times. Every time, without fail, it satisfies my desire for a gritty yet hopeful telling of a country dominated by fascism.

9 October 2007,V for Vindictive?,"What happens when the politics of a movie overpower what is otherwise a moving, relevant, and even (at times) beautiful message?

Everyone tries SO hard here...Portman becomes wonderfully cockney, Weaving emotes mystery and power with every gesture and head tilt, and Hurt channels Hitler and any other tyrannical dictator with a frightening authenticity and ferocity--this film shares with us by far the best performances of their careers. Technically speaking, ""V"" is better made than any other film in the past 3 years, and much, much better than other Wachowski/Silver collaborations (read: the Matrix trilogy). Throw in what is a perfectly twisted plot, and what we SHOULD have is a movie catapulted to every top 10 list for the next 20 years, right?

Well...not so much. You see, intolerance of the intolerant is very dangerous, especially when the filmgoing public wants to be entertained, not indoctrinated. Buried beneath the faux message of love and acceptance, behind the flashy special effects, Panavision gloom, and the painful smile of a ghastly Guy Fawkes mask is a hatred more malignant than anything Hollywood or comic books could ever dream up. This film teaches that learning to hate is how we learn to love, that vengeance is the only way to achieve justice, that fear of anything--including God--is akin to torture. Democracy begets war, Christianity begets terrorism, and freedom may only be found through Anarchy in the world according to V.

One question: is that a world where you want to live?",7

27 March 2006,Inspirational Magical Majestical,"This was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen! I have been an avid film-watcher for 20 years now and rarely have I ever been so inspired and filled with life after watching a film. Everything about this movie worked for me, which is incredible given what they accomplished in a little over two hours.

Most of my favorite films have several important themes mixed with an interesting plot and genuinely funny, dramatic and poignant moments. It's so refreshing to see a film not afraid to take chances and deal with issues that are so relevant to the world today. This film should be a screaming alarm to everyone who has become complacent in ANY government that cares nothing of the majority of their citizens.

Sadly, however, many may need more than what happened to V to finally realize what atrocities can occur when you do not stand up for love and justice. In any case, V for Vendetta is and will always be an unequivocal classic in my eyes, one I will show to my kids someday.

Oh, and the music V uses hasn't seen this great a day since Bill Murray blew up the golf course in Caddyshack. GO SEE THIS TWICE!",10
8 April 2006,Amazing,"There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said already. The acting is unbelievable, the characters and their dialogue are brilliantly written, the plot is deep and thought-provoking without being confusing, and the special effects are jaw-dropping without being oppressive. The best effects in the entire move are actually the ones that required no computer animation or modern technology; fans of classic movies will notice such devices as low-key music, camera angles, and background noise fading into silence all being used masterfully. I saw this movie on a Friday night, opening weekend, in a cinema packed with over 300 other people. Not one person moved or talked for the last 30 minutes of the film; we all sat in stupefied silence, utterly spellbound by this powerful movie.

Ironically, one of the major theme of this movie is that intelligence is perhaps the strongest weapon in the world. This is ironic because all of the people frantically blaming this movie for religious or political reasons are the ones that misinterpreted it. My advice to anyone that has not seen it is to go do so right now, but leave personal prejudices outside the cinema and enjoy an experience that is as poignant as it is absolutely mind-blowing.

Oh, this is off-topic, but I thought someone might want to know that the IMDb spellchecker will try and ""correct"" several words even if they are spelled correctly.",10

31 July 2006,One of the year's best,"Excellent. Plain and simple. The story is that of a terrorist, V (An Oscar nod is in order for Hugo Weaving), who drags a civilian (Natalie Portman, pulling off a convincing British accent) into his guerilla war with a totalitarian government. The many taboos (abusive priests, gay sex) that are brought up in the film service the story, as opposed to simply fueling a political fire. The fights are directed with panache by James Mcteigue, who makes a first rate debut, and the set design is appropriately gloomy. The soundtrack carries the film, and it manages to have a beating heart beneath the political propaganda. V gets my vote.

6 November 2022,C people need you,"I love the story about fighting against the totalitarian regime as a Chinese. Mr. Eleven got his third term, and tightened the restriction on every aspect of life. Like the Conservative Party in the movie, they conceal every truth that is bad for them, and make propaganda about the advantage their policies bring, sometimes even fake. I expected that we were moving towards a more and more free society, but it turns out the opposite. By the way, this movie was taken away from douban, aka the Chinese IMDb. I mean, they cannot tolerate a movie that tells people to be together and fight for their better future. That's the most ridiculous thing.

15 May 2007,Classical film-making,"I was so afraid this film would just be more opportunistic betrayal of my political ideals, I avoided it for two years. Wow, was I ever mistaken! This is a great film in the classic tradition - there's nothing confusing or 'avant garde' here, this is straight-ahead unabashedly Romantic film-making, and the best of its kind I've seen in a long time.

Yes, V is a terrorist - and the film never pretends he's innocent, in any way; yes, what happens to the female lead is both morally and emotionally ambiguous. And yes, the 'right people' in the film make serious mistakes, and the 'bad people' actually have an understandable argument to make.

All this makes this film a thinking-person's adventure film. Nobody here is a puppet on anybody's string.

And the final question - which must remain with an audience not living in a fantasy - is, what does it really mean to be free? and what are we willing to do to accomplish that? Just by the way, although the film ends by playing the opening of the Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man"", there are sly references throughout to the Sex Pistols' ""Anarchy in the UK"" - and the film knows this and earns the right to it, despite the total absence of ""punk"" in its visuals.

Easily the equal of ""Cyrano DeBergerac"" - a myth for the hell we currently pass through - highly recommended, to this generation and the next.",10

22 April 2018,V For Vucking Awful!!,"C'mon. There's gotta be 2 versions of this film out there. Right? There's the dismal version that I saw. And then there's that other ""Wow!"" version that so many others have raved about.

I mean, this film having 2 distinctly different versions is the only acceptable reason that I can think of to explain why there's such a divided opinion over this picture. Some people (like me) saw the crap version - While others enjoyed the thrill of viewing the dynamite version. What else could it be?

Anyways - The minute that ""V"" boasted to Evey that his all-time fave flick was, in fact, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", I knew that ""V For Vendetta"" was gonna suck, big time. (And, I was right) I guess that ""V"" loved this film with all of his heart 'cause its title character probably reminded him so much of his own deluded image of himself. Like, why else would someone love such a crap movie as ""The Count of Monte Cristo""?

I'd say that we (the audience) were all colossally cheated by the director/screenwriters of this disappointing film. For example - The fact that not even once were we ever given even a single glimpse of ""V's"" face is evidence of that. But, then again, maybe it was all just a cost-saving measure to try to save the producer a few bucks by cutting back on such things as expensive ""burn-victim"" make-up effects, or something like that.

All in all - ""V For Vendetta"" was 132 minutes of excruciatingly long and dragged out garbage.",1
28 June 2006,It's just like the what we have in China,"I'm sorry that I can't focus on the movie, but a great movie I think should bring up things other than the story itself.

Just like a friend of mine said, any government who bans this movie, it must be a government just like the one in the movie. Unfortunately, the government of my country, PR China is one of them.

It's just what they do, although not so explicitly. Everyday, Chinese police censor all kinds of political sensitive content we can reach, put away brave-enough-to-speak journalists like Shi Tao, they even put up a project called Red Shield to control the Internet, which we always believed to be non-controllable.In China, we have never seen a TV show that makes fun of the God like leaders, cause all the so called People's media were never people's. And what we citizens usually do? Just like what they do in the movie, eating, fncking and and shutting.

Thank God(every God we people believe in) there is still a country called United States, whose people haven't yet felt tired to remind us of how we should be living.",10
18 March 2006,"Violent, disturbing, and unusually patient, ""Vendetta"" reaches its film-making ambitions and makes its message heard.","Someone once said that great ideas do not succeed without loyalty between individuals. (I'm paraphrasing.) There are many great ideas floating through the film incarnation of ""V for Vendetta"", and the protagonist, V, is a compelling individual who draws the audience into his strange existence and inspires, at the very least, fascination. V (played marvelously by the masked and enigmatic Hugo Weaving) is agile and strong, educated and articulate as well as poetic, romantic and cultured. Not only can he fence, discuss music, talk about classic films, but he's a wiz in the kitchen. He is a definitive Renaissance Man who just happens to be wholeheartedly insane.

This story takes place in the totalitarian England of a not-too-distant possible future. It's a place where a disaster has allowed people to be consumed by fear of the outside world. Chancellor Adam Satler (John Hurt) is the unquestionable authority of this new era and channels Hitler as he booms orders over a Soviet-style regime with cutting-edge technologies. People scrabble about to keep up as much of a normal 21st century life as they can. Evie (Natalie Portman) is on her way to a dinner when three policemen stop and threaten her for no other crime than being out past curfew. V comes to her rescue and invites her in sincerely gentlemanly fashion to join him for a special event. The newly acquainted pair watches as V's explosives blow the historic Bailey Building to pieces as viewing London is treated to a recording of The 1812 Overture. Naturally, Evie is appalled, and although V keeps his word to return her home safely and goes on his way, another chance meeting irrevocably entwines their respective paths as investigated by the cynical Chief Inspector Finch (Steven Rea).

Hurt and Weaving as The Chancellor and V portray the flip sides of the same coin. They are men of force. One gathers power by instilling fear. The other instills hope by inflicting revenge on those he sees as the guilty. Steven Rea's Inspector Finch already knows how badly this world is run. He is cynical of the government, his place in it and what chance he might have to change it. The journey his character is on also illustrates many things about this world and where he is going in it, and it is a subtle and gradual performance. As Evie, Natalie Portman brings the audience into the nightmarish world and the increasingly nightmarish situations in which she finds herself. She makes every scene work, not just as a plot device, but more importantly for the character. There is even a scene in which Evie experiences an awakening not dissimilar to Neo in ""The Matrix"". She is viewing the world with entirely new eyes. However, instead of playing off of scenery full of scary machine monsters as Keanu Reeves did, Portman creates the moment standing alone in front of the camera; swamped and drowning in emotion.

Controversy has been the buzzword surrounding ""VfV"" during the run up to the film's release. It has been said that this movie is taking aim squarely at the Bush administration here in the US. It's not. It's also not talking about Tony Blair's current administration nor is it reflecting upon the unpopular Thatcher administration, which was in office at the time Alan Moore and David Lloyd created the graphic novel on which this is based. Nor are the filmmakers endorsing terrorism as the best way of altering a government any more than a dentist would recommend eating more candy for healthier teeth. What I believe director James McTiegue is trying to illustrate in his work with the Wachowskis' adapted script is the very need for revolution in thought when fear becomes the predominant theme in a society.

The Chancellor is seen mostly as a huge projected talking head barking orders and making frantic threatening demands. The government and military follow suit, but only out of the fear of retribution. While V is certainly not a passive figure, he radiates calm in even in a fight; no motion is wasted. V sees himself made more a reactionary than an instigator, and this refined masculinity is proved genuine as we view how he behaves in his own home with Evie. V disrupts with violence, but he appeals with conversation and ownership of his actions. He is attempting to inspire people from their fear and lethargy.

Although there are frightening images, such as V's birth by fire and Evey's torture, McTiegue's camera, too, is sparing with its motion and reserved with the space it permits the story's characters. There are close-ups during intimate and poignant moments. The action sequences are startling in their ferocity and executed with all the expertise expected from the assistant director of ""The Matrix"" series. In many scenes, the camera frames up an entire room and sits still. Even moves following someone down a hall or across a floor are done out of necessity and without excess flourish or unusual angles. The characters and situations are allowed to do the talking. Control and patience are the dazzling features here.

Unfortunately, some people will always take inspiring fiction (written or filmed) as fact or mandate, but this is a comic book world with comic book rules and brutal action  though action does not occur as often as one might expect. This is a comic with ideas in its head. If it just so happens that people find similarities between the film and current governments in the world, maybe that says something about the real life situation to which they are comparing it. If one finds a government is not living up to expectation, maybe it's time to start running for office or working for causes. This is a film with a big point to make, and takes risks making it. It's rare that a studio film is as driven as its main character.

19 March 2006,"""Freeeeedom"", ""Vendetta"" dazzles the eyes and explodes on the big screen, Portman continues to excel","*** Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, Ben Miles, Rupert Graves. Directed by James McTeigue Most comic book adaptations are mediocre and fail to stay true to the basis in which was created. But ""V"" like last years ""Sin City"", also based on a graphic novel, does not disappoint and stays true to the novels. In the futuristic world where a totalitarian government rules London but when a man known as V (Weaving) uses terroristic tactics to over throw the government and the leader (Hurt, as always great). Along side of a helpless citizen Evey (Portman, a shinning star) they teach each other valuable lessons throughout. Two great screenwriters Andy/Larry Wachowski bring ""V"" to the screen. They do a great job writing the dialogue and action scenes which never fail to bore. Dashes of British humor make ""V"" one of 2006's best movies, sure to be a classic eye dazzler. My final rating 8/10

2 July 2006,V for Victorious!,"When I first saw the preview for this movie I was immediately disinterested because of the man in the mask. However after sitting down last night and watching it I was quite taken with not only the performances of Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea but the premise of the storyline.

This movie is so out of the ordinary and frankly a bit weird that you are glued to every minute of it to see where the hell it's going. I found it started out somewhat slow, but its momentum picked up and never stopped straight through to the very memorable ending.

Definitely rent this film, watch it with someone who doesn't like to talk throughout a movie, someone that can handle a decent conversation at the end, because this movie will almost certainly provoke dialog... consider the rule of any government who dictates through fear, be they democratic or otherwise.

5 July 2006,Very good movie,"v for vendetta is a very good movie, its about the revolution in england. i saw this film in my university as my professor was very anxious about this movie.. guess what ? he was right.

the film is a master piece and very well executed. but i didn't liked one thing; the action scenes are very few.. only three action scenes in the whole movie.. though the scene were brilliant.. but it could have been more.. the lead (evey) was superb and obviously V too. i was so concentrated in the movie that i saw the whole film and than came out.

in conclusion very good movie.. worth watching!!

4 March 2018,This movie was extremely well done.,"Characters - They were all believable. All the acting was amazing.

Effects - There weren't a lot of effects, but they were all really good (except for V's hand, which was a pretty bad effect - you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it).

Sights and Sounds - The sound mixing was great, and so was the cinematography. The world was very believable and I was almost immediately sucked into this world.

Plot - There aren't really any plot holes. Most of the characters are intelligent, I especially like V, and they all work together to bring to life this intricate plot.

Overall, this movie was amazing. Everything was well done. I highly recommend it.

23 March 2006,Why the Controversy??,"This was an excellent movie and probably most if not all of the reviews have said this. So why do some see this as a movie glorifying terrorism, rather than one denouncing tyranny and unjust governments?? This is a rallying cry for oppressed people to stand up against those who oppress them, whether as an individual or as a collective whole; to me this is the theme of this movie. Was Dietrich Bonhoffer a terrorist because he aided in a plot to assassinate Hitler?? Were the Founding Fathers terrorist or revolutionaries?? I guess like some opinions, it depends on which side of history you fall on. In the end, I think ""V"" would say; ""think for yourself and come to your own conclusions.

22 May 2006,V for Vendetta,"Based on Alan Moore's excellent graphic novel, V for Vendetta is set in a post-nuclear world, where Britain is run by a fascist government which sets limitations upon the freedom of it's peoples in true Nineteen Eighty Four style. A man named V (Hugo Weaving), uses terrorist tactics to try to show the people of Britain how they have fallen into passive acceptance of this regime, starting by destroying the Old Bailey, then publicly announcing that in exactly one year he will destroy the Houses of Parliament. Along the way he meets Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman who he believes can help him achieve his goals.

V for Vendetta has turned up at an interesting time. Indeed, with the news mostly concerned with terrorists and dubious politics, it seems apt that a supposed blockbuster film should come along and try to get us to think about exactly what the hell is going on with our world. People have associated the film with Iraq, North Korea, and Nazi Germany, despite the fact that it was written during Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister. Alan Moore himself has disassociated himself with the film because he believes it has been twisted from its original intentions, but it seems right to do this  if people are going to get a message across, it needs to be relevant to the day and age that the message is concerned with.

The real focus is V  is he a terrorist or a freedom fighter? It depends on the perspective taken. From Adam Sutler's (John Hurt) government's view, he is a terrorist, but he soon opens peoples' eyes to become their freedom fighter. But the methods he uses are dubious  destroying famous landmarks, packing an underground train with explosives (particularly relevant for Britain now) and strapping explosives to himself. This is clearly a film that wants us to think.

And it does. In fact, audiences have been deceived by trailers that show V for Vendetta to be an action film. In reality, there are less than ten minutes of action throughout its two hour run time, but this doesn't matter as the rest of the film has been carefully structured to keep the audience interested without the need for slo-mo violence. The key to its appeal is the characters, and here the actors all stand out. Natalie Portman is the right kind of actress to portray Evey (although her English accent suffers, sometimes horrifically, but it is a reasonable attempt), and shows her vulnerabilities very well. Stephen Rea's detective is a world-weary man, frustrated by V's ability to avoid capture, again carried off with aplomb. The star is of course Hugo Weaving as V who, being masked all the way through the film (he never reveals his face, emphasizing his existence as an idea rather than a person), has to rely on physical and vocal actions to portray emotion, which he does extremely capably. His voice is perfect for V  understanding and passionate, yet with a slight hint of craziness.

There are some faults  Britain loses the grimy feel that was given to us in the graphic novel, instead looking plain and perhaps too much like today's London. Secondly, sometimes the film feels too heavy handed in its message, coming across as clumsily preachy. Also, V's introduction is, from the script's point of view, extremely heavy handed and could potentially put viewers off the film. Stick with it though, and underneath the blockbuster you'll find a film that is both daring us to challenge our way of thinking, and also managing to entertain.

Rated: 8/10

16 September 2006,"Feels Like A Missed Opportunity, That's Only 40% Completed","With all the hype leading up to V For Vendetta and myself being one of the followers I was looking forward to seeing V For Vendetta. V For Vendetta had mixed reviews on release and even many of the cult followers of the original comic book series felt cheated. The people who actually liked V For Vendetta most are the people who seemed to have not been following all the press up to release.

Not only is V For Vendetta a film that lacks a back-story to the film's main premise, it also lacks any kind of resolution. You'd never know that Hugo Weaving is the man under the mask because that's basically all he is throughout the film. Yet he creates a certain mystery to the already iconic ""Guy Fawke's mask"" becoming what is a somewhat intelligent terrorist, there seems no reason behind his odd attempt to over through the government and yet he still remains an interesting character even when he just rhymes descriptive words. All sounds a little strange I guess? Well it is and throughout the entire film I found myself wondering if the movie could become even more over dramatic, over acted and yes sadly extremely over the top.

V For Vendetta is filmed through a very strange visual style and one that at first I found very hard to get my head round. The bright colours and vivid fantasy look was one that I personally am not a fan of. I'm not quite sure if V For Vendetta was attempting to be realistic at showing a future where the government provoke fear into the hearts of every human being. V For Vendetta gives a vibe of ""I hate everything to do with our governments"" which I personally feel is a very generalised and over used concept.

The film's story and entertainment are the only things that keep the film together, even the acting from John Hurt is disappointing (If you can call it acting) and Hugo Weaving is not even acting he's just proving he's got a voice talent. Natalie Portman also disappoints with a bland role where the emotion feels very fake. The film has gigantic pacing problems and the end feels very abrupt, as well as ridiculous.

I don't recommend V For Vendetta, as it is often dull and over the top. To think that the film was created by the minds that warped The Matrix makes the film all the more disappointing. No way does it live up to the masterpiece that is The Matrix and V For Vendetta in the end achieves next to nothing. A contrived and messy waltz of nonsense.",2
6 August 2016,"Violent, complex, but fascinating adaption of Alan Moore's graphic novel","Corruption, graphic violence, and complex political themes supplement together in this visually striking adaption of David Lloyd and Alan Moore's hit graphic novel. Driven by a visceral direction by director James McTeigue, this dystopian action thriller captures the powerful energy of both Alan Moore's brilliant source material and the captivating (but convoluted) screenplay by The Wachowksis, and makes up slick, cutthroat thrill ride; but not without a few occasional flaws in the mix. Though the story offers plenty of surprises, it tends to cram way more ideas than the average viewer can swallow, particularly when the political atmosphere plays a major role in the plot. On the bright side, it also makes for a captivating experience. The film is set in the not-so-distant future in Great Britain, a country dominated by a fascist government under the head of the Norsefire Party, following the destruction of the United States from a civil war and viral pandemic from a disease known as St. Mary. Sporting a wig and a mask resembling the notorious Guy Fawkes, anarchist freedom fighter under the name V (played by Hugo Weaving) chooses to rebel against the government by posing as a vigilante and fighting against the ones who support the fascist government. Accompanied by television network employee Avery Hammond (played by Natalie Portman), V forms launches a resistance to bring down the government while avoiding oppressors appointed by political inspector Finch (played by Stephen Rea) who wants him dead.

Unlike most comic-book translations, this film is no superhero flick, nor does it have the feel of one. Instead, it offers something new and almost entirely inspiring to the table. Director James McTeigue accomplishes this by taking it's comic-book style action and characters, and blending these with a wide plethora of political elements and satire. Placing ideas of fascism, anarchism, and libertarianism in the mix, the movie puts political corruption in the front lines of the plot. The city of London in which the story is set is ruled by a government who blame individuals political rebels, illegal immigrants, homosexuals, and Muslims for the tyranny that plagues their society, and deal with the dilemma by imprisoning these specific groups of individuals in concentration camps, thus ridding the society of their freedom. The titular character V responds to these practices by rebelling, and does so with violence as means of Justice. As a result, the character is portrayed not as a hero nor a villain but a figure who does what he believes is right -- basically an antihero in some degree. The plot makes great use of these political elements, but at times struggles to evenly balance the narrative and the political atmosphere. The movie more often than not tries to cram so many ideas into the story that it makes for a significantly complex journey. On the bridge side, director James McTeigue does a great job at not only keeping things moving but executing them in a way that is arresting rather than heavy-handed. By the end, there's never a moment that feels wasted.

In the midst of it's flaws, the V for Vendetta prevails at both a visual and acting department. Presenting a likable cast, the film provides audience with some of the most compelling performances ever put on screen in a comic-book flick. Hugo Weaving, veteran of 'The Matrix' franchise (written and directed by The Wachowskis) provides a charismatic vibe as V, the lead character who seeks justice against the totalitarian-like government. Natalie Portman, fresh out of the second 'Star Wars' trilogy', gives a blissful performance as V's accomplice and eventually love interest; easily one of the most memorable performances she's demonstrated in her career. Stephen Rea is also quite credible as the primary antagonist, a man who roots for tyrannical society through means of political corruption. His character is masterfully written with stunning complexity and fascination. These characters all function consistently well in a world embraced by engrossing visuals. The production design of futuristic London is beautiful to look at, and fits suitably for the story. The fighting sequences however, offer the best gem in the visual department, featuring bloody, stylized action with occasional bullet-time shots Matrix style. While the fighting remains mostly infrequent as the story dwells one plot development than action-set pieces, it's truly memorable ewhen it emerges on screen.

V for Vendetta is a complex, violent, but explosively entertaining adaption of David Lloyd and Alan Moore's graphic novel, an adaption served with spectacle and intelligence. This movie levels high on the ranks of comic-book action vehicles, and is strongly recommended of all fans of the novel as well as everyone else with a thirst of a compelling dystopian action spectacle.",8
5 November 2011,"Looks fantastic, but overall I just didn't care for it","After hearing so many good things about V for Vendetta, I was expecting more than what I got. I will say, as someone who hasn't read the book, that it is not a terrible movie, just underwhelming.

Pros: The best thing about V for Vendetta was by far the visuals. The whole film looks fantastic, the camera work and editing are smooth and stylish and the costume and set design are sophisticated. The score/soundtrack was also effective, enhancing the atmosphere when it needed to and had some memorable parts too.

The lighting is brooding and like the score enhance the atmosphere effectively. The idea was also intriguing.

Cons: What didn't work for me was the plot, things weren't explained very well or were underdeveloped, it was sluggish and it just had a very shallow feel to it. I didn't care for the characters either, like the plot they were underdeveloped and and lacked any sort of depth. The script is often stilted, the direction lacked efficiency and despite the cast the acting didn't work for me either.

Hugo Weaving has moments when he is commanding but his weak dialogue let him down, also the characterisation itself seemed threadbare. Natalie Portman seems wooden here, while great actors like John Hurt are underused or forgettable, in regard to Hurt what was even more disappointing was that he suffered from both these things.

All in all, I just didn't care for V for Vendetta, despite the stunning visuals, atmospheric music and the interesting concept. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4
23 June 2008,Over-dramatized cliché propaganda,"Nothing fresh about this movie: conservatives are bad. Christians are bad, republicans are all fascists, blah blah blah.

If I wanted to get beat over the head with fanatic left-wing views I can just watch the Daily Show for free which like this movie says the same thing ad nauseum.

For all the rah rah talk about revolution against the state (with huge allusions, blatant actually, to the democratically elected Bush Administration) it really boils down to a message tailor-made for people who will just revel in the idea of seeing Bush compared to Hitler, Fox News compared to(ironically) state propaganda, Christians portrayed as oppressive bigots.

So if you hate republicans and enjoy liberal cliché, this movie is for you. For those who can see through the bullshat on both sides, avoid this steaming pile.",1

22 April 2006,Good Movie,"This movie was amazing. My sister and my dad dragged me off to see it, even though action movies aren't really my thing. I thought it was all going to be about some oppressed loser getting back and the kids who stole his lunch money in elementary school, but, it's really about a revolution. V's poetic humor and polite manor is terrifying and beautiful at the same time. Evey's steady growth as a character and as human being leaves you no doubt to her destiny. The political cause-and-effect scheme is as such that it can relate to anything and everything happening in our time. this movie shows a modern day revolution of a corrupt government that will make you feel like one among many and many among millions.

27 March 2006,"Remember, remember the fifth of November","Remember, remember, the fifth of November, The gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.

Take the stories ""1984"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"" and combine with Phantom of the Opera, and you have V for Vendetta; A Fantastic new movie from the creators of The Matrix starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. Based on a 1982 comic book story by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, V for Vendetta tells the story of the world about 15 years or so from now, and how it quickly became a world of despair and tyranny, created by a compliant public, in hopes that the government can save them from everything they fear.

Most of the population accepts what they feel is a necessary loss of freedom in the hard times the world is facing. Those that don't are usually branded terrorist or enemies of the state and ""black bagged"" in the middle of the night by government agents, never to be heard from again. One man, known only as ""V"" (Weaving), refuses to live in such a world. Believing that ""people should not fear their governments, governments should fear their people"", V single handedly purses a vendetta for liberty against those individuals in power responsible for the new world order. In a very ""John Galt"" like address to the nation, V starts to shake the citizens from their complacency, helping them to realize they only have themselves to blame for the situation they are in, but it is also only their willingness that allows it to continue. Circumstances tie V to Evey Hammond (Portman), a young woman who knows what is going on in the world is wrong, but is too scared to do anything about it. The story follows her individual journey from fear to realizing freedom of the mind is more important than even life itself. This movie may be build as an action film, but I see it as a love story. Not in the traditional sense of between two people, but in a Randian way between people and ideas.

This movie is one of the most powerful movies about liberty I have ever seen. I have seen this movie twice now and both times I have had to keep myself from standing up and cheering at the end. I am very heartened by the positive response I have heard from everyone I have talked to that has seen this movie. V for Vendetta is rated ""R"", but I would still recommend it to anyone old enough to understand the ideas presented in this film. The second time I saw it I brought my 15 year old son, and I would have brought my 13 year old daughter, if I thought she would have understood it. To all my family and friends that don't quite understand why I am involved in the libertarian movement, this movie is for them. These are the reasons I devote so much time and energy to that cause. Seeing these ideas so strongly displayed in a major motion picture, gives me renewed hope that people still place a value on liberty of more than mere lip service. To anyone that supports our government's suppression of freedom in the name of a ""War on Terror"", this movie is also for them. Your Liberty, the freedom of your mind, is too precious to trade away for anything anyone else can offer you.",10

17 May 2007,Dull Uneventful and Painfully Boring to Watch!,"I am sorry. I must have missed something here. Everybody was raving about this film. I fell asleep and had to watch it again but I came to the same conclusion. This is mild pathetic stuff. Am I on another planet? What is all the fuss about? A futuristic notion that there is corruption in the government? And that it needs to be exposed by some ""Phantom of the Opera""-like masked hero? Is this stuff really new? What is original about this? It is not even well told. I cannot for the life of me understand the excited and positive reaction to this film. I had high expectations going into it and it seemed okay at first and then it just bored the hell out of me.

I am sorry but the younger generation must have experienced holes in their education because this film just does not cut it in any way, shape or form. Pass on this one. Very little artistic merit here!

9 April 2015,Amazing,"What an Amazing film I have seen it like 4 times and I would see it again for sure. The story line is first rate the acting is top notch the plot right on the money, and it has a very real feel to it as if it could truly happen with the way things are going today with all the terror cells all over the place. It has a nightmarish complexity to it and make one think about our own world. No though a film for children the story line is thoroughly political and way way too DEEP for anyone under 16 to understand, and the violence is way too over the top for a child. But all in all a great watch a definite Ten out of Ten stars and in my mind a Golden Globe winner. If you want a thought provoking Film this is the one for you.

9 October 2006,V is for Vapid,"There's a whole lot of talking going on here, pontificating, and posturing. This is an action movie that wants to be overly dramatic and high brow...I suppose there's nothing inherently wrong with those aspirations, it's just the film should have worried about that AFTER it was entertaining.

One of the reasons the film dragged so much for me was that V wears a mask. Darth Vader wore a mask, and he was a great villain, but he didn't go on in every scene wanking on and on about what was bugging him and why it should bug you too...no...no...he was out there blowing up things and getting upset about losing the Death Star plans. He was easy to understand, whereas V is a chatty Cathy whose eyes we can't see, whose face is hidden from view...it's a bit of a disconnect. It's easy to understand what he's mad about, it's also impossible to understand why he just won't shut up and do something about it.

Portman's accent was distracting, and that's being kind. The world has gotten so small, if looking for a British actress, get one for crying out loud - it's not like they're hard to find. Same goes when casting American roles, please - enough of Colin Farrel and his bogus American accent - that has nothing to do with Vendetta, but while I was on the subject.

The film looks beautiful, it looks like it should be exciting...but at the end of the day, it was a chatter fest with a few explosions. Before anyone gets on a high horse about how a chatter fest can unearth some important ideas...this one digs up one or two childishly simple ideas up and proceeds to beat them into dust before your very weary eyes.

It's easy to see how one would want to take the book, and paste it's story over current events in an effort to make a statement. But most statements worth listening to aren't cut and paste - they're tailor made from the fabric of frustration. This is cut and past and bent and ripped CAUSING frustration.

The fact is that this film's over simplification of problems and trying to tie it into real world events is simple minded and irresponsible.

I wanted to drop a safe on V's head...just for a few laughs. You will too.",3
5 July 2021,You need to watch more than once,"This film is incredibly layered and almost overwhelming the first time you watch it. However, come back a second, third, twentieth (😉) time and you will still pick up nuances that you haven't seen. It's an incredibly important message that still resonates in today's political environment. A must watch for many...

5 April 2008,Mixed,"I have mixed feelings about this film. There are aspects that I really enjoy and others that I despise.

Hugo Weaving's performance is my favorite part of the film. The fact that he had to do it all behind a mask makes it doubly impressive. He has a great, expressive voice, and he makes full use of it here. He is able to be engagingly delightful one minute, then become terrifyingly intimidating the next. Natalie Portman is a good actress and a beautiful woman, but she's too petite for a movie like this. I feel like a stronger actress would have been better (both physically and emotionally).

The story is not very original, which ties into my biggest complaint with the movie. Instead of being a new take on an old idea, V For Vendetta's story feels more like a political statement than entertainment. I understand and even admire the writers for taking such a strong stance on their politics, but I feel like the story is riding on top of the political statement.

When it comes down to it, I like this movie. The acting and the execution is impressive. However, the imbalance between the story and the politics leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.",7
16 March 2006,Governments must be afraid of people not people afraid of the governments,"A few days ago, a city inspector or norm enforcer functionary gave me $ 100 fine for being parked in MY OWN HOUSE. Reason, just because two of my wheels were on the lawn and that damage the beauty of my neighborhood. When I tried to talk to his supervisor, I questioned and humiliated like a common criminal in the City Hall office. The conclusion of the discussion was ""WE WONT BE TALKING ANY MORE WITH YOU, PLEASE LEAVE"".

I remember that before September 11th five years ago, USA was the FREEDOM country. But, after the tragic events, government officials (police and civil servants) had been, invoking our security, abusing of their power and mistreated citizens and all of us had been closing our mouths and humbled.

Now, five years after and for the first time a movie dare to talk about the abuse on the people and it does in a really very fearless way. ""V FOR VENDETTA"" is being sold as a comic which is really it is; however not the type of movie is you will be seeing a second or third installment (well everything is possible in Hollywood).

Completed a few years ago, the movie was not released until now (commercial reasons or fear?). Now that the American government is being questioned about everything that happened in recent years this movie comes with another theory about everything.

The story does not happens in the USA (neither was the comic), but the events depicted are easily related. There was a huge massacre attributed to the Muslim terrorist and a Chancellor using that to become a ""DEMOCRATIC DICTATOR"". The movie clearly suggests government intervention on terrorism blamed events.

Other current events are shown. The use of ""FOR YOUR SAFETY"" propaganda and the abuse of lies in the media in order to keep the people frightened and accept every possible abuse. Did I mention corruption on the highest government levels, tortures and people kidnapping? Due to its strong political subject, ""V FOR VENDETTA"" is a must see movie which does not means is really a great movie. The rhythm is uneven; there is far more talk than action (probably because the great Hugo Weaving never take out the mask) and many implausibilities (like Portman's torture). The acting is very good Stephen Rea and Natalie Portman are able to carry the movie most of the time. John Hurt is a little too much as the hideous Chancellor.",8
20 March 2006,"A wonderful movie that will make you wonder ""What if""","When I first saw the trailer for this movie during the super bowl I didn't think it would be that interesting, but I was wrong. After watching a behind the scenes clip a few nights ago, I had to see it and I am extremely happy that I did. The movie goes along the lines of Brave New World, 1984 and Animal Farm, and takes an interesting look at the world of ""what if""... What if your country came under complete control of one man? What if every citizen gave into his control out of fear? What if one man's tortured past was the only way that he could see the totalitarian rule as a bad thing? And what if this one man was the only person that could change the world for the better? Beautifully filmed and magnificent dialogue moves this movie along. An underground cavern filled with priceless works of art that chronicles the world's history. And a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask who outwardly shows no emotion, but with excellent lighting we see every emotion that he truly has. Probably one of the best ""what if"" movies I have seen in a long while. I highly recommend it to anyone that has truly wondered what the world might be life ""if"".

1 December 2009,Best Alan Moore Adaption,"For me it's a toss up between Watchmen and V for Vendetta on which is Alan Moore's best work. Most people say Watchmen, but there is something special about V for Vendetta that marks it a remarkable graphic novel. Alan Moore's work has never been adapted well for the screen. There was the epic failure The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen which ruined Stephen Norrington and made Sean Connery retire from acting, and From Hell which butchered the graphic novel's material. V for Vendetta however has bucked that trend, but Alan Moore has completely distanced himself from Hollywood.

In the future Britain is being led by a totalitarian government, led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt). There is one freedom fighter, V (Hugo Weaving), a man who had suffered from experiments by the government and bases himself on Guy Fawkes. He has a two prong attack, one against all the people who tortured him, killing them for vengeance. The other is against the government, where he aims to gravitate support against the government, cause unrest, get people to question the government, and lead to an uprising against Adam Sutler on the 5th November. Early on in the film V saves Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a rebellious young woman who dislikes the government and works for the national television company. She falls for V's ideas, and sets out to help him in his quest. This despite her dislike for killing. The government as you can imagine doesn't like the idea of being overthrown. The special police are put on high alert and two officers are assigned to lead the cast, Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) and Peter Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith). Finch is simply a good cop who is just doing his duty, wanting to save people, and upset about the death of his friend, whilst Creedy is an ideologue who believes in the party and more importantly, his one self interest.

The graphic novel is of course always going to be better. It is so deep, full of ideas and numberous sub-plot. These can be covered in a comic format which when can handle them over a number of years, that a two-hour film can't. V for Vendetta is also a product of the Cold War and Thatcherism (the latter wouldn't have meant much to American audiences). In the graphic novel Britain had elected a left wing government which brought Britain out of NATO which is why Britain was never nuked during World War III. This had to be changed for modern audiences, and so it the idea of fascism vs. anarchism, to directorship and control vs. freedom of will. It was done well in the film though. For American audience V was turned from a anti-hero, anarchist who was willing to kill and betray anyone who stood in his way to more straight-forward hero who as well as uses action, uses more subtle methods to achieve his goals. The one major change I didn't like though was the change in Evey's character. In the graphic novel she starts as a scared 16-year-old orphan who lives in a labour camp and ends up trying prostitute herself. V saves her, introduces her to the world of rebellion and lets her grow as a character. She is a very conflicted, psychologically damaged girl, for example she has an with a man in his 50s. I thought that characterisation was more interesting.

V for Vendetta was the Wachowski brother's follow-up to the successful Matrix trilogy. They are big fans of the graphic novel, and wrote the script to be more then an action film or a simple comic adaption. It could easily have ended up being like Daredevil or Elektra where a not so well comic character ends up being in a weak film. They wanted to make a film with substances and places the film in a post 9/11, George W. Bush world. There are films about terrorism, how far someone should go, but I think the more important issue a government's use of fear to force through there policies (that's what George W. Bush and neo-cons did in America). Other ideas include freedom and what someone should do to ensure it, and the idea of liking in a surveillance society. The government in this film is basically a cross between the Nazis and Big Brother in George Orwell's brilliant 1984. I do however criticise the Wachowskis using some Americanisms in a film set in Britain. This is the first feature film by James McTeigue, an Australian who worked as the First Assistant Director on the Matrix trilogy. He shows he has a great eye of action, having some good, bloody fight scenes, as well as keeping the dramatic element, such as Evey's torture sequence and the flashback to the Larkhill Camp (they were also some of my favourite elements in the graphic novel). I'm sure the Wachowskis has some hand in directing the film, but hopefully McTeigue did most of the work. This make V for Vendetta a rare exception, were a first time director can make a good big budget film.

Hugo Weaving was very good playing the distant V, a character where you don't know much about his past and you never get to see his face. John Hurt and Tim Pigott-Smith make good villains, especially Hurt as the leader of the government. I however criticise the casting of Natalie Portman. Her English accent was weak and an English actress would have been better for the role. I think Keira Knightley would have been a better choice for Evey.

V for Vendetta tries to keep to the spirit of the graphic novel, not to the letter.",8

18 March 2006,V for Vendetta: or the Wachowski Bros learned to stop carrying and mess up Alan Moore's Writing!,"There are many ways to completely ruin great work. Even if you're trying really hard to be authentic to it. Let's face it, the Wachowski Brothers do not know how to write dialogs. There idea of characters are the kind on one end who have infinite knowledge of all subjects and are able to articulate them and the kind on the other end who ask the ""W' rudimentary philosophical questions that represent how they interpret the audience: ignorant. So us moronic viewers have to sit through a pile of overly-articulate monologue's and then right after the questioning of them by the ""Keanu"" character played in this film by Natalee Portman (who to her best efforts tries to do a good job.) So beyond ruining some great Alan Moore writing, the brothers decide to let some assistant director take the helm of the director's chair. The opening sequence was like a poorly made Bruckhiemer movie (as well as the ending sequence). Laced with melodramatic musical score and some editor who loves to cut, never letting us look at a single shot for more than 1 second. It was disorienting, especially compared to how most Moore comic books are sequenced, in a very cinematic way. I'm glad I saw it, because I realized why Moore disowned it and it's unfortunate that no one has able to give any of his work the appreciation it needs.",3

2 April 2006,Republicans won't like this movie,"Make no mistake, this is a politically motivated movie. If you are one of the dwindling number of people who still support George Bush, don't waste your money and time. You would probably think that V for Vendetta is rubbish. On the other hand, if you liked ""Syriana"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck"", it's a safe bet that you'll like this one. This movie shows that democratic institutions are no protection against totalitarianism if the people of a country are willing to trade their civil liberties for security. It shows where America could be headed if the president is allowed to continue to consolidate his power and ignore the laws of the land, all in the name of security.

So much for the message, is the movie any good? Surprisingly, yes. I was not expecting much based on the previews and the mixed reviews. I just couldn't imagine enjoying a movie with ""V"" in the title and a main character who wears a mask the whole time. But my son likes Natalie Portman, so my wife and I took him to see it.

I'm glad we did. The movie grabbed me from the start and got better as it went along. This is one of Natalie Portman's best performances and she has never looked more beautiful. Hugo Weaving makes a good intellectual hero despite the fact that he has to act without ever showing his face. That outlandish mask didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. The directing is good. McTeigue has a particularly effective street scene at the end of the movie. I liked the unpredictability of the plot. It has some totally unexpected twists. Sure, the movie is overly dramatic, but given that the stakes are so high, that didn't bother me.

If you are worried about the future of America or if you are apolitical and want to see a thinking person's action flick, I can highly recommend V for Vendetta.",7
1 April 2006,Mind Blowing,"When I entered the theater I was hoping to see a movie that I would add to my favorites list. A movie that would have many different emotions. I was hoping to see a great film. The movie went above my expectations.

In the first 10 or so minutes, I worried that there would be nothing but violence... but the next scene threw that out the door. With a bombardment of ""v"" words who couldn't smile? This film didn't only have humor and violence... it had so much more. More that you just cannot explain. For example: right when you have a serious point in the film, someone will ask a question... the answer will be so simple that you almost laugh.

Almost nothing turned out the way I expected, and I'm normally pretty good at figuring out endings. When it was over I just stared at the screen, as did my friend and my mom. It was over... yet not.

On the way home you just keep thinking. It feels as if everything you once thought was taken out of your head, then replaced, but with a new thought too. Will this really happen? that's one thing you wonder. This is a film you will want to see more that once, as you are blown away the first time.

This movie will not be my favorite... for reasons I'm not sure. It will be a movie I will buy and watch a few times for sure, but it just cannot be classified as my favorite... it's just not it's style. It doesn't seem right.

And also... as I went to sleep that night, I could not get Guy Fawkes face or the 1812 Overture out of my head. :)",10
6 August 2006,S10 Reviews: V for Vendetta (2006),"Natalie Portman stars (sans hair) in the Vertigo adaptation of the cult Alan Moore / David Lloyd comic. Set in the not-to-distant future, 'Vendetta' tells the tale of ]V] (Hugo Weaving) a man who channels the ghost of Guy Fawkes to continue the good fight against a English dictator trying to rule the populace '1984' style.

'V' is a wonderfully written and acted adaptation (which Moore once again blasts) with excellent low-light photography (by the late Adrian Biddle) and overall guidance by 'The Matrix' Trilogies' Wachowski Brothers. Weaving gives one heck of a verbose and over-the-top performance but it works smashingly and is a highlight of the film. Portman is remarkable as well and is starting to show a bit of range as time goes on as the Sinead O' Rebellion Evey, a young woman with more in common with the terrorist 'V' than she could possibly imagine.

Yeah it definitely has a political slant but that's what the story's about. 'V for Vendetta' is an excellent action / drama with solid acting and imagery that should appeal to comic fans. One of my favorites for the year.",9
7 September 2014,"A thoroughly adventitious, thought provoking film.","A thoroughly adventitious, thought provoking film. It glorifies anarchist and nihilistic feelings within.

The scene where V (Hugo Weaving) introduces himself to Evey (Natalie Portman) is in itself a masterpiece in dialog writing.

V: The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V. Evey Hammond: Are you, like, a crazy person? V: I am quite sure they will say so. But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking with? Evey Hammond: I'm Evey.

After reading that absolutely mind blowing piece of writing, I really doubt if whatever I review here is read or even pertinent. But on a more personal note, It's important to me as a person to stand up to something, stand up to my conviction, my own beliefs and disbelief's, to stand up to my own self, that has made me. To stand in itself is a great thing but to stand up against everything, demands a character. A character that may be disliked, ostracized but shall nonetheless have one person who embraces it and who shall become the company of him or her for as long as he is alive. Now, the question that always bugs me how me do have character, how many question, how many seek the truth, how many seek reason.

The answer as it stood always is hardly any. The reason is most men and women are molded by beliefs that some others (be it parents, society, teachers) have embedded in them, but should they seek reason, they might have their own varied reasons and that would make him ""HIM"" or her ""HER"". I cannot put this succinctly but I hope you are getting what I am trying to convey.

I was told that 9 hours stay is a rule put in office, I asked for a reason, I was presented with one, I did not buy that reason, so I do not follow that rule. So am I an anarchist? Yes coz I do not follow rules that are not substantiated with reason. But still I have my own little discipline, my job pays me something, so I have to give back what I am expected to from my job. So that's the discipline I follow and the only thing indeed. OK, now let me sway back to movie, the purpose is to review it, but it triggered such nihilistic and anarchist thoughts that I was bound to put whatever I did above.

Hugo Weaving has a voice that is so haunting and manly that even though he wears a Guy Fawkes mask, we know that for sure behind that mask is a man who is strong enough to seek command just by his voice. Hugo Weaving plays V with a command. Natalie Portman as Evey plays her part sublimely well. The way she sleeps in Jail is enough for me to convince she is a good actress. All others, have done exceedingly well in there roles. But what made the movie so special is the environment, the dialog and the way characters are developed, you have a villain, a hero, a heroine and a setup, all are placed well and told us to supremely so that's what makes this a great film. For whoever worked on the fireworks in the film, a big thanks to them, coz they were so gorgeous.

I ca't say much but I loved it, I can relate to it coz I am a questioning person, an anarchist myself who has a discipline. You don't break rules that are formed with a reason that are made to make everyone happy and not just a group of people. Like driving on one side of road, not breaking signals etc. But rules formed without a proper reason, rather a reason your conviction does not buy then it need not be followed.

By rating this film, a 5/5 I am just completing a mere formality. But I warn each one of you (those reading this) to give this film some time coz this is not an instantaneously engrossing film, it grows with time. Inside most of us we sure have a V, but sadly we forget that there is one and succumb to the comforting herd called the world.",10
26 March 2006,"""Behind this mask is a man, and behind this man is an idea. And ideas are bulletproof."" - V","So I expected 'V for Vendetta' to be a decent movie just from the talent that was in it, but I thought it would have a shaky storyline because the creators of the film, The Wachowski Brothers, were responsible for the Matrix sequels which crashed and burned faster than Vanilla Ice's music career (OOO! Diss!) However, I was quite surprised that 'V for Vendetta' turned into something more than a well-acted bam-bam shoot-em-up blow-em-up action picture. The film was not lacking on action, but it wasn't lacking on a great storyline either. The plot for 'V for Vendetta' is intriguing because it very well could be an accurate prediction of the future.

Imagine a society, a futuristic Britain society, where everyone is controlled by their government, and fear it. Imagine every second of every day being told what to think, do and eat. Imagine being the remains of a vicious holocaust led by a dictator as intolerant, determined and vicious as Adolf Hitler. That is pretty much the set up for 'V for Vendetta'. What would you do in this situation? Stand back and obey your orders, or fight? That's where terrorist codenamed 'V' comes in, a masked figure so fed-up with a fascist society he's willing to risk his life to restore the values and rights we once had. Along the way comes Natalie Portman's character who joins him in his revolution. The fight is on!

'V for Vendetta' is a very well made picture, surprisingly. Although it's pretty slow in the first half hour or so, it picks up tremendous pace and succeeds in enthralling it's viewer. The action sequences are breath-taking, and the acting is rock solid with spot-on performances from Natalie Portman, John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and Hugo Weaving who abandons his 'Agent Smith' like demeanor to play 'V for Vendetta's' protagonist. The aspect that's very admirable about the film is it's philosophy. The film is very poetic in the strangest of places, and that's exactly what separates it from most of noisome feces Hollywood produces on an all-too-regular basis.

'V for Vendetta' is not a masterpiece, and is not Oscar-calibre, however it's still a great film that almost anybody who isn't in awe of fascism and hate crimes can appreciate. I strongly recommend it. Grade: B+ (**** out of *****) (Screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 3/26/06)",8
19 March 2006,This is not a film for everyone...,"For those folks that hated ""Fight Club"" and whose reasoning was that it was just about guys beating each other up, for those who disdain ""Watership Down"" because it was about rabbits, those who sneer at ""The Little Prince"" because it is a children's book... those folks will hate this movie, and they will tell you that it is about a crazy person that blows things up.

A unique film experience in that it is possessed of much flash and boom and sturm und drang, it remains literate, and very much true to its source. So much so, that my estimation of Alan Moore has dropped as he insisted his name be removed from this film. Your loss, Mr. Moore.

While the windmills Mr. Moore was tilting at have proved to be just shadows on the political landscape, forbearing that which is as things are, the story, and the impact, remain.",10
8 June 2008,Overrated by IMDb users,"From memory when this movie came out most reviewers gave it 6-7 out of 10. This is a more accurate reflection of the film's merit than what the average IMDb user has given it. I would put this down to a proportion of users having not seen enough 'good' movies in their time. For those who have seen enough of these movies they would know that nearly everything in this film has already been done many times before. Honestly, how many times is the 1984/big brother theme going to be rehashed? It is a great book and all but someone needs to think of a new dystopian premise. The other one that has been done to death is the plague that either kills people or turns them into monsters. The only variation of this film is that it combines the latter two premises, but really, that is just a testament to the fact that it is a 'dystopia by numbers' film. I guess it's just a trend - a money making operation.

To be fair, had I seen this when I was 12 I probably would have thought it was pretty good, but looking at it objectively there are definitely better equivalent films. My advice to those who liked this and haven't seen Bladerunner, A Clockwork Orange and to a lesser extent: Dark City, Gattaca and 12 Monkeys - is to get down to your video store quick smart and hire them out!",6
18 April 2006,Alan Moore was right to remove his name from this film.,"When I first heard that Alan Moore's V FOR VENDETTA was being adapted for the screen, I enjoyed a brief frisson... but this quickly turned to a cynical wait-and-see attitude after I read that Moore himself was asking to have his name removed from the project. Alan Moore is known to be rather rigid in his scruples, but there are those who feel that his rigidity is overblown, and that the man is some kind of bitchy primadonna.

Count me in, Alan. This film is a piece of garbage.

Sure, it *looks* good. The cinematography, costuming, makeup, sets, and all around technical merit can't be faulted much, although the film does suffer slightly from touches of a misguided Matrix-like darkness. Many of the shots in the film are startlingly like panels from Moore's original graphic novel... but looks are not everything, and sometimes they're not anything at all. Moore's V FOR VENDETTA is a piece of work with a serious, vibrant, important, and challenging message, not a wretched excuse for the usual Hollywood explosion porn that one might find in any Bruce Willis action abortion. Director James McTeigue and screenplay writers Andy and Larry Wachowski should be ashamed of the gutting they've given Moore's work. They have hijacked a truly inspiring piece of truly subversive art and cranked out a hollow, incoherent, castrated, de-fanged and de-clawed mockery of it. Their adaptation is a dark triumph of idiot form over intellectual substance, an arrogant slap in the face laden with product placement to add insult to the injury. This is carefully preripped punk rock fashion being sold in Macy's. It's Pat Boone singing a Little Richard song. This film is Velveeta being advertised as top-shelf Camembert.

I just don't know where to start digging into the fetid, cannibalistic co-opting that I see here. The only value this film has is as a touchstone for those of us who have read the graphic novel, and then only if we can overlook the utter debasement that has been perpetrated by McTeigue and the Wachowskis. Perhaps if we turned the sound off while watching.

Before seeing the film, I figured that no matter how badly they botched and bungled it, no matter how cynically they sold it out, it would still be a worthwhile thing if only V's televised speech was preserved intact. And of course, they gutted and polluted that too.

It could be argued that the politics of the film are nicely pointed, and pointed in the right direction: straight at the whorish corporate hearts of Bush's America and Tony Blair's England. The problem is that that point is (like the rest of the film's plot) muddied and blunted by an incoherence that makes one wonder how much of their zillion-dollar budget went up the noses of Mssrs. McTeigue and Wachowski in the form of entertaining white powdery substances. This is aside from the fact that Moore's V FOR VENDETTA was clearly, overtly, and unapologetically a manifesto of Anarchism as a polar opposite of Nationalism-cum-Fascism, while the McTeigue/Wachowski version is a thin, watered-down gruel that has rejected Anarchism as too radical, too controversial, and tossed it unceremoniously into the lime-pit in favor of an inchoate tissue of vague and fuzzy Democracy Lite... in fact, it turns our hero to the cause of exactly the sort of poorly defined emotional-response pseudo-Democracy that has been rammed down our throats by crypto-Nationalist neocon flag wavers like Bush and Blair for most of the last decade. The only relief here is that they didn't shove any pious Christian dialogue into V's mouth... I guess they felt vindicated in totally blowing off the original political message by keeping the story superficially hostile to the Christian Right (John Hurt as the leader of Britain's Fascist/Nationalist government is still clearly a jerk who doesn't believe in the separation of Church and State, the kind of pig who is busily ruining America by insisting on the legislation of Christian morality in all contradiction of the concepts of religious freedom and ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"").

Vendetta against those who would co-opt our nobler impulses and our rebellion in the name of corporate profits! And while we're at it, all hail Alan Moore... not so much for creating V FOR VENDETTA in the first place, but more for refusing to allow his ideals to be compromised by mere money, and for having the stones to disassociate himself utterly with this bowdlerized, bastardized, perverted, and ultimately worthless adaptation instead of taking the money and spreading his artistic legs like every whore in Hollywood who drops trou and bends over for big money business transactions. Woe unto those who actually paid to see it, and had no chance to make a similarly informed decision; for them (in an intellectual and political sense) this film is nothing more than a brutal symbolic gang-rape at the hands of counter-revolutionary corporate goons.

18 March 2006,Bold/Stunning,"Just back from seeing it and have to say wow! this was a film i thought ""hey trailer looks cool"" and then when i started to watch it the thought of ""oh lots of Brit actors hmmmm!"" kind of put me at a point of unease.......why? Well i am a Brit and its strange to see TV actors in big screen films that us Brits know so well running round on a flashy USA film, most of them i myself find hard to really go for because i see actors who do TV soaps 24/7 then once in a blue moon they turn up in a big film and its a case of ""hey look its him from......"" well that was then but V is now and i can not think of a film in the last 10 years that has been mostly UK actors let loose on a big film and pulled of credible acting to match anything overseas, the film its self is a brave/bold/stunning/thoughtful/clever film, it has no real bad points to say of which is rare theses days though i do think its a love it hate it film, it does not conform to most films and goes about been the film that it is while sticking 2 fingers up at other films who toned down there adaptation of comics in the past. I can go on all night about what makes this film work and others before it fail but your the best person to judge that so all i can say is go see it and treat yourself to one of the best films of its kind ever.",9
21 March 2006,"Brilliant movie, far better than the Matrix sequels!!","The science fiction genre is very much a mixed bag. The success rate is minimal and generally the mega budgeted films fall flat and lifeless. V For Vendetta however falls under the mid budget range category and as such it's not a bloated attempt at marketable science fiction excess. This isn't like Bays shallow film The Island, or the disappointingly tame vision from Alex Proyas in I Robot, whose previous science fiction film was the moderately budgeted and superb Dark City. Essentially the producer pressure of these over-hyped and overpriced rip-offs don't have the love and attention given to films not green=lit with hundreds of millions. For example the first Matrix film, the most influential of it's genre since Terminator 2 (a rare hundred mill plus success!) was infinitely more engrossing than it's lifeless sequels. With endless resources at hand and the ability to go extreme, the Wachowski's two sequels attempted to cram our heads with philosophy and religious connotation that was more subtly fed to the audience in the original. The films survived only by the impressive effects and huge action scenes, and that goes for other similarly gigantic sci-fi epics. The films shot under that 100 mill bracket show more ingenuity and more heart, and mostly more originality. Even right down to ultra low budget there have been great films, like Cube, far more enjoyably thought provoking than the now boring Matrix sequels that completely lack the original films repeat value.

V For Vendetta is an immensely enjoyable experience. It is completely immersing and engrossing. The Orwellian plot, with the idea of a society led to be a utopia is as usual really a dystopian nightmare. In respect of the plot, influenced by the Guy Fawkes plot, we have seen this kind of story before, in movies and mostly in literature, and it's very similar to 1984. However this film feels so fresh, and as I watched it I felt I was watching something new, different, despite a recognised storyline. The film though, written by the Wachowski's has the depth instilled in their other films thus far. However this time V for Vendetta doesn't attempt to dully cram in existentialism into the gullets of its audience as in the Matrix sequels, rather it's depth is subtle and nicely delivered and will no doubt lead to great discussions on internet forums. This film will grow and grow and become a Sci-Fi classic like The Matrix.

The film is brilliantly directed by James McTeigue making his directorial debut, previously being an assistant to the Wachowski's and also George Lucas. Now there will no doubt be conspiracy theorists claiming Larry and Andy were in fact pulling the strings here, in their roles as producers and writers, but clearly, while showing some consistent style with the Matrix films, this is stylistically different enough to suggest Mcteigue is responsible for the most enjoyable Science Fiction film since Spielberg's Minority Report. He will be a name to watch no question. The film looks great that's for sure. The complementary relationship between visuals and script are first rate. Also while the trailers may have suggested this would be an effects heavy film worthy of the Wachowski's name, they were misleading. This is not a CG laden movie, there is comparatively little CGI to most modern flicks of the action/ sci-fi genre. Similarly the film has fight scenes but not the balletic martial arts of the Matrix films. There are marital arts but we get up close and personal, rough and ready. This is meant to look ugly not graceful. Also on another technical standpoint the production design is fantastic for this British and particularly, London set film. The musical score is also fresh and original sounding one of the most interesting scores I have heard for some time, from Dario Marianelli.

The cast are excellent, made up of a plethora of excellent British actors like the chilling John Hurt, and also good turns from Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and Rupert Graves. The leads though are firstly Natalie Portman who is mesmerising as Evie. Not only due to her astounding beauty but a rich performance only marred by the odd slip on her near faultless London accent. She puts completely to dark her subdued turns in the Star Wars flicks and once again proves what an exceptional young actress she is (One Oscar nom already and will surely be adding more in the near future). Hugo Weaving stars too as the physical and vocal actor portraying V. In a role where he does not show his face at all, and wears a solid and inexpressive white mask, Weaving exudes gravitas, giving an impossibly rich and ambiguous performance for a rich and ambiguous character. V is at once a character to sympathise with and be unsympathetic to. He is at once a hero, a freedom fighter, a rebel, an anarchist and a terrorist. He's a walking contradiction but it makes his character incredibly intriguing. Indeed the fact we never really get close to his character or learn too much may annoy some people, but it added to the film for me and I feel will only create discussion, and theorising amongst buffs. The film indeed leaves questions left needing answers. It teases us and then holds back, and before you know it the credits are rolling. The sense of mystery will be discussed no doubt.

Overall this was a very enjoyable piece, bar for some pacing issues with some side plots, but still an engrossing film nonetheless. This will be a cult classic I'm sure and deservedly so. ****1/2",9
2 April 2006,1984 and Phantom of the Opera with PC Shlock,"Where do I begin? ""V for Vendetta"" is a fun movie, with an annoying aftertaste that gets more pronounced as you leave the theater and begin the walk home.

I never read the book. I don't believe that a movie must stick to the dogma of the book that was its inspiration. It's a movie, with liabilities and assets that don't necessarily work in both mediums.

It should be noted that as a right-of-center libertarian type who believes that the United States is the last hope for maintaining liberty in the world, I view things from a particular perspective.

I like the concept of fighting for freedom in a repressive society. I'm not against the concept of using violence to overthrow tyranny. I don't mind borrowing themes from different movies and books. And I think that Natalie Portman is maturing into a decent actress. I don't even mind the occasional cliché, even if it pokes fun at my wonderful United States.

But you know... you can't base a movie on clichés and political correctness. And that is exactly what the core theme of this movie is all about.

I don't believe what I'm about to say involves spoilers and apologize if it inadvertently does, but in this flick, the villains are Christian males of European extraction, hereafter referred to as ""Pale Faces."" The film takes place in England. The United States is a warmongering trouble maker who has screwed up the world and the British Torries are a bunch of authoritarian tyrants who have turned Great Britan into a police state.

In England everyone is a ""Pale Face,"" because they have expelled or killed everyone else. Naturally, the expelled Arab Moslems, West Indians and Africans were total innocents. They were in no way responsible for the violence, drug dealing and terrorism that apparently made the ""Pale Face"" majority kick out the Labor Party and vote for Torry fascists. And the British Labor Party (renoun for passing anti-free speech legislation and firearms confiscation laws) has passed from the scene.

But wait folks, because it doesn't end here. Homosexual ""Pale Faces"" have been forced back into the closet and the Koran has been banned because it is a tremendously beautiful and profound work of art. Naturally, nothing is mentioned of the Bible where the Book of Psalms is generally considered to be one of the best done prose ever written. That goes well with the rapist pedophile Christian clergy that support the tyranny and are even in it's government.

After all, we know that Moslem clerics are universally peaceful, never condone violence, believe in free speech, religious freedom, strenuously object to honor rapes and slowly sawing infidel's heads off like turkey legs.

The only thing omitted to make this skewed scenario complete would be to have a few Jewish Doctors harvesting the organs of illegal aliens for sale in Tel Aviv. But I guess that would be too much, even for the Worchowski brothers to capitalize on. And by the way, I'm a practitioner of the Jewish faith and a military officer, so get over it.

What a world! What a world! This is definitely not Kansas anymore.

Up from the ashes comes a ""Pale Face"" hero in a mask. But wait a minute. He's not really a ""Pale Face,"" because diabolical genetic engineering has morphed him into a scarred and mangled ""any man"" (or ""any person"" if you wish).

Natalie Portman gets her head shaved, truth and justice reigns and it can be assumed that ethnic drug dealers, terrorists and illegal aliens are invited back into England to restore civilization under a Socialist Labor government.

Somebody give me a break.",6
24 February 2007,Does fascism justify terrorism?,"In the near future, after the United States collapses and England is plagued by a biological terror attack, a Christian fundamentalist (John Hurt) is elected chancellor, and immediately enforces Nazi-esquire restrictions and curfews. He creates a propaganda ministry which controls all media, and a secret police called the fingermen.

Evey (Natalie Portman) is an aspiring actress who works as an assistant at the state-run TV station. One night, she is accosted by three fingermen. Out of the shadows comes a mysterious man (Hugo Weaving) wearing a cape and a Guy Fawkes mask, and referring to himself only as V. He is trained in hand-to-hand fighting and speaks poetically and articulately.

The following morning, he attacks the TV station where Evey works. He forces them to play a DVD, in which he explains his admiration for Guy Fawkes, his grievances with the government, and his intention to do what Fawkes failed to accomplish 400 years ago: blow up Parliament. Feeling obligated to help the vigilante who saved her, she helps him escape when the police surround him.

As Evey and V become friends, we learn that her entire family fell victim to the government, as did V. He is not just fighting for the freedom of England, but for his own personal vendetta against those who made him the monster he knows he is.

Stephen Rea is well cast in support as Inspector Finch, assigned to find V and bring him to justice. Hugo Weaving creates a sympathetic vigilante, despite the fact that we never see his face. Natalie Portman is perfect as Evey, the character she famously shaved her head to play.

Many of the themes have been examined before, most obviously in George Orwell's masterpiece ""1984,"" but also in the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy, in which politician uses a crisis to force himself into the position of a supreme leader. What is new is the dilemma of who is a freedom fighter and who is a terrorist.

""V for Vendetta"" is intelligent and disturbing. The imagery is beautifully artistic, the characters complex and sympathetic, and the future frighteningly Orwellian. The final battle between V and the police is gratuitously violent and unrealistic, but it makes a point: Ideas cannot die and one man can make a difference.",7
23 March 2006,A for Awesome,"V For Vendetta is an intelligent film with an interesting view into the future. It tells the story of a terrorist called V, who is attempting to overthrow the fascist British government in the year 2019. He is hunted by police, and joined by a young woman he believes is destined to be with him.

Like most comic book movies, V For Vendetta has a few big changes from the graphic novel, but unlike League of Extraordiary Gentlemen and Constantine, two other Alan Moore creations, the changes in this film make it somewhat more exciting.

In the film, V is such an engaging character that every moment he is off camera you find yourself wondering when he's going to come back. There is not much action in this film, so anybody going in expecting non-stop action like The Matrix will be sorely disappointed. Most of the film focuses on the rather unconventional relationship between V and Evey. I also liked how the movie is due attention to all aspects of the story. Romance, action, mystery, drama, even a little comedy thrown in. It's all present. One of my favourite aspects of the film is the realistic view of the future in the sense that it is only 13 years into the future, so don't expect anything too futuristic. No flying cars or laser guns here.

The performances in this film are really something else. I first saw Hugo Weaving in The Matrix, and I didn't think he was anything special. However, you have to have some amazing talent to be able to give a character dimension and charm, even though we never see his face. Natalie Portman wasn't always thrilling to me either, but she gives a great performance in this film. John Hurt...Well, John Hurt is always good no matter what role he plays.

V For Vendetta is a remarkable film that holds some truth in its message, and it is certainly better than most films that are set in the future. It's too bad that Alan Moore didn't want his name to be connected to this. He might have been proud, and he would've made huge money.

3 August 2006,Exciting Flick and Insightful Cautionary Tale,"Discount the fact that this is adapted from Alan Moore's wonderful comic, and you'll find a film that retains a lot of the great elements of the source material while combining enough elements in its own right to create a well timed film that is both exciting, and though-provoking.

First off, this is a fun film to watch. It is full of action, suspense, and very interesting characters. V is presented initially as a vigilante, acting against the government with a sort of madness that like our heroine, Evey, we can't decide if he's insane or if he's right. V is a very literate, skilled fighter. Though some may mistake the acting as a bit too much melodrama, Hugo Weaving plays him quite well, capturing the madness, mystique, and the overall marvel of our hero. As Evey, Natalie Portman plays her with initial curiosity and fear and shifts the character as strong and independent over the course of the film. Given the larger than life premise of the film, the believability of the actors is one of the key successes of this film. Rounding out the cast are Stephen Rea, comedian Stephen Fry, and the infallible John Hurt, playing a highly unlikeable High Chancellor.

The subject matter of the film has come under much debate, as V is clearly noting that something is very wrong with the country he and his fellow citizens live in. He chooses to act and encourages others to act against a government that is robbing the country of its freedoms. Though not quite 1984, the film illustrates a government not far removed from some of our fears today. V drops quotes throughout the movie as a sort of warning and foreshadowing about the power the people have over the government. The finale can be seen as an act of just retaliation or an act of terrorism, depending on your viewpoint. The story is told in such a way, that it is, to me, brilliant satire, exhilarating and fun to watch, without being too preachy.

That the source material is almost 20 years old and that the themes in the story are even more timed today illustrates the brilliance of the story. But this is also a fun film to watch. There are fun action scenes throughout this film, including some great knife play by V and a very chilling third act. Intelligent, and fun, the film is a cautionary tale timed very well in these troubled times.",9

21 August 2006,People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.,"I have to say that watching this film on a long flight from London to Newark was kind of interesting. The Guy Fawkes masks were unpleasant to look at but it had another meaning. Imagine a world run by John Hurt's character, what brilliant casting that was to cast him. Remember he starred as Winston in the George Orwell novel based film, 1984, in 1984. Well anyway, he was perfect as the ruthless British dictator. I only caught the last hour of it but I can tell it was a great film filmed in London and Germany. His ruling party is basically a fascist culture much like the Nazis. They close the London Underground or at least they think. V is the mysterious guy in a mask who captures and releases Evie played by Natalie Portman. Ironic that they filmed this movie in Germany of all places but that's another story. Anyway, V is seen as a villain in the beginning until Stephen REa from the Crying Game begins to understand him as well as Evie does. It's a weird love story between Evie and V. I am giving it a 9 because I wanted to see V's face.

26 November 2014,Revolution in the air. The fascist party has control. A bunch of officers try to molest Vieve in steps V. That is the starting for their partnership..,"There are some beautiful concepts in this film. Quite brilliantly done. The mask will always remember itself in countless people's memory as a symbol of freedom. The fascist ideology never tallied with democratic approach and this is a clash of the two. While all the people have chosen a fascist government, a man and a girl make a stand against a hypocritical government. Lots of beautiful thoughts are also weaved into the tale of November the 5th. The world around should not be a lie. Freedom is what we thrive for. Never accept the fear inside all of us that will consume you and suffocate the life out of you. If V is for vengeance, this is a tale of feud. If V is for revolution then it is a search for the fundamentals that makes us want to be alive.

18 March 2006,P for Propaganda!,"(I wish there was a '0' on the voting listing this movie gets a DOUBLE-AWFUL!) The movie is suppose to be about government propaganda and corruption. If if want to find propaganda and corruption - this movie would be a great example. This movie pushes 'the line' off a cliff'! It has 'the hero' walking into government buildings with SUICIDE BOMBS strapped to him! - I, for one, do NOT find this funny at all. We are a world at war - And Suidice bombers are NOT to be lifted up as examples - as this movie portrays. The movie tries to push an idea... that the USA was to blame for the 9-11 attack, ""What if we blamed the Religious Extremists when it was the government all the time"" - Now you can start to make conspiracy theories, or you can realize what this movie is promoting.

This movie is crammed with political issues... and TOO MANY, the plot seems forced - agendas coming out of the wall, literally! Even if you agree with them - they still seem misplaced! I walked out on this one 3/4 of the way through, and if I didn't have friends with me, I would have walked out within the first 20 minutes! After the movie was over, I heard comments ALL OVER THE PLACE, ""That movie was weird/strange"", ""That didn't make any sense"", ""Woah! What was that about?!?"" In conclusion, this movie had a definite underlined agenda. The movie itself doesn't make any sense (unless you understand the propaganda they are pushing!) Unrealistic situations. I wish I could tell you how TERRIBLE this movie was!!! Not to mention how BAD Natalie Portman looks with her head shaved (from a girls perspective at least).",1
31 March 2006,Don't try to overlook this Academy!!!,"We all know the way Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror and Comedies are treated by the Yearly academy awards. Who doesn't remember the way they treated the Lord of the Rings-Trilogy?

But this year they can't, they are not allowed to overlook this movie.if they do, I suggest someone with a lot of money goes to court to get all members of the academy fired.

I wanted to watch two movies today, V for Vendetta at noon and another one, around4 o'clock. But the moment I left the theater I was walking on eggs, on air, or whatever words I can use to describe my feelings... They probably will never explain the way I felt watching this movie and leaving the theater.

I felt profound, impressed, swept of my feet. The past years I haven't had any movie touch me so much like this one. Even though there are minor moments in the movie that I didn't like. But really, I wouldn't easily give 10 points, but I do this time. The performance by Natalie Portman shows us (again) that she can do much better than playing a nice beautiful princess in Star Wars. She is one of those (few) young faces on the white screen that are on their way to become a screen legend, a screen diva. She made shivers go down my spine.

But I can't say there was one actor or actress in this movie that didn't show the audience that they had talent and that their talent was why they were chosen to be a part of this movie.

Again, I can keep on writing, but with a lack of words to give the cast the honor they deserve, I better send my warning again to the Academy (bafta and others too) : DON'T you DARE to overlook this movie !!!",10

18 March 2006,"Anti Christian, Pro Terrorist propaganda","Honestly, the movie was pretty entertaining aesthetically. But movies carry more than just aesthetic value. This movie was more about a message that America is on a path to destroying the world as we know it, and the result will be an ultra intrusive police state. Particularly sickening was the line about sacrificing a building for some hope. What tripe. Entertaining? Yes. Good movie? NO WAY.

This story would never have flown if it were set in the US, say DC, NYC, or Philly instead of London. The theme is the same. Bush is a liar, gays are wonderful, Christians are evil, Terrorists are freedom fighters.

I had already read some of the reviews. I knew there were concerns about this being a pro-terrorist movie, but I couldn't help but purchase a ticket to see it. I loved the Matrix trilogy. I wish I could take my money back now. Do not waste your money on this film.

27 March 2006,Natalie Portman makes the movie.,"""V for Vendetta"" was entertaining. I've read that the story is based on a graphic novel that I am not familiar with and so I probably missed many of the movie's references. The story concerned a revolutionary, V, in his battle with a future totalitarian English government. V enlists the help of young women, Evey, played by Natalie Portman, who he rescues from some predatory, corrupt police officials. Much of the story revolves around Evey and her relationship with the V character. Telling more would ruin the story. There's quite a bit of violence in the movie and towards the end there's a sequence of choreographed violence that I found to be too much though maybe those familiar with the graphic novel expected this kind of money shot. The movie featured many fine actors including John Hurt, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, Tim Pigott-Smith and others. Natalie Portman was very good, in fact she was a surprise delight of the movie. I thought she was better looking after being shorn. She's a babe. The cinematography was good and the story was complex enough to hold your interest. Some of the soliloquies were a bit idealistic but that is to be expected in this type of movie. Overall it is well worth a watch.",8
31 March 2021,POWER TO THE PEOPLE!,"The man wears a mask, with no visible features. Who is he? No one really knows, but does it really matter. However, he has a voice and a purpose:

A Voice that reasons; A Voice that persuades; A Voice that Violates; A Voice that Vindicates and A Voice that advocates Vengeance!

Returning ""Power to the People"" is his raison d'etre!

18 March 2006,"Fantastic, Brilliant, Amazing, and Downright Awesome","V For Vendetta is the story of a man who rebels against a dictatorship government in the future. The movie has close ties to reality, and provides a very strong message. All I can say about this movie is WOW! Now I went into the theater expecting a good movie but I was expecting something this good. Hugo Weaving (V) really comes across as a bad-ass rebel in this movie. Natalie Portman (Evey) is great once again, this time portraying an innocent, scared girl who eventually comes face to face with her fears. John Hurt (Sutler) really makes you believe that he actually is a dictator in real life, he is that good. The acting overall in V4V is sensational.

The acting isn't the only good thing in this movie, the action is phenomenal. It will keep your interest for the entire 133 minute duration of the film.

The story is excellent. It is hard to come across one as good as V4V nowadays. About a very dark, grim look into the future where government rules absolutely everything and everyone is at its mercy. But there is one who fights, our beloved V. Thus creating the ever, enticing story.

So, all in all, I STRONGLY recommend you see V For Vendetta. It is the best movie I've seen in a long while, and the best movie I've seen so far in 2006.",10
26 March 2006,"Awesome entertainment... and food for thought, too.","Not having read the comic book (yeah, as if comic books had any literary value to start with! :) ), I enjoyed this movie immensely. I'd put it on par with the original Matrix - a movie where I really didn't know what was going on right until the end. I'd say it's ""1984"" for the 21st Century - a vision of a totalitarian government, and how one man struggled to make a difference.

This movie polarizes viewers. I'd guess you could even ""guess"" the political affiliations of people by asking them whether they liked this movie, or not. The fact that action sequences are handled in a very sensible way doesn't help, either. This is not a ""blow-em up movie"" that is easy to like...

All in all, an excellent movie. A must-own DVD.

25 August 2015,"A good movie, but with dangerous ideas.","This film focuses on the mysterious figure V, a masked without name or identity that stands against the English government. Everything takes place in a dystopian future, where parliamentary democracy gave way to a totalitarian one-party government, based on a strongly nationalist, repressive and ultra-conservative ideology. Inspired by a catholic conspiracy of the seventeenth century (the Gunpowder Plot), V declares himself a defender of democracy, starts a terror campaign against the government and incites the people to revolt against dictatorship. But, what no one knows is that V is driven by a desire of vengeance linked to his mysterious past. By his side is Evey Hammond, a young woman who is saved by V and eventually become close to him.

The film is an adaptation of a comic book written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd in the eighties. It was directed by James McTeigue, who also directed the ""Matrix"" trilogy and that seems to have a particular taste for Orwellian dystopias. The cast is headed by Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portmann in the roles of V and Evey, having been at a great level and toasted the audience with excellent performances. Very interesting are also some dialogs and talks, in particular the way that V introduces himself before Evey in the beginning of the film, where almost every word he says begin with the letter V. The character was able to transcend their individuality and become a symbol of struggle, with a gentle touch of anarchism. Such a strong symbol that, even today, we see masks similar to those used in this film in many protests around the world.

The only negative note: this film does, although perhaps without that intention, a ""defense"" that the ends justify the means, and no matter the destruction of public buildings, works of art and historical monuments when we are looking, through this gesture, to defend an idea or cause that we thought to be important. However, this is terrorism, and the people who does it are that fanatics that we used to condemn in other movies and in real life, which makes this idea too dangerous to be ""supported"" by films like this.",7

22 January 2019,"A Solid, Compelling Action, Thriller","18 March 2006. What will be interesting regarding this movie is how Hugo Weaving as V will be assessed, not Natalie Portman's performance as Evey. Hugo plays the mysterious, quite literate, masked man who emotes with a fixed smiling mask. This sharp looking action thriller with political overtones to the terrorist policies of America today even though the exclusive focus on the movie is the action occurring in Britain. V echoes back to 1984 (the movie) and even Phantom of the Opera. The introduction of a stylish mask hero and a female heroine subjected to vile torture with a twist makes for compelling film-making. Yet for all the heroics, consistent script, the exaggerated and graphic novel appeal is also its distraction. Unlike 1984, V doesn't have that believability component. Unlike Brazil, V doesn't have the complete ethereal feel. Unlike Sin City, V doesn't manage to hold true to its comic roots. Eight out of Ten Stars.

4/28/2016. Perhaps it is the times. Like a resurrection, V dramatically presents an eerie sense of contemporary political times. with the mutant viruses, the civil wars, terrorism, big brother surveillance, and now the fear-plagued Presidential election of the United States, V seems to resonate even more poignantly and relevantly since its initial release. This movie now brilliant shines as an emotive, political statement as well as a smoothly, entertaining statement of timeless and important ideas.",9

23 April 2016,"Amazing Characters, Brilliant Action and a Tremendous Story","Remember remember the fifth of November When I first watched V for Vendetta I didn't know much about it. However I have always had a fascination with darker comic book movies such as The Crow and some of the Batman's. I am going start by saying that the character of V played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving is one of those characters that will be remembered and is an instance classic. This in truth is 1 of my favourite Natalie Portman performances, she is just so full of determination and curiosity and it's infectious. The scene where V and Evey first meat is truly tremendous. V saves Evey from some men trying to rough her up, she does hold her ground, V shows off some kick ass moves and a very versatile vocabulary (see what I did there). One of favourite things about V is he is an antihero yet he still views himself as a sort of freedom fighter who is standing up for the opposing government. The reason why I love this movie so much is the true determination to do what is right and the casualties that had to happen. V was a broken body but a free soul that wanted to make a difference and he did so. Was everything planned, I don't know but all I know is this movie is a must watch and truly is amazing",8
7 April 2006,True to the intent,"Finally - an Alan Moore story that hasn't been butchered by Hollywood. Unlike The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, this film has been made by people who like and understand the themes within the novel, and it's good to see what is arguably the best graphic novel (disregarding Neil's Sandman series ) brought to the general public who - by all accounts - seem to be very receptive to the themes (for some strange reason).

It's not obviously as good as the novel which includes more and varied themes that are not even touched on in the movie. The end is let down by the Wachowski treatment which wants to make some sort of superhero matrix-like fight sequence as a highlight of a big-bang action ending. Totally unnecessary, as is a bit of Hollywood schmaltz at the finale. However, overall, the writing is tight and sharp and it's still so much a film for our times, as it was one for the Thatcherite period. Obviously fascist tendencies are an integral part of government - that desire for total control over the population, which is increasingly seen as little more than a tax base and a means of supporting privilege among the few who deserve it (since they were the ones smart enough to rise to a position of power).",8
5 September 2006,"They get it , and politically miss it","It starts off with a testimony to the importance of free speech; i.e. IDEAS. The movie purports to show the power of that basis for all freedoms: the freedom to speak your ideas, your insights, your criticisms. Since these freedoms have been suppressed by a conservative-style government (anti-immigrant, homophobic, anti-Islamic, etc.) , kept afloat with the help of servile media, the answer lies in ""V"" as freedom-fighter. So far, so good - and it IS good, but where Hollywood (always) turns the blind eye is that IN REALITY, it is on the nation's liberal left campuses for example, that any opinion other than that of say, gay activists, is condemned as homophobic; any opinion contrary to unlimited abortion-on-demand is seen as anti-feminist; to oppose racial quotas is to be seen as ""racist."" The media is continually in the hip pocket of the left, and the IDEA of free-speech that ""V"" is championing are the very ideas liberal left-wingers will literally not allow to be spoken on campuses, in most Hollywood movies as well as the mainstream press. Having lived 4 years in the mideast, let me say it is obvious neither the Wachowski brothers, the director or the screenwriter had actually read the Koran, which they make a point of protecting from the angry xenophobic gov't. Had they done so, they would have seen that everything ""V"" id FOR is OPPOSED in a book that would suit well on any fascist's shelf. Mein Kamp would have been the same choice. Aside from turning real-world politics 180 degrees on its head, it's a fun movie that demonstrates Natalie Portman is the real-deal and hopefully we'll be seeing and hearing a lot more from her.",7
31 March 2006,People must be addicted to suck in large doses,"I was extremely excited to see this film. I am a huge fan of the Matrix films as well as a fan of Bound and I can honestly deal with Assassins. However, this current Wachowski brothers attempt is awful. It showcases the Wachowski's pure inability to write believable characters. The tawdry language of the film was pitiful. If vocabulary alone=solid characters then this film is rock solid. However, this film seems to use language in way that says ""Hey look at me, I used the thesaurus an awful lot during the making of this film, don't you think I'm special and oh so smart now?""

I keep hearing everybody raving about this film. Like the concepts are so ""amazing and mind blowing"", truly expressing the social concerns of our time. This movie is like an 8th grader telling you what politics and society are all about.

The cinematography is totally masturbatory. Atrocious slow-mo, pathetic behind the water- droplet zooms. This movie is a visual jerk off without the climax. I'm totally fine with indulgent film making, I really enjoy P.T. Anderson a lot, but this, this is terrible!

If you are one of those people that actually feels this film hits a homerun socially it probably proves that you are very imperceptive and you probably think that Ryan Reynolds is ""totally witty"".

And to finish off, if you actually enjoy watching an action movie, do not even bother with this tripe, because this film doesn't hit a single sweet spot in the name of action.",1
11 October 2006,Did I miss something?,"I feel terrible! Everyone keeps talking about how great this movie is, and I didn't care for it. Did I miss something? I'm serious. I loved the Matrix, but I thought this was boring. I was really annoyed by the fact that V imprisoned Evey, and as upset and ready to die as she was, as soon as she found out it was a ploy to break her by V, all of a sudden she was happy about it? That makes no sense. I'm really interested to know why this movie was so great. I'm not trying to bash it at all. I think I must have missed something. Could someone please tell me what I am missing so I can love this movie too? I was really excited to see it in the theater (and bummed that I had to wait 'til it came to Blockbuster), and then I didn't get it. :(
