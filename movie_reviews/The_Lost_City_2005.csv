23 March 2022,silly and formulaic by design,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

25 March 2022,Pieces that work and pieces that don't,"The Lost City has pieces that work and pieces that don't. Placing pretenders into an actual adventure is good for laughs and heart, yet much of this script is generic. Unimaginative MacGuffins, flat villains, and predictable romances are individually forgivable, but together, they override the premise's charm. Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum's charisma shines through and Pitt's cameo provides flavor, but that isn't enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn't painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.

Meanwhile, The Lost City's filmmaking is average. Its minor positives are the cinematography (intermittently dramatizing comedy and action), the sound (selling the combat and jungle setting), the production design (primarily real but often computerized), and the effects (employing real explosions amongst the CGI). Conversely, the editing occasionally sags (lingering on unessential jokes) and the music is distractingly trendy (forcing fun, rather than serving the narrative). Lastly, The Lost City lacks cohesion. Its humor and emotions never tonally blend, and instead take turns (which disconnects viewers). Ultimately, The Lost City has mild appeal, but functions inconsistently.

26 April 2022,Good fun.,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but on the whole, I did, some bits of it were pretty silly, but there were some nice moments, and a few bits that had me in stitches. Some of the sweeter, romance moments were maybe a little corny, but that's what was expected I guess.

Nice special effects, it looks great, I loved the locations used. You can argue it had a somewhat old fashioned, maybe old school vibe about it, but sometimes you just need a bit of silliness in your life.

Nicely acted, they all did a good job, Daniel Radcliffe was good fun, always enjoy his work.

It really does make the most of Channing Tatum's looks, and it does work, he is ridiculously handsome, and there are several tongue in cheek moments, he seems like a good sport.

25 March 2022,"A Solid, Throwback Comedy","Mainstream comedies that actually make it to theatres are slim to none these days. I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.

To put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she's on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of ""The Lost City of D,"" but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it's pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods.

This premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I'm very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.

I'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.

In the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don't think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously. Now playing in theatres, I'd give a recommendation to The Lost City.",7
25 March 2022,Enjoyable and amusing,"The first half of this movie is really funny. I was laughing more than most in the theater. There are so many well-written jokes and situational humor with about an 80% hit rate, including a few hilarious moments. The characters are fleshed out enough for me to care. The story is formulaic and relatively weak compared to the other aspects, but that's easily forgiven when it's making me laugh.

In the second half, the laughs slow down drastically. It gets a lot more serious with attempts at character arcs and story moments that aren't bad but are things we've seen a thousand times. I didn't hate watching it, but without as much comedy it's a much weaker movie.

The first half is easily seven stars. The second half is a weak six. I wouldn't mind watching this again but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. (1 viewing, opening Thursday night 3/24/2022)",6
1 October 2022,Better than the user rating on Imdb right now,"Bonkers that this film is rated only 6.1 on Imdb right now--it's better than that. Proof that folks who rate movies on here are sometimes guilty of the same crime that professional critics frequently make--looking the gift horse in the mouth. As you can see folks, this is not an art-house film--it's pure entertainment, and it delivers on that count.

My wife and I saw this in the theater--the Brad Pitt cameo alone is worth the price of admission and both Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock have lots of funny lines and pure situational/physical comedy too. What's not to like? A cast that's easy on the eyes and talented to boot, a fairly decent script and a love story with enough heft but still airy and entertaining.

24 March 2022,"Simple, fun, hilarious....","7.0/10

I actually enjoyed this film way more than I expected. It perfectly fits into its categories of action, adventure, comedy, and romance.

The story was very enjoyable. It started off kind of wonky and felt like I was in for a bad time, but once the ""prologue"" passed and the main portion of the movie started it got much better.

The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked surprisingly well, and only got better as the film progressed. I did enjoy Daniel Radcliffe as the antagonist. More of a bratty rich boy than an evil ""I want to murder everyone"" kind of bad guy.

By the end I felt that the big part of the film was that the romance was definitely geared towards the women while the action parts were geared towards the men. The comedy could've gone either way, and some may find certain parts funnier than others, both scenes and what's actually funny.

I also enjoyed the score. The way certain soundtracks were worked into the scenes noticeably helped enhance them (as soundtracks should).

Overall, I think this film is perfect for a movie date night. It's funny, it's romantic, it has a pretty good action/adventure story and it's not as cheesy as most romcoms tend to be.

I hope my review helps you make a choice on this film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",7
25 March 2022,Cute and funny enough,"A cute and funny enough rom com, a few more of the jokes were stale than I would have liked, but overall it accomplished its goal. A few laughs, a few ""awhs"", and a whole lotta ""omg is Channing Tatum hot""'d.

12 May 2022,A Mess of a Weak Plot and Little Chemistry,"From the early reviews I thought this was the film to see...but seeing it i'm amazed at those reviews.

In short, this was a weak and humorless version of Romancing the Stone. Without any chemistry between the actors...except for the possible chemistry in Sandra Bullocks face.

One minute they're in a city, then in the jungle, they're being shot at,then sleeping, the they're walking miles and miles...you don't know what the hell is going on.

26 March 2022,An enjoyable knockoff of Indiana Jones et al. Romantic and goofy.,"Yes, The Lost City is a sometime dimwitted, formulaic romantic adventure like Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones with not much creativity that I could tell. No, it is not totally boring because it offers a relaxing antidote to COVID anxieties plaguing us for two years. The cutthroat island shenanigans, with reclusive romance novelist Loretta (Sandra Bullock) and her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) are kidnapped looking for buried treasure.

What makes this romance mildly enjoyable is the charm of its stars, Sandy/Loretta just a bit too old but looking fab, and Channing, buff and self-deprecating enough to generate a spark with Loretta. Daniel Radcliff as baddie Abagail Fairfax seems out of place, but then that may be the point.

At our AMC-like theater there were a few other audience members far enough from us that we could cut up and converse, much like renting the theater for ourselves. Some solid scenes of repartee reminiscent of screwball comedies added to the pleasure of the island scenery and robust chases along with our not-always witty declamations.

I would recommend you staying home and enjoying the house invasion Windfall on Netflix except that we enjoyed being out and seeing what Hollywood could do when it barely tries. And when Brad Pitt does a cameo with surprising dexterity, your retro romance Lost City is fully updated, and even semi-glamorous if you ask me. And you didn't.",
19 April 2022,Moving on,"I try to avoid watching trailers before I see a movie. Sometimes it is inevitable - you can't escape certain trailers. So while I still managed not to see everything the trailer revealed, I already knew from the looks of it, that I would like the movie. And lo and behold the movie delivers the goods.

There may be certain role reversals (or gender cliches that are being made fun of if you want to call it that), but the way the actors are playing their roles will not make you think too much about that. At least not in a negative light - some people seem to be allergic when it comes to ""wokeness"" I reckon.

Channing Tatum has no problem taking his own image apart. Though he still will not accept bad dancing - but that is a different story. Harry Radcliffe ... I mean Daniel Potter ... ah well, the guy formerly known - actually still known as Harry Potter plays quite the fine villain.

There is an excellent cameo in this and there is also a bonus scene during the credits that you cannot miss under any circumstances. Sit back, relax and if the humor is your cup of tea, you'll have a blast with this.",9
12 May 2022,Uggggggggghhhhhhh,"This was rough. I guess I put my expectations too high from the previews. The part with Brad Pitt was fine the rest a typical Sandra Bullock overreacting to mild inconveniences and complete stupidity. Shoutout to the marketing team for making this look like something I would enjoy when I knew better, but thought maybe? Just maybe? Well I knew better. This is terrible.

25 April 2022,Mediocre at best...,"Great line up, but this film tries to hard to be funny with cringy and unforgettable action scenes... Felt like a total gimmick and clone of Romance in the Stone & Jewel in the Nile that both captured romance, action & humour so very well!

I think Sandra Bullock should stick to drama movies! This movie was painfully boring.

24 March 2022,Very fun despite some of the ridiculous bits,"Got to see the early ish screening considered date night on the regal app that was great time! One of the funniest things set up in the is experience was showing a short trailer of the movie 6 times that's never been a thing and there was feature before the movie started mostly talking about the red dress being a character itself that was silly. Didn't expect as much comedy as there was and highly entertaining action even an excellent soundtrack! I don't know about others but I loved the movie.

27 March 2022,Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum amazingly click,"It would be easy to call this a knockoff of Indiana Jones, but in some ways it kind of knows it, has a fun self aware vibe to it. It's merely just a satire of those treasure adventure films.

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have good chemistry, they just play off each other perfectly you can tell they are having a blast. Tatum is having fun paroding his pretty boy image. Daniel Radcliffe is quite the scene stealer has an over the top villain. It's just a fun movie, delivers some incredible laughs, and not for the faint hearted.

27 March 2022,Truly a waste of time and talent,"I can't quite understand how these actors would choose to make such a unfunny comedy. The humor is so basic and simple that I can't believe the actors thought this would work. With movies like these it feels as though mainstream Hollywood is intentionally trying to dumb down the population or they have become so arrogant they think they can throw a few good actors together in a film that's made with 110% cheese! It's a cheese party and laughs and humor weren't invited! And the prized guests of the party were signs and facepalms whilst shaking ones head. Was this to make a quick buck? Maybe help out a fellow producer or writer who is a friend? Or maybe they just rely on the names to bring in the money, but I don't see how any of the stars in the film can actually watch this film and feel at all good about themselves and the product they've put out. It's just a complete and utter fail from the very beginning. All I was wondering throughout the film is ""why?""

27 March 2022,Great duo and fun adventure but forgettable plot and thin amount of humor makes it decent.,"3 out of 5 stars.

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum were great with there on screen chemistry and worked great with providing humor. Taking them on a adventure to searching for the lost city before the bad guys go after the search. The cast is good. The concept is fun. The film does have some humor and entertainment. The plot is forgettable. And the film does have a small amount of humor that cant carry the movie.

12 May 2022,Jungle Dung Complete with Clichés & Stereotypes,"The amazing thing about this film -- despite the fact that it was made at all and that there isn't an original thought or idea throughout -- is that it's rated so highly on .imdb. It's also amazing that the talented actors ever agreed to be in this piece of jungle dung. The writing is terrible, amateurish, the dialogue silly, and the jokes totally unfunny. A total waste of talent.

Makes one wonder how many of the positive reviews were left by paid Paramount employees.

15 May 2022,Just stupid,"When you do not cut a simple plastic zipper with which you are tied to a chair, but instead carry the whole chair, you know the rescue opp is botched.

This movie is plain stupid and irritating.

The script is as if it's written by a five year old kid. Absolutely kiddish. The humour is forced and flat and the cast is pathetic.

Worst, the end: there is no end. It just ends as foolishly as it began.

2 April 2022,"The Lost City Of D, Not Z","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue.

16 May 2022,What a hapless abomination,"The makers of this movie are not a stupid as you would think having watched this garbage because they were smart enough to overplay Bratt Pitt's role which is 90% of the trailer and 1% of the film, the only good 1%. The writing is horrific, the acting wooden, the dialogue embarrassing and the plot stolen from Romancing The Stone. Sandra Bullock is awful, Channing Tatum, charmless and Daniel Radcliffe so bad it hurt my eyes to watch him. It is a truly awful film. It has no charm, no wit and no chemistry between the leads. I am angry at myself for wasting two hours on it.

2 June 2022,A fun and entertaining one time watch,"Novice writers and directors brother duo the Nee's did an impressive job with this full length feature film, especially considering their previous works were mainly shorts. The 112 runtime was used up well, although a little faster pacing and/or some scenes trimmed down would've shown better. Casting and performances were excellent, especially Channing Tatum who was the main source of laughs. The story is not revolutionary, but did have some refreshing changes to the genre. It's a fun and entertaining one time watch, especially if you're a fan of any of the lead cast.

26 April 2022,CGI on steroids. Low budget lockdown movie. Diabolical.,"I actually can not believe the good reviews for this. I had to leave 30 minutes before the end as couldn't stand anymore.

It's CGI on steroids. In this day and age it amazes me that technology hasn't moved on so that you don't know it's a green screen. On many of the scenes it was so obviously green screen, it was embarrassing.

There is virtually zero story. Clearly made in Lockdown on a low budget.

Sandra Bolock appeared bored and what was it with the one outfit for the entire film? Channing Tatoe was his usual self just acting by numbers and showing off his body.

I didn't even crack a smile let alone laugh and neither did anyone else in the theatre which was almost full.

The writers should never be let loose on a script again.

I despair of films lately, they just churn out any old rubbish and treat us like idiots.

Shame on them all.",1

23 March 2022,Not your typical RomCom!,"Liked: This wasn't the typical romcom that is sappy and silly. Performances by everyone that had screen time. Pacing was great too.

Not so much: Editing. There seems like a small chunk of the movie was missing and they tried to cover it with a quick transition.

Loved: Brad's Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe. Both stole the show in each scene they were in.

I really enjoyed this flick. Way more than I thought I was going to. I'm glad I saw this because this flick wasn't the typical sappy and silly romcoms tend to be associated with. It was action packed, had a lot of humor in it with some solid performances. Brad's Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe were awesome in this. Pitt nailed all his comedic timing and Radcliffe has great range and played the villain role really well. So much that one day he should play a Bond villain. Looked like he was having a lot of fun with this. No post credit but there is a great mid credit scene that adds to the story. Solid movie!",8
4 September 2022,A fun time,"This movie was the kind of movie they don't make a lot anymore. The uninhibited, silly action comedy with a sprinkle of predictable romance. It was colorful, adventurous, and all around an entertaining 2 hours spent.

I think Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, and Daniel Radcliffe all played their parts well in this fun and goofy popcorn movie. Not ever movie needs to be Oscar worthy. There is value in films that are just plain fun. (Bonus points for the laughs Brad Pitt's character brought to the screen, too.)

Was this the must see movie of the year? No. Did it make me feel like it was 2011 again, watching a cheesy but laugh-out-loud movie? Yes, absolutely.

15 April 2022,Great comedy adventure,"The Lost City is a nice reminder of the kind of film's they don't really make anymore, a great comedy adventure that moves along nicely, is frequently very funny and propelled along by the A-List cast who are all having a blast.

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum both give incredible lead performances with fantastic chemistry, equally really funny but also showing real growth by the end. Daniel Radcliffe is really good as an extremely enjoyably evil antagonist, managing to leave a lasting impression with limited screen time.

Adam and Aaron Nee's direction is excellent, the action scenes are surprisingly strong and the film overall looks really nice, helped by the practicality of it all (mostly). The soundtrack and the music by Pinar Toprak are both a lot of fun and appropriately playful.

14 October 2022,Not even remotely amusing,"Where to begin, not funny, not entertaining, no story, who cares if theres no story - this only vehicle for fast wisecracks and cheap attempts at wit. The writers must have dragged evey barrel bottom for any remote attempt at humour and warp that to fit Ms Bullocks fast wise cracking downtown chick delivery.

I would like the writer producer and everyone involved in this rubbish be made to sit through 30 or so viewings of it, because I am sure they never saw the finished product and if they did they should give up their jobs and take up a more rewarding career in animal organic fertiliser in which capacity I am sure they will feel in familiar surroundings.

9 April 2022,The lost 1hr 52min of my life,"OK. First they openly admit the plot of this movie is very similar (read obvious, shameless, blatant rip-off) to Romancing The Stone. Only difference is they added a little more (cough) humor. And a goat. Oh, and some leeches. Sandra Bullock plays Sandra Bullock Doing Another Rom-com. Channing Tatum plays a great big bag of muscles that can talk. Brad Pitt thankfully shows up (for a very short time) and steals the show with the only real laughs. Well, him and the goat. And Daniel Radcliffe is in it too. If anybody cares. I don't. Most of the jokes in the film fall flat and just lay there. Like a dead fish. The whole thing feels kinda lazy. Like they just stole a bunch of stuff from other movies, threw 'em together and hoped for the best. I guess there are worse ways to spend 2 hours. Like having a B-list actress pull leeches off my behind. (Very awkward, unfunny scene. One of many.) Anyway, go and see it if you want. Just set the bar pretty low. 3 stars.

14 November 2022,For fans of the adventure genre.,"If you like the adventure genre with a bit of humorous scenes, in the style of Indiana Jones, Jewel of the Nile, or Romancing the Stone, you will definitely enjoy this one as well. The Lost City is very easy to watch, a perfect popcorn movie, with some mild but good action scenes and funny situations. The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked well. Their bickering made the movie funny. Daniel Radcliffe wasn't bad either but it wasn't his best performance. As for Brad Pitt he's always fun to watch, even in a smaller role like he had in this movie. The rest of the cast was also entertaining to watch. Of course you have some cheesy moments, like most of the time in this genre, but it's almost to be expected in this case.

29 June 2022,goofy,"Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) has written a series of romance adventures based on the real world of archaeology. Her manager Beth Hatten (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) is trying every wacky gimmick to save the declining series. Loretta has to do a book tour with idiot book cover model Alan (Channing Tatum). She gets kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) who is obsessed with finding an archaeological bejeweled artifact. Alan recruits former military mercenary Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to rescue Loretta from her volcano island captivity.

This is a rather goofy screwball comedy. I wasn't sold on this movie at first. Tatum's idiot character is either not goofy enough or too goofy. I couldn't tell until the arrival of Brad Pitt. Pitt sets a great tone. His dead-pan performance cements this movie's ridiculousness. It's a matter of degrees. Nevertheless, Tatum has good chemistry with Bullock. There is some fun between these two stars. The leeches are memorable. He should have kept the Fabio hair. That would have upped his ridiculousness. I like the general tone and many of these actors. It could be better but it still has plenty of goofy fun.",6
9 June 2022,A Totally LOST Story With Not An Ounce Of Comedy!,"The only good thing that can be said about this film is that, the scenery is gorgeous - especially the big cave - and, that is why I have given it a 1 star.

The film is so bad (except for the Brad Pitt scenes) and that is really the best thing that a reviewer can tell you.

Sandra Bullock is very capable of doing comedy films but she had nothing at all to work with from this script. I had to force myself to watch to the end as I could tell from the first few opening frames, that it was going to be a bad film. American humour/comedy is rarely funny at the best of times but, I am pretty sure that even America will find this to be an exceptionally embarrassing export!

I was surprised in feeling tense during parts of the last act and really liked the chemistry of Bullock and Tatum. Fantastic cameo by Pitt! I was not expecting, but this was really fun.

12 May 2022,there is a scene in the movie,"... it goes by quickly so it's easy to miss, where Bullock steps out of character for a moment, takes the entire movie, cast, and crew, straps them to her back, and then carries them all to the finale. In other words, for Bullock fans only. The rest of the movie is a jumble of bad writing and bad directing.

5 April 2022,Fun popcorn movie that doesn't take itself seriously,"IN A NUTSHELL: Because of Covid, we haven't seen a lot of movies go straight to theaters. If you haven't been to one yet, consider this one because it's a fun popcorn movie that is good to see on the big screen. It's about a reclusive romance novelist on a book tour with her handsome cover model who gets swept up in a kidnapping attempt that lands them both in a cutthroat jungle adventure.

THINGS I LIKED: Sandra Bullock has been a darling of cinema for many years...and she still is. She has fantastic comedic timing and physical humor that makes her beautiful character endearing and hilarious. She looks amazing too. We can also thank Sandra Bullock for inviting Brad Pitt to join the cast for this fun flick.

Channing Tatum is a force to be reckoned with and offers the silliness that reminds us to not take this movie so seriously while spending most of the time without his shirt on. I thought he and Sandra Bullock worked well together and had some believable chemistry.

It's always good to see Daniel Radcliffe in movies.

Oscar Nunez was hilarious every minute he was on screen.

I loved the snarky humor.

There are some entertaining stunts and action sequences.

Keep watching the rolling credits at the end for a funny clip featuring Brad Pitt!

The movie was filmed in the Dominican Republic.

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Some of the humor doesn't land.

The villain's motivations aren't compelling and often waiver.

There was a missed element about some beads that I thought for sure we'd see later.

If you have seen the movie Romancing the Stone, to which this film has been compared, you'll probably agree that movie's ending was WAY better.

It's pretty predictable.

TIPS FOR PARENTS: Violence Some bloody images Suggestive material Partial nudity (You see Channing Tatum's naked backside) Some profanity and crude language

24 September 2022,Modern Upgrade of Romance in the Stone: Must watch,"This may be a modern upgrade of Romance in the Stone and so what. If so, it's perfect. The movie is hilarious and engaging. I've watched it multiple times and if I don't know what to watch then I'll put this on again. It doesn't get old.

The adventure and comedy done well in this movie. I love Sandra Bullock movies but was nervous seeing Channing Tatum was co-starring in this but I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role. He's funny, goofy, cool and everything you would want with his character.

If you haven't watched this movie yet, rent it soon it's worth it. There are so many new movies out it's tough to tell what holds up to the hype and this one does.

26 May 2022,Something a little more redeeming from Hollywood...,"I liked this movie... a bit silly, with some hilarious scenes and great photography, the story line kept me engaged. This was a great pair to put together with Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum for this movie who interacted greatly in their roles. I found it amusing that Brad Pitt being such a big star had such a passing few moments in this wonderful movie... what part he did have, he did very well and made the movie quite exciting.

I was especially happy that this is a movie the entire family could see even with the (almost) revealing nude scene and the lack of curse words which lately has been most predominate in recent movies (a sign that Hollywood is far more perverted than i thought).

Go see this movie, it's fun, exciting, and really funny at times... its worth the ticket price.

13 May 2022,The Lost City,"A rehash of Romancing the Stone.

Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is the reclusive widowed novelist on a book tour to promote her book 'The Lost City of D.'

Alan Caprisan (Channing Tatum) is the model who plays the fictional Dash McMahon, the heroic adventurer of her novels.

When Loretta is kidnapped by eccentric Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) because she used ancient hieroglyphics in her book that could lead to a real lost city.

Alan has to turn into a real life hero to rescue Loretta. However everyone else thinks that this is a tacky publicity stunt from her publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph.)

This is a shallow, daft screwball comedy. It is entertaining enough as everyone knows this is a tongue in cheek homage to the Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner movie. Radcliffe has the most fun as the villain.

Brad Pitt shows up as a real life hero who initially goes to rescue Loretta.",6
13 July 2022,Skip this one,"Only reason I don't rate it 1 (because there's no 0 as an option) is because of Brad Pitt's cameo.

He is the only good thing in this movie.

Although Radcliffe is a good actor, he's a terrible villain and a complete miscast.

Tatum and Sandra??? What went wrong here?

Changing I'm sure was forced to play a complete idiot which is not only absurd but tiresome. Enough with feminist crap.

And Sandra...if this was your last film why on earth did you freeze your face. It is annoying to watch anyone ""act"" with a frozen face from the abuse of Botox and fillers. Compensating lack of expressions with overacting

Run a way from this movie.",3
26 April 2022,The trailer was better.,"""The Lost City"" is a fun movie, with a silly and simple humor that achieves its purpose, plus the script mixes with the romance genre giving a nice result for a romantic comedy in the jungle. The characters fit into the plot and are likeable. The cinematography is well done and together with the filming locations they achieve a great result. The movie gets the job done, but the comedic scenes get repetitive and my final opinion is that the trailer looked much better than the feature film.

23 March 2022,"An Attention-Grabbing Comedy, Filled With Action And Adventure","The Lost City is an attention-grabbing comedic film, filled with action and adventure while still having an important message.

The movie follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) who's best known for writing her popular book series about adventures in ancient times. However, with an overbearing book cover model Allan (Channing Tatum), and pressure from her tour manager, Loretta has been struggling to write her final book. Luckily, she is swept off her feet and thrown into the reality of her own novels. Loretta must learn to put her pride aside and work with the people that care for her to escape the island that they're stuck on.

The sound and visuals in The Lost City really stand out to me-I am amazed at how clear the audio is. All of the fighting scenes feel so real, without being overbearing. Plus the picture quality is top-notch. Everything feels very realistic, and it's almost as if we are really there. I am very impressed with the acting, too. Each actor grabbed my attention the entire time. For example, Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum's chemistry is so strong, and they make their characters very believable. Lastly, the storyline is so interesting. There's a fun twist to it, and the story is overall unexpected. There are so many different elements, plus it is also a comedic experience. I personally love a good laugh, because it lightens the mood, and this movie definitely does that.

The message of The Lost City is that being greedy and evil will never get you anywhere. In the end love will always win. This film does have some violent scenes including fighting and the use of guns.

I give The Lost City 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, plus adults. By Mikella G., KIDS FIRST!",9
26 March 2022,Hilarious!,"I have to be honest I didn't think Bullock and Tatum would mesh well together. But the chemistry they had in this movie was unforgettable. I laughed for the first hour of this movie. It was a fun and exciting movie Overall this felt like another Uncharted movie, but I enjoyed that movie so it worked. I recommend it you want to just laugh your ass off! I must say Brad Pitt in this movie was so SEXY! So was Tatum, Radcliffe, and Bullock, but I wished to have seen more of Pitt. I will definitely recommend this movie to others. I myself will be watching this one again when I need to disconnect and literally l.m.f.a.o!

10 May 2022,Embarrassing,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

5 March 2023,Don't go looking for this on a map,"Sandra Bullock's rom-com track record is pretty strong, but not every film in her library is a standout. 2022's 'The Lost City' is exhibit A, as Bullock teams up with Channing Tatum in a healthy-budgeted tropical rescue mission (?) that could have used more original laughs than premeditated gags.

'City' is scenic for a movie of its kind - there's no denying that. But the lush setting only takes it so far. While Bullock's portrayal of glass half-empty novelist Loretta Sage is in line with where she usually excels, and Tatum's portrayal of dumb as rocks cover model Alan is not a stretch given his filmography, the two together do not light up the screen. Sure, some of the moments here are worthy of a few chuckles, but they are easily outnumbered by the many unfunny one-liners or pop culture references that just don't land.

When considering the supporting cast, aside from a semi-hilarious Brad Pitt, there's not much to write home about. Daniel Radcliffe comes across as a mouse trying to be a lion as the villain and Da'Vine Joy Randolph seems like a fish out of water in her role as Loretta's publicist. Not their fault - it's just that their characters were written poorly.

Add an uneven plot that is unnecessarily complicated to all of the above and you get 'The Lost City' - just don't go looking for it on a map.",4

Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

11 May 2022,Brad Pitt was hilarious,"The writing let this film down. It was a little funny but burnt out too quickly. There was no chemistry between the two characters which made whatever romantic connection they were supposed to have towards the end not believable. Overall it was alright, gave us some thing to watch.

14 May 2022,Poor man's Romancing the Stone,"What in the world is Sandra Bullock thinking??? Aside of being a total ripoff of the above mentioned movie this was just as stupid as it looked. Sandra is an ok actress but as a worldwide bestselling author why would she ever appear in a jumpsuit in any capacity??? And Channing Tatum while handsome is about as charismatic as a bag of potatoes. Cameos never really help the plot along and this insipid movie needed all the help it could get. Douglas and Turner had the movie down cold about 30 years ago so I shut this one off and watched the original instead.

13 May 2022,Loved the Brad Pitt Cameo,"A simple silly movie, which I actually quite enjoyed.

Especially loved the Brad Pitt cameo. I noticed that he likes to do cameos of this sort.

Unfortunately it also felt that beloved Sandra Bullock, in my opinion can't pull off those roles anymore, despite being in excellent physical shape and the role of Channing Tatum felt like a missed opportunity.

Daniel Radcliff is absolutely miscast. This role doesn't fit him one bit.

I gave it 6 stars but it's more like 6.5. It's a decent flick to watch and enjoy at least once.

13 May 2022,Offensive in how unfunny it is,"To be honest I and a friend only made it through about 16 minutes of this. Like some really poor imitation of the charming ""Romancing the Stone"" .Didn't laugh once in those 16 minutes. Hollywood is over with, and movies like this are proof. Sandra, Channing , Brad, have all seen better days. This is so bad, it's offensive. If you have to turn it off, it's an automatic one star.

17 July 2022,Awful,"This is what happens when all the money goes to the movie stars. Bullock, Tatum, Radcliffe and Pitt probably took 90% of the budget and that's why the script seems like something a bunch of 12 year olds came up with in 2 days. Hollywood in a nut shell nowadays though. Who cares about the writing? It's just an afterthought.

25 March 2022,The Action and Adventure Seem Lost In This Film For Me,"LIKES:

The Pace Is Good: Say what you want about the film, but I can't lie that the pace is much better than I anticipated this movie having. The Lost City has a lot of elements combined, but somehow balances a lot of the perspectives into a decently timed film that does not break the bank. A slower opening is curtailed by short time spending in it, but yet not enough to offset the important character building they are working on obtaining. It's quite a delight to be honest, and keeping that pace going works to keep some of the staler comedy tactics from being too hard to follow.

The Character Involvement: A movie loaded with casts like this are certainly something that gives me chills, primarily in how many times their characters are wasted in this movie. However, the movie surprises me again in how well it keeps using the characters that they introduce. While Tatum and Bullock do indeed have most of the screen time, Brad Pitt, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Oscar Nuñez do get their fair share of inclusion in this movie to stay relevant to the plot and relationships of the character. Juggling all these characters without intruding too much is not an easy challenge, yet the comedy does well to really keep these pieces progressing down the same path.

The Acting: Surprisingly better than I anticipated, the movie brought out A game in comedy acting for much of the film despite the direction the film took. Radcliffe sort of reprises his role of the bratty villain again (see Now You See Me 2) , and he seems to be having fun with the role that he is trying to make come alive. He succeeds on many levels, and his level of hyperbolic comedy fits well into the movie's tone that fans will really enjoy the laughable character before them. Tatum is well Tatum on many levels of the movie, bringing that airheaded, naïve and street boy like demeanor that you either love or hate. His banter comedy and one-line delivery are on point in this film, and if you like the irony of a physically fit guy being very idiotic and incompetent on levels, then you are right at home in this film. To be fair though, he does also bring the vulnerable side out very well, and I give him props for finally bringing a more realistic and relatable character than what I have gotten from most of his other films. As for Bullock, the woman is on fire as she often is for me in her films. Combining the sarcasm of Miss Congeniality, the searching for life's moments from the Blind Side, and the attitude from Speed is how I can describe her character. Bullock manages to bring these sides together into a very good character, that helps convey the message of the movie, but never sacrifice the other elements that the film is attempting to achieve. A fantastic centerpiece to the character web, she's got a lot of fascinating levels that are realistic, and require the help of others to get through the impasses she faces in this film.

The Message: A comedy that is fun is a victory for many, and one that manages to add story to it gets even bigger props from me. However, when you can also put in some good moral assessing moments and make me feel for the character, that's a bonus in my book. The Lost City has once again managed to put a few lessons into the movie, and while some are indeed cheesy and very much thrown into your face, others are timed well to sort of break through the mirror. When I hit these moments, I really felt something for the characters, which again is smart writing when they learn how to time things right and not overdo them.

The Music: If you liked the theme song for the advertisements in this movie, then get ready to be blown away by soundtrack of this film. The Lost City is loaded with great songs that are utilized at the right times to set the mood, help bring out extra laughs and ambience of walking, while also just being fun to listen too. An A+ I grant to the selection of this soundtrack and even more for the sound utilization in the actual film.

The Comedy While the Lost City is far from being the cleverest, or even diverse style, it still does achieve the level of fun I look for in this type of movie. Sexual innuendos are loaded into this movie, both in your face and snuck in that sometimes had me belting out in the theater, and more so the other audience members, as the two leads battle for supremacy. However, there are plenty of other things to get you into the moment with this film including, but not limited to: slapstick humor involving bodily harm, one-liners that involve our characters being idiotic or enraged, rambling comedy where characters try to sound enlightened but are again just out there, and plenty of banter that is perhaps the cleverest device used. Regardless, you will find a log of laughs in this film if you give it a try, and I was very happy with what I got in this film if I'm being honest.

DISLIKES:

The Plot's Lack Of Adventure: I can take off points for the high-level of predictability that is loaded into this movie, but what I think if fairer is that the adventure element is surprisingly limited to mostly what you see in the trailers. The Lost City's battling of dangerous criminals and the threats of the jungle has been laid out for you in those trailers, and while enjoyable there was so much more that could have been done. More animals they had to outwit, or more environmental hazards to use against the pursuing threats could have further amped up this movie's wow factor for me than what they did. This would be especially true in trying to solve the puzzle that got them into this mess, and finding more clues in the world to help beef up the mystery element.

Radcliffe's Character: While the former Harry Potter legend does the role well, it does not mean I enjoyed the villain any better. Fairfax is lame, a villain that is just a less polished version of the brat from Now You See Me 2, and I would have liked again either better comedy with him, or some element that made him a bigger threat than what we got. I get the point of the comedy is to integrate them into the mix, I really do, but the fact we could not integrate a better character into the mix that did not have to be an incompetent boob would have helped the adventure element of this plot they were striving to reach.

Cheesy In Your Face Moments: It's hard to avoid these moments in the style this comedy is presented in, but there are times where the cheese factor can be a little bit too much for a viewer like me. After seeing a few moments that feel raw, emotionally gut punching, and relatable to the point it hurts, to see the Hollywood rub it in your face moments are a little meh in my taste. Sure, they do bring the romantic comedy vibe with them, but they could have done a little better with that mess if they timed it better, or used it in a comedic moment rather. It's by far from the worst gospel moments I've seen, but it does still exist at times.

The Random Interruption of Pace: The movie does well keeping that fun and fast pace moment to really keep us moving towards the goal of survival, but then hits this random moment that sort of trips the entire element. About three-quarters through the movie, we randomly drop into this one moment that completely drops the mood into an off-kilter moment belonging in a Sparks' novel movie, that while heartwarming and emotional, feels out of place amidst the rest of the movie. It's not that there were not enjoyable moments to it, but it's the scene that feels shoved in the most compared to the other elements I saw earlier in the film.

Needed More Time: Ironically, this movie could have used a little more time to make the adventure feel the most worthwhile. That descent in the jungle, the pursuit of the bad guys, and the integration of the other characters all needed some more time and scenes to really hit the full bang this film wanted. While this may of course burn more minutes from your plans, the Lost City could have used a little more coordination to really give us the comedic adventure the trailers wanted, and help not feel like those romance moments were shoehorned in for the sake of wrapping up the film.

The VERDICT: The Lost City turned out to be a surprise for me, because of how much fun I had in this fast-paced adventure/comedy that was very open to most audiences. A story that is not ridiculously stupid, it balances both serious and funny moments in a decent see-saw of moments that help you really grab on to the characters and engage in their life. Yet, for those looking for simplistic fun, the movie has that for you too, and the writing alongside sequences is sure to just be enjoyable for groups to see. Alongside beautiful shots, variety of comedic moments, and a soundtrack that kicks butt, you really do have a movie that checks the boxes for what going to the movies used to be about investing in the time. As for the dislikes, the movie really just needed more time and planning for the adventure element, to really deliver the potential of these two unlikely explorers having a fun decipher of the riddle. More time, alongside a more serious villain could have done wonders for this movie, perhaps helping dilute the shoehorned moments, allow for more comedy that was not innuendo based, and not interrupting the momentum of the movie that happens near the end. Still, the movie is definitely fun, and brings a balanced picture that does not break the dam of cursing or R rated moments many films like to get away with. As such, my recommendation is to catch this movie in theaters if you can, preferably with a group, as I give The Lost City a score of:

Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5.",7
11 May 2022,So bad...,"Unwatchable in most parts and so poor in the whole. I really felt sorry for the main actors. Brad Pitt's cameo was great but only showed how bad the rest was. Don't waste your money and time. Watch Indiana or Romancing the stone again instead.

11 May 2022,"I tried to like it, but I couldn't.","Except for a few moments of genuine joy and serviceable entertainment; there's nothing in here that would be able to energize or reinvigorate a viewer's interest! It is more so saddening when you sit down and think about the fact that this film failed to deliver despite having the likes of Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum on its list.

I'm in no way denying their capabilities or the reputation they hold as performers, as they had ascertained their merit time and again in the past but here, in this case, they just don't seem to find their footings. I can't recall the last time I had seen Ms. Bullock this much lost and disinterested in a role! The same goes for Tatum, he might not be a known 'thespian' amongst the audience yet I must say he's usually pretty good with comic stuff. Not in this, here he's just a shadow of his former self.

In all seriousness, I never expected this to be anything greater than a popcorn flick, no, that would have been a silly belief. However, what I did expect though was to amuse myself with its idiosyncrasy, and to have a bit of fun in the process. Sadly, that wasn't meant to be and now I'm greatly discontented.

3 September 2022,Romancing the Tomb,"This was a lot of fun! I love that it's a parody of so many other flicks I really liked. I think the reviewers who complained about the plot being a ""copycat"" just completely missed the point. The early scene with the snakes actually set the stage for what to expect so blatantly that you'd have to be oblivious to miss it.

I love Sandra Bullock, I've come to love Da'vine Joy Randolph (a la Only Murders in the Building), and Daniel Radcliffe was fantastic as the villain. Brad Pitt's role was fun, as I've always thought he was great in comedic parts like this. I don't recall seeing Channing Tatum in anything before (I know I'm behind on this one), but he was perfect: So funny and sweet.

I gave it a 10, because I had so much fun watching it that I know I'll see it again.

28 August 2022,Pleasantly surprised,"I thought Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock did well in this. I got my laughs from it. IMO, a comedy can be silly if it wants to as long as it delivers the goods. I don't look for some great plot in a comedy. As long as it isn't boring. When Alan makes his entry on the stage with Loretta and hams it up I was chuckling thru it. I liked the action moments with Brad Pitt which was kinda short, but it worked. I know these types of movies are difficult to make successful so I don't want to be too critical of it. But I always have like Sandra Bullock's acting. In any event, as long as I'm entertained, great.

17 April 2022,"You don't expect much, but it gave even less","This film could have been done over 1.5 hours... but it would still be 1.5 hours too long. I'm baffled where the reviews of 'hilarious' and 'funny movie of the year' came from. There were maybe 2 funny moments, one of which was played on too much until it became unfunny and annoying. The story is very weak and even an appearance from Brad Pitt couldn't save it. It is, unfortunately, probably the worst film I have gone to the cinema to see.

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort.

1 April 2022,A nice and fun movie - exactly what I wanted!,"The Lost City is a very funny and entertaining film, which in reality is all I expected and wanted from it.

It has a story that is very predictable and derivative, but that doesn't mean its not a good time. The script is pretty well put together, with plenty of solid jokes and a premise that leads to lots of entertaining hijinks.

Sandra Bullock is a fantastic comedy actress and she shines in this role. Her timing and delivery are on point, leading to some terrific laugh out loud moments. Channing Tatum is in fine form, as he really excels in these sorts of roles where he's given license to just have a good time. The interplay between the two of them was loads of fun to watch. Daniel Radcliffe was a bit of a weak antagonist, with a pretty weak performance to match I thought, so that side of things was a tad disappointing.

Although it is unlikely to blow you away, The Lost City is sure to entertain. A charismatic leading pair, serviceable plot, and plenty of jokes that land add up to a very fun watch indeed.",8
12 November 2022,Really Fun,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue.

16 May 2022,They should've swapped Brad Pitt and Channing Tatum,"In my view Brad stole the show in his short appearance, and I think the chemistry between Sandra and him was really good and would've been amazing if he had Channing Tatum's role. Well, it wouldn't take much to be better than the ""chemistry"" between Sandra and Channing, which was zero for me! The difference between Pitt and Tatum was the textbook definition of sheer screen presence.

Sandra looked remarkably good for someone in her fifties. Usually in these sorts of capers the lead actress sheds her clothes over the course of the movie (Brie Larson in Kong Skull Island springs to mind) but in this case she went the opposite, from cleavage revealing jumpsuit to very modest dress. How odd.

11 May 2022,Mixed Bag,"The Lost City is an okay adventure movie with a strong taste for comedy. Like others reviewers state, the story reminds a little of Romancing the Stone and The Jewel of the Nile (1984 and 1985) starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in the main roles. In my opinion those oldies are stronger regarding the chemistry between the main characters. I also like those old school action and stunt performances without CGI more - no matter what the producers want to make us believe, too many times (not in The Lost City alone) the digital effects just looks artificial and it's rather boring because we know that everything is faked in front of a green screen. All in all no failure and watchable, especially if you like the stars of the movie: Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt, Channing Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe (who all make a solid performance). But in the end The Lost City is nothing really remarkable, and for sure rather disappointing if one considers the starpower, but well, the script was not up to the task to make them shine more. I also would apply some serious cutting - there are some lengthy parts that are just taking away the momentum of the plot without adding something substantially to the story.",4
7 October 2022,A romp in the jungle in a throwback comedy,"This popped up on my Prime rotation and I just 'let it go' because I adore Sandra Bullock. I was not disappointed!

One reviewer called it a throwback comedy and I stole that from them. It's a perfect description. There are a lot of surprises in it - or there were for me, but I'm sort of naive. I don't look up most movies or shows before I watch them. I like an element of surprise because I don't want to ruin them by expecting too much from them.

This was just plain fun on a lot of levels. The good guys were good and the bad guys were deliciously bad! Daniel Radcliff never disappoints. He never ceases to amaze me in his versatility. Once again, he knocks this character out of the park - and holds his own with Bullock.

SO! If you need a mindless movie to clear your brain - this is it! Sit back and let them do all the work! You sit back and enjoy.",8
2 April 2022,Dumb & Dumber,"Daniel Radcliffe as the evil villain is fun to watch, he really hams it up in a good way.

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum get what has to be the worst dialogue in the history of film. I have to think Bullock must have gotten one of her kids to write the script. Bullock brags that she got Brad Pitt to do a cameo in this movie, and that is the best part of this movie. Bullock, Tatum & Pitt, make for a great threesome for a few minutes, then Pitt is out of the movie, and it goes back to royally sucking. The best part of this movie is when Brad Pitt's brains spray all over Channing Tatum. Too bad Brad Pitt was killed off. For the five minutes that he was in the movie, it was 100 times better.

11 May 2022,Kind of lame,"Don't let the excellent cast fool you.

It's not as funny, clever, or smart as it thinks it is. The 'jokes' constantly fall flat...and there is absolutely zero chemistry between Tatum and Bullock.

Might of been better if the leads were The Rock and Jennifer Aniston, as Bullock and Tatum are seriously miscast AND mismatched!

It just became 'something on in the background' after the 45-minute mark, as it wasn't very engaging. The film more or less dies after 30 minutes...and is only just kept alive by the 'sexual tension' between the 2 leads.

You're better off watching 'Jewel of The Nile', or 'Romancing the Stone'...as this is obviously a poor man's version of them.

Such a shame that Sandy Bullock has gone back to doing this kind of garbage, because she proved that she's capable of much, much better, in 'The Unforgivable'. (She still LOOKS great though).",2
9 December 2022,Proper 2000s vibe from this movie,"I think you get a real 90s/2000s vibe from this movie. Reminds me of The Mummy or Sahara and the like. It would be right at home getting released early 2000s. I like that it's a parody of those serious adventure movies. You don't get movies made like this these days. Switch off and enjoy the pretty island like you're on holidays. I think the reviews are way too harsh on this movie. It ticks alot of boxes, does alot of things right and doesn't take itself too serious. I don't know what these people were expecting with the bad reviews, it's a adventure/comedy movie with some romance chucked. Just enjoy it for what it is.

23 May 2022,"Some movies simply try too hard to be funny. The best comedies are those born out of tragedy. This one is just superficial, only ACTING to be funny...","Not any good? There are some great actors starring in this movie, but they cant save this movie, because it desperately tries too hard to be funny, like in, THIS is a joke (you may laugh now), and HERE is another joke ( you may laugh again). It's comedy by the numbers, without any real humor. No magic.

Comedy needs or gets better with serious acting and tragedy in order to be really funny. What we get here though is lots of OVERacting and lots of slapstick like scenes that just didnt make me laugh once. Not once...bummer.

Better watch ""Romancing the stone"" with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner and Danny deVito. THAT is a classic adventurous, FUNNY comedy.

10 May 2022,Too silly for my taste,"An outstanding cast consisting of some of my favorite actors. The script was a bust, the film survived only because of its main cast (and Brad Pitt). Overall it was too silly for my taste. Some jokes were funny and original but most of the time the jokes never hit the mark. The dialogues were a little cringey and cheesy.

A beautiful looking film that used its massive $74 million production budget appropriately. A gorgeously shot cinematography that captured all that vibrant colors and the beauty of the Dominican Republic.

There were some moments that were funny, especially that leech scene shown in the trailer, but most of them felt flat. Tatum and Pitt were the only funny people. Sandra Bullock wasn't that remarkable. Daniel Radcliffe tried to be over-the-top with his villain, but he only ended up annoying. The adventure itself wasn't anything special either.

Overall, there's little fun. 5-5.5/10.

14 September 2022,its fine,"Another rom-com for Sandra Bullock after all these years!? Well yes, The Lost City talks about a Reclusive author Loretta Sage (played by Sandra Bullock) who writes about exotic places in her popular adventure novels that feature a handsome cover model named Alan (played by Channing Tatum). While on tour promoting her new book with Alan, Loretta gets kidnapped by an eccentric billionaire (played by Daniel Radcliffe) who hopes she can lead him to an ancient city's lost treasure from her latest story. Determined to prove he can be a hero in real life and not just on the pages of her books, Alan sets off to rescue her.

One of the most important aspects of any romance movie, is chemistry between the 2 lead actors. In The Lost City, this chemistry wasn't present. Sandra bullock returns to play one of her favourite characters that she always does a good job portraying and she did this time too, although the character was a bit shallow this time. Channing did a wonderful job, he was really funny and portrayed his character in the best way possible. Although we didn't see as much Daniel Radcliffe as I expected, he did a very good job portraying the villian that was a bit out of place in the movie having no big motive but jealousy from his brother. Brad Pitt's character was super amazing, cool, and funny, I would have loved to see him a bit more. Additionally, his cameo would have had a greater impact leaving a huge shock on the audience if it wasn't revealed in the trailer (although it is understandable that they did that for promotional reasons). Beth Hatten was a very funny character and added to the movie. However, I hated Allison and thought that her character was very useless.

Overall, the movie was very fun and funny all throughout however, lacking an original story and having a weak script. So if your looking for a fun adventure rom-com, with no big expectations, this might be a good fit for you.

Score:7/10.",7

30 March 2022,I chuckled twice and both times involved a goat.,"And honestly how do you not at least chuckle at a goat?

Like most people these days I'm looking for something light and fun to help escape for a little while from All Of That. But this just isn't that movie, at least not for me.

It's not just predictable, it's tired and worn out. It's bits and pieces of other better movies slapped together to make a big ol' sequin studded Frankenmovie. And i say this as a fan of Sandra Bullock, from her While You Were Sleeping Days all the way up to The Heat.

Like I said, the goat was kinda funny. Maybe he'll get a sequel. His name is Randy. Two stars. Two stars for Randy.

26 March 2022,This is why Hollywood is losing awards they made up....,"How on Earth does Hollywood not see how obviously unoriginal they are, considering we've had Jungle Cruise, Uncharted and Red Notice release in just the past while how did this seem like a good time for this movie?

What does it add to the conversation we've already thoroughly exhausted with the other 3 mentioned big budget movies?

Not only does this movie offer a completely downgraded experience (with Red Notice being the best by far and Uncharted second to that) ;but they thought mixing in Bullock's usual romance themes would benefit this movie somehow. Are these the same types chewing out super hero movies for being generic, so laughable!

1 star for the budget and 1 star is my actual rating for the movie itself.

14 May 2022,Terrible and silly,"My advice is to watch the original movie instead of this garbage, that's only a waste of time and money.

Go find the original ""Romancing the stone"" which is a real adventure movie, filmed on location, that takes its audience seriously and at the same time being extremely entertaining, quick, and well made.

""The lost city"" tries to be the original - and misses out on all counts.

27 May 2023,Lots of laughs (in the first half),"The first half of this movie's very funny, with Channing Tatum playing a doofus very well. The back-and-forth between him and Brad Pitt is the best part. It was great to see Oscar Nunez (from The Office) in a small role. Sandra Bullock is great at physical comedy, and is put to good use here. I thought this lagged a bit in the second half, when there weren't as many laughs and it slowed down to get more serious. It does get a little heavy on the symbolism with the reveal of where the tomb is. If you're looking for a good date movie to watch on a Friday night, you could do a lot worse than this.

16 April 2022,Just About Alright!,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

13 April 2023,Actors collecting a paycheck,"Actors collecting a paycheck... You better really, really like the actors in this movie, or you will not enjoy it. They just seem to be going through the motions here, and the plot is secondary to smirking, acting cute, and doing whatever else comes into their heads ad a vehicle to get through the scene. After the first 45 minutes, I found myself scrolling on my phone rather than paying any attention to the movie. It was fun to see Brad Pitt in there, but overall, I wouldn't waste my time watching this. I've seen far, far better from the two main leads. They both take this cutesy persona way too far.

16 May 2022,"Bullock and Tomb Raider, what could possibly go wrong?","Sandra Bullock is normally fabulous in everything, but she strikes out with this. It is a cluster jumble of tired clichés pasted together like a child's scrapbook. To say it is derivative would be a masterful understatement, it plagiarises chunks from multiple movies, to be kind it is a pastiche.

The chemistry between Bullock and Channing Tatum is actually very good and in some scenes they knock it out of the park. Not sure why the pink spandex suit was chosen, it is simply ridiculous, perhaps symbolising the level of comedy writing throughout.

TLDR: Been done before, better, not worth the time or money.

22 December 2022,Funny and unpretentious,"The Lost City was much better than I thought. It was very much in the nature of the Cary Grant romcoms of the sixties. All of the actors had screen presence, even the secondary characters.

The story is very formulaic, but that adds to the fun. Channing Tatum is excellent as a male model who poses for the covers of romantic adventure books, and who ends up out of his depth when it gets real. Full marks to Brad Pitt for sending up himself.

Sandra Bullock is a similar person as in her other films. And that is fine. Daniel Radcliffe washing channelling Alan Rickman as English villain.

OK, so the corn was waist deep, but there was no pretence. It was good, light entertainment.

Contrite, forced humor situations, bad timing , waiting for laugh tracks to drop.

10 May 2022,Some good cameos are not enough to save this overly safe film,"'The Lost City' is a prime example of a film in desperate need of an R rating. So often you can see the joke is there, but the script is having to dance around the subject and play it as safe as it can. It leads to almost nothing in this film being funny - particularly in the case of the two leads who are somehow the weakest part of this movie.

The cameos are what this this film afloat. Brad Pitt and Oscar Nuñez are particularly great in their limited screen time. Daniel Radcliffe as the villain gives it everything he's got too but it's just not a very well written villain. He's not very menacing and doesn't have any memorable attributes.

The film starts to drag near the end as well. The last 20-30 minutes feel like they take an eternity. There are no stakes in this movie. Everything feels extremely safe and like they are aiming it more at children than adults. This one wasn't for me. 5/10.

26 November 2022,Does what a movie is supposed to do.,"And that is to entertain. I was entertained by this movie, and that's good enough for me, especially with a lot of the terrible stuff being churned out these days.

Is it a bit silly? Yes, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's meant to be lighthearted and fun. I see nothing wrong with that. The main actors, including Radcliffe and Pitt, deliver what they were intended to, and did it well.

It's been compared to 'Romancing the Stone' (a great movie in itself) and that also is not a bad thing. You can see the similarities if you've seen that movie, and I think that is fine as it's trying to take what made that movie good and use those themes, without being a 'Romancing the Stone 2'.

If you are just looking for a good movie to relax to and spend time with your partner, this is for you.",8
11 July 2022,If you want to waste some time,"Sadly this movie is ridiculous in so many ways. Sandra Bullock's botox/plastic surgery is so obvious and detracts from the already weak movie. Although she is 57 years old, she has maintained her shape, so I suspect she also wants to prove that she doesn't age by pairing herself with a man (Channing Tatum) who is 15 years younger than she is. Her editor's wig is also silly and so obvious. Perhaps I'm being petty, but this all detracted from an already weak plot and movie, which could have and should have been entertaining. Bad Pitt's role was also totally silly and short. Perhaps that's what was planned for this movie - a total over the top spoof. A spoof that just bombs. Again, sadly.

22 August 2022,"Bullock, Pitt, Radcliffe, and Tatum make this a worthwhile comedy romp.","My wife watched this movie a couple of months ago on the plane from Chicago to Houston, she wasn't very impressed. In fact she thought it was a waste of her time.

So tonight I watched it (alone) at home on Amazon streaming and found it to be a totally entertaining movie. It doesn't take itself very seriously at all, and the final scene with Bullock, Pitt, and Tatum in a yoga class, punctuated that sentiment.

The movie is mostly a parody of such movies as ""Raiders"", in fact the opening scene where there are lots and lots of snakes all over is one parody, they ask ""Where did all these snakes come from? Who feeds them?"" The thoughts I had when watching that scene in ""Raiders"" in the giant tomb with all the snakes. I also found it to have elements of ""Romancing the Stone"" because Bullock plays a romance novelist and Tatum is her cover model. They end up lost in the jungle (filmed in the Dominican Republic).

So in this movie a wealthy treasure hunter (Radcliffe) searches for a mythical treasure on a volcanic island, he needs someone to translate a portion of ancient markings, hoping to provide a clue. When she doesn't go voluntarily she is kidnapped. So most of the movie involves action on the island where they try to escape.

Anyone who goes into viewing this and expecting a serious drama will certainly be disappointed. Viewed for its comedy absurdity, it is nicely entertaining.",
1 June 2023,Had to turn it off!,"I'm a sucker for a cheesy movie and expected this to be a good example. I love Sandra , so will watch most things she is in. I expected something along the lines of Miss Congeniality. I really wasn't expecting much from this just a cheesy chick flick that you can veg in front of and not have to engage the brain and be mildly entertained. What I saw was truly awful. Like, really really bad, not even Brad could save this. For a film that really had a stellar cast with great acting talent, this was truly awful. I had to turn off after half an hour as I asked myself if I cared about any of the characters or what happened to them or cared about what happened next. After I asked myself that question and got a resounding no! I switched off!!!

27 March 2022,A fun popcorn movie,"I wouldn't pay a premium price to see this, but it's funny and fun. Some great laughs, Gotta say, Sandra Bulloch's behind looks pretty fine for a woman in her fifties. Channing Tatum is a good foil for Bulloch's brainy character, although his character's evolution doesn't seem very consistent throughout the movie. Dan Radcliffe makes a convincing villain and Brad Pitt is a very amusing supporting character without stealing the movie. It just goes to show that good actors and a decent plot and writing can make even lightweight fare quite satisfying, for an afternoon matinee, at least. There's a sequel suggested...I'd definitely consider seeing that one.

20 April 2022,Couple laughs at best,"What a disappointment this was. The plot itself is fine, romance writer abducted by evil mogul to help find some lost artefact.

Whilst a few people were laughing in the cinema, most were dead quiet. This felt like it was made 10 years ago, or was your average Netflix movie.

It had its moments, a couple laughs from Channing, Brad Pitt also delivered for the short amount of time he was involved, but Sandra Bullock was just awful. You could tell this was merely a pay check and she really did not care about this movie.

Overall, badly written jokes, full of plot holes, and a disappointing supporting cast and performance from Bullock. Definitely save this one for when it arrives on Netflix in 6 months.

14 May 2022,Fun idea - poorly executed,"A novelist and a model get dragged into an adventure looking for a hidden treasure.

This is a silly adventure film but it lacks any sense of story-telling so it just feels dull and tedious.

The actors say the words needed to progress the plot but there is no real sense of characterisation or chemistry - just people talking.

Everything is bare minimum.

Even the sets are bad.

We enter the jungle so we get shots of a bunch of trees.

Is the jungle dark and mysterious? Is it filled with swarms of insects or dangerous animals? Is it tranquil and beautiful?

No, its just a bunch of trees that Sandra and Channing can run around so that is enough.

There are some great moments (especially with Brad Pitt) and the main characters have great potential - with snippets of insight.

But on the whole it doesn't feel like anyone cares about this.

I love Sandra Bullock but she doesn't bring any of her talent or energy to this. I didn't buy she was an author, an academic or a widow - she is just there goofing around.

About a quarter of the cast can just be cut along with all their scenes and the film would be better for it.

There are a lot of dad-jokes and obligatory embarrassment gags ""oh gosh! I can see your penis"" or ""oh no! My dress is up my bum!"" which is probably funny if you are about ten.

I was really hoping for another Jumanji or Jungle Cruise but instead got a very long made-for-TV movie that is already fading from my memory.",4

On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

4 September 2022,Ouch,"Somewhat humorous, very predictable fluff. Not sure what Sandra Bullock was thinking when she made this. Maybe she just wanted something light rather than the heavy drama she'd been doing. The script just seems to strive too hard for witty one liners and comebacks. It may have been better with someone less accomplished than Bullock, since we expect more from her.

Channing Tatum was amusing and certainly nice to look at in his bare-it-all scenes. Daniel Radcliffe was funny, but at times seemed to be acting in a different movie. Storyline is preposterous and all over the place with many elements that make no sense whatsoever.

2 June 2022,The Lost Movie,"Oh Geeze. This was truly awful. Let's see, I think I may have chuckled twice? I was hoping for a fun romcom but this was movie was just stupid. Of course, the plot was expected to be silly, but couldn't there have been any truly funny scenes? I can't imagine what Sandra Bullock was thinking when she took on this project. Absolutely no chemistry with Channing Tatum (who really needs to stop shaving his head). Daniel Radcliffe made the movie bearable, but just. Lousy lousy writing. I'm so mad I paid the for the rental and even more that I wasted my time.

26 March 2022,Great Movie,"I enjoyed this movie more than I have enjoyed one in a long time. So funny and corny and hilarious. Tatum and Sandra were so good in this film and the comedy of a romance novelist and the cover model being action adventurers was done superbly. The role Brad played was so fantastic and he played it so perfectly. I cannot say enough good things.

26 May 2022,Fun and funny! Sometimes a silly movie is super welcome.,"I'm not a fan of comedy films, I like it when the comedy is inserted but it's not the focus of the production, but by irony of fate, some productions with this focus amuse me a lot, like ""The Nice Guys"", ""Crazy, Stupid, Love "" and ""The Lost City"" itself. It's super fun! I went without expectations, and ended up being very surprised!

The biggest hit of this movie is in the performances! The main couple (Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum) are sensational, each one in their own moment of the character, but with a very well developed chemistry, around small ""dramatic"" lines and a lot of unusual situations, thus generating the comedy. Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt are super good. Emphasizing here that Brad P.'s participation is small, but it's too sensational.

But obviously not just flowers! The film has some problems, I think most of them coming from the script. The progress of the story doesn't seem very natural, it's as if to follow the adventurous story booklet, the text forced some situations so that you can get where you want. Another point is the villain, extremely cartoonish, without many layers, he's just there to get in the way.

In short, it's a fun movie! Anyone who enjoys adventure, comedy and even a hint of romance will definitely enjoy it! Those who don't like it, like me, might be surprised, if you give it the chance and go with an open mind. Fun, uncompromising, no loose ends, well rounded, with a few slips, but that don't compromise the experience as a whole.",7
20 April 2023,"Flat, uninspiring chick flick","This is just a waste of talents. You have Pitt, Bullock, Radcliffe and yet the movie came out pretty dull and unfunny. Channing Tatum is not a good actor and that's why there was absolutely no chemistry between him and the other actors.

The idea of the movie should give them a good opportuntiy to provide exciting adventour movie like Indiana Jones or Romancing the Stone. Well, basically, this is similar to Romancing the Stone but Bullock-Tatum were in no way providing such a duet performance like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.

The movie itself is so flat. Half way of the movie, no real excitement, just dull unfunny dialogues and uninspiring comedy.

1 June 2022,ugh,"The stars are for Daniel Radcliff and the the cameo from Brad Pitt, the only good parts of the film.

Watch as Sandra Bullock flops around like a human water wiggle and expects us to find it funny when she's mean to nice people and continues to drag the dead carcasses of crude jokes out long, loooooooong after we're tired of them.

A deeply unfunny film, which baffles when you realize the entire plot rests on Sandra Bullock being such a horrible, unhelpful *****, that she refuses to assist a (completely legal and sanctioned by the local government!) archeological dig in her tiny, very niche area of interest, with a spot of translating which literally took her all of 5 minutes.

After being told these priceless discoveries were in danger of being lost forever due to an impending eruption if they could not be found and preserved in time!

I think she's going to have to revoke her professor card for that.

There's a feeling of incredulity that this entire cluster**** mess with multiple deaths and a destroyed temple wouldn't have happened if she'd given less than an hour of time to Daniel at the beginning, and I spent most of the film feeling sorry for his character, since all he wanted was to find this treasure and prove he wasn't crazy to his family.",4
13 May 2022,An unwatchable mess,"I like Bullock and Pitt, of course. The Harry Potter kid is good too, but Tatum is annoying. This seems to be a ripoff of Romancing the Stone, but what that film had was romantic chemistry and humor. This has neither. They should have made RTS with Pitt and Bullock.

The writing is hack. The whole thing is a mess. I was bored out of my mind and I had to fast forward through most of it.

28 April 2022,Not so funny comedy,"The tone of this film is not well defined and it is difficult to know if it wants us to take it seriously or not.

There are times where the movie doesn't want us to take it seriously, but there are other parts where it gets very serious and even emotional, so it's hard to know its tone, if it's a ridiculous comedy or an emotional story accompanied by humor, for me it was a little of both, but still the comical didn't make me laugh so much, there are a few jokes that left me laughing for a while but it wasn't for the whole movie, so it felt very short on humor. The story is interesting, and even though it takes several directions, I think it's an easy story to follow, as its characters have decent development and some can be more endearing than others. The romantic situation is predictable despite the circumstances the characters find themselves in, which are different from what we usually see in romantic movies. The performances are decent, but I think Channing Tatum does an outstanding job compared to the other cast, Sandra Bullock has more talent to give a better performance, although this one was not bad. The locations where it was filmed are good, reflecting the difficulty of the journey through the jungle, the editing is not good since there are many scenes that you can tell were cut very suddenly and there are some others where there is action and you can't see it well what's going on.

I think it doesn't work at all as a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, but if it can give us a story that's a little different from what we're used to seeing in romantic comedies, it still needed more work on the script to be memorable and to be a good comedy, especially with how talented the cast is, which is the best part of the movie.",5
22 July 2022,THE COMEDY WAS ON POINT,"No matter what the other reviews say, I LOVED THIS MOVIE, IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST COMEDY MOVIES I'VE EVER WATCHED. I did lose some interest towards the end of the movie, but other than that this film was so funny and enjoyable to watch.

11 May 2022,The book to be judged by its cover,"As soon as I've seen the trailer of this movie I knew what to expect from it - that it would be a dumb brainless adventure flick but Sandra Bullock, Dan Radcliffe and Brad Pitt bought me up so I watched it. And I have to admit that ""don't judge a book by its cover"" rule does not apply here whatsoever as this is just a case of judging it for exactly what it is - a piece of shlock.

The screenplay to ""The lost city' was written by 4 people and none of them was even slightly funny or innovative with it. Even if I were a ten year old I would have probably not died laughing at some of the scenes, - now I only scowled and rolled my eyes all the time. Sandra is a versatile actress and she can act so I don't get why she agreed to do this humorless ""Romancing the stone"" rip-off in the first place; her character, Channing's, Daniel's and every other is not just paper-thin - they're sand, you go 'puff' and the whole character vanishes in the air without a trace of interest.

The script in general is lazy writing through and through and at times I felt like most of the dialogues were improvised on the spot and left in the movie for whatever reasons - I just can't see someone with a tiny bit of talent writing those pathetic dialogues passing around from character to character.

Overall I feel like the movie industry rapidly degenerates because I remember some twenty years ago I thoroughly enjoyed the similarly themed ""The rundown"" with Dwayne Johnson or ""National treasure"" with Nicolas Cage - those were also dumb, over the top adventure flicks but they've had deeper characters that you cared for and a nice story to stick around for but ""The lost city"" has neither of those criteria. In fact it doesn't have anything good to say about, I can only vaguely compliment Channing Tatum's feeble attempts at bringing his character some depth but they were mostly left unnoticed behind the huge cringe of the whole movie so please do judge a book by its cover (if you've read many and know your books) and don't waste your precious time.",3
23 May 2022,Fails as a comedy and romance,"Yeah, it tries to be a Romancing the Stone (1984) clone. But it fails at being properly fascinating like Romancing the Stone was. It feels like a cheap lazy copy in comparison. The budget is great, the acting fine, and much of the action is good. The main issue that drags it down is how terrible Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are as a love interest couple. Not a single scene between them works in any way whatsoever. The main story is fine. A middle-aged author writes romance novels. Her husband is dead and she refuses to leave the house. So of course she ends up on a dangerous adventure. It's cliche and could work, but it doesn't. She's funny 20% of the time in the weird situations the rest of the time she's just acting quirky and it doesn't work as she's a middle-aged woman with a botox face and mediocre comedy skills. Maybe a young woman experiencing similar stuff could sell the role? Channing Tatum is the very stupid model who tries to save her while constantly screwing up. And she doesn't like him as he's stupid. Yeah, that's it. She just doesn't like stupid guys. They don't do anything more with this conflict. Of course they have to be forced together via the plot. It's basically Romancing the Stone with a few rewrites. But Romancing the Stone took a silly idea and made it good by creating a great plot around it DESPITE the concept. Here they fully and lazily rely on forcing silly romance situations and they never feel real or funny as you can see how the writer and director forced the silly scenes to happen. So the romance is utterly dead here and replaced by cringe.

The big positive is the great island setting and the funny Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe actually hits all his comedy marks and makes it funny. The rest are just trying to act silly and the comedy falls flat. So while much of the movie works and the script never becomes bad the overall product is a letdown. It's not really a movie I can recommend. It does the bare minimum of big budget Hollywood production, but as the humor falls flat it's a failed comedy. As the romance falls flat it's a failed romance. And there is not enough action to carry the movie by itself. You'd need to cut out 15 min of romance and another 15 min of silly comedy to make it work. Then you'd have a silly short acceptable movie. As of now it's just way too cringe overall. Many scenes are clearly there to stretch out the movie runtime and totally pointless and boring. They are added in to make it long enough and it's painfully obvious. The movie drags a ton in some scenes which for a comedy is a dead sentence. But it's not completely bad in all aspects. It just feels pointless and has too many boring scenes to be worth it overall.",5
10 April 2022,Good to see Sanj before her hiatus,"Daniel Radcliffe goes off - still trying to shed his wizard's robe.

Bullock and Tatum work but Reynolds probably would've been more suitable only coz Channing seems more quirky, believe it or not, than Bullock.

Brads Pitts is pretty funny in his role. It's the best slow-motion ""walk"" away from an explosion I've ever seen.

The script was playing it very safe but it's got to appeal to everyone from teens to grandmothers so ... Of course I reflected on having watched Romancing The Stone back in the day. Movies were a much bigger deal back then. I don't know if it was because it was a pandemic movie but I predicted the look of the film. It's Bullock and Tatum in from of CGI backgrounds (very well done, mind you) and stand-ins for the wider location shots. Some of the sets seemed 100% authentic, yes, but nothing beats having the actors on real locations. But, like I said, the pandemic caused heaps of problems for folks wanting to travel.

Sandra Bullock has been the biggest mainstream comedy/drama/all-rounder actress of my adult life. Seeing as she's taking a break, supposedly, it was great to be able to see her on the big screen before she goes.",9
6 July 2022,No. Just no,"I tried to like this movie. The opening scene looked promising, however things quickly went south after that. Extremely generic plot, flat humour, Daniel Radcliffe just does not suit the role he got and he is basically always playing the same character. Sandra Bullock - wasted potential in this movie. Why was Brad Pitt featured so shortly? Another waste.

It is embarrassing to watch this movie, knowing how much money was spent on a truly mediocre product. What a waste.

13 May 2022,"Horrible waste of time and money, why did they even bother","OK, so they started weirdly, and went on even more and more cheesy and unpleasant. Managed to wedge in a couple of jokes that may fool the innocent into not running away from the cinema - which only ensures more disappointment later, because this movie is baaad.

Not long ago I'd seen Sandra Bullock explaining how one cannot know if the movie he/she stars in will turn out good or bad. It was an older fragment of a Graham Norton Show, I think. She was talking about that ""All about Steve"" flop she starred in, which I also remember having the displeasure of partially watching. But now this movie?! Is she sleepwalking and starring in movies? Is she being blackmailed into starring in these horrendous ones? Does she have to do a bad movie, as soon as people managed to forget the latest bad one she was in?

No use detailing why this is so rubbish. Why? Just go see it yourselves, so there can be more of us having bad dreams about it. Yuck... the plot, the interpretation, the costumes, the way they used famous songs, cut short to pay less for them or something... the way they used one famous actor, similarly... the nudity, the cheap jokes... how did they tricked those actors to make fools of themselves?

Do they want to prove from time to time that actors are like empty vessels, nothing without good directing, scripts and the rest of the cast team?",2
6 June 2022,Really boring,"After Brad Pitt is in it, stop watching this pale imitation of Romancing The Stone.

Moderately interesting opening, fairly interesting middle bit, boring and predictable ending.

Bulloch plays Bulloch, Tatum plays a cowardly idiot, Pitt plays the hero, Ratcliffe is ok as the antagonist.

12 June 2022,Disturbing Plastic Surgery and Disappointing Ending,"I really wanted to like this movie, and I did enjoy Daniel Radcliffe and the other male leads. The first half of the movie was funny and I enjoyed myself.

But two complaints really impaired my enjoyment. First of all, the movie turned into a mostly serious action movie instead of a satirical take on one, and that wasn't what I was looking for. It also just didn't hold my interest. It also didn't seem to be written as well and the end had a ""what was the point"" vibe.

Second problem; the plastic surgery!! Oh my goodness, Sandra Bullock's face was so unnatural and distracting, and it hindered her acting abilities due to lack of facial mobility. I would have preferred an older normal looking actress than one who looks plastic and unhappy with herself. It saddened me. It was hard to focus on anything else which brought this rating down.

4 April 2022,Terribly Disappointing & Flat,"The film is... well, lost. It's flat, poorly scripted, and only contains a few chuckles. Most of the funny parts were given away in the trailer and the moral is incredibly predictable.

Bullock and Tatum give it their best shot to have some screwball-esque chemistry but it's not believable and the supporting cast is actually funnier. Radcliffe (and even Tatum) tries to be charming, but just comes across as formulaic.

It must be much harder to write a good Rom-Com than I thought because despite (what I hope was) a valiant effort by all who were involved, The Lost City just feels lazy and uninspired. It's as if they knew there were major flaws but hoped we as the viewers would be distracted by the shiny view (that view being Tatum's body, the pretty scenery, and literally Bullock's shiny outfit). We deserve better.

Verdict: Don't Watch.",4

28 December 2022,A Perfect family movie...,"Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a romance novelist. Her late husband was an archeologist and she based some of her writings on his findings. They were on a mission to find the Crown of Fire when he died.

Her latest book describes the Crown of Fire and billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Readcliffe) - determined to find this jewel - kidnaps Loretta so she can decipher a tribal language which might lead to the location of the Crown of Fire. The cover model of 20 of her books, Alan (Channing Tatum), hires a CIA operative, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), to find her, and he goes along on the rescue mission. They follow her to an island, where Abigail took her.

With a volcano on the island threatening to erupt, time is of the essence and the film therefore is a race against time. I enjoyed the adventure element and the location allowed for some beautiful cinematography. Although the film is a bit slapstick at times, it was otherwise quite funny. There was maybe a bit too much humour for my liking, but this is a comedy after all.

Channing Tatum is in great shape with an awesome body. I couldn't quite place his character, though. Although Alan is the film's romantic lead, he came across as gay more often than not. He even remarked ""He loved me"", referring to Jack Trainer. And he packs face masks, ointment, and a nail file on a rescue mission! Not to mention him screaming like a girl on several occasions, and slapping the enemy instead of hitting them with his fists...

I love treasure hunt movies and 'The Lost City' was indeed entertaining. I was expecting more for the film's climax, but it was all good still. This is the perfect family movie.",5
12 June 2022,Another Bland Rom-Com,"This film looked WAY funnier and more enjoyable in the trailer. Unfortunately, the trailer lied and wasted two hours on this 'Romancing The Stone' wannabe.

The jokes weren't funny and got stale after five minutes. Tatum and Bullock had zero chemistry. The plot meandered and seemed like it didn't know what it was doing.

I honestly don't care enough about this movie to write a proper bad review for it. It was just... boring and lifeless. A waste of my time, and it'll probably be a waste of yours, too.

15 July 2022,The lost time,"The lost city is not the right title. The lost time (watching this) is actually the correct. Pure acting, bad script, dialogues and a woman dressed in pink strass running in the jungle, company with a muscle guy wearing mask face in his back because of allergy! A movie for kids....

15 May 2022,Hey! Did Ben Falcone direct this movie???,"Talk about a disappointment! Super Funny Star power galore, great locations , no doubt oodles of budget and what? Lame-o comedy. Flat lines, tired all the way around. How can this be? So much potential even Bullock looks bored and knows it. No chemistry either. The only star of this movie appears to be a derrière! 😂😉

26 March 2022,A new bar for Himbos.,"Channing Tatum really came out of the gate a said ""toxic masculinity who?""

The physical comedy is peak, there's enough ups and downs that it's not trying too hard to be all romance/comedy/drama at one time. The ""romance novel writing"" is the perfect level of cringe. Daniel Radcliffe plays the absolute perfect balance elated derangement.

Hands down the movie I've laughed the most at in theaters. Will own on DVD.

Some reviews are being super critical but if you're looking to have a good time, this is it.

4 April 2022,SO UN-F×××ING-FUNNY,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

27 March 2022,This movie had me rolling on the floor literally!!!!,"At first I thought that this movie was going to be an alright ""just to laugh"" movie but it turned out to be way more then that. This movie had it all, the acting, the writing, the laughs, and action, like what else could you ask for. This movie was die hard funny for most of the movie and a lot of it was together so there would be whole 15 min sections where I couldn't breathe because I was laughing so much. And this wasn't a laugh then forget about it kinda movie. This was a I'm going to use some of those lines type of movie. It was also very heartfelt in multiple parts, which is something that a lot of rom coms like this nowadays are missing. And even for how short the movie was it had enough time to have a lot of character development all the way through which again lots of new movies are missing and not even rom coms it's all genres of movies that are missing this! So over all just a great and well made movie!!

Some of the Jokes land, others don't. Parts of the Story are fun like Brad Pitt being hired for rescue operations and other parts, I couldn't care less. Like why is Daniel Radcliffes character looking for this damn artefact?

So he can beat his non existent brother?

From the trailers it looked like this was leading to something else. Like what actually happened?

18 October 2022,Basic comedy-adventure film,"The plot of the movie was basic, but kinda interesting and I was definitely gonna watch that movie. The storyline was just nice, nothing innovative (it followed the same concept every adventure-comedy movie does). The characters were very interesting, well-developed, so likeable and really funny. The filming location of the movie was really good, a small tropical island. In my opinion, the most boring part of the film was, the first 20 minutes. Especially, the opening scene wasn't very well executed. Of course, it was a funny movie that had many jokes. Also, it was a very intense movie, full of action filled scenes and they were very well portrayed. It wasn't an unexpected movie, I mean there weren't any plot twists and the ending was expected. Moreover, the casting was really good and the acting was nice, as always. Last but not least, the post credits scenes was really weird and kinda complicated. Anyway, I don't think they're gonna make a sequel, even though it was a nice movie.

21 May 2022,Had potential,"This movie had all the right ingredients but the recipe was screwed up. I was expecting something like Jungle Cruise, but instead got Harry Potter chasing around an awkward Sandra Bullock(literally plays the same finicky role every movie) and Channing Tatum (same character from 21 Jump street) in the jungle. The best part of the movie is Brad Pitt's small role. A weak story line and forced comedy is a bad mixture.

11 May 2022,Truly amazed these actors signed up for this.,"Two minutes into this film and you know what you're going to get. And what you get is a studio product, the very definition of mediocrity. Despite ripping off the premise from the infinitely superior Romancing The Stone the writing is atrociously unfunny and the direction completely by-the-numbers. As if the director was telling everyone he needed so many shots that day so let's get on and get through the pain of it as efficiently as possible.

I realise Sandra Bullock has had a lot of work done on her face, which is now permanently dour, but she looks embarrassed and bored in almost every scene. Even being carried away from an explosion her lifeless facial muscles are completely expressionless and she is discernibly counting down in her head to the detonation. Channing Tatum has difficulty even just playing himself and is he's clearly bored too, as indeed is Brad Pitt in his cameo, evidently thankful for the brevity of his role (taken as a reciprocal favour to Bullock for her cameo in his movie, Bullet Train). None of them manage to wring any excitement or life out of the terrible script and dialogue and the adventure itself is so utterly boring that not even the lazy vista shots can help.

The people who like this movie are clearly an undemanding generation, who have probably never seen more skilfully crafted examples within this genre such as the aforementioned Romancing The Stone.

Anyway, do yourself a favour and avoid this one. It's genuinely awful and you can easily tell that even the cast thought so too. They certainly don't need this kind of rubbish so why they signed up for this drivel is anyone's guess.",1
28 May 2022,Fun movie to watch...,"Finally got my wife to watch a movie other than Horror. Don't get me wrong, I like horror movies...don't get me wrong, but sometimes I like to watch a movie with a happy ending...like this little gem called Lost City. Kind of reminds me of Romancing the stone. I watched that move a dozen time and I still love it. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum do a great job in this movie. They have good chemistry and the movie is just fun to watch. I was surprised to see Brad Pitt in this movie, however. His role in it was so limited...it's weird to see him in a film for such a small role. His part had a lot of action in it, though. Anyway! It's a really good movie to watch and you won't be disappointed you had to rent it off of Youtube for 7.99. Peace.

19 April 2022,Good fun. Feel good movie,"If you're looking for something deep and meaningful this isn't for you. The story has been told a million times before. And you know how it's going to end.

But.... It's a great ride along the way. Bullock once again proves she's a great comedic actress. Tatum plays the part of the dumb pretty boy well. The chemistry between the two of them is great.

Brad Pitt has a great cameo and delivers a fantastic performance. Da'Vine Joy Randolph hits the mark every time. The weakest link in the ensemble is Daniel Radcliffe who just looks too nice to be a villain.

The whole cinema was laughing and chuckling all the way through at the screening I went to.

So if you want a feel good movie that you can just sit back, relax and enjoy. This is the one.",8
22 May 2022,Tolerable...barely.,"Everyone did a fine job (especially Brad Pitt in his cameo) in a silly film except whoever cast the actress playing the ridiculous Beth character. The minority casted goofball schtik is tiresome and her enormous size and breasts erupting from her blouse made it even more ridiculous. Glad I didn't pay for this film and it's too predictable to rate higher than 5 even watching free.

3 September 2022,Entertaining,"Light hearted good fun. The story was predictable but the cast was great. They balanced each other well, and the characters had more depth than one might think. Sandra Bullock was reminiscent of Miss Congenialty - similar comedic timing, which she does so well. Daniel Radcliffe was brilliant as the villain but not as dumb as the premise makes him sound to be with a bad guy kid napping a romance novelist to find a treasure. There was real thought behind the character motivation, which I appreciated. And Channing Tatum as the wanna be hero came through.

My review ends here.

I'm not sure why this review needs 600 characters and is being flagged for being too short. I think it does it justice, and I'm sure I've had other reviews with fewer characters. So just adding on this gibberish so it posts!

18 September 2022,Jack Trainer!,"Unique and quirky, this film produced genuine laughs. Unfortunately, most of the funny moments were in the trailer. It was cheesy at times, but the performances were fun to watch. Really, I just need a whole movie of Brad Pitt as Jack Trainer. There was too little screen time with his character.

Filled with shocking and claustrophobic moments, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat, even though it was a bit predictable. It was nice to see Channing Tatum back on the screen and not so serious. In the end, the movie is decent but nothing special.

Additional Note: Beth's character was pointless and the performance was bad.

10 May 2022,Such a cool and fun movie,"Unpretentious, light hearted and actually funny - which is something I can say about 1 in every 100 comedies, at most. I won't try to rationalize why and how the director makes you care about the characters, but if you have a heart (like this movie), you will. The script is well written, another rarity these days, and the acting is excellent, even when the scripts calls for larger-than-life and exaggerated performances. It just works, pacing is great, soundtrack is spot on, what more could a viewer possibly wish for? This isn't my favorite genre but I'm giving it 10/10 because I think it deserves better than its current rating.

2 June 2022,REally Bad Rip OFF,"I was going to rate it at 5, but took off 2 points for the stupid post credits scene. Absurd, insulting and not funny -that scene for sure, but could apply to most of the film as well.

Bad Rip Off? Romancing the Stone of course. This film is the manifestation of so much that is wrong with the movie business these days. Bullock is cute, but in trying to look 35 when she is 55 sort of works, but sort of doesn't. The DIE (Diversity, Inclusion, Equity) casting is painfully obvious and does not do anyone any favours. Black? Check. Asian? Check. Gay? Check. Obese? Check. Yawn... I pay for entertainment, not social justice agendas.

A few good lines, a few good scenes, that sadly stand out as good against a tapestry of boring, plagiarized, trying too hard and failing miserably.

Pitt is classic, but his role and character are insultingly betrayed by the credits scene. Radcliffe is a moustache twirling bad guy who is suitably overplayed. For the rest, give it a big miss.",3
18 December 2022,Bullock and Pitt Having Fun,"Sandra Bullock is the best since Lucille Ball at physical-comedy-shows-personality and she demonstrates it here, but the joy is how great Brad Pitt is at farce, including a bit after the credits roll. The comedy and romance are understated, perhaps too much, and the violence is not to be taken seriously. This is just a couple of great actors having fun for our enjoyment.

I'd happily see this again at home in preference to anything showing at my local mega-theater. We are awash in imperfect movies this year, so this movie stands taller than it might in a more shining era, but a benefit of the deluge is that there are some good movies, such as this one, even in underrepresented niches such as romantic comedy. If you like heroines you can laugh with, you'll probably like this movie.

8 September 2022,Fun comedy that picks up the pace as it goes along,"The lost city is a good mix of action, comedy and some 12 rated romance. It was also nice seeing an older woman, Sandra Bullock, in a leading role as well as Daniel Radcliffe in a villainous role. Both quite uncommon in films!

The plot is run of the mill but I enjoyed it regardless and it's rarely a dull film if not a masterpiece. I especially enjoyed the parts with Brad Pitt in and the power struggle / rivalry between his and Channing Tatum's characters. There are a couple of very unexpected moments which is nice for a comedy film that was otherwise quite predictable, which doen't make it a bad film at all but having unpredictable moments adds to the excitement.

I don't remember much about the music which means it at least wasn't noticeably bad but I can't say it was anything special.

25 March 2022,Let's make 'Romancing The Stone' 'Lite',"In the adventure/romance genre, this film is hugely disappointing. It adds nothing new, and lacks basic elements that are necessary to make such films 'work.' Bullock. Appealing as usual, and an extended cameo by Brad Pitt are the two saving graces, for their fans, though both are failed by a muddled, simplistic storyline and generally unfunny dialogue.

Tatum's man-child demeanor as the protagonist romance novelist (Bullock)'s fellow adventurist-and potential romantic interest, is miscast. Bullock's mega-star presence eclipses his. His super-nice hunky- guy character moons over her, seeming at times as if he's medicated with something that keeps him from displaying emotion. It isn't bad acting- it's emotion-free acting. Bottom-line: the Bullock/Tatum 'chemistry' does not work here. See 'Romancing The Stone' for an example of how this should* have worked. Fan favorite Daniel Radcliffe plays the (far too-mildly) eccentric heavy, pursuing Bullock/Tatum. He seems to try to make the best of the character, but- again- screenplay and direction disappoint.

It's 'just' watchable for fans of the cast.. I suppose.",5
1 May 2022,Light-hearted adventure for the entire family...,"I went to watch the 2022 movie ""The Lost City"" on a spur of the moment decision, as this is normally not something I would deem worthy the admission of a cinema ticket. But I went to go with my family, and I have to say that the movie was actually more enjoyable than I had initially anticipated.

The storyline in ""The Lost City"", as written by Oren Uziel, Dana Fox, Adam Nee and Seth Gordon, actually turned out to be a well-written one, and it was a storyline that had lots of different elements to it. ""The Lost City"" is a good combination of adventure, action and comedy, and it was done in such a way that it was actually rather enjoyable.

Now, I mentioned that this is not something I would normally spend a cinema admission on earlier, and that is because I am by no means a fan of Channing Tatum, and while Sandra Bullock does have a handful of good movies to her name then she is not cinema-worthy for me.

Directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee managed to put together a good and fun adventure movie. I liked the ways that the comedy elements were laced into the storyline, and there was also a good amount of nicely choreographed action.

While Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are not my first pick of go-to performers, then I will say that they were nicely cast for the movie and they definitely put on good performances on the screen. So thumbs up for the casting. But I have to say that it was Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt that made my day in the movie, they were just brilliant in ""The Lost City"".

""The Lost City"" makes for a good popcorn movie, where you just lean back in the seat, enjoy the snacks and watch the movie for what it is. If you like light-hearted adventure movies, then it is definitely worth a watch. However, I doubt that this is a movie I will ever return a second time.

My rating of ""The Lost City"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6
22 May 2022,Would not recommend,"Bad rip off of Romancing the Stone. There was no chemistry between Sandra and Channing. The PR character was not needed. The after-credit scene was like most of the movie, not funny. As much as Sandra is a bit of a one-note actress, she's good at what she does. But she grated a bit here as well. The best thing that this movie did as others had mentioned, is highlight how hard it is to be an actor and make me see Brad Pitt in a different light. I feel he is a bit one-note too. But he shines in this movie. There is something about him that made me want to watch him. He was funny. He made the character interesting. When he and Sandra were together, those scenes were interesting and the chemistry was on point.

14 May 2022,"Good Lord, why was this made?","All the ads you ever saw for this movie showed scenes from the first 20 minutes. The script was so totally derivative, like a low rent Romancing the Stone, the chemistry between Bullock and Tatum is like a wet match. The writing of the Tatum character is so one dimensional and contributes to how blank the movie seems. Brad Pitt's character is fun, but his presence is so minimal that it doesn't really help the overall feel of the movie. Daniel Radcliffe could have been replaced with a cardboard cutout.

Where did the $75 million budget go? Did the stars eat up the budget?

7 July 2022,Weird looking film work,"Weird looking film work. I'm not sure what was going on with it. Maybe it was that I was watching it on someone else's TV, but I don't think so. Backgrounds look like they were filmed elsewhere and inserted via green screen. Some people's skin changes from mottled to smooth and back again during a scene. Wrinkles on foreheads appear and disappear, as though photoshopping is inconsistent. The lighting is really weird too.

Dialog is really bad. Was there a writer, a director? The biggest question is how they managed to get the likes of Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe to do this film. There were signature awkward romantic comedy scenes I expect from Sandra Bullock, but totally devoid of any chemistry or humor, as though the person writing and directing the scenes was just going through the motions.

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

17 July 2022,Annoying garbage,"The 500th movie where Sandra Bullock plays a silly character who is afraid and clumsy and appears to be 20 years younger then her real age.

Annoying garbage where absolutely nothing is funny at all.

2 April 2022,"Funny, Charming and Delightfully Refreshing","The trailer for The Lost City caught my eye mostly for what wasn't in it. No clues about an existing property it was attached to, no comic book characters or Oscar bait material..... how did it get the green light from the studio? City felt very old fashioned and with some interesting names in the cast, I was intrigued. Starting with the plot and characters, Lost City doesn't rewrite the book on this genre of movie but it avoids too many of the tropes. It's helped along by the fact that it's such an oddity in 2022. I was disarmed by the story's earnestness and straightforward nature. The screenwriters could have wrote a tighter plot but the phrase ""good enough"" comes to mind. It was never intolerable or grating and while Loretta being a stick in the mud could have been too familiar or Alan being a useless idiot could have been too easy, I found the movie was able to toe the line without being too lazy or cliche. The story and characters get the job done (with the exception of Allison whose jokes consistently elicited no laughs).

Sandra Bullock has been bouncing around, hopping between genres and projects to varying degrees of success. She's a versatile actress but The Lost City feels like a throwback to her days doing movies like The Proposal and Miss Congeniality. Regardless of what you think of those movies, she's one of the few who could pull those roles off consistently and she's more than game here as over-the-hill writer Loretta. She doesn't play it up too hard, she walks a fine line between capably anchoring the movie yet being game to roll with Tatum or whomever she's sharing the screen with. Tatum's re-invention as a comedian has been such a joy to witness. He's got serious comic chops and he has great chemistry with Bullock. The two of them together had me chuckling throughout. Brad Pitt was great in his role, he's on exactly the same wavelength he needs to be and while I knew he was capable of being funny, I was surprised at how deftly he played his character. I always like seeing Daniel Radcliffe pop up in things, he's got a very diverse portfolio of characters and he always seems to be throwing his all into it. He's a lot of fun here, I did have a couple of notes on his character but his performance always had the requisite energy and spirit. Da'Vine Joy Randolph was also a welcome addition, she walks a similar line to Bullock and she never failed to deliver her punchlines in a way that didn't leave a smile on my face.

I could pick this movie apart if I really wanted to. The script could have been stronger, there are extra scenes that don't really gel with the overall narrative, the movie can't make up its mind on how villainous they want Fairfax to be. But despite the flaws, I didn't want to penalize The Lost City too heavily with for its missteps. As I mentioned above, I was taken aback by The Lost City. Not every joke lands, not every narrative decision plays but the movie works more often than it doesn't and it didn't dampen my enthusiasm as the film went along.

The Lost City made for a refreshing viewing experience. The mid-size movie is fading into obscurity and while most of us love the huge tentpoles or the obscure indie fare, I'm glad there's still an audience that's willing to go out for this kind of romp. Bullock and Tatum are on point, the story has enough laughs and heart baked in to keep you interested and there's plenty of fun to be had (it's not completely family friendly as there were some kids in my theatre that witnessed some pretty ""adult"" jokes). It won't make any top 10 lists but The Lost City adds up to a couple of well spent hours at the theatre. If you're tired of superheroes and weepy dramas, give this a shot and maybe you'll exit the cinema pleasantly surprised like I did.",8
29 April 2022,Brad Pitt was the best part,"Brad Pitt was in the movie for 5 mins and was the best part of the film. If your a basic person you'll love this movie especially if your a girl as Tatum loves to take his shirt off in this one.

30 July 2022,Nice cover,"""The Lost City"" is an average type movie, pretty much along the lines of ""Romancing the Stone"" from the 80's. To be quite honest, it could have been much better, the storyline was not the best; again, it is a take on a previous movie. It is OK, light entertainment as the phrase goes. Watchable, but not great.

""The Lost City is one of this year's surprises, managing to vary the well-known formulas of the genre in a creative, fun manner.

By making the most of the hilarious, chemistry-filled performances from Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock, the Nee brothers explore the distinct protagonists, Alan and Loretta, beyond what's expected in generic rom-coms, developing their misleading appearances through a genuinely exciting adventure.

Unfortunately, only the main character arcs receive this level of care, as everything secondary lacks the same interesting treatment and better entertainment. Still, a thematically rich ending compensates for any cliches.

Definitely, a family viewing party recommendation.""

2 October 2022,Lol I absolutely enjoyed this movie,"There is a reason why I am a huge fan of oscar winning actress Sandra bullock and the answer is here- Sandra never disappointed me ever, if a movie has bad reviews Sandra finds a way to make the movie brilliant.

This movie is not just a romantic comedy action movie but it's almost like a remake of romancing the stone but more clever.

The performances between channing Tatum and academy award winner Sandra bullock is pitch perfect they are a dynamite together also Daniel Radcliff is brilliant.

Daniel Radcliffe made a comeback a because of this 10/10 very good enjoyable laugh out loud hilariously funny action packed movie.

6 April 2022,Romancing the Stone,"This is a remake of Romancing the Stone, and not well done. Just fluff. There is nothing interesting about this, it's just as generic as you'd expect. There's a lot of opertunities that they had to make it a little from the original, but they didn't. Wait until it's on your streaming service before watching it, don't pay for in the theatre.

Just a whole lot of whys and no clear answers. I'm convinced that the good reviews are from people being paid to write them or people with low IQ's--nothing else makes sense.

30 January 2023,Ignore the low rating it's fairly good !!!,"The lost city is a 2022 action comedy adventure film starring Channing Tatum, Sandra bullock, Brad Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe. When I saw the trailers I thought it looked really good and wanted to go to cinema to see it but never got a chance. After reading the mixed reviews I kind of got put off but I thought what the hell I'm going to watch it. The movie was better than expected I really enjoyed it Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are as good as ever and never seem to disappoint. Very talented. The storyline silently different to some other films which was good ( a little predictable in places) but certainly keeps you hooked. The acting was superb was funny in places. It was a good film more comedy than action but definitely worth the watch. Ignore the negative reviews and watch it for yourself it certainly is entertaining to watch. If you are a fan of Channing Tatum and Sandra bullock then you will love this. A good light hearted action comedy to watch. Get the popcorn out and watch the film. Currently streaming on paramount plus.

25 May 2022,The Lost Silly,"So many big names in such a small script. Brad Pitt stole the show and I'd have had much preferred he male headlined this movie instead of Magic Might not. Yes, yes, you may take all your clothes off to distract from your great acting and butt boost the box office. On other matters, the production value set was clearly Hollywood great but watching and listening to the many tacky and dull conventional clichés amongst all these flickering star actors, it was clear they probably wished their lines were way more respectful of their talents. No, tired slapsticks and references aren't human. Sandra Bullock was her usual self effacing self suffering heroine lady great character persona, waiting to sweep everyone off at the end of the movie with her usual dry margarita smile and humor. All in all, petty cash for everyone who's anyone bored with lockdown yes?

18 April 2022,A fun and harmless comedy romp,"While far from a laugh riot or a product that in anyway, shape or form tries to rewrite the romantic comedy adventure rulebook that has long been a staple of such well liked films as Romancing the Stone, Aaron and Adam Nee's The Lost City is a consistently enjoyable and pleasing Hollywood ride that coaxes along off the chemistry between its leading duo to produce a now rare type of studio film that never tries too hard while embracing what it is and what its end goal entails.

Following the exploits of Sandra Bullock's widowed novelist Loretta Sage and her cover model Alan Caprison (played by a once-more dimwitted Channing Tatum) as the two mismatched adults find themselves on an exotic jungle covered island that Daniel Radcliffe's resentful billionaire Abigail Fairfax has partially claimed in order to find some fabled lost treasure, City surprises little in any of its narrative beats or formulaic delivery but like comfort food the Nee's film provides exactly what has been prescribed in any of the films trailers or marketing campaigns, allowing the film to be one of the more successful high-profile comedies of recent memory.

Wasting little time on anything that could be considered attempts at providing anything deeper than getting easy laughs from Bullock's double wedgies or Tatum's battle against blood sucking leeches, City understands what it is and who its for as Bullock brings her Miss Congeniality comedic skills and Tatum brings his 21 Jump Street smarts to the film that gives its duo plenty of material too work with, even if their both overshadowed by a scene-stealing Brad Pitt as mysterious son of a weatherman Jack Trainer.

Bouncing off one another with ease and clear enjoyment, Bullock and Tatum make for perfect partners in crime as they battle Fairfax's incompetent goons, the dangerous jungle and inappropriate footwear and their interplay with one another goes a long way to cover over the films cracks that are constantly appearing in the rather daft story and adventure components and the fact the film suffers from genuinely killer set pieces that the best of Hollywood comedies have alongside the filler chuckles.

These cracks and missteps of the film matter rather little in the overall proceedings of the film and while City is a film you're unlikely to be quoting to your friends or remembering months down the line, City reminds us all that sometimes middle tier films such as this that exist merely for easy wins and mindless entertainment have a place in our movie going lives as much as any other products we consume.

Final Say -

Getting a boost from its on song leads and easy going charm, The Lost City isn't groundbreaking stuff buts its a perfectly fun and harmless comedic adventure that is sure to entertain the masses.

4 June 2022,One more for the pile,"New movies are so offensive to the senses. The cast picks are unbearable and the many agenda jokes (Gag). At least we can refresh our eyes with Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt. Movies don't feel like movies, just random nonsense and a collection of people they threw together.

13 July 2022,An epic tragedy,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort.

26 July 2022,The Found City.,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you?

21 April 2022,Enjoyable,"Trying to revive a Romancing The Stone (1984), Jewel of the Nile (1985) vibe, Sandra Bullock, Tatum O'Neal, along with a surprise lengthy cameo part for Brad Pitt, this comedy romance has all the typical trappings though at times, there are a few uneasy scenes of drama and violence. Daniel Radcliff from Harry Potter gets to play bad guy. Tatum's character at the beginning is almost offensively and perhaps unintentionally two-dimensional and off-putting. This romance, comedy, adventure movie though adds two nice elements to the genre. First, there is an increasing element of seriousness and a touching measure of maturation or at least revelation of the humanizing of Tatum's character and an added depth for the typical relational component of romance in this movie. Second, the anticlimax of the movie is somehow more refreshing and connective to today's audience that has been bombarded with the more outrageous. Whether the inclusion of the final scene that comes after the major ending credits was tacked on by the producers to allow for a better audience focus-group reaction is at present unknown. Overall, this rom-com is a nice contribution to the genre.",7
29 May 2022,"Terrible, just terrible","Not funny, not adventurous. Action lame. Boring. Bad script, bad acting, waste of time. I can enjoy bad movies, and see some charm in it. Sandra, looks like an avatar of herself, or close to Michael Jackson at the end of his life.

No this is worse then bad. Nothing works, all is overdone, and just Bratt Pit's performance, way too short, gives some smile at the movie, although it is one eye, in the land of the blind.

I gave up and put it off, my wife, even if she hated it too, continue watching..... But boy, she should be rewarded for tis.

14 May 2022,Turned off after the Harry Potter kid said gender neutral,"Well I can't review the whole movie because I turned off after 12 minutes. Where do I start?, how about the overweight black lady for her agent, silly Asian host, Sandra bullock not smiling then cracks jokes when she's abducted, bullock saying she's saposexual or whatever it's called and then the icing on the j k Rowling cake.. Harry Potter saying he's got a gender neutral name. Go woke go broke keep it coming Hollywood because at this rate we can get back to a normal movie world sooner.

17 September 2022,Entertaining at least,"So I finally got around to watching this film after putting it off for some time. It's basically one of those movies you watch when you don't know what else to put on or wanna kill some time. At least that was my reason. Definitely not making any headlines or awards but has an A-list set of actors with a mediocre script that doesn't do them justice. We've all seen that one before right? I will say Brad Pitt was probably the best part of the whole movie and stole the show as he usually does in the little screen time he was given. The rest of the film was pretty much your average cookie cutter stuff you usually see in rom-coms, with a woke feminist take sprinkled in. As other reviewers have said it tries too hard to be funny at times and ruins the authenticity. But enough critiques, If you want something light-hearted that will make you laugh then this is the movie for you. Personally seeing it once was enough for me.

28 March 2022,The Lost City,"This potential comedic adventure proved to be a dull bore. To its credit, the film's leads have genuine chemistry throughout and have some funny scenes together. There are also some over the top antics and cameos that are downright hilarious. However the film falters agonizingly through an overdone and predictable plot as well as a being painfully boring. It was clear throughout that the film desperately needed an outlandish performance from its cast or something to truly stick out in a pool of forgettable comedies, but this film takes the blandest route in its execution. It didn't help that the characters didn't seem too interested in the adventure occurring until the end, which should tell the audience about how much care they should give to the film overall. Despite the films obvious flaws and bland execution though, it wasn't completely unwatchable with some redeeming qualities. However, in the end it made for a forgettable comedy that will just fall into an unfortunate fold.

10 May 2022,its very generic...,"On expeditioning topic, a lets try it out comedy by two rater strong caracteractors of fun, flickwise channing falling out higher than sandra bjullokk. The rest of the cast including harry potter do not raise any alarms , seems like a job is a job to them.

Seems like the dynamics are good and some of the jokes hits home, but its far too average, and maybe slow to many.i you love, like my better half, miss bulljokk living kicks'n about, you wont be dissapointed, her adhd having total control over the playbook and director, words and demeanors is like the good old ones.

So praise the absence of digital treasure hunting, they barely use a cell phone in this flick, the high heels and bare breast do take you on a ride so therefore a tiny recommend to watch, if you have the chance use the ffwd button, that can raise the level of entertainment a lot.

I still rewatch many of them today. Movies have become overly serious. I miss Movies that provide entertainment but with a sense of humor. Channing Tatum and Sandra bullock make a great duo. The cameo is also fantastic. I highly recommend this movie and I suggest everyone enjoy it in the theaters.

3 July 2022,Had high hopes but no,"It's so sad to see such a great cast doing so poorly. It's just a never ending cliché. I don't know who the audience would be to think this is enjoyable, kids maybe who never seen similar movies before. I don't know if it's the bad script or lack of interest from the cast, maybe both. This was just very sad for everyone involved.

12 August 2022,A lacklustre Romancing The Stone clone.,"Joan Wilder should sue: romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) has totally stolen her schtick, the archaeologist turned best-selling writer becoming involved in the search for a long-lost treasure hidden in a jungle, unexpectedly finding love along the way.

The Lost City rips off Romancing the Stone something rotten, but hasn't the charm or wit of the 1984 Kathleen Turner/Michael Douglas adventure. At 54, Bullock is way too old for this kind of material (Turner was 30 when she made RTS), making Channing Tatum seem too young for his role as cover model Alan, the man Loretta falls for. The age gap mightn't have mattered so much if the pair had some kind of on-screen chemistry, but they are unable to replicate the Turner/Douglas magic, their supposedly funny banter more irritating than amusing. Meanwhile, Daniel Radcliffe as villain Abigail Fairfax is just terrible - how does this guy continue to have an acting career?

Only Brad Pitt impresses with his cameo, playing a rugged Special Ops agent hired to rescue kidnapped Loretta: he embraces the stupidity of his role and looks like he's having a lot of fun parodying the macho stereotype. Shame he wasn't in the film more.

As far as the action is concerned, it's mediocrity all the way, the set-pieces lacking in originality, imagination and excitement.

I disliked it because it was not funny, had none of the ""Romancing the Stone"" excitement and the acting was just b-a-d. For those of you who gave this anything higher that a 5, you need to watch Romancing the Stone or Jewell of the Nile (which was not as good as Romancing, but a heckava lot better than this rubbish).

25 March 2022,Very stupid and very crowd-pleasing,"I mean, technically just about every aspect of this movie is pretty mediocre. It has an extremely formulaic plot, very standard visual direction, a crushingly boring villain (despite Daniel Radcliffe's solid performance), and a bland, underdeveloped romance arc.

But something about it makes it very difficult to dislike, and that something is the actors.

Really, every single performance is remarkably spot-on, and constantly charismatic and entertaining. The humorous beats are diverse and fast-paced, and I was never bored, despite rolling my eyes occasionally.

For the most part, The Lost City is an adventure romp that knows exactly what it is, and is completely okay being just that. And for that reason, I'm completely okay with it too.

18 May 2022,Excellent Well Written Comedy,"Not really sure why my review for this film kept being rejected or just not going through. I have evaluated this 3 times now and all 3 times were very positive reviews.

I am not a fan of American comedies, but this one was a pleasant surprise. What I like about this movie is that it is witty and a lot of the short minor jokes were creative and unexpected. Many of the jokes are not direct, but uses insinuation and and implication, which is really just genius in my opinion

The overall plot is formulaic, but that is expected in comedy especially when they're often parodies. However, my only issue with this film is the editing which bloated the run time. I think it could be trimmed cleaner by cutting a lot of the slow talking parts which don't really add anything to be plot other than trying to build the relationship between the two protagonists.

Overall, a good 7/10.",7
30 March 2022,Brad Pitt Stole The Movie,"I like this movie. I was expecting some fun silliness and it didn't disappoint. Honestly, the only reason I wanted to see it was for the Brad Pitt part, but I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy most of the other scenes too.

There was simply no chemistry between the characters, and I felt like all three lead roles were miscast. Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock just do not look like a couple. Also, the jokes were too forced and fell flat most of the time. The villain was not villainous enough. It just felt like the movie was trying to hard to be a big time action romance comedy. Overall, it simply did not live up to the hype and was basically a mediocre two hours.

Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

5 April 2022,Very interesting and Just like Indiana Jones,"""The Lost City"" isn't an especially unique film; its premise draws on ""Romancing the Stone"" and countless other adventure movies. Its punchlines are recognizable from a distance as the volcano dominating the remote island where most of the story takes place. This is a movie you can get a clear sense of from its opening moments, every beat clearly telegraphed. There is, however, a significant amount of comfort and delight in all this familiarity. Directors and co-writers Adam and Aaron Nee understand exactly what their audience wants-much like a good romance novelist might-and deliver an undeniably charming (and refreshingly IP-free) romantic romp. This is a movie you watch in the theater, with popcorn, then again and again on streaming, with a glass of wine. Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a burnt-out romance writer whose grief after the loss of her husband threatens to derail her career. Her disdain for her books is only matched by her dislike of their cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), a seemingly dim beefcake who indulges her readers at signing events. After an event promoting her latest book, Loretta is abducted by explorer/rich guy Abigail (it's a gender-neutral name, apparently) Fairfax, played by Daniel Radcliffe. ""The Lost City"" may get dinged by some for being formulaic and silly, but it does many things well that are notable. It's bright, both visually and atmospherically. It's an original story, told by filmmakers who get what kind of movie this is. Most importantly, its central relationship displays a real understanding of the emotional sensitivity and vulnerability that make romance attractive as a genre. Ultimately, ""The Lost City"" is interested in hitting viewers' expectations head on. It does so on a level that may seem obvious, but is done with an amount of care that's sure to hold up to repeat viewings.",10
23 May 2022,Terrific (but silly) entertainment in a 'Romancing The Stone' stylee,"Similar to 1984's ""Romancing The Stone"" (and it's 1985 sequel ""The Jewel Of The Nile"") adventure rom-com ""The Lost City"" has reclusive romance novelist Sandra Bullock (on fine form) whisked off on a remote treasure-hunting jungle adventure, in her case with 'dumb' cover-model Channing Tatum, helped by the likes of Brad Pitt, Da'Vine Joy Randolph & Oscar Nuñez - while evading baddie Daniel Radcliffe (surprisingly perfect in the role). It's great fun and the fine & likeable cast appeared to enjoy making it, which comes across via directors Aaron & Adam Nee (who also co-wrote it with Oren Uzil & Dana Fox). It is undeniably silly mush, and yet is still terrific entertainment.

5 July 2023,Intentionally cheesy romcom parody that turned out awesome,"Great casting and witty dialogue between characters felt pretty natural. It has a good balance between making fun of cheesy romcoms and steamy romance novels while still being one at the end. The action and adventure theme pulled it all together creatively and made it much more entertaining than just a standalone love story with no other objectives.

Didn't feel as forced or cause any eye rolling like traditional films of this genre for me, because of the bit of parody element they worked in. The parts that I generally find cringey were made intentionally awkward with the character dynamics and it just worked much better.

Personally being in the entertainment field, it showed the dichotomy that a lot of people in the field go through. The character you're playing versus your true self. The more often or longer you play a character, you can sacrifice your own identity. Seeing this play out in a comical way between a writer and the cover models' real identities versus their on stage roles for interviews which were the polar opposites was a pretty accurate depiction of how working in the field can be and the expectations of always being ""on character"" with the fans expectations.",7
10 April 2022,Funny and enjoyable,"I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't top drawer, but it was fun and funny. Since I originally liked Romancing the Stone a lot and this was so similar of course I liked it.

15 July 2022,Bad Bad Bad,"The only good thing in this film was Brad Pitt's cameo. I thought it might be a fun with but it was just a Sandra Bullock vanity project. The comedy fell flat even though Channing Tatum tried hard. The script was woeful, cliche and unimaginative. I sat through an hour of the movie but couldn't bear it any longer and turned it off. Dreadful.

9 May 2023,More like a lost tomb,"*) K Reviews *) ( ( Comedy aspect of this good, and the role of trainer is the highlight of this movie. Daniel Radcliffe has a knack of doing the same role in different films, for example Harry Potter series and now you see me. This movie is more like a now you see me 2.5 except the magic part. If you are being bored and looking for something fun time, then this is a good one, with a unique style to approach humour. More like a dark, type of humour. Kudos to the Duo couple in the main role and keep us entertaining throughout the movie. You'll find flaws here and there but you can ignore it easily due to the silly theme of the movie.

I can understand some people had higher expectations from the cast and were disappointed but if you just consider the premise it's pretty obvious what you're going to get: not much originality, weak and predictable plot, good actors giving very adequate performances, entertaining action and stunts. For mindless mild fun, I recommend it.

1 May 2022,Great Escapist fun,"My Review- The Lost City - My Rating 7/10

I enjoyed The Lost City it's slapstick escapist fun in the spirit of the 1980's movies like Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones but not quite as good.

However it has a great cast and enough funny ""Shtick"" moments to make it a good Saturday matinee style movie in the true sense of the word . I think it would be lost on television as it's an old fashioned cinema comedy adventure movie in the tradition going right back to The Keystone Cops or Jungle Jim and Tarzan era.

It's unpretentious well produced , yes at times silly but I'd rather see ten films like The Lost City than one like a certain pretentious Viking box office disaster that's screening at the moment .

The plot is simple with similarities to Romancing the Stone (1984) but it's not a remake in my opinion as there's enough difference's in the plot to make it stand on its own. We do have a jaded disillusioned romance novelist Loretta Sage /Angela played by Sandra Bulloch who through dramatic circumstances after her latest book launch organised by her literary agent Beth Hadden in a fun performance from Da'Vine Joy Randolph.

Loretta is kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax an eccentric bratty billionaire (Daniel Ratcliffe) who explains his name as gender neutral while trying to get Loretta to reveal the whereabouts of the ""Crown of Fire"", a priceless treasure.

Loretta's handsome cover model Alan or Dash played by Channing Tatum as his book fans know him sees the kidnapping and pursues her captors aided by rugged ex combat fighter Jack Trainer(Brad Pitt).

Dash or Allan appears all brawn and no brain but has a heart of gold and Loretta who at first is indifferent to him soon warms to his clunky buffness.

That's enough plot line from me the movie was filmed in the Dominican Republic and only wrapped up on October 2021 principle photography began in March 2021 and there is talk of a sequel already.

The Lost City is proof that a relatively modest budget of $64-74million dollars can do well at the Box Office as it's already earned Worldwide $130.6 million.

Don't expect the techno brilliance of Dune or Star Wars but if you like an uncomplicated unpretentious adventure escape with some really good performances especially from Channing Tatum Sandra Bulloch and Daniel Ratcliffe as the villain of the piece I recommend The Lost City.",7

11 October 2022,Better Left Lost - The Lost City,"Brad Pitt picked up a payday in this film, but realy doesn't add much to the film. Sandra Bullock makes a decent straight man for his lame jokes. I guess I should mention Chaning Tatum, but there really no reason to. The acting? Is barely believable and the silly plot and script were probably written on the car ride into work on a cell phone. This film is not exactly rocket science, nor is it the greatest treasure hunt ever told. As a matter of fact, it is pretty ho-hum from the beginning of the film onward. No one should be forced to fork over ten bucks for this average fare when there are so many other superior options. Don't bother.

This movie is so bad, I'm wondering if the cast lost a bet which led to them being cast. The original film was silly; this is a remake of lesser quality (shocking, I know).

If there's bribery involved, by all means watch this movie. If you need to rearrange your sock drawer, do that instead.

1 May 2023,Adventure Comedy does its job...but no more than that,"This film wants to be Romancing the Stone but its not on that level. It's not even The Jewel Of The Nile. It is a solid film though without an original idea in it. Its a fun film in a Sunday Afternoon turn your brain off sort of way. Bullock and Tatum give solid performances, Daniel Radcliffe is good. The scene stealer is Brad Pitt in an all too brief appearance. Action scenes are passable but nothing that truly sticks in the memory. The big gripe i have with the film is at times the humour is just too silly, borderline annoying. Plot is paint by numbers, however the reveal of the treasure is a nice surprise. Everything seems set up for a sequel, and if that does happen i would be interested to see what direction they take these characters.

11 June 2022,First 25 minutes were pretty darn funny and promising...then...,"The movie falls apart after an opening half hour. I suppose that it was just too hard to keep the momentum going after that point given the 'meh' script and formulaic ideas in play.

At first, the cast had excellent chemistry. Things were really building steam, but after Brad Pitt's character briefly appeared and left the film it was all downhill.

4/10 - Highly entertaining for a while then devolves into an utter lack of creativity.

For a better film of this type, visit (or revisit) ""Romancing the Stone"" or even ""Jewel of the Nile.""

There is comedy, romance, adventure, and there is nice story about feeling like a fraud, but then learning something about yourself and wrong assumptions you make about others.

20 November 2022,Negative 0 stars times infinity,"This movie is an example of how everting that comes out of Hollywood these days is such schlock bad remake of a better idea. Romancing the Stone is a legendary film about a romance writer who goes on a real life adventure that could fit into one of her stories and meets the man of her dreams.

This film is an intentional cheap knock off. It's badly written, acted, and the sets look awful and the makeup is bad and the cinematography are appalling. Sandra Bullock is about as likable as sitting bare butt on a porcupine, and Channing Tatum fails on every conceivable level.

I hated this film from the moment it started and I wish I had just turned it off. I hope these filmmakers never work again.

23 March 2022,Brad pitt character deserves a whole sequel.,"Brad's part was the funniest . Now i need a movie just about his character.

I am really amazed and moved by brad pitt's acting in recent years . He creates characters so perfectly that when the movie finishes you feel like you want more of that character . This happened for me with once upon a time in Hollywood too.

He really is GOAT.

He does some magic on screen .

He was 10/10 in this movie.

19 June 2022,OmywordWhere2begin?,"Aside from the story paralleling much of the earlier ""Romancing the Stone"". The bantering was so asinine and OVERDONE, that it ruined what little entertaining plot there was to begin with. A real mistake using Tatum Channing as a ""lead"" (seriously?!) Sandra Bullock deserved better, you know, as someone who could equal a comedic role?! It was another clear mistake in doing but a cameo of Jeff Trainer (Brad Pitt) who came & went far too fast to add to the plot's interest.

Honestly, making a FUN movie is ONE THING - but creating such a bonafide flop of bad moves from start to finish - well, someone has lost mucho money on this one and? UNDERSTANDABLY so!

I always love seeing Sandra Bullock on screen -- she was a great choice for the main character. I feel like they should use her in a lot more movies even though she's been in a lot already.

24 March 2022,A decent romance adventure comedy,"Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum make a fine duo in this farcical comedy which is a more contemporary take on the plot from Romancing the Stone (1984). Daniel Radcliffe actually makes a fantastic villain in this movie with some really funny dialogue.

Overall, the movie has plenty of funny bits despite having some jokes that fall flat and the movie occasionally gets dull during the first half before it starts to pick up during the second half. The movie benefits from some really good casting decisions and Bullock's usual deadpan delivery feels balanced against Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe's over-the-top quirky personas. Bullock portrays a jungle romance writer who's lost all passion for writing romance books but when she gets entangled in a jungle adventure of her own, she regains her lust for writing as well as romance. Despite the majority of the film containing over-the-top comedy, there are some serious moments where Bullock and Tatum's characters are fleshed out. Overall, there's a fair amount of drama mixed in with the film's comedy.

Reportedly, this is going to be Bullock's last film for a while as she's planning to take an extended break from acting in Hollywood so I really recommend this film if you're a fan of Sandra Bullock and rom-coms in general.",8
29 March 2022,Great Fun From Start To Finish!,"The Lost City

It was great fun!

A grieving and somewhat accidental best selling author, Sandra Bullock, goes on a life changing adventure, with her novel's dashing cover model, Channing Tatum and regains her mojo.

This was a light and fluffy romcom expertly played by the two leads, you got exactly what was on the tin, it was genuinely funny and I laughed out loud throughout.

The chemistry and comedy between these two worked in spades, and I know I shouldn't but Sandra Bullock must have the best plastic surgeon in Hollywood, looking 37 when actually 57, it really is remarkable, when the close up shots were merciless.

For shear entertainment, and I could tell everyone around me loved this movie, I'm giving it a firm 7 outta 10, meaning such fun!",7
6 April 2022,Enjoyable most of the time.,"I'd rate this somewhere between a 6 and a 7.

The first half of the movie is hilarious and I'm not sure how they got away with a pg-13 rating.

Second half of the movie they tried to focus on the plot more and it was sort of ""meh"".

Overall, it's worth seeing, I laughed a ton but the overall plot and trying to put in romance and serious moments in the second half sort of fell flat.

24 April 2022,Hilarious,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

20 April 2022,Mediocre,"I'd not classify this film as bad, but there are alot of slow bits that feel like they're dragging and a lot of weak writing especially the awful narrative humour where they're just pointing out the obvious in silly ways.

It's decent, but the fact is I don't see it as a real comedy as it's doubtful you'd want to see it again.

Sandra is 58! I mean she looks unreal fair play!

CT was alright, but he's played the Handsome idiot to death at this point.

Brads cameo was great.

I feel sorry for Radcliffe, Harry Potter was huge but he's grown into such an awful actor, everything I see him in he's atrocious, I genuinely believe it's that potter love that gets him gigs. He is one of the worst villains I've ever seen in a movie.",5
3 April 2022,Consistently funny.,"Good romantic adventures are very hard to make. The Lost City works, remaining funny right from the opening moments until the post-credits coda.

All three of the stars are convincing, and there's plenty of chemistry between the two leads. Brad Pitt's extended cameo is flat-out hilarious, and it neatly sets up a contrast to Channing Tatum's deliberately pared-back tone. The writing is modern but not forcedly woke.

Everyone involved deserves credit for taking on a difficult genre without resorting to self-deprecation and glum navel gazing.

Plenty to enjoy for both genders, young(ish) and old.

14 April 2022,Love it!,"If you like your fun, quirky romantic comedy's with a lot of action, this one's for you.

There's not much to complain about really although I wouldn't of complained to see more Brad Pitt scenes, he was brilliant for his hole 5/10 minutes screen time. Other than that this movie gives you everything you need, bullock and Tatum are on top form as expected they bounce off each other. Glad to see Tatum starring as I read he replaced Ryan Reynolds (love Reynolds) but he does more than enough movies. Definitely get your selves down to the cinema for this one, it's worth it.

Bullock does well in this role. Good comedy parts. Kind of a redemption story of sorts and an awakening for the main. Nothing controversial or woke which is a plus. Just enjoy it.

11 May 2022,Does what it says on the tin,"To be mad at this film is like being mad at a microwave meal, expecting it to taste like restaurant quality. So I'm giving this a generous 7, simply because there's nothing bad to say about this film.

It's exactly what you should expect.

High budget, good acting, easy to watch and enjoyable. With a few things thrown in, like Brad Pitts role which I hadn't expected.

If you're watching this for something new/ original, then you've come to the wrong place.

This came out around the same time as Unchartered and it's very similar. The only difference is you can actually complain about Unchartered and the lost opportunity it had to be something punchy, well-written and original.",7
10 May 2022,Flat jokes and uninventive story,"What's most preposterous about the movie, it starts with a main character complaining how the narrative she creates doesn't make logical sense, and then the movie goes at length to defy logic in the scenery, situations and narrative.

There are some bright moments here and there, though they quickly sink into the general puddle of half-hearted jokes, dull villains and generic predictable story.

A disappointment.

The plot is solid. Great direction. Just a well put together comedy about a bored romance writer pulled into a real life adventure. Her cover model steps up to save her. Brad Pitt is the real SEAL tough guy that is hired to save them both. Fun stuff.

5 September 2022,The proposal 2.0 on drus,"Just if a maniac wrote a satire out of it. I enjoyed every bit of it, it's entertaining and fun, but just a guilty pleasure. Is good for entertaining, but don't expect much art out of it.

The story might be clicheed, but I find the evolution of the characters interesting. Is a cross over Nim's Island with Sandra's The proposal, full of jokes and exaggeration.

A film to watch with the girls while sipping wine, or to watch by yourself when you put on makeup and stay home alone. So, definitely, a film for women in their 30's or older.

The only thing that was a bit off was the ending, and maybe the ultimate message. It was supposed to be 'if you aren't happy with what you have is because you didn't realize what was in front of yourself', but I find it a bit tasteless how they conveyed that ending with all the grievance the main character was thorugh...

21 November 2022,Wow a lot of negative reviews,"Peter Debruge of Variety said, ""The result can feel a little rickety in places, but the Nee brothers - who share screenplay credit with Oren Uziel and Dana Fox - have punched it up with off-color jokes, looped over moments when the characters' mouths are off-camera. In this and myriad other ways, The Lost City proves they do in fact make 'em like they used to."" Writing for Rolling Stone, David Fear said ""The movie itself is trying to excavate a long-lost genre: the big-budget action-adventure movie-star rom-com. It wants to be a modern Romancing the Stone so badly you can almost see the flop-sweat dripping down the screen..

This is the the way cinema works. I remember the return of Jedi and that film was just fun not this film. This is art.

28 March 2022,Flesh and blood cartoons,"The moment one reads about a recluse novelist any thought about originality goes flying out of the window. Kathleen Turner from Romancing the Stone and Jodie Foster from Nim's Island pop immediately to mind. So I knew I was walking into a cliche from the very start. The only question was, how are they going to breath life into it. Well, it was a team effort but they did breath life into a whole series of cliche. Or, using a more appropriate term in this case - a set of cartoons from the recluse novelist to her dim witted cover model who wants her to take him seriously. And then her overbearing literary agent; the megalomaniac millionaire with the big inferiority complex; and the list goes on. Almost everyone on screen is a walking talking cartoon of a cinematic and literary cliche. And still it does work.

Recently I spoke on these pages a lot about well written roles. Well, here we had well written cliche but a superb cast headed by Sandra Bullock Channing Tatum, both of whom have already shown the ability to laugh at their own image and a surprising comic performance from Daniel Radcliffe whose acting prowess grows in leaps and bounds. All of them together, playing one of the others, make this collection of cliche work. I spoke a long while ago about Rowan Atkinson's ability of making a cartoon character human enough for us to care for him as Johnny English. Here we got a whole series of cartoons becoming real flesh and blood humans on screen - just enough for us to bond with them and care for them.",8
26 September 2022,"Some parts work, others don't","The dialouge in this film isn't great, but the actors enhance the material. Especially Brad Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe, who are much better than what the film calls for.

Pitt and Bullock have great chemistry, in the few short times he is in the film, and I found myself astounded that they have somehow never worked together before. Considering they are film stars from the same era I found that quite surprising, and found myself wishing they'd work together again.

The Pitt and Bullock chemistry actually kind of takes away the chemistry from Tatum and Bullock, thought I have to say they do have chemistry also, just not as much as she does with Pitt. Some parts of the film also just were not really that funny, and I could have done without them.

28 May 2022,One of the best Adventures,"This movie is the rebirth of cinema. Because it is not only a revival of the genre, but also a new kind of filmmaking based on its classic components. Basically, I think the big problem for great filmmakers is that they don't watch movies correctly!!!!, before they can start making their own propagandas, before they can make an alien, they can make a Terminator, they can make an avatar, or they can make a Lord of the Rings. Watch the movie of this kind ,Sit Bored 625 times (calculated number according to the main time of this movie). See this masterpiece 625 times and do not be proud. Next, if you go to build a terminator and do not have a billion-dollar audience. ......It is not possible at all. This film should be seen 625 times by any filmmaker, anyone interested in cinema in this field. In my opinion, watching this film 625 times is obligatory for any filmmaker and filmwatcher in this genre (or a film of this power).

13 June 2022,Didn't laugh one time,"Update: I did finish watching this movie. Still hadn't laughed once-not even on the inside. Unless you pay me a decent amount of money, I have no desire to ever watch this movie again.

This movie tries too hard to be funny. I was looking forward to seeing it.

I subscribed to Paramount+ so my kids could see Sonic 2 and was excited that this movie was included. I am halfway through it and have no desire to see anymore. Not one scene is funny-they are clearly trying too hard. So disappointed. Don't even bother wasting your time...or do and you will agree.

Brad Pitt did bring something entertaining, but still not enough to bring any laughs.

31 May 2022,Weak cheesy humor,"I had high hopes for this as Romancing the Stone has always been one of my favorite movies, and it looked similar. But this was not even close. The actors were supposed to be in peril, but they break out with these cheesey one-liners of 12- year old humor. Very ""dumbed down"". Daniel Radcliffe did a good job and played his part straight.

21 May 2022,Amazing,"So much fun! Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum were perfect together. Basically a silly Indiana Jones movie. I have no idea what's up with the low reviews as I really enjoyed this movie. Fun for the family too, not overly sexual.

31 May 2022,Almost watchable,"Beautiful scenary, good visual effects, great plastic surgeon, maybe too good, Sandra Bullock looks like middle age Barby.. great, and ridiculous.

Considering all garbage that Hollywood produced lately, this movie is almost watchable.

16 July 2022,Ad nauseum,"OMG this is a dreadful movie. Without the Brad Pitt cameo it would have been zero stars.

Apart from the fact that it has been done many times before, and never as badly, this has an illogical, cliché-ridden script, poor direction and C grade acting from the leads. And, once again, gratuitous male nudity. Simply sad.

4 June 2022,Charming - with charismatic leads,"Like most folks, I barely gave THE LOST CITY any notice when it came and went in movie theaters earlier in 2022. This Sandra Bullock/Channing Tatum vehicle looked derivative from earlier films (most notably 1984's ROMANCING THE STONE with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner) and it blew in and out of theaters with hardly a notice. But...sitting on an airplane...I ran across this flick and thought I'd give it a go.

And...I'm glad I did! For THE LOST CITY is a fun, charming film with 2 charismatic lead actors that you will want to go on this adventure with.

Written by Oren Uziel, Dana Fox and Adam Nee and Directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, THE LOST CITY tells the tale of Romance Novel Writer Loretta Sage (Bullock) who gets caught up in a treasure hunt when a crazed Mega-Millionaire (played with a spry twinkle in his eye by Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe) kidnaps Loretta for she had written something in her latest novel that he thinks is a clue to find the titular LOST CITY. Coming to her rescue? Her clue-less Fabio-like Cover Model (played with charming density by Channing Tatum). What could possibly go wrong?

With that sort of premise, the rest of the story is fairly predictable and pedestrian, so the weight of the entertainment value of this film falls squarely on the shoulders of the charm, charisma and chemistry of the 2 leads - and the Direction of the Nee's.

And...I'm surprised (and happy) to state that these all come through with flying colors making THE LOST CITY a pretty enjoyable romp.

Let's start with Bullock and Tatum. They are really looking like they are enjoying themselves - and each other. Bullock is no stranger to playing emotionally repressed intellectuals and Tatum is no stranger to playing dumb lugs...and they both embrace these stereotypes and had fun brining these two to life. Add to this the aforementioned performance of Radcliffe as the comedic villain and an extended cameo from a very recognizable ""A-List"" performer - and the charm and charisma meter in this film is off the hook.

The Nees, then, play to the strengths of these performers and move the film quickly from set piece to set piece, wisely only slowing down the action to let these performers play. The Directors show a light touch to this piece - and the audience is rewarded by this.

Not the type of movie that will cause focus groups to sit around and discuss it after, but if you are looking for a fun romp, summer action/comedy flick to sit on the couch some summer afternoon/evening with a bowl of popcorn and your favorite beverage, look no further than THE LOST CITY.

Letter Grade: A-

8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8
29 March 2022,Not bad but could have been better,"About 15 of our singles group went to see this. There are some laughs. But quite frankly the script was lacking. Impressive special effects for example the island looks quite real and the volcano also. It has some funny moments. But overall I wanted the action the pickup. Perhaps I expected more of an expiration an adventure movie and it just didn't happen.

11 May 2022,Its a Brad Pitt(y) he didn't stay longer...,"Nice locations, a bit Indy here and there, Sandy does her magic very mainstream, Best bit of the movie was Brad's part - just awesome, I just wish he could stayed and played Tatum's role.

Radcliff delivered a solid performance. Also a shoutout to Héctor Aníbal who played ""Rafi""

is he the love-child of Denzel Washington + Mark Wahlberg ?

Only minor complaint would be the villan didn't get enough screentime which is unfortunate because Daniel was great in this.

Loved all of the cast. Would recommend the watch!

19 May 2022,I was only checking it out to see if it was worth watching,"The plan was to watch a little of the movie to see if it was worth watching later. After 20 minutes, I was hooked and stayed up until after 3 AM. Sandra Bullock makes it look so easy and the interaction between her and Channing Tatum is the most fun I've had in a very long time.

I laughed so hard, I nearly wet my pants.

15 January 2023,Lost the plot,"There are over one thousand reviews, so no-one will read this, which is a pity because I really want people to know how insultingly bad is this movie.

I don't mind light-hearted fluff movies. Tune out. Get those Beta waves humming. Sleep soundly.

I don't know the motivations of the decision-makers who green light such drivel. Tax purposes perhaps? And surely the actors are experienced enough to know poor writing and bad plots... why did they agree to participate? It's not location because mostly it was shot in a studio, and a badly designed one at that.

Elsewhere in these reviews it was suggested it's a throwback to yesteryear. Hope and Crosby road movies? Zany adventures? Whatever, it fails to the point of insulting the viewers.",1
26 March 2022,A Lot of Fun,"It is a ridiculous, upbeat, laugh out loud romantic comedy. If you go in wanting to have a good time, you will. If you are expecting something believable at all, you will be sorely disappointed but if you have seen a single trailer or even a movie poster, you shouldnt have those expectations. I love the way Sandra Bullock makes ordinary situations relatably funny, like high stools. They are impossible to get on without looking stupid. Channing Tattum does a great job at trying to be the charming hero. Some of his lines are hiliarious and if you arent paying attention you will miss them entirely. So sit back and just enjoy the comedy for what it is meant to be.

15 May 2022,Ridiculous Sexualization of Men,"Who would pay to go watch this in theaters? Good thing I waited and watched it for free with my subscription. I knew it was a foolish movie since the preview, but, it's not only foolish, it's incredibly dumb. Too many dumb movies out there already, we didn't need another one. And the butt scene was so ridiculous, as always using sex appeal to attract dumb people. Repetitive silly plot with horrible costume design, it's just a ridiculous movie.

3 February 2023,Silly? Yes! Fun? Yes!,"I gave this an 8 because the imdb rating needed a boost. I always check a rating before I watch a movie and almost didn't bother with this one. It IS a silly movie. And it IS fun and enjoyable! Channing Tatum's comedic moves were a highlight for me. Especially in the scenes with Brad Pitt. I actually rewound and watched those scenes over again. I'm a huge fan of Sandra Bullock and like that she chooses both serious and silly films. If you want a light, fun romp of a movie, then I say this fits the bill. It moves along nicely and the scenery is also quite spectacular. Special mention also to Da Vine Joy Randolph and Oscar Nunez.

18 January 2023,Not Indiana Jones or even close,"With such high profile cast members, I thought this would be a good watch but I was disappointed. I found the acting weak, especially from Tatum. I didn't warm to his character, despite his heroics. In all I found it a very bland, forgettable film.

Daniel Radcliffe played a major part of the story but he wasn't on screen that much. Perhaps that was part of the problem - we're too used to seeing him in the lead role. Sandra Bullock came across as a stronger character and I wish I could walk in her ""mountain trekking"" boots!

The dialogue was hard to follow at times and I didn't understand some of it. I wouldn't recommend it to adults but perhaps young teenagers may like this film as it has a bit of slapstick action, mild violence and some mild peril.

Not to disrespect the actors as they've all previously played great roles but I won't recommend this film or will watch it again.",3
26 March 2022,HILARIOUS! Non stop laughter,"I haven't laughed this much seeing a movie in a long time. Sandra and Channing are so great together. It was so much fun to watch, I'm planning on going again soon. My whole family enjoyed it. This is one of my favorites now.

21 May 2022,Mummies are Human,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

26 March 2022,So Funny.,"The title says it all, this was really funny. Better than Sandra and Ryan in The Proposal (although I may be the only person who likes that movie). Thanks to this movie I have decided that under the right circumstances, Channing is funnier than Ryan Renyolds. Sandra and Channing are great together. Daniel was a really excellent bad guy as well. This was a really fun movie and it was consistently so throughout the entire thing. The whole theatre was laughing and the best part is they saved the funnier bits for the movie and didn't waste it on the trailers like most movies do.

Still not sure who does a better hair flip though- Channing or Brad?!

6 February 2023,Funny...,"""The Lost City"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch a romance novelist being kidnapped while her cover model tries to save her. They both find themselves into a jungle adventure and they have to try to work as a team if they want to survive.

I found this movie very funny and the plot was simple but also interesting enough for this kind of movie. The interpretations of both Sandra Bullock who played as Loretta Sage and Channing Tatum who played as Alan were hilarious and very good. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Brad Pitt's who played as Jack Trainer. Lastly, I have to say that ""The Lost City"" is a nice comedy movie to spend your time with and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure it will make you laugh and have a great time.

15 October 2022,Harmless fun movie to watch on an airplane flight,"I watched this yesterday on a flight from Madrid to Toronto. And of all the movies I watched this was the one I enjoyed the most. Fun and funny. Yes, we've seen this kind of thing before but I don't care.

What did surprise me was Channing Tatum playing someone against type and boy was he good. All I could think of was him on Bear Grylls' National Geographic show where he took part in every rock climbing/diving/outdoor adventure Bear threw at him with gusto and relish. And aplomb! Channing was excited about it all, not even remotely scared like most of Bear's other guests. So seeing him play someone so inept and inexperienced at outdoor adventure was very funny.

And the leech scene - so good to see a man being naked in a movie for once and not the woman.

3 April 2022,Uncharted - meets Artemis Fowl - meets Eat Pray Love,"* * * ...Overall #TheLostCity gives Uncharted - meets Artemis Fowl - meets Eat, Pray, Love.

The film is cute and adventurous, but it's a pretty safe film that I don't see as something worthy of spending a theater coin on in my opinion, nor rushing to see.

Highlight: First, Daniel Radcliffe was fun to watch as a villain. I also just love how effortless Sandra Bullock's comedic delivery is in this film. Additionally, the film moves quite well to keep up engagement.

Could've Been Better: Though I enjoyed Bullock's delivery, I think more thought could've been had regarding her character-her as a writer was ""aight,"" but I personally feel it wasn't the best character choice for her. I think her as an uppity, entitled actress or the book model with Tatum as the writer could've been interesting (and the story of course being focused on the book model in that context).

And speaking of Tatum, his character also needed a little more time at the brainstorming table. I grew to adore him as the film progressed, but I wasn't 100% sold on him in the beginning.",9
29 May 2022,one of the worst scripts EVER,"Take a talented group of actors - throw some serious $$ at them - hire a terrible script-writer and use a terrible director - and this movie will steal 2 hours of your life that you can NEVER get back!

12 May 2022,Cute movie,"This is a modern version of movies like Romancing The Stone. Movies they just don't make any more. Too bad, because movies like that are fun. And this movie is no exception.

The script is silly with a number of genuine laughs. I couldn't spoil the plot if I wanted to because I'm not entirely sure what it was. It's entirely incidental.

Is Sandra Bullock aging in reverse? She actually looks younger. Channing Tatum is charming as usual and does a great job acting awkward.

Eight stars for light entertainment with no socio-political lectures detracting from the fun.

18 May 2022,A middle-of-the road rom-com actioner! [+52%],"On the one hand, The Lost City is too formulaic to really mean much. On the other, it also isn't difficult to just sit back and go along this predictable ride of action-sprinkled romance elevated by a few funny instances. Tatum and Bullock are fun to watch as a couple, even though this film doesn't make them do anything they already haven't. Pitt's cameo was good fun; I wish we had more of him in The Lost City. Oh, and there's Dan Radcliffe, who seems to be totally enjoying his baddie act!

27 August 2022,Can you say Romancing the Stone & Jewel of the Nile?,"There are so many components to this movie that seem to be gleaned from other movies, mainly those listed in this review title along with Raiders, Tomb Raider, and The Proposal (The Proposal you ask?? Well, I can't unsee Oscar Nunez as that show's strip dancer who plays a guide/pilot in this show). Sandra Bullock is suited for the role she plays; but having an evil Harry Potter harass her just does not work. I thought I was watching John Cena as Sandra's co-star only to be told it was Tatum Channing. Either way, the two clicked. It's a fun romantic romp, but don't watch it with someone who is overly critical of what is and isn't possible when it comes to the make up of live volcanoes.

Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

27 November 2022,Another treasure hunt,"The simple story about a writer and a male model getting involved in an exotic adventure didn't have many surprises if you saw other adventure comedies before. It feels a bit like an episode from ""Relic Hunter"" with 100 times the budget, but not necessarily better ideas. The count of funny scenes against unfunny scenes is at best 50/50. The movie was okay to watch once but doesn't shout for repeated viewings.

The actors are mostly good. Sandra Bullock is slightly older than me and still doing action movies in a tight suit - hats off to her. Channing Tatum does not have a good chemistry with her. Daniel Radcliffe was better than I expected, a good parody of a Bond villain with big money and gadgets. Da'Vine Joy Randolph as the writer's agent, never giving up the search for her, was a good choice as well. Brad Pitt steals the show in the (too) few scenes he's in.

Terrible script, poor acting by those desperate to hold on to past successes.

30 May 2022,This movie should never exist.,"Painful story, tried to be funny but ends up being forced and ridiculous. This is the way to destroy respect for famous actors. I wonder whom can give more than 1 star to this movie. Just waste of time expecting when it could stop being forced and unnatural funny situations, not worth a minute to watch.

25 April 2022,Let's go on a funny adventure with a comedy duo made for it!,"For an original comedy adventure, it sure feels like a Romancing the Stone remix! A recluse writer takes her adventures into the real world after being kidnapped by Harry Radcliffe himself Daniel Radcliffe/Harry Potter)! There's even a musical sound track that sounds suspiciously familiar to the Harry Potterverse!

The interesting role reversal works fabulously, though the ""damsel in distress"" is given a great retribution, being a male and all! The layered characters enhance their roles and lift the premise of the film, slightly.

A nice change for Radcliffe, though not for Hollywood-bad guys-with-foreign-accents (and, Yes, British is foreign for Yanks!). The paper thin plot is given fluff with the great comedic timing of the leads. Pitt's cameo beats his Deadpool one by a fraction!

A nice change of pace for many of the stars, and a welcome breath of fresh, island air for viewers! A no-brainer worth the view!",7

26 March 2022,A Hidden Gem,"Yes, this movie falls victim to some of the tropes of the standard rom-com, but it doesn't matter because the entire subtext of the film is making fun of those tropes. What's more, it's funny as heck, and Bullock and Tatum have real chemistry. The scene where they dance together was, in a way, more erotic than any dance Tatum did in ""Magic Mike!""

25 August 2022,"""I'm Certified CPR, I'm Certified CrossFit, I Have Snacks.""","It would be easy to say that The Lost City is exactly what one would expect, but it's more accurate to say that it's exactly what one would expect minus a little of everything. The film is conceived as a remake/rip-off of Romancing the Stone but the people in charge never bothered to develop the script past this first conceit.

The film is extraordinarily lazy and rehashed, checking off narrative boxes and filmed in the obligatorily flat, unconvincing monotone of contemporary cinema. It's a stunning return for sentimental, schmaltzy romcoms after the release Marry Me just a month ago. Is it possible the dam is just beginning to burst? Is it possible some of them will be funny?

The film follows romance novelist Loretta Sage as she's kidnapped and taken to a remote island by billionaire Abigail Fairfax, who seeks a magnificent ancient treasure. Hot on their trail is Sage's cover model Alan, out to prove he's more than just a pretty face. Along the way, the two learn about the peril and pleasures of love, professional gratification, and self-esteem.

This film is bland. Everything is weirdly sterilized and glossy, starting with the script. The above bit about not developing the script past the initial premise was not a joke. There are several promising moments in The Lost City which begin to be setup but are immediately abandoned halfway through. The only consistent source of attempted humor is the glibness of the cast, who are uniformly aloof. The only bold choice The Lost City makes is bringing a rough draft into production.

The direction is equally lazy and bare. Most of the visual landscape is flat and uninteresting, despite the film being shot almost entirely on location in the Dominican Republic. Why directors Aaron and Adam Nee decided to aim for a synthesized, glamorous veneer for a deadly jungle is anyone's guess. Smart money's on studio mandates of course, but whatever the case, the decision doesn't work. Sage and Alan's trek through the jungle looks like a comfortable camping trip, and hardly any of the cast seem to be physically exerting in the slightest. For all its faults, Romancing the Stone didn't completely ignore the ""action"" in action/romcom.

The cast can't come close to saving the material, but at least it looks like they're having fun. Every performer is nestled deep within their comfort zone: Sandra Bullock as a frustrated but fierce author trying to turn the tables on her captor, Channing Tatum as a meatheaded lunk trying to prove himself as a capable, responsible adult, Brad Pitt as a hunky but enigmatic savior, Daniel Radcliffe as a psychopathic but blandly polite spoiled punk, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph as a sassy, exasperated editor. They all play into the glib, spiceless material.

There's just not much to anything here. The action is lifeless and obligatory, the structure is hopelessly rote, and the few jokes consistently fall flat. The Lost City is as shallow as a kiddie pool, crassly recycling tropes and characters from other, better films and hoping no one's the wiser. It's weird to even see this type of movie in the theater. Non-vulgar romcoms have been dead for the better part of a decade, so one would think Nees and company would at least put a little effort into the resurgence. One would be wrong. See it if it's your chosen genre, but don't expect anything fresh or innovative; The Lost City picks up right where Anna Faris and Katherine Heigl left off. Abysmal.",3

Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

21 May 2022,"You'd be better off watching ""Romancing The Stone""","The opening scene reminded me of ""Romancing The Stone"" with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas, and as such, I couldn't help but compare ""City"" to ""Stone"" although this film. My verdict is that ""Romancing The Stone"" is funnier, better acted, and a just all-around better movie.

8 January 2023,"Fun, enjoyable movie!","Ok, so of course it's not academy award material! But these reviews are why nobody risks making comedy flicks anymore. If you go into it expecting a masterpiece, than yes, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you are just looking for some laughs and a good time?? The Lost City does not disappoint! Great humor, great cast, great acting, absolute beautiful scenes at times, and an interesting (however cliche that it may be) premise to boot. A film that keeps you wanting more. The character development started out strong and falters a little bit on the second half. They could have developed the chemistry a little more, but it was solid and enjoyable. This film deserves a high rating to make up for the haters. This definitely deserves higher than a 6.1 on IMDB and is much better than the typical cheesy rom-coms they come out with these days. Let's stop being so harsh and critical of comedy movies! They are not SUPPOSED to be anything of epic proportions but just a couple hours of fun and giggles. Why does everything have to be so serious and deep? We are a culture to worried about offending people.

14 August 2022,Just watch the trailer and save 2 hours of your life,"Recap: Four very good actors. One script apparently written by a focus group. A bundle of unfunny jokes. One not-so-bright and chronically shirtless Tatum. A bit of woke nonsense, a Brad Pitt appearance and gratuitous buttcheeks.

Not sure who this movie is made for. Possibly women, or who ever likes seeing Tatum's shirt fall off every 2 minutes. Although, that might also be a way to distract from the lack of jokes. The dialogue tries to show the characters' vulnerable and romantic sides, but I have a hard time believing even the biggest romantic would have any emotional reaction to their verbal and physical exchanges, other than pure cringe.

Brad Pitt is good in his short appearance, and there are definitely funny moments in the movie.

Unfortunately, they all appear in the trailer.

It's not a disaster, it's just not good.

I suggest Romancing the Stone, or any of the classic Indiana Jones movies if you're into romantic adventure/archeology flicks.

Or ""Spy"" with Melissa McCarthy if you feel like a good laugh.",3

7 July 2023,A good film to watch if you want something not especially deep but fun.,"My summary might sound pejorative, but I am not saying anything negative when I say that ""The Lost City"" is a good film to watch if you just want something not particularly deep but fun. It fits the bill as a good date movie as well.

Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a successful romance writer whose best days are behind her. Following her husband's death, she's been in a five year funk and she has become, essentially, a hermit. However, her newest book is about to debut and her publicist wants her to attend a readers' convention...and she unexpectedly gets sucked into a plot by an evil man (Daniel Radcliff). He kidnaps her and two men (Brad Pitt and Channing Tatum) come to her rescue. What's next? See the film.

The film is fun...period. It's enjoyable and undemanding. My only complaints are that the big finale seems to happen too easily and Brad Pitt's character's final scene didn't make any sense at all. Still, it's engaging and worth seeing.",7
30 April 2022,Cute Film,"With all the stress from work and the crazy out in the world this movie was a nice breath of fresh air. Besides the fact that I love all of the cast it was fun and entertaining. Me and my son laughed and enjoyed the movie. Glad we went and saw it tonight.

8 November 2022,You can do worse,"A lightweight romantic comedy adventure romp with an exotic setting, THE LOST CITY is essentially an exercise in box-ticking but it does succeed in what it does, at least to a degree. It's a little more fun than UNCHARTED but it doesn't have very interesting action sequences and Sandra Bullock simply isn't very good as the lead, but then I've always thought that. The surprise here is Channing Tatum who is actually pretty funny as the male bimbo, although the scene stealer is Brad Pitt who has far too little screen time. Daniel Radcliffe I didn't really enjoy all that much and the second half does drag, but you can do worse.

13 May 2022,Silly and fun,"Keeping it short. Bullock has lost the plot in recent years (including in real life). This is a somewhat return to form. Tatum was reasonable as the leading man. Pitt was solid. Radcliffe was ok but over the top.

The story is predictable, however, if you're in the mood for lightheartedness, there are some chuckles to be had.

Bullock kept her gender politics to a minimum but had to have her one moment. Fairly small whinge about the patricarchy.

17 April 2022,A very likeable movie,"While not perfect by any stretch, The Lost City manages to put a dedcent comedy, a decent rom-com, and a decent adventure film all into one sleek 90-minute package.

Probably not going to be anyones favorite film, but feels like a prime contendor for ""oh yea- that was a really fun movie, we should watch it"" status in 3-4 years.

Everyone commits to their bit and play off of each other well. Even if Channing's character kind of silently morphs over the course of the story in a way that feels less like character growth and more like the writers favored the plot over the character, but that's a minor complaint.

Overall, strong movie that manages to add up to more than the sum of it's parts.

8 December 2022,Sweeter After Difficulty? Nah,"I had high hopes for this film conjuring memorable images of the successful Indiana Jones movies. Boy, was I wrong. It tries to be both a funny movie and an action movie. It doesn't do well in both departments.

Thanks to Brad Pitt for the well-executed action sequences and the dry humor. But Da'Vine Joy Randolph tries to be hilarious but she comes off as campy bordering on inane. The same could be said of Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum's dialogue.

The word that Loretta Page (Bullock's character) uses is schlock. I hate to think of the movie in that way but maybe it is.

It's a regrettable waste of well-known and talented actors. I would like to say ""sweeter after difficulty"" but the movie is not this.

The saving factor is the beautiful island scenery. It is probably an island in the Atlantic perhaps somewhere off the coast of Ecuador. Could it be Isla de la Plata or Isla Lobos de Terra?",5

19 July 2022,Not a bad watch,"Feels weird watching a jungle adventure movie without Dwayne Johnson in it. Anyway, I must say I was sleepy heading into this so I may not have watched it in the best of moods. So since the only other jungle adventure film released around the same time was Uncharted I'm going to compare them and say this was slightly better but I don't it was great. Brad Pitt was probably the best thing that happened but his character only showed up for a few minutes during the movie (and post credit) so that's a little missed opportunity. Once again it's riddled with clichés but after so many films already made in the genre I guess it's hard to find something original that someone hasn't already thought about. There's the adventure side of it and the romance side of it, both were not so great, you got the typical well read, smarter character in Sandra bullock then Channing Tatum playing the good looking guy that everyone assumes is only as smart as bait but actually has more to him; and then you have the typical adventurer who's kidnapped by a rich evil man who's using her to uncover the treasure's location but is eventually saved. Both the adventure and romcom side of the movie are cliche. There are other elements added to it to give it a more unique feel but none of them deliver enough to make this an above average adventure movie. Most of the jokes didn't land but that could be due to my current drowsy state, still I don't think that changed much. It's worth a watch and something for the whole family but it's nothing special; if you do want a capering adventure film to watch, Jungle Cruise is the only recent one in memory that I enjoyed enough to recommend, that surprised me, this didn't. I am late to the party to watch The Cost City and thought I was missing out on something good and it turns out I wasn't really.",5
26 March 2022,Back on the Big Screen,"I've mentioned before I'm not a big ""chick flick"" rom com kinda gal by nature. In terms of romance novels, pfft even less so (the few I've read I've done so as comedies through and through). However, I am a big Sandra Bullock fan, have been for ages, and couldn't pass up the opportunity to see my girl back up on the big screen where she belongs. Yes, I've enjoyed seeing her tear it up the last few years in various streaming endeavors (personally I don't buy into her whole Netflix is the only reason she still has a career thing) but.. anywho, Bullock + Big Screen = 4evr for me!

Moving on.

In The Lost City (2022) Bullock plays a reclusive, broken-hearted romance novelist that gets kidnaped during a book tour and swept up in a jungle adventure with her cover model Channing Tatum. TLC is part Raiders of the Lost Ark, Romancing the Stone, and Baywatch to name a few all mixed together with an over-the-top sense of self-awareness and a banging soundtrack. Yep, there will be seat dancing.

In short, The Lost City is good stupid fun.

While not as hilarious as The Proposal or endearing as While You Were Sleeping, The Lost City is funny, sweet, and charming in its own right. I snickered, giggled, and laughed-out-loud start to finish. Thoroughly enjoyed the characters, Tatum's plays the clueless but loveable idiot brilliantly. Daniel Radcliffe's unhinged, billionaire baddie is pure over-the-top fun. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's put upon, stressed out, BFF delights. And then there's Brad Pitt's Jack Trainer. OMG, I can't even with this one. The proverbial cherry on top is of course Bullock's doing what she does best. That special blend of sweetness, awkwardness, sarcasm, charm, and je ne sais quoi, *chef's kiss*.

The Lost City is a solid, throwback rom-com, action adventure that's comforting and nostalgic in its familiarity, has enough twists and surprises to keep it fresh and engaging, and offers up an entertaining movie experience. Be it at the theater now or watching at home later, The Lost City is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.

As always, your heads up not to bolt at the start of the credits, there's a bonus scene that's sure to bring a smile to your face and tops off the film wonderfully.

The Lost City is a 7.5.",7
27 May 2022,Garbage Adventure,"Seriously.. Do you even call that an adventure? We have seen way better jungle adventure movies in the 90s.

The only part good about this movie was Brad Pitt. Sandra Bullock was below par with her over acting.

23 June 2022,We Need Something New ...,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip.

2 April 2022,Entertaining because of Bullock and Tatum. But forgettable.,"When I saw the trailer for this film I knew what it would be. My expectations were that it would be funny and feather light but it is usually the type of film that Sandra Bullock specializes in. And with that said it met those expectations. I was entertained and enjoyed it but it is so thin that I pretty much forgot it minutes after it ended. Chanum Tatum has also created a self-depracating persona which is very funny. The story if you want to call it that is a mash up of Romancing The Stone, Indiana Jones and every other Sandra Bullock romantic comedy before it. Romance novelist is kidnapped by a rich guy who wants to find a priceless object that he thinks she could help him find. Period. That's it. In between there is the typical banter, some of funny between the romantic leads. The film is self aware how ridiculous it is and just let's the leads charm carry the film

Entertaining but forgettable.

27 January 2023,A Solid Adventure,"""The Lost City"" is an interesting take on the classic treasure hunting story, as it presents itself as more of a freewheeling jaunt than a suspense-driven tomb crawler. While some moments of expected peril still persist, the film as a whole goes out of its way to assume a more subdued approach that fits with the characters and narrative.

The plot overall is concise and imaginative, though the climactic moments could have been stronger had a more serious outlook been utilized: an example of this would be the direction that was taken for the main antagonist. While their repercussions are negligible and vague, a more fitting demise that could have stemmed from their blind arrogance and drive for notoriety would have been more memorable.

The humor throughout the film acts as a good counterweight for the somber tones introduced off and on in the main character's arch, and it lands decently overall. Minus a few gratuitous moments that could have been cut, most of the comedic output meshes well with the action and storyline.

One point of dissonance that unfortunately cropped up several times involved the poor build up and execution of moments dealing with the fate of a reoccurring side character. Twice, when two different supporting characters seemingly met their end, the story presented the scenes so abruptly that they felt jarring in contrast to what came before and after - A few wisecracks one moment and a visceral gunshot immediately after - While both of these scenes could have stood out positively and led to satisfying conclusions, they ultimately felt bizarly rushed.

In summery, ""The Lost City"" mostly achieves what it sets out to accomplish. It's a lighthearted adventure that stumbles at times, but holds its viewer's focus through clever plot, fun characters, and a heartwarming through-line of timeless love. While not the shiniest of cinematic gems, it remains a solid experience for anyone looking for a new adventure.",6
3 April 2022,Just plain Lost!,"I was reading a review of Uncharted where someone said how bad it was and how Lost City was a much better film. Sorry. Uncharted may have been a C-, but this movies is a complete F. It's not funny, suspenseful or entertaining.

The movie was downright boring and I am going to assume the beautiful people are the only thing anyone loved about this movie. Sandar B may be pushing 60, but there is no doubt she has more beauty than 99.9 percent of women on the planet. Channing Tatum acts like an ignorant idiot so often that I'm starting to believe he is actually being himself and Harry Potter should sit on his own city of gold because the sorting hat should have told him that he'll never appear in another successful film with a hat or wand.

There is no redemption for the plot, the characters and again, unless eye candy is your bag, you are going to be disappointed. Worst movie I have seen in some time.

Sandy, Channing, Da'Vine, Daniel and the rest of the cast and crew, a big thank you from a bunch of us!

It's been a while since my friends and I had such a good time in a movie theatre, the entire audience laughed to tears more than once.

Because of the trailer I though that The Lost City would be walking a fine line of being a rip-off of Romancing the stone but in a way it turned out to be an homage to the entire rom-com genre. Wouldn't mind a sequel.

More than a solid 8/10.

11 June 2022,Great villains make great movies,"Why so many really low ratings? Did this politically offend someone? Seems like a good silly comedy to me!

Plenty of good things about it. Lots said about that so I won't re-hash comedy, chemistry, etc. Not everything is perfect, a few secondary characters could have been fleshed out better, have long periods in between checking in.

But most of all, Daniel Radcliffe is perfect. I mean as an actor sure, but the character especially. Too many movies don't have a villain, and too many comedies make us rely on a serious villain with maybe one funny characteristic. Here, he's legit bad and... also ridiculous is exactly the same way everyone else is. He's perfect, so serves as a foil, and a threat, for the whole film.

28 March 2022,Disturbing,"It was raining, everything told us not to go, but we still went to see the movie. Once we arrived, the theater was closed due to power outage. We should have turned home, but decided to give it a chance and drove to another theater. At the parking lot I realized that we forgot to leave our beach chairs at home and my husband almost drove back, but I convinced him that nobody will break our windows. We should have just went home at this point. But no..we ended up staying and watching a movie. There were 4 sketchballs at the theater that really looked like they were up to no good. One of them whistled at me while starring at my backpack. We should have turned back and went home. At the theater a group of basic girls were laughing at each of Pitt's move. Actually no, they were laughing at any scene that supposed to be funny according to the screen writes. I was even wondering if they placed those girls in the audience just to show others how you should behave while watching a masterpiece. Anyways, the movie wasn't funny, not entertaining. However, there's one positive thing I learned today: if the universe clearly tells you not to do something I really should listen next time.",4
12 August 2022,"Underrated Movie That Includes Invaluable Unconditional Love, Authenticity, Hilarious Scenes & Profound Wisdom","I read that this will be Sandra Bullock's last movie, which to me is a Divine Dichotomy of both sad news and great news.

It's sad because I've been fully enJOYing movies that she stars in, since they're usually great combo package deals of integrated Mind/Heart stories, that include various, interesting aspects that are highly beneficial for humanity and beyond.

However COMMA it's great news that she's leaving the energizer bunny on CRACK, SUPER BUSY Hollywood lifestyle, since she (and like others) deserve a more relaxing, free-spirited, peaceful, and joyful life.

She (and like others) has done MORE THAN ENOUGH to gift humanity with soul-igniting, deeply heartfelt, encouraging, uplifting, empowering, inspiring, and (individual and Collective) Consciousness expanding entertainment.

I trust that Sandra (and like others) is becoming more awake (as Soul & Spirit within), is becoming more aware, and is tuning into unconditionally loving more and more ultimately NEUTRAL aspects of her WHOLE self (physical self)/Self (Divine Self); hence, why she has chosen to gift herself much more FREEDOM.

Thank you Sandra, Tatum, and the rest of the team for co-creating a memorable movie.

Continue SHINING BRIGHT no matter: what neutral aspects you choose to freely Be at any given moment, where you are and what you do.

And always REMEMBER that it's your AUTHENTIC, Full Presence-your WHOLE self/Self, FEELING state/core vibrational frequency-that matters most.

EnJOY many present and pleasant moments of now. 😘💖💓💕",10

A great attempt at a Romancing The Stone type movie, this is one of the best comedies of the year so far. A great cameo from Brad Pitt helps but it is the chemistry between Bullock & Tatum that decides whether the movie lives or dies and it delivers on all fronts. Special mention to Da'Vine Joy Randolph who is wonderful as Sandra Bullock's agent.

17 November 2022,Cute and Entertaining,"This was a silly, cute movie that I had really no expectations when starting it. It entertained me and made me giggle from time to time. Sandra is adorable as always, maybe a little too skinny in this movie IMO. Channing played the dingy hot guy, which could have had a bit more depth tbh. There's been a lot of dumbing men down in movies lately and I am not a fan, but this is a silly movie and not meant to be a drama. Brad Pitt did really good, but was only in the movie for 2 seconds. The storyline was pretty rushed but the set looked beautiful. Daniel Radcliffe played the villain well, they didn't write him too well, but again this is meant to be a silly movie. Overall I watched it once and could maybe watch it again when bored at work.

2 April 2022,Way funnier then I thought it would be.,"I knew it was supposed to be a comedy. And nowadays comedies are really a hit or a miss. But this one didn't take itself too seriously and they just had fun with it. Fun movie! Loved the casting! PS, stay through the credits for a bit.

20 April 2022,The Lost City,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

Hilarious, shocking, and romantic. I would love to see the entire cast in another film as different characters. Awesome Summer movie. 🍿

10 May 2022,The Lost City,"Successful and bored adventure writer Bullock is kidnapped by bad guy Radcliffe to help him find a hidden treasure within the legendary ancient city, he has just found. Her book cover model, Tatum, who has adopted his sexy, tough guy character rather too eagerly goes in search of her.

Old fashioned, undemanding adventure comedy fun with very little to dislike. Bullock and Tatum have good chemistry, Radcliffe is terrific as the Bond like villain, Brad Pitt has a fun cameo, the jokes work and the action sequences are strong. I could have lived without the current American comedic penchant for leads to waffle very fast over the top of each other about complete rubbish, but this didn't distract from an otherwise fun and quite charming movie.

22 August 2022,Romancing the stone?,"Absolutely not. Just a cheap ripoff. Radcliffe plays a solid villain, and there were some fun moments early in the film, but mostly this was a sad retelling of a fun film, lacking originality or imagination. You'd think these actors were politicians the way they sell themselves for money they certainly don't need, without thought given to art or creativity.

3 October 2022,Original film,"Beg you, throw away any adventure or animation movie you have seen and watch this movie with a new perspective, then you will realize that it is a masterpiece. I think that these two directors are trying to make jokes that sometimes become repetitive. Using it may damage the effect. I saw a movie. It was a bit of fun and very engaging for me. Although the film is at a lower level of special effects compared to films with big budgets, it uses visual effects to the highest extent. Very elegantly, for example, the part that shows the waterfall... we feel like we are seeing and feeling the waterfall up close. This movie has a script and this is important. Something that we don't see in many movies like this. I can only say that it's a good and accurate movie, it's exciting.

A very beautiful, artistic and magnificent film at the same time simple and unpretentious. This movie entertains you with cinema and teaches you the meaning of cinema without using technological and intellectual tricks. Everything in the movie becomes a character, even the colors, even the clothes. Everything I can say about this movie is still not enough. Although the design of the film is minimalistic, it is very beautiful. It was even better than beauty and the beast

I haven't seen a movie in a long time that I was so directly affected by it.",10
14 June 2022,The lost plot,"Just because there is an all star cast doesn't give it a 10 full star rating. The film is dull from the get go. The humor was dry. Most audiences might get lost watching the lost city. They might have trouble finding a plot or finding their way out of the lost city or lost film itself in this case.

6 October 2022,Lovely,"Ignore the serious critics. Took me out of myself for a couple of hours. * genuine laugh out loud moments throughout * gratuitous Channing Tatum torso and buttock close-ups * plenty of action in a stunning jungle location * Sandra looking amazing for her age (and retaining flawless full-make up through rivers, caves, mountains and baths) and * a Brad Pitt tough guy/hero cameo.

What's not to like?

Same feelgood vibes as a good Indiana Jones on Boxing Day with the family.

For those whom like to dis this movie, get over it. It is classic romance novel! It has humour, action, adventure and fun. I love this movie. It was everything I was expecting from a romance novel point of view. Sorry there wasn't enough blowing up of things.. lol.

13 January 2023,4 Writers For This?!,"Seemed to be going for the broadest audience possible, like a movie created by artificial intelligence; a bit of comedy, a bit of action, a bit of adventure, a bit of romance but not particularly successful at any of it. Anyone who has rated this movie highly has incredibly limited expectations for a move. Will hopefully disappear without a trace within a couple of years.

Incredibly implausible premise, I wouldn't even call it entertaining. I'm sure you are supposed to just go along for the ride but there's surprisingly little happening for a 2 hour movie.

Channing Tatum's manchild schtick was incredibly irritating. Sandra Bullock tries to make the most of her character but succumbs to attempts at physical comedy.

It would be great if Hollywood made an effort in future but I'm sure they won't given all the money this movie made.",2
26 April 2022,Very silly movie...loved it,"So am posting a review of this movie that I heard is so bad its good. This is true!!

This movie is hilarious 😂 Everyone in this movie is an idiot.

Its kind of a parody of rom coms and Indiana Jones type movies.

Harry Potter is the evil rich bad guy...Brad Pitt does a cameo as a hero

And the leads are Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock who are trying to be Indiana Jones and very much are not. They are very much ""cupcakes""

This was great fun to watch. Twas so silly.

27 March 2022,Fun movie,"I expected to fall asleep in this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes movies with lots of star power lack plotlines, but this was Romancing the Stone meets Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was intentionally camp and silly, but I stayed awake throughout and wasn't even tempted to doze off. I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock and Daniel Radcliffe. If you want a fun couple of hours to escape reality, this will hit the spot.

3 August 2022,"fun fluff, often very funny","When I read about this movie it sounded like the wonderful Romancing the Stone so in spite of the iffy reviews I decided that would be worth seeing. And it was!

In the movie Sandra Bullock is a romance novelist mourning the loss of her husband and Channing Tatum is a guy who's become famous as the cover model for her books. After she is kidnapped by the cheerful psychopath Daniel Radcliffe she finds herself searching for treasure on a mysterious Island while Tatum tries to rescue her with the hilarious assistance of an ultimate alpha male Brad Pitt.

Things go wrong and there's a lot of running around.

Pitt, Radcliffe, and Tatum are all excellent but Sandra Bullock shockingly doesn't seem to quite manage the character. She does a good job as a depressed rather angry woman but seems unable to transition into the predictable romantic part. It feels as though she believed, like a lot of us, that she could act a comedy romance in her sleep, decided to try it, and found she couldn't after all.

Still, while not perfect this is tremendous fun and I recommend it if you like light adventure comedies. I almost gave this an 8 and probably would have Bullock had been up to snuff.",7
16 August 2022,Always liked Sandra .....but wasn't so good...,"I expected better...definitely watchable but maybe a different leading man....and a few more funnier scenes.

The plot was VERY similar to Romancing the Stone and we were left a bit disappointed ......

12 May 2022,"Sandra Bullock saves it (And oh, Brad Pitt too)","It's not Sandy's fault really. Her charm is sufficient enough to make the film bearable. The blandness came from its bad writing and intangible direction from the directors. And there's no spark of real romance in Sandy and Channing's characters. Only sibling chemistry. Brad Pitt effortlessly steals the scenes every time he appears.

26 August 2022,It took five writers for this!,"If Romancing the Stone and Raiders of the Lost Ark had not been made, I'm not sure that the writers of this would have come up with a script. I suppose, since some of it is so obvious, there might have been some thought of playing off of those two for fun, but it does not work. I did laugh once early on, though I can't remember why the very next day and there is absolutely no realistic drama, thrills or suspense at any point, if any were intended. Hard to tell. Read here that Ryan Reynolds was sought for the male lead. That was a loss for us, though perhaps a gain for him. To be kind, I'll just say that Tatum displays a great body which seems to be his sole contribution, though also to be kind, the role is terribly written. Bullock also displays, with more (ridiculous) clothing, that she too is in great shape, but she is back in her generic comic mode and if you haven't tired of this schtick yet, perhaps you will like her. She does have comic talent, but she too needs a script that is not embarassing. Brad Pitt makes a cameo and is by far the best thing about this film. The less said about the usually reliable Daniel Radcliffe the better. The ending is positively skin-crawlingly awful.",2
27 September 2022,"It's not a treasure trove of laughs, but it's amusing","The Lost City isn't a treasure trove of laughs, but it kept me amused for the duration of the story. Channing Tatum is enjoyable as the clueless cover model, Alan, and Brad Pitt's role as Jack Trainer is definitely a highlight. However, the normally comical Sandra Bullock felt like a little more restrained in her performance as Loretta Sage, and I wanted a little more from Daniel Radcliffe. The plot of isn't overly original, but there were a few parts that surprised me. Even though this isn't going to have a lasting legacy, The Lost City worth a watch if you're looking for a lighthearted adventure flick.

15 April 2022,"A somewhat funny, cringy mess that misses the mark.","This movie tries to a lot more than it actually is. It's a largely nonsensical mess that has so, so many cringy lines and terrible references to other movies. The cast performs well under what is obviously a strained script and a ludicrous plot. The jokes and one liners are a hit or miss, and most often they're a miss. The Lost City cannot be considered as a particularly good comedy. It is enjoyable, sure. But is it worth the effort of going to the cinema and watching it? Probably not.

Some good sudden incidents that makes you laugh, but there is this attempt to try and blend a classic advernture story with today's twisted city life world that just does not work. Does not have any good mystery to to it. Also too much adult rated scenes. Felt like wasted our time. Better to have watched a rerun of any classic old adventure movie.

So where did this go wrong? There was so much scientific information, as the story of the books was actually real and that is where they lost the audience because there wasn't that much information about this Island. We were only given the information bits and peace's along the way so we can piece it together later on. The cover model should have stayed as a cover model, Like Chris Farley (Tommy Boy) Wishing to be something more than he is couldn't be possible, and only accepting the fact that he is a cover model would have been funnier and acceptable. Instead, they made the scenes very complicated and redundant over his character being something more than a Cover model and more like he has a soul, Then here comes the back story, storytelling which was ""BORING"". I really enjoyed this movie despite my negative comment because, in the end, this is someone's rendition of a work of art and just ""Sh%^ing ""on it is counter-intuitive. Thank you for this art and thank you for this awesome movie.",7
19 March 2023,I loved this even though...,"Some people are not giving it the best review. Why? What is not to love when you have Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum and Brad Pitt involved. It is meant to be silly and off the wall. This is what makes it so perfect. We needed a movie like this to make us laugh. We've come out of a dark and dreary time so we need to lighten up a bit. We don't need movies that make sense or are dramatic by design. We need fun and humor. All of the supporting actors were great and managed to capture the essence of the storyline. I've seen this movie three times now and watch it when I need to have a good laugh.

For those of us that have a sense of humor, we got it!

23 May 2022,Worthy of your time,"If you this kind of movie, you will be in for a treat. It's witty, funny, like all the classics its based on.

That said, I am astonished by the utter lameness of the title. The Lost City? Seriously, who came up with this absolute nonstarter? Do they *want* this movie to fail?!

There are online movie title generators you could use that would provide you with a hundred better options in less than a minute.

24 March 2022,Biggest surprise of the year so far!!!!,"The Lost City was really funny. I was surprised by how consistently entertaining this movie was. Channing Tatum, Sandra Bullock, and Daniel Radcliffe were so much fun.

The story and cheesy moments were so good. Even the action was funny. This movie was such a fun action adventure romcom!!!! Also, Brad Pitt was such a scene stealer. Definitely, highly recommend it!!! I would watch this again. 9/10.

Every time the camera was close the stiffness of her face after too many surgeries is very apparent. You can literally make a drinking game out of the few times she makes facial expressions. I always liked Sandra Bullock, it's sad to see her reduced to this...

5 June 2022,The worst movie we have ever seen,"The plot was ludacris and filled with every cliche possible, even worse than that: they tried to make them seem deep and profound. We were wondering the whole movie if it is a parody and were very disappointed to realize it was not. The characters were completely one dimensional. And why did Brad Pitt exist for 5 minutes? At least Channing Tatum was hot.

27 March 2022,Actually much better than I thought it would be.,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

5 June 2022,Bad pacing makes for an oddly quiet movie considering the genre,"Most of these blockbusters treat their audience like morons and use music to force feed jokes and pacing. But this one has the exact opposite of a problem. Moments that seem to be communicating a joke have zero SFX, visual or musical punctuation and it makes for a bizarrely paced movie.

For an example of one of these moments, take a look at the moment where Channing Tatum early on in the film falls off a stage in front of a crowd. No music, no nothing. Just really weird silence that tells us almost nothing.

Oddly enough, it's something I've noticed in other Sandra Bullock films. 🤔

26 May 2022,Nothing could save this flick.,"Sandra is almost 60, trying to play like when she was younger, with a younger actor. Tatum is no Brad Pitt, as one can see when Brad's cameos arrive, he sparkles...lights up the screen, the other actors...not so much. Preachy Rom-com, wished it had been more uplifting in dialogue without the need to use tacky language to encourage teenagers into the theaters. Sad really.

Hollywood has forgotten how romance and comedy are written.

17 April 2022,A great and much needed comedy,"A combination I never knew I needed, a good comedy, very necessary for these times. They succeeded with combining a nice adventure, comedy, romance, action. It's fun, enjoyable, really good produced, great acted, witty, smart, with satire and nice suprinses. The trailer and promotion did not ruin anything, I'm glad I watched it at the cinema, it was much more fun. I was not dissapointed at all, laughed a lot and it exceeded my expectations.

Yes, it may seem silly at times or even predictable, but it still surprises you. It reminds me of the good comedies I grew up with, but it's so actual and qualitative at the same time.

The cast is great and should continue doing these movies, they're so natural and talented. The public needs and appreciates a good comedy like this, whatever the critics opinion is. We need fun, a good laugh, a great time watching a movie, hype up, good energy, not just a perfect plot, an original drama or serious happening.

I hope, there is a second part and I look forward to see Sandy and Brad in another movie together.",8
8 April 2022,Good fun. Sandra Bullock making 58 look amazing.,"This movie is a typical fun movie for Friday night movie with family, friends or sleepovers. Channing Tatum and Sandra bullock have surprisingly great chemistry and Daniel Radcliffe is a great unhinged villain. I love seeing Daniel Radcliffe playing different characters in movies other than HP. He is my favorite part in the movie.

19 July 2022,Don't waste your time!,"I had high hopes for this movie and thought it would resemble Indiana Jones or Romancing the Stone. Instead, I quickly realized that it was a brainless chick flick that spends more time showing manly body parts than actually searching for a hidden treasure! The script is terrible and the acting is as bad as it gets. Don't waste your time on this movie unless you're into Chippendales!

21 August 2022,It's More than an Adventure Movie,"I found The Lost City to be just a fun sit down for a couple hours. I feel like we've been getting quite a few ""treasure hunt"" movies lately, and while it was better than Uncharted, it definitely wasn't a Raiders of the Lost Ark. It played its romance cards well, and while some scenes felt a little embarrassing to watch, none were unbearable. I never thought I'd see Sandra Bullock play a character like Loretta Sage, but she managed to a really good job. Same with Channing Tatum as Dash. Bradd Pitt, Daniel Radcliffe, and Oscar Nunez were all fun additions, and I loved how they fit this movie so well. The comedy was very much a hit or miss, with some of it being very dull and hard to laugh at, while other bits were hilarious. I found it really weird that some jokes were reused or had another shot taken at them, but it was good nonetheless. The adventure itself is fun, but felt a little long. But in a way that lets the scenes sink in a little better. I'd say all in all, this movie is definitely one I wouldn't mind watching again.

8 October 2022,The Lost City is a good time full of laughter but feels like a typical rom-com adventure that hits all the tropes.,"The Lost City is a goofy adventure with shades of romantic comedy, much like Romancing The Stone back in 1984 but with the absurdity and the laughs cranked up to 10. The movie basically revolves around Channing Tatum's hilarious reaction to every peril and danger. Sandra Bullock charms as always, and Daniel Radcliffe's kooky villain entertains but the best part of the film is Brad Pitt's over-the-top hero. His character is a gut-busting foil to Tatum's attempts to impress Sandra Bullock. The Lost City has plenty of funny moments and laughs but feels overly familiar like I have seen it all in other movies. I enjoyed The Lost City and recommend it, but I wish it did more to feel unique than rely on Tatum's wacky antics and Pitt's uproarious cameo.

Yes, there have been better movies of this type, but if it was made during lockdown, well good on them. It is better than sitting at home.

As for CGI, well get used to. It is the future and was quite justifiable in this production.

30 October 2022,Could it be worse?,"No one will remember this film, because it's as hollow as donut hole. There are bad but better films that are more watchable, like Jumanji 1 and 2. And if they tried to xerox Douglas and Turner ""Romancing the Stone"" it's two decades too late. And Brad Pitt in this, really? He needed money obviously. At one point, I was sure Channing Tatum was donning a Mark Whalberg's action figures. LOL, towards the end he became a GI Joe again?! Saving the day, kinda.

The most ridiculous thing was the makeup. After days of running in the jungle, sleeping in a hammock, camping, etc. Loretta had had perfect eye liners, makeups and lashes on! And had had blushes and shadow on to highlight her cheeks.

On top, it had awful dialogues and storyline. Despite all, Daniel Radcliffe was quite brilliant in it.

Bullock has to realize her time of Miss Congeniality was over a decade ago.

It's disappointing after watching her in Bird Box and Gravity, she would pick a project like this. Oh, I see, she was one of the producers. It makes perfect sense now.",2
12 May 2022,What Could Have Been,"This wants to be a more satirical 'Romancing the Stone'. Problem is, it just isn't funny. It relies too much on improv and the script is lacking.

The dramatic moments are better but they're few and far between. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in the theatre. Even after seeing it free on Paramount +, part of me me regrets wasting my time.

8 December 2022,Romancing the Stone with no romance and a stone dead script,"Wow. I mean, wow. That was bad. Seriously bad. If you're going to steal the basic idea of an old (and good) movie, you've got to do better than this. Romancing the Stone was funny, full of action, and had great performances from a cast that worked well together. And it had excellent production values. This looked like a bad telemovie. Don't know what Sandra Bullock was doing in this. Daniel Ratcliffe proved once again that he is the luckiest man alive to have been cast as Harry Potter as a 10 year old, because he got to be a multi millionaire with virtually no visible talent. The one bright moment was Brad Pitt's cameo. I've never been a big fan, but his ten minutes made you realise how big the difference is between an A List actor and...whoever it was playing the love interest in this. The two stars I've given the movie are his; the rest of the movie is a big, flat zero.

13 November 2022,Silly Fun,"Just wanted to watch something I wouldn't have to think about. Something that was just mindless, ridiculous and fun. Bingo! Never been a big fan of Channing Tatum but he was great in the part of an airhead cover model. Sandra Bullock played the roles she is best in rom-coms. Brad Pitt had me and stitches as the over-the-top living action figure. He was great. Wasn't impressed with Daniel Radcliffe his part could have been played by anybody. It was the perfect movie for just having fun and not having high expectations. Every movie can't be Academy Award material. Some are just made for us to have fun watching them.

18 June 2022,Only cracked a smile once maybe twice,"Terrible storyline,terrible acting,Radcliffe as a baddy is about as menacing as a fluffy kitten.

Brad Pitt does more in the 5 mins he's in than the rest do in the entire length of the movie.

In one scene they are at the bottom of a cliff and turn around to see the bad guys following them,so they climb up the cliff,bullock in high heels and camp at the top!.what happened to the bad guys?,did Radcliffe only hire henchman who were afraid of heights...lazy terrible script.

AVOID!!!!!.

16 April 2022,good,"I heard of Moon Knight, but never really knew the hold story, but then I saw the first episode on Disney plus, and I gotta say I'm excited for what comes next. Oscar Issac really takes us on this journey, playing like a Cary Grant like style.

13 May 2022,I laughed all the way through!!!,"This was the funniest movie I have seen in a very long time. It made me laugh all the way through the film. The banter between the main characters along with a few shockers made this such a fun enjoyable watch. It's one of those films that allows you to forget your troubles and just laugh for awhile. The acting was so good and very clean as far as sex and language- so that was refreshing too!

18 June 2022,"Fun to watch, take some time off and enjoy...","I really had fun watching it. There may me some plot holes, but this film is obviously made to enjoy and forget the world for about two hours.

I miss this kind of films. Yes, it is a formula, but it works. Story is familiar, to say the least, just like the characters. It is fun to watch.

Enjoy.

20 May 2022,Disappointed!!,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

5 October 2022,If this movie is average I want to see average movies forever,"I think after "" citizen Kane "" and Dark knight this is the third big movie in history.

This year is the year of creating unique masterpieces of cinema. This is not a disposable movie. It was not a movie that I wanted to use as an example. I might even have a collaboration with Disney in making it. I never think that bullac will play a good movie again. This movie is one of the few movies that uses slow motion correctly.

It has unique actions and is among the best. . If this movie is an average movie, I would like to see only average movies for the rest of my life. And I don't even think about good and great movies anymore. I am willing to wear such glasses all the time to see this kind of movies all the time. There were films that helped cinema in terms of technology and turned the wheel of cinema in any way, but this is really a film. This movie seems to belong to a golden era.

Nee Brothers"" as the director of the work, show a special ability in it. Production-wise, every aspect is competent enough to fill the standard expected of a mid-budget feature film.",10
12 December 2022,The Cast is the Star,"The Lost City was everywhere. You couldn't watch television or go on the internet without seeing an advertisement for this film. Then all of a sudden, it was gone. I didn't hear anything about it. It was like the film straight-up disappeared. It didn't seem like something I would pay to see in theaters, so It just slipped through the cracks. Then while going back through films released this year, I realized I never ended up watching this film. So I dusted off the ole pen and pencil and went to work.

The Lost City's strength is the all-star cast and the chemistry of its lead roles. The highlight of this movie is the performance of Daniel Radcliffe. Radcliffe plays the film's villain in another performance that makes him one of my favorite actors of the past twenty years. For the small amount of screen time, Brad Pitt makes the most of it. He is easily one of the funniest parts of this movie, and it would be a much lower-rated film without him. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are also great as the lead characters. The chemistry their characters build throughout the film makes the film's second half bearable. What the film lacks is consistency. The first half caught my attention, and I was fully invested. By the second half, much of my attention had been lost due to a slow script. It makes me upset I was bored by the second half because when Daniel Radcliffe reenters the film, I really wanted to be excited for him, but I just couldn't.

7/10 A harmless, fun action-comedy that's missing something to make it great.",7
28 March 2022,Judgment on The Lost City,"Overall I think it's great to have an author of a book to seek out for an adventure, instead of seating at home, having writers block while being pressured by your boss.

However I hate to wear a glittery outfit in the jungle that will definitely alert trouble. I do enjoy Daniel Ratcliffe's character. He's doesn't want to be second best. He wants to prove he can do it.

However his ego does get the best of him. I love Brad Pitt's character. Very mysterious and funny. Too bad he has such little screen time.

My judgment we'll be great for comedy and adventure. However mediocre on the plot and pacing. Since some scenes may slow down.

11 April 2022,As a return visit to the theaters this was a pleasant escape from reality,"That may sound like a kind if backhanded compliment but that is not my intention. Rest assured, The Lost City (of D) is a lot of fun and is honestly better than it should be.

The story does like milking the plot structure from '80s classic adventure movies like Romancing the Stone or Indiana Jones. It follows frustrated romance novelist Loretta Sage (Bullock) and her dim cover model Alan (Tatum) after she's kidnapped by a weird billionaire (Radcliffe) who's looking for a lost treasure. And he thinks Loretta Sage knows how to locate it. The lovelorn Alan follows after them to rescue Loretta with the help of a cool-as-hell specialist (Brad Pitt) who is not onscreen very long.

The movie sounds tiresome on paper and I'll be honest, the first ten or fifteen minutes are both rushed and thinly written. I was worried if this was going to be the whole movie. But luckily once Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are onscreen together trying to survive and fall in love, it is quite a lot of fun.

Once the adventure begins, it really picks up and the jokes are really funny. Despite being 57, Sandra Bullock remains a gorgeous woman and her comic timing is as good as ever. Channing Tatum has mastered playing the 'dumb but sweet manchild' to a tee now. I saw more of Tatum' ass than I ever wanted to see though. They had surprisingly good chemistry.

The show is nearly stolen by Daniel Radcliffe who is having an absolute blast as the bad guy Abigail Fairfax (yes really). He really yucks it up as a wacky rich lunatic and has some great lines. Brad Pitt really just has a cameo appearance in turns of screen-time without going into spoilers. But he is so cool and funny at the same time.

A couple of the side characters are kind of wasted unfortunately. There is a sidestory about Loretta Sage's assistant (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) who is also on a rescue mission and it is jarring whenever it cuts back from the main story to her. Randolph's demeanor and delivery could make some lines funny but they don't give her that many good jokes and that's a shame. A second character who is basically a grown woman acting like a teenager is very annoying but she's not onscreen long thank god.

On the flip slide, Oscar Nunez (from The Office) is in this and he is pretty damn funny. It's a one-joke stereotypical kind of character but man he is hilarious and did everything right.

There is not quite as much action in this as say Jungle Cruise or the more recent Jumanji movies. But it's clever how they handle the fight scenes and chases.

Despite its generic sounding title, The Lost City is a good time.",7
7 October 2022,Wow how negative reviews,"The movie was adventurous. My favorite character had to be either the villain (Daniel Radcliffe as Fairfax) or the main character (Sandra Bullock as Loretta Sage). The filming was incredible and the locations looked absolutely beautiful (I know it wasn't as cool actually being there in the jungle). How they captured the mood in the setting was perfect and how they created a spot-on and talented cast was remarkable. The plot was kind of predictable but most of the action and adventure in it was involving comedy and drama. I'd love to see another movie like this but with the same actor as (one of) the antagonist(s). The movie in conclusion was spectacular.

Ok, I'm a guy and this movie is probably supposed to be enjoyed by women but I loved it so much. I love these adventure movies so much. The acting is superb and the plot is excellent. I would rewatch it in a second. I only wish Brad Pitt was in the whole movie and not just the beginning and the very end briefly but I understand the story line wouldn't have worked with all 3 of them or would it? That's the real question.",10
11 October 2022,"It's ok, But Shakespeare it isn't","Sandra Bullock is capable of carrying a movie and has proven herself many times but here she seemed a bit sluggish. Guess she was in need of a break to recharge and reenergize herself. Channing Tatum is perfect and seems tireless, any role he's in he puts that extra thrust that never disappoints and so far everything I've seen him in I wasn't disappointed. Brad Pitt on the other hand literally stole the movie with the little screen time he had, I'm not big on him but he was magnificent in this movie. Daniel Radcliffe who plays a billionaire is the villain and again he trying to put those ""Harry Potter"" movie's behind him, again I say he just needs the right script unfortunately this isn't one of them. As a whole this one doesn't in my opinion deliver but offers just enough to get by.

It's not a remake of ""Romancing The Stone"" but does borrow heavily from it as it tries to offer a bit more than RTS does. The chemistry may have been stronger had Bullock been more refreshed but she made several movies back to back and was pretty much burned out and sadly it showed. The gimmicks and stunt's aren't are that great nor are some of the jokes and seemed to take a bit to get moving. The action is there but the acting wasn't to me up to par. Glad I waited to purchase this as I'll wait a bit till the hype wears off and try again.",7
28 March 2022,Well done formulaic copy,"This movie is as expected- just fine. Not objectionable, not great, just a well produced story with the usual plot of this genre (find the lost ""treasure"" while bad guys interfere). While Bullock isn't at her best, she pulls off the role better than most would. Daniel Radcliffe is excellent in his silly role but still might not be the best choice for it... he's not really a believable bad guy imo.

17 June 2022,Mostly Dreadful,"If you re going to the theatre expecting some film about discovering a lost city with epic fight scenes and grandeur this is not that. However, for a movie night it has some value with a familiar likeable cast and some decent yet mostly corny comedic moments. It's very much family comedy meaning it applies broadly but isn't spectacular for any group in particular.

Daniel Radcliffe is straight up terrible as the villain. There simply is no fit here at all. He isn't funny, nor can he really be taken very seriously. It seems uncertain he will ever be able to break from his role as Harry Potter. There are even moments he expresses his frustration almost identically to Harry.

Overal you can fill your time better with another film .

29 September 2022,"Comes close to Romancing the Stone, not Uncharted","I liked The lost City surprisingly more than I was expected. From poster, I got impression that this is cheap clone of Uncharted, but it turned out to be lighthearted adventure romance comedy.

From the beginning It makes clear it never takes itself seriously, and thanks to due good cast and writing entertains till end.

Romance part is in my opinion weakest element of the movie, at least I was not entirely sold by chemistry of the lead actors.

Adventure part was really well made, with beautiful locations, and some great and funny action scenes.

I did not notice any CGI effects and which was refreshing for me. It has the fell like old adventure movies, that could have being made decades ago.

Maybe this could be also reason for some negative reviews - this is not Indy or Uncharted, nor superhero movie packed with action spectacle.

It has more than a few similarities to Romancing the Stone, which is a good thing, event though it may not match its qualities.

Some says the script was not original. While I would agree plot wise, I also think the writers created original characters, and there are some great comic moments, that were fresh and well executed.

When the movie ended, I felt lighter, smiling, and compelled to write review. While there may be something missing to achieve greatness, this is still solid entertainment, worth watching when in mood for something to relax with.",7

3 September 2022,Plot was okay but the cast was better,"Good as a comedy, I think Sandra bullock and Channing Tatum did well together. It was great to see Daniel Radcliffe in a villain-type role, I was unsure about this at first but I think he did very well and it was a fresh perspective on his acting abilities. I think it was well-cast, and all the actors all did well working together. I think it worked well but almost more of a romantic comedy feel than action adventure. It could have gone back to Daniel Radcliffe's character every once in a while to make the film plot more effective. I never really felt a true sense of danger after the opening part where they were first captured, and again towards the end when I was unsure how they were going to get off the island.

20 November 2022,"Meh, unexciting but watchable","Whole time, I couldn't stop thinking about how uncomfortable main character must've been, by the time she was kidnapped. Quite apparent that the her one piece is literally a costume to stand out against the backdrop of the movie (though it is cute). On the other hand, perhaps it was very good quality. Loved seeing""Oscar"" and the manager reminded me a bit of Queen Latifah. Sandra does the 'awkward stutter acting well' and so does Channing. Also loved seeing Daniel as a villain and Brad was a nice surprise. Unfortunately, the script relied a little too much on canned, predictable humor. I recommend as a popcorn flick, but I doubt I watch a second time as a first choice.

For the most part, this movie could have been released in the 80's and been part of the Michael Douglas/Kathleen Turner romance duo. Tanning Chatum and Sandra Bullock have good chemistry. There were some good laughs in this and it goes by quite fast. I did feel like I escaped for an hour and a half and that was the goal. Who doesn't need an escape in these times?

14 August 2022,Worst Sandra Bullock Movie Ever!!,"This is my first review of a movie. I love Sandra Bullock as an actress. I have seen most of her movies. She usually makes me laugh, I love the romcoms. But this movie, which received so much hype, has to be her worst movie ever. I thought ""The Heat"" was bad, but this goes way beyond bad. Sandra, you cannot be that desperate for a paycheck. Channing Tatum, I don't know why he was picked, I didn't feel that they had any chemistry together. Brad Pitt's character would have made the movie more interesting, but I guess they couldn't afford his salary. Anyway you look at it, this will be the worst 90 minutes you will waste in your life. Go take a walk, play with the dog, wash your car, do anything but waste your time on this.

16 September 2022,Im not surprised that it was bad,"Even before watching it I knew it was going to be average at best, but it was a little bit worse than average. The story was not great and it just felt very boring like I've seen it before a million times. The action scenes were okay, but there wasn't much of them and it didn't make the movie more thrilling. There wasn't much comedy in the movie; just some lame jokes here and there. The only thing I liked about the movie was Brad Pitt's cameo and maybe the movie might have been a bit better if he had a main role. Movies are getting more bad every year and it feels like Hollywood are running out of ideas; I feel the demise of cinema coming.

29 May 2022,Avoid this one.,"This was a terrible movie. The star power that they had for this project gave me hope that this would be one of those thrilling adventure-type movies, but boy was this a let down! I really don't get why Channing takes up such awful roles. A senseless plot, forgettable perofrmances and the most bewildering aspect of it all is that Brad Pitt has a few minutes of screentime even.

15 April 2022,Good enjoyable popcorn film.,"Yes this film is going to win any awards or tax your brain , but it's not meant to !

It's a enjoyable silly and funny film that has a good few laugh out loud moments and the (packed) cinema audience seemed to agree !

Escapism, what more can you ask for ?

26 March 2022,Sandy NEVER disappoints,"Such a witty movie, you'll be cracking up. I was skeptical of this pairing going into it, but Sandra and Channing had great on screen chemistry. Great movie, best in a while, and well worth it. Beautifully casted. And I can't get over the talent and timeless beauty of Sandra Bullock. What an absolute jewel.

24 April 2022,Fun hybrid retread,"Aimed at tweens too young to remember Romancing the Stone, this blatant retread is reasonably mindless fun. The ageless Bullock plays the new Joan Wilder in an expert manner consistent with nearly every role in her career, while Tatum rehashes his 21 Jump Street style Himbo with a heart. 80s tropes are peppered throughout, including Stand By Leeches and even a brief musical homage to The Goonies. Radcliffe is amusing at times, but his detachment from Harry is probably never going to happen. Fun hybrid retread, and a sequel is inevitable depending on box office. 7/10.

10 April 2022,Comedy is Hard,"Once again, another lighthearted comedy to fill my listless soul with joy. I absolutely love Brad Port's short but remarkable presentation, which amusingly contrasts with his serious appearance. Without exaggeration, Brad Pity's 10-minute performance is about 50 percent of the movie's jokes. Sandra Bullock, also accidentally discovering her comedic potential, depicts a self-centered intellect who slowly learns to let go of her trauma and hubris, and appreciate her loved ones. Besides these, the film barely reaches the bar. Channing and Sandra's chemistry is apparent but not convincing. Moreover, Alan's immature and guileless characteristic is somehow added with a sudden canniness towards life, which is just contradicting. Lastly, the plot is just plain - several times the film sprinkle Beth's completely unrelated solo slapsticks for the sake of time, and I am routinely distracted by sleepiness. Overall, a slightly below-average comedy.

28 August 2022,Free with Amazon Prime and priced about right.,"Not a very demanding roll for Sandra Bullock and she delivers a typical performance. I thank the entire production for not challenging her to do more. Okay, okay, I wasn't expecting Casablanca. I knew this was not going to be art or cinema even. It filled up 90 minutes while I waited for my 30 minute pizza delivery. No chemistry between the co-stars and the best performances by the supporting cast. Brad Pitts small roll is worthy of a watch. Some lovely scenery. Some very lame bad guys who nearly defeated the lame good guys.

Spooky walking along the treacherous cliff such on original suspense builder.

My pizza is here,

The story line is good with beautiful scenery and good acting, but when they started to be funny by acting silly, I or could say we all the six of us just wanted to leave the theater, but we stayed just to see the great acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Channing Tatum and Brad Pitt, who is looking good and very fit for 59yrs old.

28 March 2022,Boring,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

1 June 2022,Brad Pitt's scene stealing cameo is the highlight of this adventure flick,"Directed by the Nee Brothers (Adam & Aaron Nee), The Lost City is the 2nd action adventure film to release this year (after Uncharted) but atleast this one isn't an adaptation or a sequel. With Sandra Bullock & Channing Tatum in the lead, the film is good fun despite the 'been there, done that' plot.

Loretta is a romance novelist and Alan is her cover model. When Loretta is kidnapped by a billionaire (Radcliffe), Alan decides to help her escape and in the process find the lost city.

Bullock & Tatum make for a great pair. Their on-screen chemistry is fabulous and they are both great at comedy. Daniel Radcliffe is good as the big bad. Brad Pitt has a scene stealing extended cameo. Though the casting is spot-on and the locales are exotic (similar to other adventure films -> an island off the coast); the film is quite derivative (with Pitt's character being the only surprise).

The Lost City is good fun despite it's faults. Tatum & Bullock are phenomenal and so is Brad Pitt as Jack Trainer.",7
15 April 2022,Let's hear it for the boys!,"It's Easter and I like a bit of escapism at this time of year so this fitted the bill perfectly. Sandra Bullock surrounded by three of Hollywood's most personable guys: Channing Tatum, Brad Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe tuning into his sinister side. The plot is flimsy a hunt for treasure with a bit of romcom. Sandra loses out a bit as the boys are having fun, Channing adorably goofy, Brad Pitt, slick and funny and Mr La Di dah and sinister Daniel Radcliffe. Actually the chemistry is gorgeous between the he leads and the action and quips keep this afloat. And Channing is one hell of a dancer.

There were a couple funny scenes, but most of the jokes were just too corny. The best part of the movie were Brad Pitt's scenes, which weren't long enough as he's not a main character. And Harry Potter cannot act. The ending was also underwhelming.

Bullock and Tatum have great chemistry and comedic timing, but not all of the jokes land. The stakes are pretty low, but it sends a nice message about not judging a book by its cover.

18 May 2022,This movie was much better than expected.,"It doesn't do anything new or really tread any new ground however Channing and Bullock have some pretty decent chemistry and there's quite a few laughs to be had.

Daniel Radcliffe does an adequate job of being a villain. Felt like he goes back and forth between being a gentleman and a brat, I suppose that was intended however it feels off.

The assistant Beth was a character that really fell flat for me. She had some funny moments but overall it felt like the character was trying too hard to force a laugh.

Brad Pitt absolutely kills it. For a brief moment he gave me some good laughs. His character has a lot of anger and resentment to let go of.

Overall a fun watch and decent popcorn flick.

29 July 2023,The Lost City is a fun romantic adventure comedy with Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum,"Sandra Bullock is an adventure romance novelist, Channing Tatum is the cover model of them. They both end up in an adventure in a jungle when Daniel Radcliffe as a villain kidnaps Ms. Bullock for her translation skills. Oh, and Brad Pitt also makes an appearance in a surprise role. I'll just now say this was both funny and adventurous and maybe a little touching in places. Both Mom and I enjoyed this one. It's a little like Romancing the Stone with more of the glam and even more of the slapstick scenes. I especially liked the rescue attempt while one of them is still tied to a chair! So on that note, we both recommend The Lost City.

31 March 2023,Maybe the real treasure was...,"'The Lost City (2022)' isn't particularly funny, but it is fairly fun. This romantic comedy adventure follows a reclusive writer and an underestimated cover model as they get embroiled in a billionaire's plot to unearth a lost treasure. It's a breezy, fast-paced romp that plays with the same sort of chalk and cheese dynamic that has acted as the genre's bread and butter almost since its inception. Bullock and Tatum are charming in their familiar yet entertaining lead roles, while Radcliffe's villainous forehead vein outacts almost everyone else on screen. There are a handful of chuckles and even some disarming action sequences, too. Generally, it does exactly what you expect it to, but does most of it rather well; it's as generic as it is enjoyable. It's a solid, if somewhat forgettable, experience that should keep you in high spirits for its modest duration.

5 September 2022,A mock up of Romancing the Stone,"Hilarious movie and not intended to be taken seriously. They covered all the tropes of romance novels and action movies. It's like Indiana Jones meets The Notebook (only way better than The Notebook). Sandy is dressed like a disco ball, Channing is unassuming my charming, and Brad Pitt is gorgeous and heroic. There are even some hints at Tropic Thunder (with the savior publisher). The soundtrack is perfect and it's clear that everyone had a good time while making it. I'm honestly not sure how they ever got it done because I imagine everyone laughing through the whole thing. Yes, the previews showed many of the funniest parts, but there was enough else to still be hilarious. Daniel Radcliffe is perfect as an obsessed villain. If you need an escape for a couple of hours, get over yourself and watch this.

31 May 2022,Very light reimagining of Romancing the Stone,"The similarities with Romancing the Stone are evident, but the film is not a remake or a reboot or anything, just similar. Sandra Bullock is a romance writer fed up with the industry in which she works and dreaming of more. So she gets more, via Daniel Radcliffe who does a rather menacing yet funny psychopathic villain who kidnaps her. It is time for romantic interest (and 16 years younger) Channing Tatum to come to the rescue, even when he is completely clueless. The film goes from there, being entertaining and decently funny.

I have to say here that Sandra is still beautiful and there is real chemistry between all the characters, but Brad Pitt just steals the show. Poof! It's gone! No more show for you, Bullock and Tatum. Pitt basically does a cameo like in Deadpool and is confident and good looking and amazingly funny. He elevates the film just by showing up.

There is also the issue of the obligatory Black person that I would not want to get into, but it's impossible to avoid. She just has to be female, weird, bossy, ""ethnic"" in order to check off all the boxes, but her character just comes off as manipulative, annoying, pushy, hungry and mostly insensitive, because at the end she ""has your back, girl!"". And she also protects her investment while at it. If I would want as many people as possible to become racist, I would just plop one heavily overweight black person playing an obnoxious and unnecessary character in every movie. That's exactly what happens here!

Bottom line: there are huge leaps of faith necessary to enjoy this film without rolling your eyes, but it was never supposed to be serious. It is a very light comedy that presents even an island jungle as a green and clean place where you can ride your motorbike between trees and islanders who just go on with their daily lives while a volcano is erupting. As such, it was fun to watch, but I wouldn't really recommend it.",7
1 April 2022,"Dreadful remake of 80s ""Romancing the Stone""","Absolutely tedious remake of 80s blockbuster ""Romancing the Stone"" with Sandra Bullock replacing Kathleen Turner,Brad Pitt filling in for Michael Douglas & Daniel Radcliffe stepping into the Danny Devito part which was extremely frustrating to watch. Complete lack of chemistry between actors & the movie too often falling short of funny.

Definitely give it a miss!👎😴

11 December 2022,Nah not a 6.1,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

14 April 2022,Cute and funny,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part, there were several laugh out loud moments, though some jokes fell flat and there were some unintentionally awkward scenes. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum had pretty decent chemistry, and Brad Pitt was a nice surprise. I could have done without the geriatric comments concerning Sandra Bullock throughout the movie. She looks great and gets the job done, so why go out of your way to belittle one of your lead actors? Da'Vine Joy Randolph's character (Beth) was unnecessary and her lines were stupid and unfunny. Daniel Radcliffe managed to overact and underact at the same time. The movie had some flaws, but overall not a bad way to spend a couple hours.

There are a few chuckles here and there but no laugh out loud moments. The plot is serviceable but not intriguing or immersive. The leads are obviously all capable actors but the script asks nothing of them.

Generally a mediocre movie that you will forget a few days later. Definitely not worth a theater viewing, maybe catch it at home at some point if you are interested.

On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

22 October 2022,It's actually pretty bad,"I wasn't expecting much from ""The Lost City"" so I guess I wasn't that disappointed. It does have its fair share of laughs but not enough to make it worth the trouble. Most of the laughs are provided by Da'Vine Joy Randolph. When Randolph is on screen, the movie's a lot of fun. When she's not, it grids to a haul. Sandra Bullock is getting to old to play these kind of characters. The rest of the cast is fine, I guess. The movie acts like everything its doing is a lot of fun but it's not. It mostly seems tired and forced. By the time ""The Lost City"" ended I couldn't care less about what was going on. Dishonorable mention: the always annoying Bowen Yang.

16 May 2022,Good flick with a familiar plot,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

30 October 2022,Absolute Drivel,"What made three very good comic (and dramatic) actors get involved with this piece of rubbish? Trying to be a rehash of The Proposal (without Ryan Reynolds) this poorly scripted piece of nonsense starts without an idea and goes downhill from there. A bit of madcap humour is fine but this gets it all wrong with weird ultra-violence thrown in for laughs (a character's blood and brains scattered across Channing's face!). The movie looks cheap too with poor sets and cgi that are only as convincing as the dreadful script. If you want to waste 90 minutes go sit in a darkened room rather than watch this...

20 May 2022,I wish I had read the reviews. What a stinker!,"Its soooooooooo bad.

This is promoted as an Action Rom-Com; and there is neither Action nor Rom nor for that matter Com.

The plot doesn't make any sense. All the situations feel forced, and the interactions between the characters are stilted and by the numbers.

What passes for humour, falls flat, and you feel embarrassed for the actors.

I stopped watching.

13 November 2022,Better chemistry and a better villain would have done wonders for this film,"Whilst on a book tour, author Loretta Sage is kidnapped by mysterious billionaire Abigail Fairfax whom wants Loretta to help him find some lost treasure. Determined to rescue Loretta is Alan whom is the cover model for her story; whilst Alan is a hero in Loretta's novels, can he be the real-life hero to Loretta?

I've generally found Sandra Bullock to be an appealing actress; when the script is right she can sometimes have a quirky ability of making her characters likeable and turning trite material into something watchable (like Miss Congeniality 1 and 2 for example). However, The Lost City seems beyond her talents...

I get that The Lost City is not meant to be taken seriously (or at least I presume that is the intention), but even so in order for a film such as The Lost City to work it needs to have certain key ingredients;

CHARACTER CHEMISTRY; I've said this time and time again in my reviews and I will keep saying it when writers get this aspect wrong. I didn't think Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked very well as a double act. It says something that Brad Pitt managed to work up better chemistry with Sandra even though he shared much less screen time with her than Channing did; truth be told I'd have preferred it if they kept Brad and ditched Channing, but hey that's just me....

THE VILLAIN; films of this nature need to have one and sadly this film was saddled with Daniel Radcliffe in this respective role. I have nothing against Daniel and have found him to be good elsewhere, but as the villain here he played sucked. His spoilt man-child act was not funny and he was about as intimidating as Mr Bean. In fact the few laughs I got from the film were from him actually trying to be tough (though I'm unsure whether this was meant to be funny or not).

TENSION; well there just wasn't any and as usual Fairfax's goons were so inept that you never were in any doubt how the film would end or whether or not Alan and Loretta would get the better of them.

I think what's worse is that I sensed that this was supposed to be an adventure film, but where's the mystery, the suspense, the intrigue etc and don't even get me started on the nauseating and frankly ridiculous and unbelievable romance.

I found it boring and to be honest the only person I liked in this film was Brad Pitt, but he wasn't in the film enough for me to be able to truly like it.",3
25 March 2022,Return of the Comedy Adventure film. It's fine.,"I thought overall it was cute, it was fun. There's nothing amazing this movie is trying to do, it knows what it is. It's here to make you laugh and excite here and there and it does its job. I didn't find it THAT funny personally, but where there was a lack in comedy (for me) it made up for with a lot of heart. It's genuinely a fun story, and it's very entertaining to watch these actors bounce off each other the way they do. Sandra and Channing have great on-screen chemistry and Daniel Radcliffe was clearly having fun in the role of a villain. On a side note, I really appreciate that the majority of this film seemed to be shot on location in an actual jungle. I just really enjoy it when they make that kind of effort instead of a ""green screen"". You can tell Sandra is really there and it adds so much more life to everything. I think there were a few ""green screen"" shots that were probably reshooting through production, but 90% of this movie is shot in a Dominican Republic jungle, and that's awesome.

If you need something light-hearted go check it out this weekend. I will admit there's nothing The Lost City does that we haven't already seen in a comedy. But you know what, the performances by all the actors and the clear intention to have fun with the concepts make this a pretty entertaining watch. That's the goal anyway.",6

31 May 2022,These reviews are rude...,"This movie is super fun. If you love romcoms it's a home run. It's like The Proposal meets Indiana Jones. And I could see it being a great movie to watch with a boy, because it's not oooverboard mushy, it's hilarious, and there's quite a bit of fighting and action. Idk what these people reviewing this movie were expecting, it's literally a light hearted nonsense romcom. But unlike others in the genre, I felt the story was actually pretty good! I've def seen girly movies held together by less. I seriously laughed and smiled the whole time, and I'd totally watch it again. Don't read the reviews just watch it.

28 May 2022,Nothing of value here,"Firstly, there is no chemistry between Bullock and Tatum; other than some mother/son vibe given the age difference. Secondly, the story is paper thin - it just lurches scene to scene with no rhyme or reason for each event to be happening.

The central premise is contrite... after she's kidnapped there's no reason NOT to go along with Radcliffe character and find the treasure that your husband and you have been searching for. I guess that means there wouid be no movie but it's illogical.

Characters are comically 1 dimensional... was this intentional? Loretta judges Allan and then Allan responds with a list of all the reasons why she's spot on.. and then says 'oh you never judge a book by its cover'. Ummm... she just judged you perfectly 🤷‍♂️

The ONLY time I laughed is the assistants assistant.

24 March 2022,Bad and that d letter is continue to infinity,"That is a waste of talent like Brad or Daniel and of course, your money, time. Purpose's ekip is uses their stars for only 3 minutes but pr like they are the center of film. The real center of film, Channing Tatum was a dumb and that too much. He acted the same way with a wood. Ekip abused sexual scene but i did not understand why they keep use it again and again for no target. 60m of opening was nighmare with me and i wish i could take a sleep. Overall that was a combine of ridiculous comedy, too much sexual, a little bit of action, a little bit of Brad Pit too. That film have no meaning and any artistic value.

19 July 2022,A goofy movie.,"The lost city follows Loretta Sage she gets kidnapped by an eccentric billionaire who hopes she can lead him to an ancient city's lost treasure. This was a fun goofy movie. There are some rememberable senses in the movie that are hilarious. Channing Tatum plays the dumb guy though out the hole movie he might be a little to dumb be he is still really funny in the movie. Daniel Redcliffe was a welcomed addition to the movie I never new he could be funny. And Brad Pitt plays the all serious type character who is really cool and badass! Sandra Bullock has some really good chemistry with Channing Tatum which leads to many funny moments!

Overall this is a good movie to watch if you want a good laugh.

10 April 2022,Too long and with no chemistry between actors,"I was so sure Sandra Bullock will save this movie, but that didn't happen. I love her, she is such a beautiful, incredibly good looking woman, she is a good actor too, and I like her quirkiness, but in this movie she just looked like she is done with everything. I could just feel like she is not satisfied with the role. She showed no joy, acted like she was tired, and like she couldn't wait for everything to end. And there was not one single spark between her and Channing Tatum! Maybe poor guy did want the spark to happen, but she was just not into it. There WAS a spark though between her and Brad Pitt, but that was not the point.

And OMG why was this movie so LONG?? It should have lasted 1 hour and 15 mins tops.

Don't get me wrong, Sandra, Channing and Brad were the only people who knew how to act in this movie, the rest were just unpleasant to watch. Too bad though, cause I really like Sandra's comedies, just not this one.",4

14 May 2022,Lost City of D,"I was not expecting much out of this movie and from the trailer it looked stupid, but I thought I should give it a chance to see if I was wrong. And after seeing it I was mostly wrong to think it was bad because I enjoyed this movie a lot.

Sandra bullock and Channing Tatum were both excellent in this movie, they both were funny, and they had great chemistry in a good romance. When they talk about their backstory or their story in why they do what they do you understand where they are coming from.

Daniel Radcliffe is a great actor, and he is good in this movie, and you do believe his role as the bratty villain looking for treasure, but I thought they should have given more explanation for his reason in doing this. Even though Brad Pitt is only in some scenes he did an excellent job, and his character was funny in the scenes he was in.

There are nice looking camera shots in the jungle and in big wide shots of the island that looked pretty and nice to look at. The action scenes that movie had in the jungle was shot well and entertaining to watch along with it just looking nice when they are on walking through on their adventure.

There were some scenes that were not funny but if you look past that you will laugh at the actual funny lines and scenes. Some people will not like this movie and some people will like this movie, but I thought this was a funny, entertaining, adventure.",6

28 March 2022,OK if you like Sandra Bullock and adventure movie humor,"It's a romantic adventure movie set in modern times, mainly on an unknown island in the Atlantic. It's a tongue-in-cheek film in the Harrison Ford model.

Loretta Sage (Sandra Bulluck) is an academic who used to work with her archeologist husband, who died five years earlier. They studied early Atlantic cultures. After that, she turned to writing romance novels but has retreated more and more to her home. She is finally coaxed by her publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), to undertake a tour with the cover model for all her books. Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum). Alan is always the character Dash McMahon in her novels, in which she is the model for the Angela character. He looks good but really isn't very competent at anything.

Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the bitter older brother in a wealthy family. He didn't get the family business but pursues treasure, in this case, the ""Crown of Fire"" left by an early Atlantic culture. In reading Loretta's last book, he realizes she can read cuneiform-type writing and kidnaps her to assist in finding the treasure.

The film then follows the adventure as Abigail tries to force Loretta to find the treasure while Beth and Alan try to rescue her. Alan briefly works with a former Navy Seal, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), to save Loretta but finally has to work directly with Loretta to escape the villains. Their adventure forms the plot of Loretta's next book.

You'll probably enjoy the movie if you like Sandra Bullock and adventure humor. Brad Pitt is amazing in his cameo role as Jack Trainer. Daniel Radcliffe is a little odd as a master villain. However, some other characters fit stereotypes for this kind of movie.",6
29 June 2022,Stupefy!,"Fairly decent adventure/romcom. Evil Harry Potter was a good laugh - I did want Sandy to whip her wand out at certain points though! Brad Pitt's cameo was fine - but let's face Brad's fine anyway. It's not the best but it's not the worst!

It distracted me. As far as the personality she acted like she was loaded on valium or xanax or pain pills. She just did not seem like Sandra Bullock at all. Lifeless and quite dull. Too bad. She's usually a bit more animated and feisty. Sandra if you are reading this please do not do drugs. They are so Unbecoming on you. This film was so unflattering. I found myself pushing the fast forward to see if there was any more exciting Parts oh well. I will say the black lady that played her agent was the funniest of all I did have some laughs on her.

10 June 2022,"Sandra having fun with the guys * No F-bombs, good for the whole family","Low-rate reviews are unjust to this film. It is labelled a comedy, but this way it makes one expect more that it properly provides. However, if you ignore the label, you are in for a funny entertaining film. Jokes and gags come in surprisingly now and then and are so goofy, which really makes them entertaining.

The scenery is fine and Sandra's face is so photoshopped she looks like 35 (which is cool).

Apart from the fact that soft comedies are now rare on the big screens, there is no F-bomb, so this is one of the few films of these times suitable to the whole family.

The crazy scene of Bullock, Tatum and Pitt escaping in a wheelbarrow should become a classical!

The cinema scene needed this film.",7

Ending was disappointing but it's a gender thing. I'm sure most women found it touching. A 'Romancing the Stone' type movie.

22 August 2023,Nice movie,"It struck me with elements of Romancing the Stone at first. Well that's nothing interesting as she's starts out as a romance writer and they show a scene she is writing. So that's just the same.

Sandra Bullock is such a great actress. She's really good, the subtle words and levels of her voice inflection. Everyone in this acts well.

It's a fun adventure that goes along by the numbers really, but hey that's ok. We've not seen this formula played out in a long long time. So it will seem fresh to a newer generation.

I liked it a lot and found it fun and fresh viewing. Oh honorable mention to Brad Pitt for his small role which was really good also.

3 October 2022,Goofy action movie that's alright,"Well, I like Sandra bullock and Channing Tatum, this is some adventure action movie that's pretty entertaining as long as you don't dwell on if things make sense or not lol

They tried really hard to make the story with some romance but personally I think there's just no chemistry between the two romantically which made the movie a bit cringe. I like dry humour like zack Galifianakis which this reminded me off a bit but this just not quite there.

I would've give this movie maybe a 4 or most 5 But Brad Pitt really was great in it actually so ended up a 6 :)

It's on Amazon so it's free, if you want something funny light hearted this wouldn't be too bad.

3 October 2022,Masterpiece.why???,"Friends, out of 262 votes, Rotten Tomatoes website got 79. So this movie is unique and everyone should watch it. This movie can be a complete and enjoyable study of art. Because the details are observed. Unconsciously, the director has come on the screen. A movie that can be seen a hundred times and learn a lot from it. It makes our mind more active. The movie is heavy. And it has all the features of an action movie It's as if everything has come together to make a unique movie and everything will be engraved in the history of cinema. To make such a film, you must know literature, know classical cinema, know painting, and be a professional screenwriter. This film comes from the subconscious of its director.

The story of the movie was very beautiful and not repetitive or clichéd at all. Actors seem to be made only for these roles. Adam Nei and Aron Nei prove that they can follow in the footsteps of great filmmakers. But in this movie, it is clear that they are not looking for more profit and sales with the common stereotypes of Hollywood and made an artistic and masterpiece movie with heart and soul. In short, it is very important that a movie can affect us as much as fiction.

It was really a unique and first class movie. Do not be fooled by the poster. Hollywood has given us trash movies for years under the title of adventure genre, maybe we think this movie is one of them. Contrary to the simple appearance of the film, it is a masterpiece in the genre of adventure and drama. A great film, a film at the edge of the art of storytelling in cinema. Do not miss watching this movie. You will never forget the good impression this movie has on you.....",10
3 April 2022,Pleasantly surprised!,"I didn't go to the cinema with any expectations but was pleasantly surprised to watch this hilarious movie. You can watch and have a good time :-)

All the actors have done justice to the role and Brad Pitt aced it.

27 April 2022,A fun comedy adventure with great acting,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

29 May 2022,Inferior Re - imagining of Romancing the Stone.,"Despite the presence of its 5 screen writers and 2 sibling directors, The Lost City ends up existing as a very ordinary remake come rip - off, of Robert Zemeckis's far, far better Romancing the Stone. This is kind of ironic, since Stone was frequently charged with ripping off Raiders of the Lost Ark, an accusation with which, I've never agreed and don't think is in any way sustainable.

At any rate believe me when I say the list of plot similarities between LC and RTS is pretty staggering, right down to the mid movie outdoor dance scenes, where both leads finally acknowledge the physical attractions they hold with each other. I won't bore you with a list of parallels. Suffice to say that billed as LC is, an action - adventure romantic comedy, RTS tops it in all those key areas. 38 years later, it still has better action scenes, more suspense, a greater sense of fun and a much higher - charged chemistry between leads Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas, than LC could ever hope to achieve.

There are positives. The Lost City, like the somewhat similar (and disappointing) Jungle Cruise, is pretty harmless, in an almost bland, family - friendly way. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum utilise the right approach to the material on offer and never play over - seriously. The Brad Pitt and Stephen Lang cameos are welcome and Pitt especially has a lot of fun with his part as a gruff soldier of fortune with a contemplative side, (though I have no idea why his role was made so obvious in the trailers. Well actually I do. Regrettably, it was probably all about money). Da'Vine Joy Randolph playing the over - stressed literary agent Beth, pretty much steals the show. She serves up the best lines and is involved in the funniest scenes, most noteworthy of which co - star a very sociable goat.

It's just a pity that the general involvement factor of the movie wasn't ratcheted up a lot more tightly. There seriously is minimalist action and what there is, is choreographed quite poorly. The dialogue is repetitious and there is too much of Loretta (Bullock) and Alan (Tatum) endlessly walking through the jungle just talking away. In fact head villain, Daniel Radcliffe (playing it completely for laughs) disappears off screen for such long periods, we almost forget about him and any threats or dangers he may pose to the welfare of our supposed heroes.

I much as anyone likes a good adventure come romance yarn, but sadly The Lost City, whilst innocent enough, just doesn't cut the mustard for me. Believe me when I say the majority of people will be checking their watches, long before the mid - credits, half - expected twist arrives.",5
27 July 2022,"The Original ""Romancing The Stone"" is way better.","Do yourselves a favor and first watch ""Romancing the Stone"" starring Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito from 1984. While Bullock and Tatum are great, you can't beat the OG. The characters are better fleshed out, not nearly as over the top and more human.

11 April 2022,Didn't expect if we need it?,"It's really great movie if still not sure what to watch in the cinemas. Just strolling around and giving this movie a shot. Action-adventure comedy movie like this is really great to lit our weekend consumption needs - laughter from comedy. Some huge casts are shown up like Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe, and Brad Pitt. The movie plot is simple to find the lost city through an unexpected adventurous journey.

The pros are this movie felt entertaining enough through jokes, clear external and internal Hollywood references - citing the movie and using OST music - and actor performances. Practical jokes and rom-com movies typically seem great. Movie narration and jokes seem at a suitable pace. Hollywood references make this movie relatable to the audience. Sorry, I'm not trying to spoil the reference because please just see it lol. Lastly, actor performances are absolutely no doubt caused they are great casts. Visual quality? Just good or Hollywood standards. The cons are the movie plot is too simple and the char's background is too shallow. But actually, these two cons are typical of comedy movies.",7

11 May 2022,Weak copy of 1984's Romancing the Stone.,"What a load of crap. Nothing but a really, really weak copy of 1984's ""Romancing the Stone"".

Sandra Bullock, absolutely unconvincing in her part. Probably not her fault, because they gave her very little to work with. As this romance novelist and awkward, insecure, can't find a husband, hate my life, because I write trash, but really, I'm actually an intelligent, girly girl thrown into an adventure. And there you have it, the next novel. Bullock is briefly joined by some standard comedy items, like the loud, big, black woman and a mouse like assistant.

Pretty boy Channing Tatum, who of course happens to have so much more layers to his personality than his looks would suggest. Got to enjoy that for literally one short scene, and it's back to the stupid pretty boy. The PC way to go. Even guys aren't allowed to be pretty and stupid anymore.

Daniel Radcliff, once again as this spoiled, rich, frustrated, inferiority complex ridden A-hole, like he played in ""Now You See Me 2"". Done before and absolutely not an improvement, or in any way interesting. Joined by some stereotypical henchmen. Buffed and brainless, adding nothing.

One lame joke after another. All been done before in just about any adventure movie ever. And worst of all, the utterly failing attempt at some clever Gilmore Girls like dialogue, that more or less dies a horrible death after the second line. Guess the screenwriters got most of their material off the internet, or were hired fresh out of a Craigslist Comedy writing 101 class.

The only funny part in the entire movie was Brad Pitt, but that didn't last long.

In short, another failed Hollywood attempt to relive the good old years, where writers still came up with original ideas.",3
13 March 2023,This isn't a movie that helps.,"I was disappointed in this movie. It's supposed to be so funny that our main female character is being tormented and teased because she's still mourning the death of her husband. It's insane. They mention it's only been 5 months since he died and her so called friend is guilting her for being depressed. Then she gets stuck with the male model and suddenly she's over the love she had for her husband. I thought this movie wasn't any good. This society never let's people mourn properly. Someone dies and you should be over it all in a week and reading to date again. There is nothing wrong with you if you never want to date again.

13 April 2022,A somewhat amusing action adventure comedy film that will become easily overlooked,"This action adventure comedy doesn't take much risks and doesn't have an audacious enough storyline to make this a memorable comedy film. I thought a lot of the jokes fell flat and was surprised that this film only had a few genuine laugh-out-loud scenes. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have sufficient enough (but is it enough?) chemistry to buoy this film from faltering, but I think this film would've been better overall if Ryan Reynolds was casted instead as Bullock's foil & love interest (The Proposal film nostalgia anyone?). IMO, they have a more natural rom-com chemistry. The rest of the supporting cast is standard: Daniel Radcliffe looks like he had fun playing a bad guy role and Oscar Nuñez (same-named character from The Office) is funny in his minor role.

This film misses the mark yet it still has some entertainment value. Though, I wouldn't recommend watching it in theaters, just wait for it to be released on streaming services.

6 October 2022,Disappointing,"Weren't they embarrassed by totally ripping off Romancing the Stone? Right down to Kathleen Turner using a convenient pay phone in a jungle village during a fiesta and then dancing with Michael Douglas. The least they could have done is given the Kathleen Turner part a different job than reclusive yet beautiful romance writer; a different locale than the jungle; a different goal than jewels. Yes - I think Bullock was embarrassed. Some of the movies she's in that are just derivative drivel using her to bring in the bucks, she overacts to the point of cringing. Speed 2, Miss Congeniality 2. She can be so lovely, so funny - but the aging zany mega star isn't working. Tatum - meh. Weird face on top of gym muscles.

19 May 2022,What a disappointment,"This was one of those movies where the trailer was all of the best scenes. It had all the potential of ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""Romancing the Stone"" meets ""The African Queen"" but came nowhere close to any of those classics. And I suppose that is too much to ask but in spite of so much appealing talent cast, this was a ridiculous and boring snooze-fest. No chemistry between the too-old Bullock and the too-young Tatum. The Radcliff character had so many contradictions that he was neither funny, evil, sympathetic, or interesting. Pitt is a highlight but his role is far too limited. The plot made no sense and was beyond anything you could suspend your disbelief to embrace. ZZZZZ.....

16 August 2022,Zzzzzzzz,"I'm a longtime fan of Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt, and even Daniel Radcliffe. But not this time. Everybody in this dull adventure seemed like they were asleep, or distracted. Zero chemistry between the two principles (Bullock and Tatum), or between anyone. I kept imagining the directors being satisfied with each bland take and looking up from their iPhones and saying, ""Okay. Cut! I think we got it. Check the gate."" (That was unfair, I'm sure the directors/writers, the Nee bros, were on top of every take.

And then there's the so-called McGuffin, some vaguely described ""Crown of Fire"". So pedestrian and ill-described that you often forgot about what everybody was looking for. Radcliffe (I'm sure he loved the idea of trying to play a villain, weakly), who's supposed to be some sort of Elon Musk mega-billionaire, is obsessed to the point of risking his entire fortune with this obtaining this geegaw.

Then, as each character has that obligatory revelation scene to relate their backstory, you are struck by how boring all those stories are. It's like the script just said, ""insert backstory here."" Bullock's character was supposed to have once been a successful archaeologist but then she inexplicably got into writing bodice-ripper trash novels...yeah, there's a believable thread. Alan (Tatum) was just a good looking nobody in high school, then college, and ended up as a highly paid male model (how sad). Even the supporting characters' revelatory backstories are pointless.

Just what was the point of this whole movie? Yeah, yeah, yeah...I know it's supposed to be a comedy. Still waiting for the laughs.",2

13 May 2022,"""Mummies are Human""","It was fun for a while, and then it was okay.

Well, it was sort of enjoyable and had a great start. And I certainly did not dislike it, or left with a sour taste in my mouth. It does have it's problems that I translate as a lack of ""more"". What you get is competently executed, beautifully shot/edited/acted, the whole package! Although, Channing even delivers a lines while laughing, and they allowed that take to stay in. Anyway, as an ""action/adventure movie"" is BEYOND tame, an lacks a big set-piece.. Then, the ""Comedy"" is terribly generic. So! You are left with ""Romance"" (which this movie isn't even listed as). Luckily, it is a character-driven story and the leads are well defined and totally work together (they won't be winning any awards, for sure). But it's sweet, and even has some very good/smart dialogue.. when it's not trying to do ""dumb"". The writer-framing is put to good use, and even for cute moments.

There's not much to get beyond a certain point, but it manages to finish.. somewhat. At least, is not a let down like Uncharted.",6
15 May 2022,"Not original, but pretty and fun","Whether you enjoy this movie will really depend on what your expectations of it are.

If you are looking for something original, high-brow, or complex, you will seriously disappointed.

If, however, you are looking for some brain and eye candy, then you should be pleased.

Not to put to fine a point on it, but this is basically a less gritty version of Romancing the Stone.

Even though you know exactly what is going to happen, the beautiful backdrops and and Bullock's knack for comedy make this an enjoyable romp through the jungle.

Brad Pitt's appearance in the film, although brief, is a real boon to the story.

His performance really stands out and keeps the film from dragging over what is probably a longer runtime than it needed.

Daniel Radcliffe's appearance is less successful.

He seems to be trying too hard to live down his Harry Potter days by seeking out roles that allow him to play a villain, a weirdo, or both.

In the end, this is a silly rom com that is fairly forgettable, but still pretty and fun.

So long as you accept that you are not sitting down to watch the next Citizen Kane, this is a movie you will be able to enjoy.",7
22 April 2023,"""Is that a Ken doll on a moped?""","(503-word review) I found this to be a bit cringy. Enough to immediately assume that the overall film will be a rating lower than what I've given it; the Q&A scene hammered that home for me. That awkward humor, topped with perpetual silence because some people want to make you suffer, is second-hand embarrassment galore. People who love that probably exist, and I'm perplexed.

However, that was only the case until the meat of it all started making headway, beginning with the introduction of Daniel Radcliffe's character, followed by the arrival at the island. It gradually improved from there, much to my relief, regarding the escape from that humor and the enjoyment increase.

The main cast (Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe), including the supporting cast (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Oscar Nuñez, Brad Pitt), were all good and contributed massively (Patti Harrison was alright) to the enjoyment of this film. That wouldn't have been as much of the case if the writing (the Nee Brothers, Oren Uziel, Dana Fox, revolved around the story by Seth Gordon) wasn't also good; the directing, too, also by the Nee Brothers.

Speaking of the supporting cast, specifically Brad Pitt, I want to mention my surprise about him being in this film. I remember reading a few things about it back in 2021, which included that. Well, I forgot. And something about Jack Trainer's voice over the phone was stroking my subconscious. That's why. He barely had any screen time (nowhere near enough, mind you), but he was one of the highlights. His ""status"" is at a level where his little screen time is understandable.

The best aspects beyond the cast were the cinematography by Jonathan Sela (the visuals looked excellent and picturesque, helped by the work of the location managers, Boni Canto and Isidro J. González) and the action-adventure genre, specifically the adventure part.

The whole 'adventure/exploration of ancient places, maybe to also find ancient treasure' thing has a particular appeal; the nice-to-look-at locations/scope of the world-building probably plays a factor. I may like it more than the murder mystery/whodunit sub-genre, for example, as I watched Murder Mystery two films ago, although it's still pretty close.

The most lackluster, although not THAT lackluster or that big of a deal, aspect was the chemistry between the two leads. Both Channing and Sandra had more chemistry with Brad. Yes, romantic chemistry. Yes, Channing and Brad, too. Channing and Sandra had more comedy-duo chemistry than romantically.

I'd welcome a second film but with a catch. Brad Pitt must return and have a more prominent role. Adding to that, it should revolve around all three of them. The trio was better than the duo. Hell, add a threesome into the mix. Why not? Come on, don't be shy and prudish. Don't ""reserve"" something like that for films like Fifty Shades of Grey/that trilogy only.

With a better first half and the short-lived trio of Channing, Sandra, and Brad, the action-adventure element did most of the work here, followed by specific characters, particularly Abigail Fairfax.",7
25 March 2022,Hilariously corny romantic comedy,"If you are looking for a date night movie or a friend's night then this is the movie to see.

13 April 2022,The Lost City is... lost within its own world,"Since Ocean's 8, I have adored Sandra Bullock. She's one damn gorgeous woman with a wide range of acting abilities and I found her to be charming as ever. Channing Tatum looks so young, he makes me feel old. He's 41-year-old for the love of God. When The Lost City poster and trailer were released, it only took these two world renowned actors to catch my attention and I was immediately sold.

The Lost City is marketed as an action rom-com with a bit of spoofy elements so it's inevitable for audience to go in expecting it to be a comedy film. Did the comedy work? Yes and no. Some of them were effectively done, it received lots of gags from everyone but others were okay at best, mostly because of 2 reasons; either the trailer has spoilt what could have exploded the hall with laughter or it's just not funny enough to warrant a giggling response from the audience.

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and they are just adorable together. Albeit Bullock is 16 years older than Tatum, she knew how to act younger despite her character who leads a simple, boring and uninspired life. Tatum portrays a capable-looking bloke only to realize that he's not as strong as how people see him. Throughout, it felt like their characters are almost caricature-like, which was what elevated the chemistry for me.

Daniel Radcliffe is mehhh, he played the exact similar to his previous blockbuster role, Now You See Me 2 but I guess that's what made it funny, the fact that this movie just straight out let him played a similar role again which was kinda spoofy. Brad Pitt is charismatic as always although I knew his character only serves a few purposes for the movie.

Is it filled with action-packed? No, not really. Here's the thing about The Lost City, it spends most of their running time talking and elaborating its comedic scenes which are a hit-or-miss, that they sometimes forget to include 'action' in it. And even when there's one, it's mostly consisted of chasing sequences that are okay at best, and there's barely any action going on expect when Brad Pitt's in it.

Ironically, The Lost City is... lost within its own world. It fails to set a tone that enriches the world, resulting in a blockbuster movie that feels cheap and half-cooked. It doesn't look appealing to the point that it takes away what could have potentially be an enjoyable experience like Jumanji or Indiana Jones. Even for a semi-spoof film, it's bad considering it took about $70 million budget to make this.

Verdict: The Lost City sends a pair of attractive leads capable enough of surviving to the jungle. However, the deeper the journey, the more they realize it has lost its charm, resulting in a mundane expedition.",5
3 April 2023,"Standard Formula & Casting, But Fun","Not the film to watch if you're wanting originality, unpredictability or any of the actors to display their range, but still a very solid, occasionally funny, and easy watch.

A-List actors are brought in to play the roles they've done a dozen times; Bullock as the intelligent yet socially awkward and insensitive lead, Tatum as the stupid eye candy who has the heart of gold, and Radcliffe as the billionaire Englishman trying to steady his insecurity, but at least you know what you're going to get when you're coming in.

There are some great additions, Pitt is an unexpected high, Nuñez is a bit more wacky than previously seen, but overall it is a cookie-cutter formula for a film. It is an enjoyable, light-hearted adventure comedy with a popular cast that provides a few laughs along the way.

9 April 2022,"Thank to the protagonists, they manage to make their own film in addition to the parody comedy","The Lost City is a new adventure comedy directed and partly written by the Nee brothers, who co-directed Band of Robbers and The Last Romantic. The film is about the reclusive novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock), who has become quite popular with her book series. She owes this success partly to Dash the book cover model of her books who is played by the model Alan (Channing Tatum).

During her book promotion of her latest book The Lost City of D, Loretta is kidnapped by her wealthy fan Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). With her book knowledge about tombs on which she based her books, he thinks he can find an ancient treasure. Alan, who saw Loretta kidnapped, now tries to rescue her to prove that he is more than just a cover model of her book series. Ending up in the jungles of the Lost City, the two opposites must work together to survive their perilous jungle journey and find the treasure before it falls into the wrong hands. With this film they have made a kind of parody film, which brings out the clichés of other adventure films about hidden tombs in dangerous jungles with booby traps. Fortunately, in addition to the parody film, they were able to give the film its own story. This story itself also commits many of the clichés from the other adventure films, which they try to make a bit ridiculous. This is an entertaining film, but nothing really new or special.

Apart from the comedy of the clichés that they try to ridicule, the comedy of the movie itself works best to make the rest of the movie stand out compared to other adventure movies. Unfortunately, many of the comedic moments have already been seen in the trailers, so for a more entertaining experience, try to avoid the trailers. Other aspects that provide the best moments are unfortunately also used the least. As a result, the film is mainly about the contradictory humor between the two main characters. Fortunately, Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have good chemistry together, which makes their comedic scenes come across better. They actually filmed the film on location, so the directors, together with photography director Jonathan Sela, managed to provide many beautiful images. This also makes the film a bit more realistic compared to other adventure films, which were mainly shot in film studios and were later given a background with a green screen. Most cast members have also been able to perform their own stunts on location. Sandra Bullock manages to return as a comedy star in the cinema world with this cinema film, because before this film she played more in films that were put on streaming services. Together with Channing Tatum she knows how to provide good comedy. Her character often comes across as sarcastic during what she's going through. Her character wears a purple glitter jumpsuit for a large part of the film, which also creates many comic moments. Channing Tatum also knows how to show his comedy sides in this film, with which he has become a talent since 21 Jump Street. In this film he does play a stupid bungler, who is always trying to prove himself. Daniel Radcliffe also knows how to play the villain of the film, but his character is not really well developed in the film. He also sends his accomplices after the duo more often, which means that he has less to do himself. Brad Pitt also has more of a cameo in the film in which he manages to steal the spotlight and you quickly start to miss him when his characters disappear from the film.",6
25 May 2022,"A Little Lost at Times, But there is Treasure Found","The movie has a very entertaining premise. A romance novelist lost in the jungle with her cover model. For the most part the film is able to take full advantage of this set up. Tatum and Bullock do a great job, as well as Daniel Radcliffe as the villain. The supporting cast as well get some good time to shine, including a hilarious bit with the character of ""Jack Trainer"".

The two leads, Bullock and Tatum have a good back and forth throughout the film. Their lines have good comedic timing, and come across very natural. Sometimes their comedic banter does not land as well as the director may have thought. Certain sequences seem to last too long, as if the two actors improved a bunch of quips and the editor couldn't decide which ones to cut out.

The film does have its fair share of logical inconsistencies in the duo's escape. Certain plot points that leave the audience saying, ""there is no way that should have worked."" but we go along with it anyways. The movie does keep cutting back to a ""B-Plot"" that isn't nearly as funny or engaging as the main story. But it feels that the movie spends a lot of time here as homework they have to do for the finale. There is also a romantic subplot in the story that I was just not buying. That combined with some lazy story telling clichés towards the third act, hold this movie back from being great.

But all in all, I still had a good time. The jokes that landed out numbered the stretches of misfires. And the lame story beats are salvaged by the likable cast of characters. There may be some detours along the way, but I think there is treasure to be found in ""The Lost City"".",6
2 June 2022,Horrible,"The only reason this isn't a 1 star is because Brad Pitt crushes it. This movie was better when it was Romancing The Stone. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum clearing were doing this for an unreasonable amount of money.

15 May 2022,It will be no ones favourite film but it will be enjoyed by many and hated by few. Simple but solid fun and adventure.,"Simple fun. Channing Tatum is so obviously and naturally a leading man, you have to hand it to him for being willing to take the mick out of himself like he does here. Dan Radcliffe is really coming into his own now and is no longer the boyish wizard, he is a believable villain here with plenty of charisma and solid professional chops. Sandra Bullock looks remarkably well and has a remarkable amount of energy for her age. Fair play to her also for continually being able to have a laugh at herself through her career. The story doesn't make a lot of sense but it provides some laughs and is lighthearted entertainment for a Friday night. Brad Pitt's cameo also brings some laughs. It is one you can imagine will be shown on TV a lot in the future because it is largely inoffensive, solidly made, with tried and tested fun and adventure.

12 July 2022,"The Lost City (2022, Aaron & Adam Nee) Silly but sweet comedy where Bullock & Tatum are better as a comedic pair than a romantic one","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

Opening in theaters on March 25, 2022.",6
31 July 2022,Just Terrible,"With the cast involved, this should have been much better. Instead you get this listless, lifeless mess.

I'm not sure if the badly written screenplay or poor direction are to blame. Every cliche you've seen in every rom-com is here.

There has to be talented writers and directors out there waiting for an opportunity. Give them this cast and this budget and you would likely end up with something better.

My wife fell asleep three times watching this and she picked it.

20 April 2022,Wanted to love this,"RomCom adventure movies, something which was a big thing in the 80s. I love a Romcom, but why not add some adventure right? You might think so. The problem with mixing 3 genres is the balance, and at least one part suffering. The Lost City sounds good on paper... I mean, it has Bullock and Tatum... hell yeah, it even got Pitt. But when the supporting cast makes me laugh even more, than these 3 names... clearly something is off! Jokes are not landing, there is a lot of chemistry missing between Bullock/Tatum, the storyline is very predictable... I felt even awkward at some points, for sure the scene where Tatum clearly need to show off his body. Obviously a point in his contract, but the build-in how to do it, is rather lame and it just feels off. I often watch the end credits and see 4 script writers for a bunch of nonsense like this? Why??? Even the adventure part is pretty lame (a small little temple in front of a massive blown up CGI forrest) and some tomb. Where are the lush sets? The dangerous booby traps? The plot twists? I mean, nevertheless I enjoyed myself slightly during the movie. You know you can't expect much, going into this... but all was very frustrating and it could've been much more, and opened a new era in this kind of niche genre. I'm even surprised it scored more than 6/10 on imdb. I hardly can give it a 5.",5

20 March 2023,this movie is corny and knows it,"Absolutely loved it!

Sandra Bullock has always had stellar comedic timing and this is no different. She and Channing Tatum make for a great combo (he's got the golden retriever energy needed to balance out her intense nihilism).

David Ratcliffe as the zany supervillain was so enjoyable, I hope he gets to play these roles more often! The whole rescue scene with Nick Cave playing in the background? Amazing. I loved the soundtrack. There are so many iconic visuals as well.

This movie riffs on so many tropes and cliches, it's a delight. The stuff of tales. It also kind of makes it timeless? No notes, loved it and will watch it again! It's a classic in this household already.

Was it supposed to say something about her character, or did she really get all that filler and Botox on purpose? I liked her less and less as the movie progressed--exactly the opposite of Tatum Channing. I have nothing good to say about Daniel Radcliffe either, so I just won't say anything.

Brad Pitt was a+

3 September 2022,An Tasteless Buffet of Typecasts,"In her recent films Bird Box and The Unforgivable, Sandra Bullock delved into more serious, richer roles, leading to widespread acclaim. With her streak of strong performances, I was then looking forward to her next outing. In The Lost City however, Bullock disappointingly regresses to her typical klutz of a character, a role we've seen a thousand times that its reemergence was chore to endure. Channing Tatum does not escape his own typecast, as the film's dialogue relied heavily on his idiocy to spark comedy, which failed miserably in my books. Further bogged down by an an atrocious screenplay that presented unoriginal & boring physical comedy, chemistry that felt forced & unappealing, the result is then romantic comedy that comes up bland, awkward & cringe worthy. Oh, and the green screen sticks out like a sore thumb too FYI.

Overall, The Lost City failed on everything it tries to be. It presents itself as rom-com, yet good ol' laughter was a rarity. It declares itself as adventure-fueled, yet motivations & dangers were shallow, and technically, the film screams falsity. Tsk Tsk!",5

23 March 2022,First Feature Length TikTok EVER,"As the trailers left me wondering if I'd been so inebriated that I'd missed any mention of a plot, I find comfort in confirming that my impression actually checked out. There is no plot. Indeed, this film is a kaleidoscope of things happening until they don't anymore. Then it ends.

The film mercilessly begins by offering no more than.0001352 teaspoon of character development. Tidbits of their backgrounds are offered up throught the course of the film, but the window of opportunity to care for a character's arc (or even the pseudo-plot) is nailed and cemented shut.

The attempted on-screen chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum was probably the only humourous aspect of the film. I'm unsure of the reasoning behind Daniel Radcliffe's casting, but...he's there. Brad Pitt is in there, too.

In the end, I left the theater feeling as though I'd stumbled upon a Miss Congeniality + 21 Jump Street + Jumanji TikTok challenge. And that's fine. I guess.",3

It's Romancing The stone that takes the stone too seriously and leaves no room for heart.

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

5 April 2022,The Lost City,"Honestly it's a fun popcorn flick. Dumb humor, but very funny and entertaining. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum were good. Surprisingly Danial Radcliff was good also as the villain. It's not gonn win any awards but it's a fun movie that will let you escape for 2 hours.

21 May 2022,Just a normal family movie if you want something relaxing.,"The movie is just good. Actors good. You don't have to think about what's happening. It's a classic Hollywood movie with lots of cliches. I can say as a cinema lover I was bored some times cause plot and dialogues were expected like in every film of that kind. Jokes was normal.

25 March 2022,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie. I liked many members of the cast. This is billed as a drama/comedy. I kept waiting for something to at least make me chuckle. I felt for the cast as the writing was really stale. I'm not sure why it was so difficult for writers to give these talented actors better lines. While the plot was full of holes and a bit disjointed that isn't unusual for this type of ""adventure"" movie. I kept thinking how much more this movie could be with better writing and direction.

13 June 2022,Need More Films Like This!,"This is a wonderful throwback to the 80's films that the whole family could enjoy. It's funny, fun, and doesn't try to be more. It's made for adults but accessible to a wider audience, and as a parent who's seen too many rape and torture scenes I am totally cool with that. There are a few parts inappropriate for children that will go right over their heads, the language is pretty tame, and the bad guys aren't completely dehumanized.

There are a few plot holes, and no it's not 100% realistic, but it's a lot of fun. Sandra Bullock is beautiful and on brand, Channing Tatum works in nicely, production quality is very good and overall the movie is well-cast. It is what it is, and there's not nearly enough of these anymore. 9/10.

On a side note I watched Romancing the Stone before this to compare. It's not the same movie. There are ""nods"" to it but in no way is this a rip off.

9 April 2022,A Fun Jungle Movie That Had Good Jokes BUT....,"The Lost City is funny, and had solid performances by Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, who's banter made the movie very enjoyable, and the jokes they have are (Most of the Time) Comedy Gold, but once in a while, they drop really cheap jokes, which make me question what the movie's purpose even is. But, for a comedy movie, even if you have a bad story, if you deliver on the laughs, you have a good movie. And yes, this movie did have a messy story, but it was saved by the laughs the movie brought to the table. Daniel Radcliffe's villain only had like 15 Minutes of Screen Time throughout the entire movie, but everytime he was on screen, it was a good performance. It will not make it to my top movies of the year, but it did give me some laughs I really needed.

6/10 is a solid rating for The Lost City in my opinion.

7 November 2022,Despite Bullocks energetic performance there's no chemistry with Tatum to make this work,"It's not clear whether directors Adam Nee and Aaron Nee set out to remake Romancing the Stone (1984) and update it for a new generation but it sure feels like it, and a playful poster spotted in the lobby of a hotel early on in the movie certainly hints at it. So while this is a mildly amusing action adventure romp that moves along at a brisk pace I wasn't totally swept along by the premise like I was with Robert Zemeckis' movie and I think this was due to some of the casting.

Sandra Bullock is excellent as romantic novelist Loretta Sage who gets caught up in a kidnapping after promoting her latest book and finds herself on a remote island in the jungle in the middle of nowhere with her cover model Channing Tatum in tow. Thinking that Loretta has insider knowledge about a lost ancient city which features in her fictional novel, a billionaire tries to get her to solve the whereabouts of the real ancient city so he can get his hands on the hidden treasure.

It's a nice idea but is sadly let down by the casting of Tatum who may have the looks and physique but doesn't possess the required charisma or on screen chemistry with his female lead to pull it off like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner did in both Romancing the Stone movies. I get that the filmmakers are trying to flip the strong macho male lead cliche by making Bullock's character the stronger braver one which is a nice touch and obviously sits better with a modern audience, but the whole premise hinges on the relationship between the two leads which for me just doesn't work. You feel that the filmmakers are just going through the motions trying to channel their inner Indiana Jones rather than come up with something new.

The other mistake was casting Daniel Radcliffe as billionaire Abigail Fairfax who I found to be totally unconvincing. He seems too young to be the villain and shows little menace as the unscrupulous kidnapper hell bent on getting his hands on the treasure. The films saving grace though comes in the form of Brad Pitt who, although only having a brief appearance as CIA operative Jack Trainer, steals the scenes he's in which makes you realise Channing Tatum's shortcomings.

The Lost City delivers some thrills and escapism, and it's fun to see Bullock stranded in the jungle wearing a totally inappropriate pink sequined jumpsuit which adds to the ill equipped 'fish out of water' scenario she finds herself in, but the romance doesn't work, the comedy often falls flat and it's about half an hour too long.",5

21 April 2022,What Walts Watching,"This adventure is real, the heroes are not.

In fact, they were heavily plagiarised from 1984's ""Romancing The Stone"".

Still what we have here is a fun rom com where in one of those rare Hollywood moments the female lead, Sandra Bullock (Loretta) is older than her leading man and romantic love interest Channing Tatum (Alan) by 16 years.

It's refreshing when so many older men normally have women their daughters age draped on their arms.

Harry Potters' Daniel Radcliffe is back exploring caves but alive this time...unlike his ""Swiss Army Man"" role as ""Manny"".

This time he plays a rich, spoilt brat who needs to discover more than just a crown of jewels, but in doing so abducts a romance novelist who could be the key to deciphering the ""Lost City"".

While Tatum fills in for original choice Ryan Reynolds as the Fabio of this island adventure filmed in the Dominican Republic.

Channing has come a long way since dancing in Ricky Martin's ""She Bangs"" music video for $400.

Brad Pitt makes a cameo as ""Jack Trainer"" a life coach, guru & rescuer who has more of a Scatman Crothers effect...ala ""The Shining"".

In return Bullock will appear in Pitts action, comedy ""Bullet Train"" later this year.

It's all fairly formulaic and predictable, but it's still a pleasant way to spend just under 2 hours relaxing, watching the big screen and sharing a laugh with other cinema patrons.",7
22 June 2022,I had FUN,"I don't understand the low ratings. It feels like people want to take this movie seriously when it is not suppose to be serious. I had a lot of fun watching it and I am pretty sure that was the whole point. To relax and enjoy this light and silly movie. Made me feel happy. So thanks to everyone who made this one.

Oh, and all of you who rated this as a 1, because you found it dumb, maybe a bit of relaxing and taking things easier in life can help you be happier, just an advice from a silly movie lover.

4 January 2023,Bullock brings Romcom Back,"Pretty much a paint by numbers romantic comedy. You can even consider this as a reimagining of Romancing the Stone, that 80s adventure romcom. It pretty much has the forest, the action, and the mystery that 80s film had.

In here, Tatum, Radcliff, Cruise and specially Bullock takes charge to push a really been there and done that concept. They are realistically clicking AND all them have great chemistry. A concept almost foreign in a lot movie production this days.

Overall, its just forgettable and nothing special. This also proves that movie stars are just a different breeds of actor. Without any of those names above, I do not think this would have work quite well as this finished product has.

6 November 2022,Just didn't work,"I'm sure if it was the script, the directing or the lead actors, but this just didn't click for me. I'm fine with a remake of Romancing the Stone, but those are big shoes to fill and this one failed on main levels.

The leads seemed to lack the chemistry needed and although on a tropical island, the film just wasn't exotic or exciting. At one point there was a car chase and people were crawling on a truck and I noticed I was just bored by it. Although on paper it all sounds like fun, it simply didn't work for me and I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock. Wish I could clarify it better and I hope she'll continue to make romantic comedies, but something here isn't working.

Now I know why. Clearly they blew the budget on the lead actors, locations and effects.

Don't get me wrong; there are a few funny and cute moments, but this is not worth the price of a movie theater ticket these days, let alone drinks and popcorn.

Watch ""Romancing the Stone"" or even ""Jewel of the Nile"" instead and wait for this thing to hit Netflix with ads, lol.

17 June 2022,Worth a watch,"Those in the audience who remember the adventure movies from several decades ago may get a feeling of deja vu with 'Lost City', and that's not a bad thing. In no way is it on par with 'Raiders', or even 'Jewel of the Nile'--but it has a pleasing cast, a doable story if you don't look for too much logic, and a sense of fun. We all know Bullock has Oscar caliber acting chops, so she has a right to do something silly sometimes-and it's a delight watching her tap into her ditzy schtick. She plays well off Tatum's less-talented but serviceable reluctant-hero clone (the infamous ""cheek shot"" got him more attention than his acting) and they do radiate some charisma. It would have been interesting to see Brad Pitt in a bigger role rather than the precious few scenes he got, but all told it's worth at least one watch-just for the Saturday-afternoon movie-ness of it all.

4 March 2023,I don't like the characters.,"""COMEDY"". Forced, unlikable characters. Wierd sense of humor. Nothing funny, forced secularization of non attractive heroes. Not funny. Chqracters worry more what others think about them than being relatable. A lot of angry females and apologizing males. It takes a minute of your time at the beginning to explore gender of a mildly interesting character that is then becomes ridiculed. Everybody seems dumb, except for the bad guys. Not sure if it glorifies minorities of ridicules them. Only laugh I got from it was about an childish joke about a hamster. Overall it is a loose unrelated story about a bunch of people that seem to not belong, either cowardly or too confident. Totally unpalatable.

28 May 2022,A supposed conedy film that wasnt funny,"From start, it is disappointment to the end. The film tried to be funny but they arent funny, instead most of the jokes are stupid and lame. The story is lame and action pack was lousy. There are tons of illogic scenes too.

Such a high salaries actress acted with such a movie is a disaster. I wtched it because she was good in the past but this movie acting was poor. Furthermore, some freaking online news reviewed and lied how good some movies were but all of them were lousy.

I dont recommend to watch this lousy made movie, it wasted my time. The most I can give is 5.8/10 because Asian movies qualities are far better than this.

Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

20 July 2022,not bad,"This movie I was excited about because it is close to the Uncharted series, but this movie was more comedy than action, but the movie succeeded in making me happy, but I felt in some things illogical and there were moments that could have been better, but this movie was beautiful, but it was not the best I watched.

13 May 2022,Nice surprise,"This appeared on my Paramount+ Home screen. We new nothing about it but thought we'd give it a go. We were pleasantly surprised by how good it was. It's a silly movie that is well written with a lot of unexpected laughs. We'd love to see a sequel.

27 July 2022,Disappointing Comedic Rom Com,"Loretta (Sandra Bullock) is a writer of exotic romance novels and includes exotic places in her books. She gets kidnapped by a billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) who needs her to help locate The Lost City and the treasure within. Alan (Channing Tatum), who Loretta uses as a cover model on the covers of her books decides to be a hero and rescue her. Alan uses his meditation guru Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to help.

This is a disappointing Rom Com bordering on being annoying. Everything was forced. The only funny thing was when trying to get out of the jungle, Loretta, says, ""I'll drive"" and as she touches the car, it falls over the cliff. That was it. Yes, funny but was shown many times in the promos so we knew what would happen. Still it was funny. The script was okay, the execution of that script was lacking. Poor dialogues by others and incessant banter by Allen made no sense whatsoever. Like I said everything was disappointing.

The only bright spot in here was the performance of Brad Pitt as Jack Trainer. All went downhill after his scenes were done. Okay, okay, Daniel Radcliffe did okay with what he had to deal with. Sandra Bullock as Loretta, who Is the Kidnappee wasn't given memorable lines (and it's her show, bummer)

Notables: Patti Harrison as Alison, Loretta's Media Manager; Brad Pitt as Jack Trainer a Navy Seal turned CIA Agent and Trainer's scenes were spot on. DaVine Jay Randolph as Beth, Loretta's editor who finds a way to track Loretta down in that faraway jungle.

I expected better from Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. For what it's worth, they should never attempt comedy again. They are not good at it. Okay, maybe the script was at fault too. (3/10)

Violence: Yes Sex: No.

Nudity: No.

Humor: Hardly.

Language: No.

19 August 2023,Do yourself a favour...Watch Romancing the Stone instead,"Love Sandra and Chatum but they have no chemistry together.

If your make a rom/com action adventure. You need romance, comedy and action adventure.

This was so cribbed from the far superior Romancing the Stone ...but forgot to add the elements from the movie that made it so enjoyable ...

Michael and Kathleen had so much chemistry and the secondary characters were hilarious such as DeVitto and the drug dealer with his 'little mule'

The only person who knew the assignment was Pitt in this movie and his extended cameo was over too soon

And the mid credit scene...I believe references the writers only using 10% of their brain when they wrote this

I really wanted to like this movie. Such a waste.",4

21 July 2022,Not bad but I expected more?,"Not sure why this movie didn't live up to my expectations to be honest... maybe because I watched it on the plane? I don't know... it felt like every other movie of that genre and didn't really offer anything new. I just expected a little more depth from it but let's face it - it's just a silly summer movie. Definitely worth the watch though! Great laughs and a great time with two of the greatest ever!

29 October 2022,"Rom com action with no rom, com or action","I like the two leads. I generally like their other movies. This was terrible.

No chemistry between the stars. Nil, zero, zilch, nada.

Daniel Radcliffe playing the comedy bad guy should never happen again. Ever.

One star for the Brad Pitt cameo.

4 people apparently wrote this script. 4 people. Yes, I know you think I'm making this up, but I'm not. Script is so bad sandra Bullock resorts to the usual tripping up, falling over shenanigans she does in other films.

Romance nonexistant, comedy missing, action straight from a made for TV show from the 80s.

The only bright spot is the relatively short running time of 1hr 52 minutes. Sadly it overstays its welcome for 112 minutes.",1

27 March 2022,"A modern ""date night"" movie","With some wokeness sprinkled in!

Literally the best part of this movie was Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. However outside of that 10 minutes or so, is just eye candy for the ladies with Channing Tatum, Brad Pitt and if you are somehow into ""men"" like Daniel Radcliffe.

What do the guys get or this modern ""date night"" Movie ? A old Sandra bullock in a shiny dress that she cannot fill out, looking all her 56 years of age. A morbidly obese woman with abnormally huge eyebrows, playing the publicist of Bullocks character.

For the wokeness, it is small but in some scenes it is obvious with the ""powerful whamen"" message & misandry of the men by portraying them as buffoons.

To Conclude: The story is an adventure which moves along at an OK pace, and the ending is decent at the adventures conclusion, however only go see this if you REALLY love your wife or owe her something.",4

10 November 2022,The lost opportunities as no romancing the stone for sure.,"I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock so was very disappointed with this film as not up to the quality I'm use to in her movies ( as the script was too ridiculous ).

The basic premise was a good idea & if the film had Channing Tatum & Brad Pitt both vying for Sandra's affections throughout & the film took itself much more seriously ( with the character motivations & what a real person would actually do in each situation ) then the comedy moments could have had a good contrast as the film has to feel more real for the comedy to work best.

A truly great film is Romancing the stone & this film is quite similar to that except this film The lost city is half as good & barely watchable once really.

The script needed to be more serious adventure based instead it was more like a comedy sketch film where the characters were way over the top silly.

I was expecting a good romantic adventure ( with humour ) & got a poor film as I felt a bit sorry for Da'Vine Joy Randolph ( who played Beth Hatton ) as her character arc would have worked a lot better in a more serious film, but the script really was not helping the talented cast this film had in it, though Daniel Radcliffe is just not good in his role as a villain ( apart from Harry Potter I've never seen him do well in any other part including this role ).

I think Daniel Radcliffe needs to play a nice guy & trying to act in roles that don't suit his real life personality just doesn't translate in film, so instead of trying to distance himself from Harry Potter just be a nice English gentleman as it's much easier to play a role that is more similar to your real life self.

Only true great character actors can play believable villains & that comes from years of putting the work in usually in theatre to understand how to do it.

So the film is a 5 out of 10 ( not worth buying but is worth watching once ).

Just go into with low expectations & know it is a silly attempt as adventure.",5
31 May 2022,It's exactly what it intended to be and that's not a problem,"It's cotton candy. It's popcorn. No, even better it's popcorn's fancy cousin Fiddle-Faddle. The butter-toffee kind. Sandra Bullock is a grieving, reclusive romance-novel writer, a Danielle Steel or Nora Roberts type (I had to google romance writers cuz I have no idea). Channing Tatum is her Fabio. It riffs on Romancing the Stone and others of that ilk. Boy and girl who don't get along falling in love over the course of an unlikely adventure. I didn't need to see so much of Channing Tatum's backside, but to be honest if my butt looked like his I'd be waving it around too. And I'm a straight guy.

It's fun and engaging and at a time when it seems reality just keeps throwing haymakers (Monkey-Pox? Seriously?) an engaging distraction is what I needed, even though I didn't know it.

29 April 2022,Perfect for a weekday movie night,"I watched the movie with a hungarian dub, so jokes might be different for English watchers.

The movie achieves the goal of being a fun, not overly emotional and lightly romantic comedy. The jokes are nothing new, but they're still really funny, and there are very few cringe moments in the movie, which I think is a huge plus. I would suggest watching this with friends, even tho there is not much you can think about later about it I hope if you watch it, you'll like it for the lighthearted piece of cinema that it wants to be.

If you like silly action comedies with a bit of romance you'll enjoy this flick.

Was it a bit long? Yea. Was the beginning a bit slow? Ah ha. Did her pink bedazzled jumpsuit get old? 100%

16 May 2022,A bad version of Romancing the Stone,"Where to start? Underdeveloped characters, storyline, plot, poor editing poor everything -A movie can be silly/stupid and fun this just simply is not (outside of Brad Pitt's character). This movie borrowed from everything that worked better and originally before it stole from them -primarily Romancing the Stone, Jewel of the Nile and Raiders of the Lost Ark (check car chase scene). My wife and I were thinking it'd be a silly, stupid fun rom-com worth watching but really it's just stupid and not worth it. Watch the much better version of it Romancing the stone or even True memoirs of an international assassin..

6 May 2022,Watched it for Tatum,"It's not bad but also could have been better. If they added more puzzle solving and adventure like Indiana Jones, this movie could have been a solid adventure comedy, much like the Mummy.

The jungle looks fake sometimes, the trees were just too clean, and some of the cgi scene could have been better.

Brad pitt cameo scene was hilarious, but after that it went so so. Also some illogical thing like that thin paper being so resistant to water and wrinkle and anything (just having it inside a plastic doesn't mean it is safe...). Why did the bad guy even gave the real copy instead of just a photocopy. You don't even need the real thing to decipher it.

Tatum was excellent though. I love sandra bullock, but her character is a bit of hit and miss in this movie. I do like the little background that they gave her, how she lost her husband and that tied kinda tied in to the last scene of the movie, and also the fact she was given a new love too.

Overall, it could be better. Not a bad watch but could have been better.",6
22 July 2022,Okay but forgettable,"Not really sure what to think of this movie. It's fine, but very forgettable. Some of the jokes work and some don't. A solid choice if you just want to watch a somewhat funny action movie and don't have any high expectations.

3 December 2022,Good if you know what you wanted.,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

19 June 2022,not bad,"This script is not as good as some of Bullock's other comedies, and at times, she is almost a parody of characters she has played in the past. So, there is nothing new from her here, but she is always good and interesting to watch, and Tatum and Pitt manage to add some pizzazz to the story playing very likable and fun characters, and Radcliffe is an intriguing villain. All in all, not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, with some laughs along the way, but I doubt that this will be one of your favorite or most memorable comedies.

The story is a bit stupid but that's what makes it funny. The way the characters develop through the plot is incredible. The little part of brad pitt in the movie are epic moments. Actually the movie is very entertaining and fun to watch with friends and family.

17 April 2022,Romancing the city,"An ok film' which could have been better . The film has some comedy and action. It is a bit similar to Romancing the Stone and the Indiana Jones films but not as good as either . Brad Pitt is the standout in the little role he has . Daniel Radcliffe Is not bad as the villain . The film drags at times until it's inevitable conclusion.

25 April 2022,Random,"This movie felt so random and the jokes half the time didn't hit or were just weird. I overall didn't think this movie was the greatest or the worst. It's just a mid movie. Bullock and Tatum have decent chemistry and Brad Pitt was good for the little time he was kn. I overall thought this movie was just Mid.

26 March 2022,Started off good.... Last 1)2 was mediocre.,"What a shame. First half was so good. And the laugh started when they killed Brad Pitt in a violent gory way. He was integral to the comedy. He was the serious person that everybody else could play off of. And they killed them off very early on.

29 May 2022,Only Sandra Bullock works!,"The movie is strictly for Sandra Bullock fans. Thread bare story line with serious plot holes and no originality. It's like watching ""Dora and the City of Gold"" with Jungle cruise thrown in and those two are hardly phenomenal movies. Yes Sandra Bullock looks awesome for her age but she has zero chemistry with Channing Tatum. And which book cover model is famous, not one book that I can think of, so the character is absurd in the first place. You are supposed to cheer for a guy who is shown as farcical and dumb at the start, this pairing will absolutely fail.

The comedy works because of Sandra Bullock else I am wondering how did this movie make so much money with such a thin cliched plot.

28 April 2022,Meh!,"Channing Tatum in a comedy movie just didn't work for me. His acting was dull & shallow almost awkward! His better off with the Magic Mike type of movies. Brad Pitt as leading man could have saved this movie.

16 May 2022,Unbelievably Bad,"Impossibly stupid. Brain-dead script relies on trite cliches that really go nowhere and then sundown on the viewer. Channing Tatum is a hamburger unsuccessfully searching for cheese, mustard and relish. He just doesn't belong in this movie. Sandra Bullock has more chops, but the script lets her down. The supporting cast all stink except for Radcliffe, who is way over the top but ok in this steaming pile.

Do not waste your time on this insult to audiences everywhere.

17 July 2022,Adventure comedy with 80/90s nostalgia,"Maybe I've missed something but this movie ain't as bad as most reviews say. Actually it's a fun adventure movie with a great cast. As a fan of this genre, I can say that there wasn't a single moment the story got boring. I would give it a 7.5 if I could. I had some good laughs. I love Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile and this movie is just as fun.

29 April 2022,Not great but pretty good,"Well, i must say... it was a pretty good movie. I wouldnt say great but it was pretty good, entertaining, nice to watch n some good action bits in it. But my expectations from the trailer, was that it was gonna have abit of an Indiana Jones feel. Where there's more mystery n adventure in it. But feels like, not enough of it. It felt like, it was missing something. As some movies r graded with the A's, B's n C's, i would give this a B++. I would probably watch it again but it wouldnt b something i would rush to watch.

28 February 2023,A Bit of Fun... but Very Forgettable,"Now if you say the opposite and will remember this tor the rest of your life, I would be surprised.

The Lost City is about a novelist who writes treasure hunting stories. Together with the main actor who acts out her stories onscreen, they wound up in a real treasure hunt, wrought with dangers (superficially) and window dressed with a lot of humor, some of which is pretty funny. It's a comedy more than a treasure hunt adventure.

It's all good fun. John Cena and Brad Pitt are quite charismatic. Sandra Bullock played a familiar part, not unlike her role in Two Weeks Notice. Daniel Radcliffe was ok... I feel he has a tendency to overact.

The plot is not much to write home about.

You'll be watching this mainly for the chemistry between John Cena and Sandra Bullock. It wasn't so electrifying for me.

Feminists will not be pleased that an intellectual of a woman succumbs to the romance of a meat head, if you care about that angle.

And that purple dress bothered me throughout the entire movie!",5
28 March 2022,Good Movie and Great Casting,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

30 December 2022,"Predictable but fun, kind of Romancing the Stone modernised","This is lots of fun, silly, funny and enjoyable.

Mostly predictable but lots of fun. Was expecting a modernised Romancing the Stone and that is apt. The parts are perfectly cast and good to see Sandra Bullock back in the type of character she does so well. Channing Tatumn is fun as the hunk and Brad Pitt who would have once played the Tatum role is hilarious in his bit part.

It's a good Friday night escape the world movie. Yeah it's not the most original or best shot film, but that's missing the point. I actually found it a lot funnier than expected but having moderate expectations helps.

Have a few drinks, don't expect much and enjoy the fun.

Not really funny and the film just dies after a while. One of those films where you can go and make a cup of tea, come back 5 mins later and still know the story.

I was hoping for more from Sandra Bullock but I think with this she has had her day.

25 March 2022,The lost city - A lost city and a film that lost its way finding it,"In the world of American commercial cinema, one thing is clear: Sandra Bullock is the queen of the rom com. From ""The Proposal"" (2014), to ""Two weeks notice"" (2002), or even ""Miss Congeniality"" (2000), Bullock has delivered a string of hits that aren't of the highest quality but are enjoyable enought to be successful. This is also the case with ""The lost city"", which, while being on a higher level than most of Bullock's previous work, fails to deliver a completely satisfying result due to its unsuccessful mix of romance, drama and comedy.

In the first scene of the film, we are introduced with a sequence à la ""Le magnifique"" - a 1972 spy parody by Philippe de Broca- to our heroine, the writer Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) and her partner, Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum). These two are trapped in a temple à la Indiana Jones and are almost eaten by snakes. Then, something happens: Loretta can't believe what she sees. Nothing is logical, and everything disappears. It turns out all that was just the imaginary universe where her next book, ""The lost city of D"" takes place. It seems, though, that her book's plot is as illogical to her audience as to Sage. And so, it becomes a complete failure.

The only person who cares about the books is a millionaire with the apparently gender-neutral name Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He is convinced that the book gives the instructions to find a lost city, with its legendary Crown of Fire. So, who better to kidnap in order to help him than poor Loretta? The only problem is, that Alan witnesses the abduction and calls a former Navy Seal, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to help him find her. When Alan is left alone by a sudden event, he will have to free Loretta and cross the jungle with her.

So starts this otherwise average film. And it is average because it doesn't know what it wants to be; a romantic comed, a laugh-out-loud movie, or a drama with space for character development. While it starts off as the second one, it slowly, develops into the first, and makes an unsuccessful attempt to become the third kind. To me, though, the result felt a bit dated, like these old Bullock hits I mentioned in the beginning of my review. Channing Tatum could easily be the new Hugh Grant or Ryan Reynolds on the side of Bullock, and if their adventure didn't take place in an ancient city but, in say, an office - of course this would require the plot to change a bit- it would without any doubt be a modernized ""The Proposal"".

Regardless, it needs to be said that Tatum and Bullock have good chemistry between them, which just grows stronger as the film progresses. Their best moments are those involving comedy, since they are both hilarious, Bullock with her trademark neuroticism, and Tatum acting as her completely antithetic companion. As for Radcliffe, his portrayal of the villain was maybe too passionate, with him getting annoying after two consecutive hours of hearing his rants and grand visions of finding the Crown.

It was the supporting cast that stole the show; Da'Vine Joy Randolph shines as the overstressed manager of Bullock, her constant anxiety making for some unforgettable comedic moments. Oscar Nuñez, who plays an eccentric cargo plane pilot, is perfect as the friendless, desperate for some adventure character. Even Patti Harrison, the actress that here interpreted Bullock's social media manager, is given some excellent lines, with her total indifference to the seriousness of the situation (Bullock being kidnapped) and her fixation with her client's online popularity giving the film its desirable lightheartedness during the beginning of its second half.

There is a successful series of books called ""Why mummy..."" , where the heroine presents her life as a working mother of two recalcitrant children. Most chapters start with her describing what would be a perfect day, until reality comes and destroys everything. ""The lost city"" followed this structure, but up to a point. In my opinion, it could have transformed to a hilarious comedy of contradictions between Bullock's dreams of being a brave explorer and her real, bland life. Being a more challenging form of story, this could of course turn off some viewers, but the film wouldn't lose its commercial character at all, actually improving it with an intelligent concept.

For all its faults, ""The lost city"" is a film that deserves most of the praise it's getting, since it accomplishes its goal; to be an engaging feature with likeable characters, using its actors' talent well, and offering what I would simply call a typical Bullock vehicle.",6
26 April 2022,Best seen on the small screen,"6/10

Only watch this at the movies if you have time to kill.

A few surprising moments. Otherwise lots of laughs.

But of course this is meant to be a Love story catering to a female audience. So take snacks otherwise to get you through the Love theme scenes.

Almost 2hrs of my life lost & the price of the dvd. The script didn't work with the cast & all I can say that it was catastrophic at best, whatever they spent on this movie it was too much & shouldn't have even left editing. I want my 2hrs back and my money, save yourself from the time wasted & watch something else. I would say it couldn't be any worse but I would be lying.

14 May 2022,Hilarious brilliance crazy heart warming mood fix cheer up adventure,"The Lost City is one hell of an amazing crazy ride full of joy, delicious laughs and brilliant narrative with stellar performance of main cast, Channing always great, Sandra in shape, Brad razor shape with ""once upon a time in hollywood"" glorious flashbacks and Daniel always a delight when playing some little messy upstairs maniacs.

I don't get the horrible ratings of this movie, I'm certain we saw completely different movie...

It's not 10/10 which i rated, it's legit clean 9/10, with sour mood 8,5/10, but this brilliant light comedy deserves some justice so I'm balancing those outrageous ratings, I feel sorry for everyone giving it below lets say 4/10, You cannot even possibly argue and admit why do you actually hated this movie so bad, you expected heavily complex ambitious sci fi mystery horror drama cyberpunk? That's the only justify of 1/10 rating... Wtf is going on in your heads? Ridiculous, as far as I'm concerned, The Lost City wasn't advertised as deeply complex mentions of genres above, it was supposed to be fun entertaining light adventure comedy AND IT CERTAINLY DELIVERED, period.

Rate the movie by it's genre please, good comedy should give you great time, lighten up the mood and give a good laugh, good horror should chill your spine, good drama should definitelly spice your eyes unless your emotionless stone. I can't even remind of myself when was the last time I had such a great time in terms of laughter and good time, Bad boys for life possibly?

Highly recommended movie, 2 hours off the gray abominable view of the outside which is real life, once for a week to month you just gotta blow off some steam and watch something cheering up, not dramas and horrors all the time ffs, let's be human. Amazing movie, especially nowadays with insanely flat low tier ocean of movies with just ""woke press"" and terrible humour draining your remaining braincells.

Excellent job, thank you,

Final conclusion : 9/10, movies like these are rare gems these days, you will appreciate it one day or another. Good comedy isn't easy to obtain sadly, there will be always a viewer target with too high iq, too low iq, different taste of humour and sensitivity, you can't please them all....",10
10 May 2022,Good cast and not much else.,"This is star studded cast for sure. But this movie proves that a great cast can only do so much with a generic story and bad writing. Maybe it's the feeling that this should have been a straight to streaming movie, or maybe it's because we've seen about 5000 movies just like this, but The Lost City was miserable to watch. The cast holds this movie up... not easily though. You can tell they're holding it up but the legs are shaking a lot. It's a generic plot that's extremely predictable and older people who don't watch many movies might swear they've seen this before. To be rewarded for a great cast though I believe you should have to do something with that cast and they don't do anything special with them here, the main characters feel like cameos in a much worst film. For that I think this film deserves an average rating, nothing worst because there are way worst films in this genre but just average. Wait for home release when it's free on something.

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

4 October 2022,Below Average Fun movie,"The only factor to praise Lost City is the efforts taken to film maximum number of scenes in practical backgrounds. The beautiful island landscape where the movie is set is its biggest pro. Sandra Bullock's fun free style performance supported by Channing Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe adds to the entertainment of the movie. The colorful action sequences serve their purpose of making this flick watchable. Climax is another thing that saved this one from more problems by delivering a satisfying end. Last but not the least Brad Pitt steals the show with his role 😁.

However, none of the jokes seem to land for me, the B grade sequence is the worst part of the movie that ruined the experience for me. Prolonged dance sequence is another dull factor of the movie. Finally, the unwanted fan service mid credits adds to the disappointment of the movie.

Lost city with its ensemble cast is a below average entertainer that improves as it goes on!

20 April 2022,Adverts was better,"When I seen the adverts, I recollected Jewel of Nile and Romancing of Stone, so I was keen to see how it compared. There was some plot and character resemblance but it was mostly nothing like what I had imagine it could be. I was a guy (not the only single guy in the cinema I might mention) in a movie theatre where mostly women were having moments of laughter. For me, I felt like I was watching a week-day midday flick.

17 August 2022,"""Romancing the Stone"" knockoff that misses on the humor","From the basic plot right down to some individual gags and scenes, this feels like a poor counterfeit of ""Romancing the Stone."" Not only does it lack originality, but it isn't very funny either and proves yet again that even with a good cast - which it does have - you cannot overcome a weak script.

I would be lying if i was to say that there were some scenes i didnt enjoy. I really enjoyed the brad-pitt cameo, but the plot of this movie was weird and okish. This movie is a solid 6.1/10 for me.

25 June 2022,Goofy action movie,"Sandra Bullock as a writer, Channing Tatum as a model, Daniel Radcliffe as a vilain, and a jungle, what more to ask? A naked Channing Tatum? Check too. I genuinely laughed during the movie, it's a goofy action movie, where things don't always make sense, jokes are plenty, and you just have a good time with the characters (some of them could not be here and the movie would be the same, but hey, they are still in it)

22 May 2022,It was just alright. 3 out of 10.,"Well, it's not that funny. I chuckled 2 or 3 times. There just wasn't any chemistry between Sandra and Channing. She was born in 1964 and he in 1980, so that might have had something to do with it. Daniel Radcliffe was pretty good as the villain, and Brad Pitt did a nice cameo.

The soundtrack wasn't memorable except for the opening song, then of course, Dash tells us that he has a masters in gender studies. Excuse me while I retch from the wokeness. Thankfully, it didn't get much worse then that. Oops, I forgot about Radcliffe's characters gender neutral name, was it Aubrey? Wokeness meter was 3 out of 10, just like the movie rating.

I almost stopped watching halfway through, and said to myself, ""When is this going to make me laugh?"" I did stick it out, though. Watch it again, or recommend it to a friend? No way.",3
30 June 2022,"Funny a bit, not so good a bit.","Trailer of this movie promised much comedy, but couldn't find that in the movie. Yes, there is comedy & I liked it, but I expected much more hilarious content. Love story between the leads was dull. On the whole it fared average, story wide & comedy wise.

14 August 2022,It's okay.,"An author writes a novel believing it to be fiction only to find out it's all real. It's a seemingly perfect concept on paper, (pun intended), but the execution falls short. Lots of the jokes don't really land and the plot never seems to go in a satisfying direction. It's a bit entertaining, but I can't really say much else. Overall, it's mediocre.

6 September 2022,I wished Santa Bullock didn't get Botox,"I wish Sandra Bullock didn't get Botox. She looks so much better before. I thought the movie was OK I love her as an actress so pretty much anything she's in a watch Channing Tatum's not that bad either and how can you deny Brad Pitt lol. I thought there were a few very laughable moments and Sandra bullocks personality comes out more in this movie. I like Brad Pitts part the overacting and all that was was good I wish it was in the movie just a little bit longer. Not a bad movie to curl up with a soft warm blanket on a rainy and chilly afternoon! I wish Sandr would make more movies! Like Practical Magic II 😊

4 September 2022,Not as bad as ppl make it out to B,"Lets pre empty this with....yes, I am a SB fan. Love her (most anyway!)movies for what they are: fun escapism.

When I saw the trailer 4 this pic, I thought straight away of RTS (1984) but the vibe seemed more comedic.

I started watching it last night and didn't expect to laugh as quickly as I did.

Definetly a great turn from the main cast.

Though on its own Tatum's performance is up to par and self mockingly funny, I think he was miscast against Bullock.

I agree with others that the chemistry between them was a bit lacking. Maybe bcs of the age difference, the romance would have been better done with an older lead against SB.

I mean, they do poke fun/don't try to hide her age, so an older, maybe a bit out of shape (wanting to recapture his youth) male lead would have enhanced the comedic parts and allowed for a more, I believe Hollywood likes to refer to it as 'organic' romance. This would have also helped the contrast with the Brad Pitt (perfect specimen) alternative love interest.

A quick shout out to Radcliffe as well as he camps up his baddie just enough, whilst keeping him believable as a whiny spoilt rich manchild.

Last but not least, yes I enjoyed SB performance.",

27 March 2022,Remake of romancing the stone but worse not funny,"This movie is like a remake of romancing the stone. It's updated to 2022 however it's worse than that movie. The premise is the same and some of the scenes are the same and Sandra is even wearing the same 80s clothing but it's worse and boring. I saw the trailer and didn't think it was funny. Everything in the trailer is at the beginning of the movie. I kept waiting for something fun or funny to happen but nothing was happening. The film drags it's not much of a comedy. I don't Understand why the critics gave it a good review. I recommend the original romancing the stone to watch. Sandra Channing and Daniel and Brad are all ok but the script is so boring. I don't understand why the critics liked this film. There's a mid credit scene.

27 January 2023,Funnier than I expected,"Watched this with low expectation, but it turned out to be a decent, fun light-hearted adventure comedy. Great chemistry from both lead actors, the jokes were stupid sometimes but still hilarious, and the addition of Brad Pitt as the super badass ex-soldier Jack Trainer (even only for a brief time), made everything better. Daniel Radcliffe delivered a great performance as the movie villain, though I can't say the same about the writing. There were few scenes that felt dragged just a bit too long for the sake of jokes, but it's only a minor complaint from me and the movie was still very enjoyable to watch, at least compared to other similar jungle adventure movies from the last few years.

7 October 2022,A derivative missable mess,"Been a fan of Sandra Bullock's since Love Potion #9 - been a few clinkers, but I seriously never thought she would do one like this. At 58, is she trying to relive her earlier success? Hard to say. Brad Pitt and Channing Tatum have moments (very few!) and the lack of chemistry is painfully apparent. The action is stilted, the plot is incredibly derivative. Imagine the worst moments of The Rundown (well, at least it was fun!) Indiana Jones 2 and 4, the few bad parts of Romancing the Stone, mash them together with Daniel Radcliffe as a colorlessly unthreatening guy. Oh, and Sandra pretty much phones in her part, too. Find something better to do for two hours, like watching paint dry.

The cast was good, but the script just wasn't there. There were a few good lines, and Brad Pitt stole every scene he was in.

All in all, A complete waste of time, and talent.

Sad to see.

12 May 2022,"Modern reconfiguration of well-worn adventure, I hate then love you, slapstick, White-centric movies","For a person under 20, for whom this is going to the first adventure-action movie in life, this movie is amusing and reasonably well produced. It contains three known actors: S. Bullock, T. Channing and D. Radcliff, with a few scenes with B. Pitt. The casting, from a believability viewpoint, wasn't ideal. S. Bullock is both outside of the demographics to be a credible character and David Radcliff, who excelled at playing a nerdy wizard child, now seems like a child with a child's voice and strident mania, who is an unconvincing ""baddie"".

Only Channing seems more or less well cast even though it is a bit of a stretch that a 40 year old of his appeal would be a) unattached, b) so naive about women and c) fit enough to play the role.

This was basically a reconfigured rehash of different past movies that was a ""money maker"" - nothing more.",6
3 November 2022,The lost talent,"This is absolutely dire! I expected to look on this page and see people panning it. Where is the comedy? What action? I thought that Sandra Bullock could act but that proved to be untrue. Not high expectations for Channing Tatum but actually he has comic timing, he just had a God awful lame script. Seriously I can't believe that there are people on here giving this a score of 10 who thought it was hysterical and that there was chemistry between the leads. I found myself double checking that I had the right movie! I resented giving this pile even one star but perhaps it was worth that for casting Harry Potter as a bad guy.

16 October 2022,Appreciate it for what it is!,"If you watch this movie expecting it to be a life changing, Oscar winning film - yeah, you'll be disappointed. I feel like a lot of people have unrealistic expectations of the movies they watch. This is a lighthearted, RomCom with in my opinion, a lot of very funny moments. I laughed out loud many times throughout. Sandra Bullock is of course incredible in it and makes a lot of the more emotional scenes very believable and touching. I'm not a huge Channing Tatum fan, but I definitely didn't hate his performance. If you watch this movie expecting it to be something it's not, you won't enjoy it. But it is a really fun and silly movie that I will definitely watch again!

26 March 2022,Ok movie if you have nothing else to do,"The good- had a decent story and liked the twist at end. Some funny moments, most in the Brad Pitt scene. Channing Tatum was pretty good in his character. Brought some nice comedic moments.

The bad - Sorry, Daniel Radcliff as villain was not great. It was reminiscent of his role in Now You See Me 2, which was annoying. The pacing is disjointed. There are some parts that could have really used some editing.

The ugly - most of the secondary characters are a why. It's as if they just needed to hire a few more people and wrote them in like the characters of Allison and Oscar. Both were annoying and didn't fit in at all.

11 August 2022,A little too much cheese,"Not a bad movie, but the chemistry between Sandra & Channing could be better. Maybe it's the age difference. It's supposed to be a comedic romance, but I got a cross between Raiders of the Lost Ark & Miss Congeniality.

.. AND if that wasn't bad enough, Brad Pete's Two-minutes cameo was additional nails to the coffin of producers desperate attempts to lure people to watch this D-rated performance!

23 April 2022,Good chemistry but not as good as Bullock and Reynolds,"Hoping to share a similar success by pairing Sandra Bullock who in my opinion can do no wrong, with a heart throb actor (Channing Tatum) in a romantic comedy, The Lost City is an inoffensive safe choice.

Great cast, fun storyline and some comical writing with more than a few giggles, but no laugh out loud moments.

I did enjoy the adventure/romance hybrid theme, and Bullock and Tatum's characters were reminiscent of Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser in 'The Mummy'. They had good chemistry, but not as good as her and Ryan Reynolds in 'The Proposal'.

Not an awful film, but certainly not the best of the year.

Also I'm not sure if Sandra Bullock is not funny or if she just plays annoying characters? The writing was very 2012 and the best part of the movie was seeing Brad Pitt LMAO.

I didn't care for any of the characters at all, and the storyline was dumb.

It seems like the writers just threw a script together because it wasn't funny, and the premise was stupid, especially the ending. I felt like I walked a long way to find the corner store closed.

(i mean the jokes).. i laughed and the landscapes and the great cast levels up the hole movie... grab some popcorn and hung out solo or with your friends to entertain yourself...

26 August 2022,Better,"I expected nothing from this movie so I avoided it for months. It's better than I thought it would be. I actually enjoyed it. Brad Pitt is a plus. Channing Tatum's body, another plus. I liked Sandra Bullock being the same uptight person she's played before. It was easy to suspend reality while watching. All of the characters made sense and the thick black chick saves everyone. Cheesy rom com is back! Now I can get a break from superheroes and mutants.

16 November 2022,"Easy movie, still not as funny as expected","It is a pity that such actors make such movies or are invited to such movies- too easy and almost just for the show or just to be distributed in any movie. And a pity that nowadays not even a comedy raises to expectations as to laugh at least half of the time from the movie.

Yes, the plot is funny but in the same time naive - the writer is kidnapped and no one wants to find her; her manager flies by herself to the remote island, finds some random people to help her and, somehow, appears on a boat where the writer and her friend are escaping, just in time to save them. I just wished that this is not another money maker but a bit more.

Had to watch the whole thing to see if it would get any better but it did not. This is literally the last film Sandra Bullock's going to make before taking time off from acting this is the way you're going to go out with this garbage. And why would Brad Pitt be in this junk just goes to show there's no good movie scripts anymore.

Maybe because it did have hints of a throw back, but that's what makes it so fun to watch. I just loved it. I saw it in theaters when it first came out and just re-watched it with my teens at home.

The people who wrote this think comedy is having a character narrate/comment every move that happens; Bullock has never been funny as the straight man and needs a silly supportive cast to make her seem funny.

8 August 2022,"Zero story, Radcliffe as weak as usual!","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

But why is the love insterest young enough to be her son. She could have given birth to hun when she was 22nd old. Put that in your mind n then try watching it and then being romantic. I also don't agree with how older men have younger romantic partners in films either. So let's stop this nonsense

I love Sandra but why not have someone her own age we all know that a big gap like that in age doesn't actually work out in real life.

If u don't know how old they actually are in real life then it might have worked out but honestly why do this just to be woke so gross.

11 September 2022,Very good modern romantic comedy,"In today's very low TV standard, one disappointment after another, this movie has been very refreshing and enjoyable to watch.

The biggest plus was no forced wokism, no forced jokes (Im speaking to you, MCU...), no forced gender and other political BS. Simply a romantic comedy, like the ones in old times + modern trends (technology + new age stuff which served well for character development) . A little bit silly, but not overly stupid (ekhm, anyone seen ""Love and Thunder""?....) to the point of unwatchable. The movie was just like classic romantic comedies, very silly but funny and light. There was absolutely NOTHING cringy in this movie in a bad way, which again should be standard for all movies but sadly is hard to come by nowadays. Daniel Radcliffe made such a good villain, I think he was cast perfectly for this role and Im happy for him that he is trying out his skills in different genres as different characters, good for him. He did a great job! Overall, all actors were great. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum was not a combination Id ever consider but they had such great chemistry throughout the movie! Alan was very likable and charming and relatable. Beth was awesome and very likable, I wish she had more time for development, would love to know more of her story!

Overall, I was very pleased with this movie. A perfect balance of humor, romance, and fantasy. The creators of this movie have proven that it IS possible to create a neutral movie for the purpose of enjoyment and entertainment solely, and they proven that romantic comedy is not dead and a modern spin on it makes for an easy and enjoable movie.",8
11 July 2022,I personally loved this movie!,"This was a great movie and it was hilarious! I enjoyed it from beginning to end and I loved Sandra and Channing's chemistry. To all the negative comments, you need to get your heads out of your arses and just enjoy the movie. Most of them just seem to be hate comments towards Sandra. If you don't like her why did you even choose to see the movie? Just so you can be negative and criticize everything... Shame on you and find something better to do with your time than write hateful comments.

Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer.

The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you?

31 July 2023,"Worth it on all counts, value for money film making.","With reportedly half the $68 million budget going to the four headline actors. 20, 10, 2, and 2 ( Bullock, Tatum, Radcliffe, Pitt). It is not surprising that production wise, this was never going to be a spectacular recreation of an actual lost city. Yes some nice tropical island locations and effective CGI where required, nothing breathtaking. But its effective, with enough eye candy to satisfy.

The strength of this movie is something that a lot (if not most) of the $200 million plus movies lack, which is Heart. The actors give of their best performances, they know this is a cheesy, rom com adventure, but its never overplayed as such, being just the right amount of self aware that lets the audience partake in the experience along with the actors, without ever being condescending. This makes it possible to forgive the inevitable plot holes, and contrivances, that pop up.

Its a funny, warm, if occasionally violent mix. An extra $40m spent on developing the plot, creating an actual lost city, and maybe some throwback scenes to the actual lost city story, would have fleshed this out to real Saturday night blockbuster level. But for a Friday night, or an afternoon matinee viewing, this makes for a rewarding 1 hour 50 of your time.",7
15 May 2022,same generic formula - not done better,"First thoughts - horribly miscast, agree with most that harry potter should not have been the villian but would also like to add that tatum should not have been the hero, for me they should have roles reversed.

Sandra B is great at playing what does does, looks like she has had a ton of work done but still looks great.

Brad pitt is a funny cameo.

Just below average as a whole. Been there, done that formula.

30 June 2022,This was terrible.,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason.

8 July 2022,Fluff,"It's a fluff film, you can have it on in background whilst working and still see what's going on!

The combo doesn't work Sandra B whilst still stunning I think some works been done face looked tight and emotionless for most of the film and I think it's makes her look older! And just a tad too old for the younger male. The 15ish year gap seemed noticeable (maybe be design) Still it wasn't the chemistry of the Bullock/Reynolds of the Proposal 2009 where the gaps played apon but still you got the feeling they wanted to go at it like savage beasts... I feel this would have been a straight to DVD film back in the day almost like half the turd fests Netflix pump out.

But it's got some fun and silliness to it so fair play.

19 August 2022,Boring,"This movie had such a potential :a great adventure, casting 5 stars, beautiful location.. but they failed miserably.

No chemistry between the actors, I like all of them but for whatever reason they do not work together.

Jokes are not funny. At all.

Editing was pretty bad and this weird feeling of a movie made in front of a blue screen.

The movie could have been better with a different director.

10 April 2022,Preview was better than the movie,"Watching the preview made me excited to go watch this movie in the theatre, however the preview exceeded the actual movie. Channing Tatum's acting is barely bearable. His comedy is not funny. Ryan Reynolds would have been a better casting. Brad Pitt did a good job in his cameo, and wow Sandra Bullock looks amazing for her age. The story was mediocre, and a few instances were funny, but it could have been better overall. However, if you want to let loose and enjoy a night out, it's not a terrible one time watch, but not anything to brag about.

I kept watching it thinking it was going to improve and get better, but it never did. I wouldn't waste your time unless you have nothing better to do.

31 July 2022,Does exactly what it says on the tin...,"If you are expecting a brilliant cinematic masterpiece you will probably be disappointed. If, however, you are expecting a fun-filled, action packed, over the top adventure/comedy/romance you will love it.

Sandra Bullock is her usual comedic top class act, her physical comedy is the best, Channing Tatum is never afraid to send himself up and does so to great effect as Dash and Daniel Radcliffe makes a first class comedy bad guy with a great balance of charm and villainy.

It is, to some extent, and updated Romancing The Stone, but loses nothing in that. The story really doesn't matter all that much, it's the formulaic searching for the lost treasure vibe, but all the charging around in the jungle is very funny - not least because Sandra Bullock does it all in a sequinned pink jumpsuit - kudos.

Brad Pitt is hilarious - he doesn't have a big part in the movie but he makes the absolute best of what he does have - and the vibe between him and Channing is terrific.

Just grab your popcorn, settle down on the sofa and have a good laugh. It's a feel-good movie with a great cast, and doesn't pretend to be anything else. I loved it.",9
11 April 2022,One or the Other needs to be Recast,There's no denying it was an entertaining enjoyable movie. The problem is something about Sandra Bullock's performance seemed off even awkward at times and I don't think that it was just her character. It feels like she was phoning it in and didn't particularly want to do this role or at least not with Channing Tatum. Once I found out there is a 16 year age difference between the two of them I have to figure that's what it is. I don't think she feels comfortable with him or maybe she didn't want to work with him. Everyone said she had good chemistry with Brad Pitt which she did and I think it might be because they're similar in age. There's still a pretty big age difference between her and Ryan Reynolds but I wish I hadn't heard that he was supposed to be cast because now I can't stop picturing him instead of Tatum since their chemistry in The Proposal was much better than what happened here. I do think Channing Tatum gave it his all. I also think he was much more excited to work with Sandra Bullock than the other way around. He wasn't bad either and though I love Sandra Bullock if I was going to recast her I'd probably do someone like Rachel McAdams. Again closer in age and they had good chemistry in The Vow. Plus perhaps her goofy nerdiness would have felt more genuine than Sandra Bullock's performance. Other than the off chemistry the movie is typical rom com material meets Unchartered (or yes Indiana Jones).,5

13 May 2022,Enough to keep you amused,"Nothing new here, just standard action, romance and intrigue in a family sort of way. There isn't much of a demand for deep acting or nuance, so the thrills and grins are light hearted. The story line is fairly predictable which is both annoying and comforting that the good guys do win. Daniel Radcliffe has to work hard to get his character to rise above buff and beauty, which he does admirably. Don't expect much logic or reason in the stunts, since it is a fantasy from the start. Just sit back and enjoy some easy going, light-hearted entertainment.

18 May 2022,Hilarious Quirky Dialogue Carries it,"Without going into a deep dive on whether or not talent was wasted, I recommend giving this movie a watch -- or rather a listen. It's not about the star quality. It's not about the plot. Or the setting. Or the state-of-the-art bang-bang. It's about the dialogue: hilarious and quirky. (I suggest putting the captions on, so you don't miss anything.) And the actors deliver their craft, so maybe it IS a little about star quality.

Oscar Nuñez is full-blown delight . Daniel Radcliffe shows off well-aged acting chops, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph is fabulous, as always.

But it's the quirky throw-away lines that make it. The story is just the toast on which the sweet dialogue marmalade is thickly spread.

21 August 2022,Funny movie for a weekend,"The movie starts with a promoting ceremony of Loretta's new book. Personally I like this plot because of the passion of reading from female authors. Wearing that sparkling pink dress, Loretta went for an obliged adventure with a handsome boy. Well, he is mature but looks like an amused boy in front of her. The adventure can be tough but it is present in a relax and hilarious way. Harry Potter gave an intense action. I heard the loud laughter from next seat when that guy who threaded dash fell in the cave himself. A happy ending.

Only complaint was Daniel Radcliff could have done more and maybe some more with Brad Pitt. Otherwise it was a enjoyable movie.

It reminds me of old school comedies from the 90s in multiple ways. It has a duo trying to achieve something a minor villain trying to stop them and a couple of big name cameos that pop up. By the end the duo has grown and become better the villain has been dealt with and the supporting cast get something too.

Throw it on and enjoy.

I found the film one of those fun sit back and relax family films where you don't have to do to much thinking to enjoy the film. I think my grandmother would even enjoy it being a harry potter fan. Maybe some of the topless seens might be a bit much for children..... but it wasn't over the top which I appreciated and the jokes were decent. I find so many comedy films these days stupid and over the top dirty jokes but this one was just perfect. I'd watch it again not because it was an amazing film but just because it wasn't a bad comedy.

20 July 2023,The Lost Movie,"I thought The Lost City was going to be similar to ""Romancing the Stone,"" the 1984 Robert Zemeckis film, starring Kathleen Turner as romance novelist Joan Wilder. Joan ventures out of the safety of her New York City apartment into a Colombian jungle to save her sister from smugglers. She meets Jack, and their romantic adventures begin, ultimately leading to Joan's next best seller. Meanwhile, Jack shows up in New York, to fulfill the the promise of more romance with Joan. The film captured a fan base & began an era of movies in the Rom-Com-Adventure genre.

The Lost City features Sandra Bullock as romance novelist, Loretta Sage. Loretta, a widow, has painfully cranked out another installment in her romantic adventure series, which features a dashing hero, aptly named Dash. Loretta is bullied by her publisher into going on tour to promote the book. Channing Tatum plays the part of Alan Caprison, a model who stars as Dash during a promo appearance. When Dash's long-tressed blond wig falls off, and he's out of character, he's just Alan, a bumbling puppy dog with a crush on Loretta. Meanwhile, Loretta is kidnapped by Daniel Radcliffe, a billionaire amateur archaeologist, for her translation skills (she's a closet nerd who writes romance novels to pay the bills). Radcliffe wants Loretta to decode some hieroglyphics in order to find lost treasure. Brad Pitt joins the action for a brief stint as a rescue consultant & spiritual adviser. He plays the part of a real Dash, in contrast to Alan. He's only there for the usual Brad Pitt sex appeal. Unfortunately, Tatum's attempt at bumbling humor, a la Ryan Reynolds, never gets liftoff. Bullock, a pro at comic timing, has nothing to work with here. Hence, her valiant attempts to inject humor fall flat.

Actually, the whole movie is just embarrassing. Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt, Channing Tatum, and Daniel Radcliffe surely had something better to do than get involved with this turkey.",2
13 May 2022,Brad Pitts cameo only,"Okay I just could not take it looking at Sandra Bullocks plastic face. The lack of natural movement in her facial expressions was disturbing. These famous female celebs are getting worse with the plastic surgery, better of using cgi to make them looking young than the plastic face on display.

Movie had its moments and there were with the much Talented Brad Pitt, but unfortunately he is only a little more than a cameo.

This sort of story has been done before with better lead actors and direction.

9 June 2022,Funny Movie,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

Opening in theaters on March 25, 2022.",9
15 May 2022,The first two minutes of Romancing The Stone is better than this full movie,"There are many things that can be said about this is meaningless trash of a movie.

The script is bloated to the max with useless, boring poorly written dialogue that doesn't take the movie ANYWHERE. Who greenlit this script? Why so many useless and unnecessary side characters like her manager, her managers mother, the social media manager, the guy that flies the cargo plane etc. All these characters could be cut from the script to make it tighter and more entertaining. Even the backstory about her dead husband made no meaning to the story.

If you are going to make an action adventure like Romancing The Stone or Indiana Jones you have to focus on

1. Chemistry in the acting. There was none at all except from a short cameo from Brad Pitt. Tatum and Bullock both phoned in this performance and I honestly can't blame them due to the state of the script.

2. Create a good and believable villain. Daniel Radcliffe did not pull this one of at all. Also him being a famous person from a famous family made no sense

3. Focus on action and adventure. This movie focused more on dull dialogue instead of pacing it up with some good action scenes. Every time something happened the movie stopped so Bullock and Tatum could talk about irrelevant stuff for 5 mins.

Avoid this movie at all costs and rewatch Romancing The Stone, The Mummy or Indiana Jones instead.",2
27 July 2022,Very simply? It's definitely 'worth your time'.,"While I can't say that this was the greatest movie in the world, it totally fits the bill for a silly romcom & unlike reviewers who clearly suffer from a pathetic level of ageism, Sandra Bullock is anything other than an 'old enough to be a grandmother' actress, when it comes to her performance in films.

This movie is cute, well acted, well cast & definitely keeps your attention. It's a silly, romcom that fits the bill for how it is being marketed.

Brad Pitt really does play a great character & it would have been nice if he had more scenes. His character is such a badass, but that's simply not how the story was written. As for the others: Sandra is great as Loretta - simply a classic Sandra Bullock character. She's uptight but lovable, a little snobby but deep down still humble & she's just silly enough to make it all work, Da'Vine Joy Randolph's performance as Beth is phenomenal, as is Loretta's social media asst Allison, played by Patti Harrison. I should also add the Daniel Radcliffe does a great job (of course) w his character, even though it's almost odd to see him as a bad guy. These are well cast, albeit silly characters & it 'works'.

This movie is not anything worthy of huge praise, awards or anything of that nature. It's just a fun, silly film, basically just being exactly what it says it will be - a silly adventure romcom taking place in a rather unique environment (which really is beautiful, BTW).

I don't know when everyone became such full-blown critics of every show & movie out there but had this been 10 years ago, at least 75% of these negative reviews would have been people who either didn't watch the movie, didn't bother to take their frustrations out on some IMDb review page, or just watched, shrugged it off & moved on. But these days everyone feels the need to complain about something, so take those reviews for what they're worth - people just want to criticize others constantly & everyone seems to think they are the next Steven Spielberg when half of the US (the world, maybe?) are just a bunch of frustrated, know at alls who really should not be writing reviews at all. :-)

I'm really not here to complain about the reviewers though, just trying to give the movie a fair review by pointing out that those who had the worst things to say tend to give one star on nearly EVERY review they post. These individuals only pop in here to diss films, so maybe don't take THEM too seriously :-)

Bottom line? I'd say just a ignore those negative peeps (remember, they give everything 1 star) in stride & give this fun flick a chance - I think most people will enjoy it.",8
6 August 2022,made me laugh out loud,"The first half was funnier than the second, where the romance started to dominate. But not many movies make me laugh out loud like that these days Most comedies feel like I've seen it all before and executed according to a formula. And yes it was way over the top, but charmingly so.

14 May 2022,Just not entertaining,"For me this was a huge disappointment all and all. Storyline was glued together from past megahit movies (Romancing Stone, Indiana Jones and so on) and I hate to say I could not tell difference between Sanda Bullock's character from The Heat or in this movie because they were the same. Chemistry with Bullock and Brad Pitt was perfect for that short time he was in the movie, pity. I felt like I was chewing old bubblecum with no flavor left anymore....

21 May 2022,I was not disappointed,"Been waiting ages for this film to come out as I was looking forward to seeing the interaction between the main 3-4 actors. I was not disappointed. It might not be the best movie of 2022 but it was funny, camp, sexy, and a happy ending. A great feel-good movie and we'll worth watching. I was going to give it a 7/10 but as Channing took all his kit off I'm going to give it 8/10.

15 June 2022,A Romancing The Stone rip off,"Watch the subject line film. That is all.

Not original. (They said my review was too short, so I added this and I'll keep talking as it is still not 150 characters. Channing keeps phoning it in. I guess as long as you are all thirsty, he'll keep getting cast. )

15 May 2022,No Chemistry Between Bullock and Tatum,"I was so looking forward to this film and disappointed to find it a snooze-fest. One reviewer is correct: it's a really bad remake of Romancing the Stone. I thought it had a King Solomon's Mines (1985) vibe to it, as well.

Bullock and Tatum have absolutely no chemistry and even though Sandra shines in some of her films, for the most part her talent is nowhere to be seen in this one.

I'm not sure why Tatum was cast.

Pitt was the only redeeming quality in this film. I know he was only supposed to have a cameo and he truly shined in his role.

Bottom line: what a bore.

17 May 2022,Not a classic but not awful.,"It passes the time. It pales in comparison to Romancing the Stone's humor or other adventure-rom-coms. It's saved by it's secondary characters, Daniel Radcliffe, Brad Pitt, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and others. I admit I'm not a fan of Channing Tatum and his buttcheeks. It has it's moments but no real surprises. Watch if you're easy to please ( and a bit zoned out if you catch my drift.)

31 July 2022,Terrible.,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

For what it was it had some pretty funny moments and a decent storyline that was simple, but kept it going. Definitely a movie to watch going in without high expectations but to just turn your mind off for a while and enjoy some adventurous entertainment.

And it was. I don't know what it is. Is it me not getting the ""humour"" of the second decade of the 21st century, or are things really falling apart? Gags and jokes are ridiculous most of the time. It's a random mess of dialogue and events really. And speaking of Sandra, she should stop taking up roles that aren't in line with her age. She doesn't look right anymore with all that plastic surgery and whatever they do to make actors and actresses look younger on screen.

8 October 2022,Tow point of views,"If Sandra Bullock is in the movie, I go see it! She never disappoints and everyone I know agrees! Channing Tatum was so, so funny - their chemistry was RIGHT ON. He has really come a long way from Mag Mike! His performance gave me the biggest laughs...really added/balanced Sandy's understandably sad character. Daniel Radcliff was equal parts awful but likable and so handsome n grown up. He was ridiculously elegant/cute as he was stupidly ineffective:) Da'Vine Joy Randolph, stunning, brilliant delivery and vulnerable-see a bright career for her, a stand out in every way!! Oscar Nunez' second movie with Sandy B and he always turns in seamlessly funny performance, The Proposal is one of my faves because of Oscar:) Brad Pitt can still rock it from A to Z, no question! The casting in the previews had me doubtful but WOW! Such a welcome and entertaining movie after the last 2.5 years! THANK YOU.

I Love Sandra Bullock. I am a lifelong fan. Channing Tatum, I have also been a fan from the start. I looked forward to watching this for a while. I rarely have time to watch movies. Incredibly beautiful balance in this movie. I love these two together. So much so that I really wish true love for both of you, and that is the first time I have ever wished that for anyone. Sandra did such a remarkable impression in creating this. I loved every element that was thoughtfully felt and part of this. The entire story fits together perfectly. Sandra, thank you for giving Channing an opportunity to stand up for his talent and skills, while also embracing your femininity in a natural strong way. I had no idea this would be so good on the sophistication and kind humor, romance, and adventure. From Boulder, Colorado .. so much love and blessings to you both, the entire caste and crew. Also, I appreciate the financial investment that made this film quality in all ways. God Bless you. Kerri 10 Stars.",10

18 April 2022,It does the job,"What can you expect from a comedy-romantic movie that also works as a parody of the classic family friendly adventure-in-the-jungle story? Precisely what 'The Lost City' gives you.

Well, maybe it's not that romantic. And maybe there are too many/absurd/easy jokes even during dramatic or tense situations. But again, it does the job. You go to the cinema, you enjoy your popcorn, you laugh a few times while actually caring for this or that character, the lights turn on again and you won't probably remember this movie that much once you've left.

That's how this kind of movie works; it probably won't be a personal favorite to most people and may become one of those... ""Oh, yeah, there was a movie about Bullock in the jungle wearing those exagerated purple shiny clothes... How was it called? The Lost Jungle or something, yeah, yeah. It was fun. And there was a blond guy that was hot"".

Brad Pitt showed up just long enough to save our heroine, only to be shot after about a 10 min appearance, He was in the movie to what? Help it at the box office.

The whole movie was slow and slower, with an occasional burst of action that fizzled out as soon as it began.

It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

15 May 2022,Overeacting...,"Oh man, this one is a stinker! You have Sandra Bullock, but not THE Sandra Bullock. This one is from ""Speed 2"", and ""Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous"". I guess she knew this movie is going to be bad so she overacted the hell out of her character. So did everybody else! Almost like in a parody movie. The problem is that this is not a parody...

30 May 2022,"A Remake of ""Romancing The Stone"".... Without the Romancing","The similarities between this and the great movie ""Romancing the Stone"" are very strong. But it's not an official remake. This movie lacks passion and story and replaces them with Mustache Twirling Victims and a Character Bullock has played several times already .... Think ""Miss Congeniality."" Too smart to be doing what she's doing and she only deigns to do her job, and eventually learns something about herself. Channing Tatum has one thing: Pretty, and he uses it well here. There are some funny moments, but nothing that had me rolling on the floor. It's a good rainy afternoon kind of movie. But if you want something better that doesnt rely on cheap slapstick and has a palpable romantic storyline where both characters have a beginning, middle, and an end, something with substance... go with ""Romancing the Stone""

25 July 2022,Loved all of it,"In ""Romancing the Stone"", Kathleen Turner had a cat. It fell out of the ceiling. Sandra Bullock, in this movie, however has not. It does not degrade the quality of ""The Lost City"", in any way.

I loved this movie. It is even better and funnier than ""Romancing the Stone"". ROTFLSHMSFOAIDMT.

8 June 2022,Funny,"I'm a huge romance reader, so I figured that this movie would be right up my alley and I was pleasantly surprised that this movie did well with some of the romance tropes.

The casting was great, I've always enjoyed Sandra Bullock's movies, Channing Tatum was hilarious in here and I thought he looked like the old school Fabio on the romance covers. Surprising in here was Brad Pitt, he only had a cameo, but I wish that he had a bigger role.

I know that Daniel Radcliffe has been trying his best to be known for someone else other than Harry Potter, though try as he may, he will forever be known for that iconic role. I think he was funny in here as well, though not really believable as a villain.

Overall this was a fun and hilarious ride, and I'm sad to here that Sandra Bullock is stepping away from acting and I will definitely miss her, because she has been one of my favorite actresses for years.",8
24 June 2022,So much fun,"I loved this movie not just because of the story but the fun I had watching it ! I love Sandra Bullock and the comedic interaction between Channing Tatum and her just made me laugh out loud. Haven't had that much fun watching a movie in a long time . Thank you guys. Much appreciated after a couple of years dealing with my grandsons leukemia and covid.

Watch this if you've exhausted all other Tatum and Bullock comedies. I'm having a better time rewatching 21 Jump St and Miss Congeniality.

6 September 2022,"Been there, seen it","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing.

27 May 2022,"Chronic, so disappointing","I really was expecting something special: I adore Sandra Bullock and Daniel Radcliffe, I like Brad Pitt and can tolerate Channing Tatum. I was hoping for something along the lines of Raiders of the Lost Ark - or at least a bit of humour. The humour in this film plodded along with leaden feet. Yes, there was some action (not brilliant, but fairly OK) and they certainly tried re the humour, but most of the jokes didn't really land. They were really trying too hard!

There were also a lot of continuity bloopers, which was really irritating. First, Daniel Radcliffe donning white cotton gloves to hand a box over to Sandra Bullock (very early in the film) then taking it back a moment later without gloves on. Sandra at the bottom of a cliff with her hair in a chignon. Then halfway up, with hair long and flowing. Etc etc. I started to watch with an open mind, but ended up looking at emails from the halfway point onwards, and couldn't wait for the film to finish. I was hoping for a good ending. Don't bother.",2
9 April 2023,A ten seems high but...,"Have you seen the recent adventure crap movies out recently??? Uncharted and Red Notice to name a few. I literally gave up hope on finding a solid movie in this genre released after 2020. But tonight I finally gave in and thought, why not try this movie?

I mean it's Sandra Bullock. She has a loooooong trail of phenomenal movies made. The only movie I could think of that was disappointing in her trail was Miss Congeniality 2. But let's pretend that never happened.

This movie was what other movies of it's kind attempted but could not do! It's funny! My husband and I genuinely laughed out loud! I can't tell you the last time a recently released movie made us do that!

The character development and back stories were well done! What really did it for us was the characters themselves. They were so layered. They had heart!

Even the cheesy parts of this movie was well earned. Not out of place. Cringey but in a way that added to the story.

I really enjoyed this movie. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again. But it put a great smile on my face and warmed my heart. It gave me hope for movies yet to be released. So it gets a 10/10 because it went above and beyond movies of it's kind that were recently released.",10
16 July 2022,Smart funny,"Loads of fantastic clever one liners; it was spoof movie. Channing is definitely a super underrated comedy star. Brad was a gold star cameo. I can only guess those giving low stars don't get or like sarcasm/spoof humor and we're expecting something else.

I laughed because of deliberately corny scenes, the deadpan humor, the very subtle jokes and puns which I'll bet a lot of people didn't catch, and because of Sandra Bullock who I think is great at playing comic roles. It's just a lot of fun. I think the people who didn't like it are too serious and need to the lighter side of things.

30 July 2022,Great fun if you remember how to just enjoy a movie,"I wasn't really up for watching this to be honest; I knew nothing about it and though I really like Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, I wasn't really in the mood.

It took about 30 seconds to turn me around. This is the kind of old-fashioned movie silliness that you so rarely find anymore; it's unrealistic and completely over the top and all the better for it. The aforementioned leads are both fantastic in their roles; funny, charming and both bring some great physical comedy that alone had me in stitches. The story itself is pretty basic, but that feels like it's by design. It's a comedy adventure romp and in that it definitely succeeds.

If you remember how to sit back and enjoy a silly, funny popcorn flick you'll probably enjoy it. I did!

25 July 2022,Yet Another Reason to Dislike Channing Tatum!,"This movie could only have been made during a pandemic where acting opportunities were very limited! While a fan of Sandra Bullock I ended up feeling sorry for her involvement in this disaster. I can only hope she got a bundle for lowering herself to this level of ""entertainment"". Tatum was his typical untalented and unfunny self whose only claim to fame is only revealed, apparently, when he removes his shirt. The script was unoriginal and only Brad Pitt provided any moments worth remembering. Stay clear if this unless you totally devalue your limited time on earth.

27 April 2022,"Old, reused plot line and not very entertaining","I went into this movie without seeing the trailer or reading any reviews but seeing as it was billed as an adventure/comedy I was expecting something funny and full of adventure.

Well...I was disappointed. The plot line has been done before, time and time again. I mean, it's been years since I've seen Romancing the Stone but as I recall it's basically the same story line. The climax scene I'm pretty sure they just took from the Goonies, although not done nearly as well.

The scenes that are meant to be comedic are really not that funny. I didn't have one point in the movie that I actually laughed. Maybe a little snicker at one scene but that's about it. Even the adventure aspect of it wasn't original or very adventurous. It didn't have the ability to pull me into the adventure like other great adventure movies do.

I still give it 4 stars for some good acting and some cool jungle scenes but that's really about all this movie has going for it.",4
31 July 2022,Cheap knockoff of Romancing the Stone,"Except it doesn't have the great chemistry that Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas had. Storyline was blah, I had no desire to see the leads become a couple, and it wasn't funny. The music was way too loud, so we had to turn the volume down too low to really hear the movie.

The funniest part of the whole movie wasn't even in the movie. When a character gave Loretta a drink, it was the color of urine. I itthought Loretta said, ""Urination,"" so in disgust, I asked my family to confirm she was going to drink his urine. Turns out she said, ""You're an angel."" That was the most we laughed during the movie.

It is what it is, I enjoyed Brad Pitt role, and it was a bit more than a ""cameo"". Tatum Channing did a good job being an inept Hollywood type for this role. It was an enjoyable farce, but if you want something with depth and a serious message, go see something else. This was just a fun, light movie, and it met that expectation.

13 April 2022,So cheesy it WASN'T funny,"So, I've never posted a review before but after seeing how highly others have rated this, I just had to do so.

There were so many things that didn't work in this movie for me, where to begin?

1. This is obviously a rehash of Romancing the Stone and a bad one at that.

2. Ther character development was seriously underdeveloped. Sandra's character was completely unsympathetic and pretty unlikable. Channing's character was bit of an idiot and never proved to be different.

3. There was no chemistry between the 2 main characters.

3. The ""jokes"" weren't all that funny. They seemed to try a little to hard.

4. To me, a long time romance reader, it kind of felt like the movie was making fun of me and others who love the genre.

5. Against all odds, I just don't see the appeal of Channing Tatum. I feel like this movie would've been better if they had cast another actor in his role. (Maybe Keanu Reeves since they already have shown that those 2 have terrific chemistry.) The only thing that was good about this movie was getting to see Daniel Radcliffe be the villain and even that was not as developed as it could've been. I know hollywood could've done better than this.",4
11 April 2022,Cinema isn't dead afterall...,"Changed my perspective on modern day cinema tropes. Think 'Indiana Jones' but with grit. Bullocks and Tatums onscreen chemistry reminds me of my mother. Couldn't stop watching. Sick of b list rubbish at the picture shows these days, finally we're getting back on track to the golden era of Hollywood. Austism friendly. 10/10.

I've never seen Tatum in a movie and now I know why, good god he's an awful awful ""actor"" when he came on stage dancing and looking like a right clown I couldn't take it anymore, also the Asian host guy was bloody annoying too, from what I see on here, I didn't miss much!

14 May 2022,Pretty Cliche in an Very Unendearing Way,"Between Bullock's over-botoxed facial expression (singular) and Tatum's super dumb guy acting, this movie is pretty bad. Everything is supremely cliched in the most predictable way. As in the character dynamics are based on old movie formulas that you can guess ahead of time with minimum surprises. The only thing missing is the sassy black woman and bumbling cops. Wait, nope, they got those in there too. The plot doesn't make any sense from who's involved in the overall adventure. An ""evil genius"" who is ignoring using experts for his plan. It makes you question why the hell wouldn't he go for someone who could actually help. Why aren't the people on the rescue team from local authorities? The bad dick jokes that make dad jokes look genius. I guess it's worth it if you want a movie to play as background noise while you're cleaning on the weekend. 2 stars because of the actors involved, but that's about it. People are saying that the ""intentional banality of the movie is on purpose. That's what makes it great!"". I'm just going to say I've been cliche movies done right and this one isn't one of them.

1 September 2022,What I wanted,"I liked this movie. It had the elements of an adventure-comedy like the newer Jumanji movies which is what I was looking for, though it lacked the dynamics of a great cast like Jack Black and Dwayne Johnson in those movies so wasn't quite as strong. Daniel Radcliffe was weak as the villain and didn't seem entirely believable. Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock were great but I think they lack a certain element to really bring this movie to greatness, though their on screen chemistry was perfect. The plot was pretty mediocre but about what I expected, a fun adventure through the jungle to find treasure. Overall a fun chill adventure. I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters but it's perfect to watch while chilling at home.

Some of the humor that takes place like questions yourself it makes you think does it know that I'm high? Or am I just high? This is the Channing Tatum from jump Street humor. Already making this fantastic. The ridiculousness adds a bonus, Making this a movie to enjoy while high.

27 July 2022,It served it's purpose,"For being an Action - Rom/Com, it served its purpose with regard to being entertaining. There were parts that I laughed at, so I will give it credit where it's due.

That said, the whole romance side of things fell pretty flat. I thought that Channing and Sandra had good banter - as friends. Even when Channing's character, Alan, was somewhat confessing his feelings, I couldn't buy into it. No sexual chemistry between them, no tension, nothing that made me feel like they were genuinely physically attracted to each other. Especially with Sandra's character, Loretta. In fact, she was pretty condescending to him for most of the movie.

For the five seconds Brad Pitt's character was there, I actually felt like she had better chemistry with him than Channing.

That said, I don't think I will rush to watch this again, but I would recommend it to someone curious to watch.",6
29 May 2022,Perfect popcorn movie,"Tough not to compare with Romancing the Stone. Nothing new with the plot but we laugh a lot and spend a good time.

The duo Bullock-Tatum works well. The Brad Pitt cameo is hilarious. And the biggest surprise must certainly be Daniel Radcliffe, far from his Harry Potter years. He's fantastic and funny.

It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

14 August 2022,So painfully stupid,"The movie starts out with such promise, given the luminosity of its stars and one or two funny lines, but quickly deteriorates to awful. I lost count of how many times I was going to stop watching. Even the scenery was noticeably phony with backgrounds of mountains and volcanoes that were static and artificial. On the ""ouch"" scale, this tale gets 5 loud ouches. Sandra, Sandra, what were you thinking?

4 September 2022,Boring,"Couldnt even finish until the end of the film. The story line must have been written on a napkin its so bad. The actors look like they dont want to be in the film either. Wife usually likes these types of romcoms but could not watch either. Not one laugh to be had. I feel like I should be able to claim a refund back from Apple for renting this movie.

Better off renting romancing the stone instead......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

5 April 2022,A light comedy with pretty good cast!,"The movie is like a light chick flick with a few good laughs and a good acting cast.

If you are looking for a serious movie with some deep thoughts or meaning - this isn't your one. It's just for some light, non-engaging entertainment, to relax and have fun.

There are a few references to other movies, at certain point it felt like giving a wink to the Indiana Jones series.

The thing between Sandra Bullock and Brad Pitt started so promising... There was chemistry, they feel comfortable together, obviously had some fun, and could be quite witty. Both are great comedians!

I loved Daniel Radcliffe's performance; as usual - he's a brilliant actor, and especially his accent. Such a pleasure to see him and listen to him talk!

There's a thing I really didn't like - it's the goat moment. There shouldn't be any such references to animals.

Watch it till the very end, guys!

The end was fun :)",7
30 July 2022,Cute fun movie.,"I highly enjoyed how easy breezy and fun loving this was. Doesn't over think. Brad pitt's character killed me. The movie had a romancing the stone vibe.

9 September 2023,I watched it and I was invested,"It had the right amount of comedy and plot, and the movie had my undivided attention, the very start was very bad, almost quit, No idea what they are thinking throwing out dabs like its funny to anyone in the whole world, If I had better things to do, that scene would instantly make me quit the movie, but thankfully after that the movie is very enjoyable. And throwing in a fat black chick for no reason is 1 star off just for that, obviously her only purpose was inclusiveness, and its a shame too because she is a good actress, its just that her purpose in the film was non existent. No idea why some complain about the cgi, I honestly didn't even notice any cgi, the film felt very grounded .

13 May 2022,Not enough metal to magnetize.,"Sandra Bullock is a good actress. That's about all the positive about the movie.

With a dearth of good adventure movies in last few years, when a movie with an enticing title for any avid connoisseur like ""The Lost City"" comes along, the anticipation is high, especially with actors like Sandra, Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt. Oh, and Channing Tatum. But this one falls flat on almost every aspect.

Lack of a menacing antagonist, who is never really a threat is just one of the many things which go wrong here. Background score is aridly unoriginal. You never quite feel the sense of urgency or ""adventure"" like you do in trendsetters like The Mummy franchise.

The banter between the characters is more like a conversation between tweens. Dialogues directed towards the working class people in the movie are more scornful than anything else.

Acting here is subpar at best. Actors feel bored with no real chemistry.

Story line is predictable. No serious attempt to make the treasure hunt even a little cerebral. Even the twists in the tale are visible from a 100 miles away. All's just happening by chance.

Best to avoid the movie. Definitely not for multiple viewing.",4
15 January 2023,A masterful review that will stir emotions,"So Great.... I'm not sure how I should start this review, I only know that it should be about The Lost City and how I feel about it, and that it should relay the feelings to others accurately. So here we go... so here come all the highs and lows and in betweens, and dare I say some spoilers. It wouldn't be right if I was to drop spoilers and not warn you ahead of time. I may even give you a sneak peek into what you can expect in the sequel. It's always exciting when you come across a really good review. Not only does it allow you to delve into your own imagination, but also the imagination and the mind of narrator of that review. So let's do this.....

30 March 2022,Lost in D,"Acting: 9/10 Chemistry: 2/10 Plot: 3/10 Dialogue: 3/10 Pacing: 5/10 Action: 9/10 Comedy:7/10 Romance: 1/10 Setting: 7/10

This movie was barely watchable. It wasn't self aware which was the whole point of the premise and would have elevated the film. This movie follows Loretta Stone, a sad, depressed woman who wants to kill off her main male character because she doesn't get along with the vapid air headed cover model played by Tatum. She very randomly and abruptly ends up on an island adventure with tatum where they fall into cliche tropes, but they aren't self aware or sexy or romantic. It's stupidly awkward and uncomfortable due to the lack of chemistry between the characters. This is a major flaw because nothing gets built and the whole movie had no payoff- except an awkward kiss and mismatched banter at the end.

Unfortunately, I don't think Sandra Bullock was good in this role as nothing in her line delivery makes it believable.

8 September 2022,"I can't sayI didn't enjoy it, but....","The movie was fun to watch, until it wasn't. Sandra and Channing have chemistry and Daniel Radcliffe does a pretty good job as villain. Unfortunately, the creators didn't know what to do with them, except to throw them into familiar, sometimes funny situations, and cliché action sequences. Let's just say that this movie really doesn't have a reason for existing, as it lacks imagination and originality. I really don't understand it. How is it that the big movie studios keep recycling the same material over and over. They just don't care about the lasting impact a well told story may have as long as it makes a profit. This is Dora the explorer for adults.

1 April 2022,OK popcorn movie but that's it,"A good effort but it felt hollow - maybe I was in a mood but the jokes weren't very funny to me and the story felt flat. A few people in the theatre laughed. Sandra, Tatum and Daniel did a decent job but I likely won't recommend this to anyone beyond catching it on streaming.

24 June 2022,Fun film!,"This was truly one of the fun films to watch this year! It was also one of the few films that my husband wanted to see twice! He has wanted to see other movies twice, but usually several decades after he first saw it; this one we watched on cable about a week after seeing it in the theater! Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe, Brad Pitt, and the rest of the cast were great! The only real complaint we had was that the car falling off the mountain could have been done in a funnier way!

13 May 2022,"If you didnt like this movie, you're a sad monster.","Great cast. Yes, it was goofy, the intent of the movie. Some jokes were a little corny, but I don't think the intent was to win a bunch of awards. Enjoyed the movie for what it was. Had a couple laughs, light hearted and kept me entertained. Would recommend.

15 May 2022,Cute movie that follows the simple formula but still manages lots of laughs,"This is a movie you know what's going to happen, but you watch it anyway because the journey is fun. Really enjoyed Sandra & Tatum as leads, just wish their relationship had more time to develop over the course of the movie.

Daniel Radcliffe was great as the ""bad guy"" and enjoyable to see him performing on the big screen.

Tatum thrives in this character role & his chemistry with Sandra Bullock is great.

29 May 2022,Not high art but very enjoyable.,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

Actually I liked it till the last 5-10minutes because they should have end the movie there. Those minutes were not neccessary and were too weak and low , ruined the experience.

7 May 2022,A good cinema movie which lacks enough effective comedy.,"The movie is entertaining and it is a good time to watch in cinema, but in my opinion it lacks more comedy situations.

I laughed in this movie but still not satisfied with the comedy which could be more, for example:

1-More scenes like brad pitt's which were the best in the movie.

2-More funny scenes between alan's and loretta's characters.

The story, the plot and the villain are all weak in this movie.

26 August 2022,Very disappointing!,"I saw this advertised a while ago, and put it on my watch list. Finally got round to watching it, well around 40 minutes of it before I gave up. I'm a fan of Sandra Bullock, and from the story line I can understand why she agreed to do it. However she must be wondering now why she agreed, this is one of the most lacklustre films I've seen (or partly seen) in a long time. Changing Tatum (a fine actor) was not suited to his part, and I really felt embarrassed for Daniel Radcliffe who was definitely mis-cast. One to avoid!

30 June 2022,The lost plot,"Fairly entertaining film with plenty of action. However the storyline was very thin and lacked any originality. Rather a lot of cringeworthy scenes with the fifty-something writer fantasising about the hunky male model, while they run away from a group of villains. Lots of bits that didn't make sense. Apparently it was supposed to be a comedy, but the humour fell terribly flat. I quite enjoyed it, but it was poorly constructed.

Also, I hate it in these movies when they make the bad guy not comedic at all, or with an original personnality. And it's even more of a shame here since Daniel Radcliffe could have done so much more if his character was tweaked a bit.

But don't expect too much because the whole plot of this movie is something you though it's so great but it's actually not. It's just something some kind of legend from the past but i think it's all worth it. I recommend you to watch this movie with your partner or family. Because i think it really suits to it or maybe you're an author and you're having a writer block, this movie is something you can relate too. LMAO.

I didn't feel like saw it again and it's not a movie that deserves a high recommendation, in fact, I even say that it's worth putting aside unless you're a big fan of one of these actors.

11 May 2022,Worth it only for Brad Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe,"Those 2 are great. Channing Tatum is funny alright. Sandra Bullock... It's a pity because with her (same as with Nicole Kidman and similar actresses and actors who have splurged on botox), I am able only to look at their terrible plastic surgeries... Their inmovable faces, their lack of expression, their unnaturally flat skin... She's always been funny, but when you try to crack a smile and only half of the bottom lip moves, or when the same face is used to express compassion, terror, grief, hilarity, comedy or anger, then it just kills the entire movie.

Apart from that, the plot is meh, the location is fantastic, the characters are full cliches with little development... At least it's not way too long.

If you don's have anything else to watch, I guess you can grab a bicycle and enjoy the good weather outside.

24 August 2022,The Meh City,"I don't even know what i expected from watching this but i thought it would be like uncharted just a fun adventure movie. I apologize if this offends anyone but i think its time for Sandra to call it quits on acting- she has done plenty of great movies but she just did nothing for me this entire movie. Shes not funny or charismatic all she does is talk about her book and complain. When Brad Pitt came in the movie got way better but spoilers he dies and its back to Sandra and Channing. Channing Tatum was funny in this movie but he needs someone funnier than him to bounce off him and Sandra is not that. If you replaced Sandra with Patti Harrison who stole the show in her minor appearance then this movie would work! She is hilarious! The movie is shot very well and has some cool action but its not enough. Also i already saw Danielle Radcliffe do this same exact role and performance in Now You See Me 2. Just a poorly casted movie. You can turn your brain off and have a fun time with this movie but you have to cast a good lead.

11 April 2022,The case of the long cameo,"The Lost City has all the ingredients that make up a classic Hollywood adventure-comedy film, it hits all the notes at the right times, and is casted to perfection, but perhaps it's only flaw is precisely in just how formulaic it actually is. Fear no further dear reader, to the rescue comes what possibly is the longest cameo in film history: Brad Pitt. Pitt's carachter is perhaps the most interesting and better developed one, stealing scenes and hearts at every heroic glance. One could even argue that this dude even deserves a spin-off of his own. But if a cameo is truly the highlight of an entire film, that's not saying much, is it? Save from the hysterical physical comedy of Sandra Bullock and a few well-oiled jokes, there is not much left for the audience but a few giggles. Still, The Lost City is a pretty exciting and light movie to keep the audiences entertained on a rainy day.

23 April 2022,Romancing The Crown,"Sandra Bullock, Daniel Radcliffe and Channing Tatum are willing, but the flimsy plot, disjointed pacing and rom com sensibilities are tiring. Come for the star power and stay for the promise of something weightier (which arrives in fits and starts). Popcorn was made exactly for this silver screen feature.

12 May 2022,Brad Pitt saving a boring and forgetable movie about something I already forgot,"I would give Brad Pitt an Oscar just for his appearance in this movie. In fact, that's what kept me from sleeping while watching this movie. The most boring two hours I spent on a theather, and I watched ""The Eternals"" recently.

I already knew that The Lost City was the kind of movie where you turn your brain off and have fun; the problem is, even if I rip the brain out of my head, I still wouldn't enjoy this movie. The beginning is very promising, it establishes the tone of the film, introduces characters, situations, and context in a pretty good way, but towards the half of the runtime, the story starts to get stuck, and it just doesn't turn into a very expensive sleeping pill because Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock are really good in here.

The story is way more interested in the silly adventure, but sometimes it tries to invest in an uninteresting drama just to put the main couple together. Booooring. I could easily cut off 40 minutes of this movie. Even things that should get more attention, like action scenes, visual effects and production design are really bad.

Anyway, if you like to see Brad Pitt being hot, this movie may suit you (even if he only appears for about 10 minutes). Otherwise, a totally forgettable adventure. The Rock loves to make movies in the jungle, maybe if he were here, the film would be a little less boring.",4
29 July 2022,Exiting or funny ? NO !!!,"Boring and not even well made. Brad Pitt was participating for about 5 minuts.

Strange Bullock couldent ""carry"" the movie her self. But needed Brad for only the name.

The movie was a bad imitations of Indiana Jones. Wasted money.

19 July 2022,Pleasantly surprised how different the movie is from trailer,"The trailer gives the impression that this is two dimensional slap stick comedy. Although not as laugh out loud funny as I expected, I was pleasantly surprised by the sometimes intelligent and touching dialogue. The acting from The three leads is top notch, there is decent soundtrack (especially the Latin music) and the cinematography is lovely. All in all, a sweet escape from our current grim reality.

15 August 2022,"A ""funy-crazy"" movie or not...","When I saw the cast I thought that ""yeah, a funny movie is coming"", but if I want to be honest it wasn't. There was some jokes which were actually funny and enjoyable, but the most was only ""supposed to be"".

Also I think the casting wasn't so good... the actors on their own are brilliant, but together there is too much going on. Also the ""chemistry"" was a bit bold.

The storyline was not that bad, but too cric-crax. Too much what the heck moment.

So at all it is not a waste of time, but you can live whitout it.

The Brad Pitt character was the best part of the movie, but unfortunately he was only in it briefly. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum didn't seem to have much chemistry, and a lot of the jokes were forced and not all that funny. I couldn't really buy Daniel Radcliffe as the bad guy either. This could have been a lot better, but was just poorly executed.

31 March 2022,Waste of money!!!,"This was such a huge DISAPPOINTMENT! The trailer makes it seem it would be a bit like Jumanji, a light hearted adventure, but it was definitely not like that. Where was the adventure??? Apart from some really short and uncreative chase scenes there was no adventure. Only Brad Pitt's part was cool, I wish he could've stayed longer. The comedy was also not funny; at the start I guess the awkward moment jokes and fumbling to communicate was funny, but the same type of lame jokes again and again. I'm surprised how Sandra Bullock and Daniel Radcliff agreed to do this. The dialogues were so messy, and the romance between the leads was lackluster and seemed extremely forced. Also Loretta having a good look of Alan's d*** when he only asked her to look for leaches and then developing feelings for him... what kind of stupid message are they giving?

This was a total let down... I kept waiting for the adventure to come but only got forced and boring banter between the leads. Huge let down, don't watch it in the theatres!!!

30 October 2022,"Good acting, but poor story and looses momentum","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you?

20 July 2022,"As you would expect, Fun overall, lazy and troped moments","5/10

The first 2/3 of the movie were decently funny, and set the goofy, lighthearted tone. There are some jokes and awkward script moments that fall flat, and the villain is incredibly boring. After the classic 3rd-act ""everyone needs to hate each other for no reason, so the ending is more emotional"", shtick the writing starts going down hill. Expected a cheesy, formulaic, Hollywood film and got a fairly competent one.

27 March 2022,"Appealing stars, but dumb script","Has a dumb main story about finding some lost whatever that you don't care about, and one scene after another is people doing things that make no sense. In a comedy/adventure that can be ok if the comedy works, but there's just not enough of that. Pitt, and esp Tatum, display some fun moments, but that only goes so far. Radcliffe's such a cartoonish, non-threatening, villain it's hard to take the adventure part seriously for a second. With Bullock 16 yrs older than Tatum, the movie's emerging sexual dynamic between them looks not so believable, and might work better if they were closer in age (you do see it in her scene with Pitt, who's about same age).

18 September 2023,Not what I anticipated,"When I first laid eyes on the trailer, I experienced a fit of uncontrollable laughter. My excitement to watch this film knew no bounds, especially given the star-studded cast it boasted. It rekindled my childhood enthusiasm for adventurous treasure hunts on hidden islands, deciphering cryptic hieroglyphics, and embarking on thrilling escapades.

At the heart of the movie are two protagonists: Loretta Sage (played by Sandra Bullock), a romance novelist, and Alan/Dash (portrayed by Channing Tatum), her renowned cover model. Loretta's novel, ""The Lost City of D,"" tantalizes readers with its enigmatic title, sparking wild speculations. But it's not what you might assume. Their journey unfolds on a perilous expedition to an uncharted paradise island, albeit not of their own volition. Loretta is kidnapped by a delusional, bittersweet billionaire, a media mogul who believes she holds the key to discovering treasure in a lost city on that very island, mirroring the plot of her own book.

My initial expectation, fueled by uproarious laughter induced by the trailer, was that this movie would captivate me from start to finish. Regrettably, that wasn't the case. It turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with moments of disappointment and monotony. Nevertheless, the same scenes that had amused me in the trailer still had me in stitches, along with some previously unseen gems. These redeeming moments make me inclined to recommend the film to others. I would, however, temper my recommendation by acknowledging that it may not live up to the hype but is still suitable for a laid-back day of viewing. Given the track record of Brad Pitt, Channing Tatum, and Sandra Bullock, I can't recall a single instance where their performances have fallen flat. Consequently, I attribute any shortcomings solely to the production team.

The plot was passable, while the storyline struck me as a bit wishy-washy. Certain segments left me pondering, ""Why was that even included?"" Additionally, I have reservations about the casting choices. Sandra and Channing certainly embodied their roles, and Brad Pitt, while fitting his character, seemed an unconventional choice for this particular storyline or genre. Frankly, I don't envision him as a comedic actor. I regret to say that Daniel Radcliffe felt out of place in this ensemble. He was an exceptional child actor in the Harry Potter series, but this role didn't suit him. I found myself wincing, thinking, ""No, perhaps it's time to step away from acting."" The remaining cast members appeared disengaged and seemed to be present merely to fulfill their roles in making a movie, resulting in characters that felt lackluster.

Maybe I should consider watching a 'behind the scenes' episode to uncover the rationale behind that rather questionable outfit (the onesie) they dressed Loretta in. I must admit, I found it quite dreadful. Sandra Bullock possesses an enviable physique, especially for her age, but that suit felt entirely out of place, even for a book interview. The color choice was off, and sequins? Seriously? I couldn't help but wonder, what kind of novelist wears a sequin onesie? And let's not forget about Beth's eyebrows... I suppose we were meant to take notice because they certainly stood out prominently.

Now, on to the peculiar moment when Alan covers his eyes as he asks Loretta, in a state of undress, to 'check his front' for leeches. It's a puzzling choice, to say the least. But credit where it's due, I appreciated the witty wordplay with the quote, ""oh your plucky warrior hangs in tranquil solitude,"" which did manage to elicit a giggle from me.

All in all, I'd say it's a passable movie to watch, primarily for the sheer delight of witnessing these acclaimed actors share the screen. However, it might have caused a slight dent in their status as actors and actresses, given some of the creative choices and moments in the film.

Is 'cheese & rice' supposed to be a substitute for Jesus Christ? Just wondered.",5
14 May 2022,Huge Sandra Bullock Fan,"Normally love everything Sandra Bullock makes. Was very sad to read that at one point Ryan Reynolds was attached to this project because that would've been a totally different movie. Reuniting her and her Proposal co star as well as Pitt and Reynolds's from Deadpool 2. After seeing him as Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe was hard to buy as the villain.

17 April 2022,Way too much,"PG-13, okay, but way too many sexual suggestions. Definitely not appropriate for a 13-year-old! Sandra Bullock was a favorite of mine, but this movie only suggested that she's playing into Hollywood's hands rather than her being genuine to her self. It could have been much better without a nearly totally naked scene! It was more of a rather R movie in some ways. Stay away.

My two-star review would not change if I saw this on streaming for free. It is just not a good movie. Not sure why they had to try an Indiana Jones knockoff, but it just did not work.

On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

7 November 2022,Not Good,"Terrible, obvious storyline. Cut-out Sandra Bullock character. Annoying support characters. Waste of good talent. Goodness knows why so many people like this (low expectations? Dumbing down?)

There is nothing new here. Nothing that hasn't been done before, and better. I can only assume that the stars were well paid, as it could not have been the script and 2D characters that enticed them.

It tries far too hard to be funny and quirky and fails miserably. There is the odd chucklesome line, but most of it falls way short of the mark.

I gave up after less than 30 minutes. I think I may have smiled or giggled twice in that time. Avoid.

Awful.",2
5 June 2022,I'll be generous,"Not bad but not great with hints of jokes. Daniel Radcliffe helped the movie. I like a good treasure hunt movie. The one with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg had a better story.

11 May 2022,"Can't production professionals see what we, the audience, is seeing?","There is no romantic chemistry whatsoever between Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock. That was irritating throughout the movie. The plot was predictable, offering very few surprises. The actors were over-acting most of the time and that made the overall ""boringness"" of the movie even worse. I'm sad to say that the only saving grace was the short part with Brad Pitt in it... he was adorable and believable. I was sorely disappointed in this film. 😔

30 March 2022,Not Romancing the Stone,"There is even a Romancing th poster somewhere in the film letting viewers know where the roots of this film come from. But this film has nowhere near the heart, action, and comedy of Romancing the Stone. Sandra Bullock is fine. Channing Tatum nowhere near the charisma of Michael Douglas. Brad Pitt has some screen time and that probably is the best part of the film. There is an extra scene during the credits that is crucial. Much more crucial than most after scenes.

31 March 2022,Star Studded - Romcom,"The cast is the strongest aspect of this film. Although it had it's comical moments, it struggled to make me laugh physically, just a few chuckles throughout. It turns into a hard romance, lovey comedy, over the top writing, mush. The action throughout was nothing special, and the editing was very poorly done, I was really expecting more having a star studded film. I was really looking forward to Bullock and Tatum paired together, but this wasn't the movie for it to be done. All in all, you can skip this movie and not feel like your missing out, is boarders on waiting for it to be over, and calling what's going to happen next. I used loyalty points to see for free, and I still paid too much, wait until it comes to a streaming service.

29 July 2022,Not bad,"Overall it's...not bad.

Both Channing Tatum & Brad Pitt were amusing. I feel like Daniel Radcliffe could've been used better.

Sandra Bullock was...okay.

I feel like the first half of the movie she shone. Then for some reason the second half of the movie her character just felt off. Maybe she was dealing with personal issues? I don't think the second half of the movie was her strongest.

So because of that I wonder if the movie was shot in two parts . Maybe before /during the pandemic? I dunno but it felt like there was a shift. I wouldn't blame anyone fir dealing with that though.

To be honest this movie was kind of a parody of the movie Romancing the Stone. A few others that watched it said the same thing.

But overall it was still entertaining.",

10 April 2022,Not Romancing the Stone.. or anything else,"I love Sandra Bullock as a comedic actress but this movie fell flat for me. Sandra did what she could with the character but Channing Tatum's character is inconsistent. The chemistry just wasn't quite right either. I realize this was attempting to be a bit more comedy than its concept inspiration Romancing the Stone, but the humor was a little tired. RTS storyline was far better and the chemistry of Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner far better. Maybe a younger audience who does not know or hasn't seen the predecessor movies will receive it better. However Gen X...save your money.

16 April 2023,"Funny, action-packed","This movie was cute, funny, action-packed entertainment. It was very reminiscent of Romancing The Stone. I was a little spoofy, but not so much so that it ruined my enjoyment. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope they make a sequel. All the actors did a wonderful job at their roles. Sandra Bullock was her usual beautiful powerful self. Channing Tatum was endearing, hunky as usual, with a soft side. I liked Daniel Radcliffe cast as the villain.

All in all it was a fun movie. Great for a date-night. Appropriate for younger viewers since it's PG-13. Some mild violence, romance depicted, but tastefully.

There were points were the filming actually looked so cheap that when they were in the jungle it looked like they were in a parking lot somewhere with some dirt thrown on asphalt. It had a few moments of laughs. I glad it was free with my prime membership. I would have been annoyed if I had paid extra for that.

24 September 2022,Poor script for two amazing actors.,"This is a waste of time. I bet the actors hate this moving. It has a terrible plot and it's just trying to be like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. In Romancing the Stone. If you can stand this movie you might find a few decent screens.

The constant silly adventure didn't add up to a first class movie by my standards. It's just a fluffy movie that tries to rip off so many other movies with similar scenes. If you like Sandra Bullock you will wonder what would tempt her to sear here unless it was more about Tatum Channing.. He too must have suffered through this movie. And with all this I watched the movie a second time and found it no more interesting.

The casting feels misplaced - but right in line with 2022's virtue signaling Hollywood. Sandra Bullock is a beautiful woman but can we stop watching her play the same roles she played in her 20s? Its cringe. Channing Tatum is cringe as her love interest. Zero chemistry. I only gave it 2 stars because I watched the whole movie.

Is 2022 Hollywood incapable of making a movie in which a character doesn't have some lame line about feminism? Cringe. Cringe. Cringe.

26 August 2023,Mediocre,"When I first saw Daniel Radcliffe on screen and glimpsed the intriguing setting he found himself in, I was filled with anticipation. The movie seemed poised to deliver an engaging story. Unfortunately, it devolved into a hodgepodge of poor writing and illogical drama. One glaring inconsistency was the portrayal of a billionaire riding in a makeshift ambulance, being chased down by an unarmed, average individual. Even more baffling was that this supposed billionaire had only a single gun for protection, undermining the sense of danger and urgency.

The romantic subplot felt forced and uninspired, detracting from the film's overall impact. One of the most perplexing moments involved the lead actress inexplicably turning down an incredible opportunity to recover a lost, valuable item. This choice not only lacked motive but also severed any connection I had with her character.

Lastly, the film was rife with numerous smaller loopholes that were hard to overlook. For instance, a character struggled to open a simple plastic clip while, oddly enough, carrying a chair throughout a chase scene. These issues collectively shattered my suspension of disbelief, leaving me to lament what could have been a much more compelling cinematic experience.",4

16 May 2022,It's ok,"I've enjoyed the first half of the movie much more than I expected, good humor, some smarter than average jokes and a story that while not new or revolutionary was well written and told. Not amazing but a really decent start.

The second part of the movie goes down dramatically, the jokes become a tiny bit dumber, many puns don't really land and the editing gets more and more disjointed with each scene. Still watchable but definitely subpar.

The main leads made a decent job. I believe Channing Tatum out-acted Sandra Bullock, which sincerely surprised me. However, neither of them were specially great.

In the other hand, Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt shined through and through. Radcliffe is capable of portraying a morally ambiguous antagonist in a serious yet funny way. Pitt made me laugh at every turn, he distilled humor at every word he said and every jump he made. Good stuff.

Sadly, we don't enjoy much of these characters. Pitt's appearance is more of a cameo and Radcliffe's character becomes flatter and dumber as the time goes by, becoming a caricature of the complex character we met at first. In turn, the movie tries to flesh Tatum and Bullock's relationship out but there's really nothing there, just the same old ""don't judge a book by its cover"" kind of unlikely couple we've seen a million times already.

All in all, it's an innocuous silly rom-com with some very decent action and special effects and a story that, while not really innovative, is mostly out of the ordinary. I expected to laugh more, probably some changes to the script could have made a better flick, but all in all, it's ok.

Do I regret spending two hours watching it? Nope, it was good enough. Would I remember its plot and characters in six months? Probably not. Would I watch it again? Oh no, thank you.",6
13 May 2022,Predictable,"Predictable storyline.

Predicable jokes which makes them not really funny. Jokes may make you smile but not laugh.

Tatum and Bullock are whatever. Bullocks fish lips are very distracting.

Pitt was great. Radcliffe was fun.

Put it on while doing something else, not worthy our full attention.

Lost City never came close. I expected so much more from Sandra Bullick.

27 August 2023,Hopeless movie,"There is no option for rating in -ve numbers that's why 1star. A well-trodden path of treasure hunt story with no twists or turns. Sandra Bullock has degraded over the years. A mannequin could have done better than her. Most of the movie is without humor (except Tatum). I can't understand how the producers can approve such mundane plot. I don't know what the director was smoking while shotting this movie. Towards the end the heroine jumped in the water to escape from the lava wearing her shoes. That only explains how much care they have given while making the film. I think fake rating has put this film so high in the list. Though the publicity team has done a good job. Wasted two hours.

17 September 2022,Mediocrity at Best,"I haven't watched any movies that were done in the last few years and I clearly don't think I have been missing anything. Sadly even Sandra Bullock wasn't her usual cute, spunky, funny self. Channing Tatum played a brainless body, which is just sad. Daniel Radcliffe actually played an evil, creep and was good at it. There were a few moments that I laughed but not enough to waste my time on this movie again. One of the pleasant surprises was Oscar Nunez, who was really funny. He was also in The Proposal with Bullock and he was hilarious. Sadly Hollywood has spent too much time pushing their liberal agendas to actually create polished entertaining movies that appeal to the average person.

14 August 2022,Sit back & enjoy the laughs,"This was the perfect movie night for us after a seriously stressful week. It's not perfect but it's plenty of fun and the physical comedy is terrific. Use close captions do you don't miss any of the quiet asides. I laughed so hard I scared my dog!

14 May 2022,Had so much potential...but ended up meh.,"There were great moments...like the whole Brad Pitt thing. But they drug out some of the most boring and unnecessary parts to make the movie longer. It lacked the action one might expect from something like this. It had real potential, but someone didn't think this through very well in the end.

17 April 2022,Forgettable and cliche but enough wit to be enjoyed.,"Going into the cinema to see The Lost City I knew not to expect anything ""new"" or ""groundbreaking""...we've all seen this movie before somewhere, whether that be 'Romancing the Stone' , 'Jungle Cruise' or basically every Adventure Rom-Com out there. But still, despite my wavering hopes about the story itself, the hilarious trailer and charming leads kept my expectations far above average.

After a rough first 30 minutes it was much appreciated once Bullock and Tatum finally arrived in the jungle along with a hilarious Brad Pitt in a very welcome yet minuscule role. During this short part of the film while our protagonists are accustoming themselves with the jungle every slightly funny scene is HILARIOUS with multiple sequences where the whole cinema was roaring in laughter!

Unfortunately not soon after, directors Adam and Aaron Nee lose all of their steam , swapping belly laughs with little to no light grins. It is tiring to see predictable plots unfold and unfunny jokes being made along with flimsy CGI and an utterly underwhelming ending.

Brad Pitt is the star of the show while both Tatum and Bullock get the job done. A miscast Daniel Radcliff plays villain 'Abigail Fairfax', a both cliche and uninteresting antagonist. Meanwhile Da'Vine Joy Randolph is a delightful surprise with a likable persona and an amusing sub-plot.

At the end of the day The Lost City is not a TERRIBLE movie, it has it's moments and surprisingly deep characters to route for. Despite it's major problems The Lost City is still enjoyable and will pass the time ...but don't expect to be blown away!",5
5 April 2022,"Was forced to watch it, had a pretty good time","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

30 June 2022,Pleasantly surprised,"I wasn't expecting much I put this movie on in the background one day while working around the house and ended up watching most of it and thinking it wasn't what I expected and not bad. I saw a lot of negative reviews idk what ppl are expecting it's a cheesy romantic comedy and that's what you get. Theres a part with brad Pitt that is actually pretty funny and definitely un expected. This movie wasn't what I was expecting but in a good way. It's not the best movie ever but if you want a movie to watch with a date or who ever it's not a bad choice.

30 July 2022,GREAT MOVIE,"Absolutely loved watching this!! I was scrolling to amazing prime and saw this movie. It interested me since the cast seems great. It was funny, the scripting was good, acting was spectacular, it was witty, there was action ect.

This had Sandra bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt. I've seen a lot is Sandra's movies and I already love her work so I'm slightly bias about any movie of her's I watch, but I haven't really watched anything of Channing Tatum's, but in this he smashed his role. He was so funny and played his part really well. The chemistry between Sandra and Channing, worked wonders for the relationship between their characters, Loretta and Alan.

The whole cast are fantastic! It definitely didn't fail to put a smile on my face. I watched it again with my family and enjoyed their laughs.

There are sweet moments between Loretta and Alan, that really brought it all together. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND for anyone that needs cheering up or as a fun family movie!! Hope this helps! W MOVIE FR I LOVED IT LAGUHED SO HARD . :)",10
27 June 2022,Just the tip,"This movie starts strong, promising a new rendering on the old ""reluctant heroes bonding"" formula. Daniel Radcliffe is known for picking up interesting and unorthodox roles, so it seemed that this movie will offer something fresh and unexpected. Then the second act started, and it turned into generic adventure movie we had seen thousands of times. It's not bad, just... fine. I cannot blame any of the actors for the mediocre plot, just the first act was promising so much more.

14 May 2022,Her typical movie,"I was expecting a better and slightly different story from Sandra's previous comedy films. But again the story presents a lot of Sandra's typical dialogue that is too excessive. The conversations tend to carry feminism sentiments. Many funny scenes are incomplete in delivery, jokes are a bit stale and childish. Again, Sandra's character is very dominant, which has been boring since her previous films.

But luckily the story is pretty good, the adventure sceneries help a lot. I think if this film is not made with a comedy genre, this movie is more interesting to watch.

22 August 2022,Romancing the Stone III,"After 37 years, finally the long awaited final piece of the trilogy is here. A show of hands for those of us die hard fans who have been waiting. Obviously we couldn't let Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner reprise their roles, have you seen them lately! So we got Channing and Sandy to step up. Basically it follows the root plot of #1, with a few differences. Is it worth the watch you ask. Well, if you enjoyed Romancing the Stone but not Jewel of the Nile, yes. The substitution of Daniel Radcliffe for Danny DeVito was clever. Overall, good for an afternoon romp but not up to snuff for a Saturday night watch party.

It seems that the whole screenplay team attempted to make laughable jokes or funny memorable moments but it's like watching the same thing over and over again like the case of treasure hunting in a lonely island and being raped by a group of raiders led by a multimillionaire mogul whose obsession is finding a precious gem.

I'm so sorry but this movie is gonna be a huge pass for me...

Daniel Radcliffe should have been given more screen space ,he was a scene stealer although playing underwritten and lame villian .Brad Pitt cameo was highlight

28 March 2022,Common take a leap of immortalization!,"Sandy, from the appearance of several of your last movies it looks like you would like to be remembered as a very sexy actress. Go ahead and take the plunge, loose the white pasty face makeup, shave the kitty, and get a moderate boob job. Then your ready to make the leap to a nicely done porn movie where you will forever be immortalized in some no holds barred sex scenes. Could you imagine turning the industry upside down by you winning an AVI award. Priceless and mention accomplished.

He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).

It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez (""The Office"").

Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.

8 August 2023,Surprisingly clever and not a waste of time,"This was a surprisingly good romp. It is a great adventure comedy for when you don't really want to think, but you don't want something super dumb. The writing was much more clever than I expected and I actually laughed aloud a few times, which is a rarity regardless.

As with all other movies I watch, I went in quite stoned and without watching the trailer, though I had seen frames and tiny bits and pieces. Pitt and Radcliffe definitely stole the show. Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock have good chemistry and they both grow during the film, which I guess is pretty likable. But there was good character development all around. The bits held up pretty well throughout. And though a lot of the film universe is fake, the plot is more or less realistic, and realistic enough to enjoy.

For movies like these, I usually don't pay too much attention to the cinematography or sound and whatnot, but there were some good solid songs at appropriate times. The scenery is quite beautiful, and volcanoes are fun.

Honestly, I'd recommend it. It kept my attention throughout the entire film almost completely, which I'd say is very good for an adventure comedy. The story was cute and quite strong; the characters had some really exceptional lines. They might even make some people snort-laugh, though that really isn't my jam or jelly.

Just give it a whirl. If you like any of the actors/actresses or if you like adventure and exploration movies, or if you like a smartly-enough written comedy, you'll find the gamble was worth it, and may even come out pleasantly surprised.",8
2 July 2023,So great!!!!,"This movie was hilarious and so cute. One of the best rom coms I have seen in a very long time. I was laughing so hard which was a surprise. The wit and humor are very hard to come by in a movie. The adventure, humor and love story had me on the edge of my seat quite literally. I love Sandra Bullock and of course Mr. Tanning what a adorable match and bravo to the directors. This reminded me of romancing the stone movie but with lots more humor. She's a romance novelist who lives out her adventure unknowingly very similar to Romancing the Stone . The man though is not the typical knight in shining armor, but kind of a little sissy but then he evolves into himself . Overall a wonderful movie.

22 August 2022,Skip it,"What possessed Sandara Bullock to take this role? There was no ball game on last night, and I decided to watch this disaster. It was just awful. The plot is a satire on the Indiana Jones series (except this one is based upon a romance novel series). The dialogue is juvenile, the acting over the top, the romance was a flop, and the action was tongue in cheek. If this is what audiences want, I'm sticking with European fare.

10 May 2022,Romancing the Stone meets Congo,"It felt like this for the most part with a few original scenes here and there. Daniel Radcliffe plays a humorous villain at best. He's not a believable mastermind, and acted to cheerful for a man of power and money as his character claimed. It had it's slightly charming moments and inevitable haha ""clueless"" moments/lines.

30 September 2022,"So, so stupid","I thought this movie would be really funny. And cute. It wasn't. I am SO glad I didn't waste money going to the theater. My husband commented that no one in this film could act. I know that's not the case. I just think everything was cheesy, exaggerated, and over-the-top on purpose. It just made it seem ridiculous. The plot was mediocre at best. There were a couple of ha-ha moments, and Channing Tatum is great to look at. But that's about it. With 30 minutes left, I wasn't even sure if I cared to finish it. I did, but I felt like I lost a few brain cells in the process. If you decide to see it anyway, keep your expectations low!

21 June 2022,Enjoyable,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""

Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.

After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe).

25 April 2022,Good fun,"The Lost City is a lot of fun with some great acting and a lot of fun to be had. Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock are brilliant at physical comedy and had some good chemistry on screen.

The story while very formulaic gave lots of room for the actors to do their thing on screen.

Daniel Radcliffe was brilliant as the villain and was genuinely hilarious in most of his scenes. It's nothing special but it's good fun.
