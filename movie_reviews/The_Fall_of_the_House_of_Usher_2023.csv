15 October 2023,Not an Adaptation,For those who read and understood Edgar Poe s stories the new Flanagan s work would be a revelation I agree with some other reviewers that the naming of this show is somewhat misleading especially for viewers who are trying to compare it to The Fall of the House of Usher story It is not an adaptation It is a hommage to Poe s legacy and the ideas the author encapsulated in his works You can easily notice the reference to at least one of Poe s stories or poems in each episode The Masque of the Red Death The Black Cat The Pit and the Pendulum The Tell Tale Heart The Gold Bug The Raven And maybe even more I read Poe a long time ago Flanagan captured Poe s gothic atmosphere and core ideas and translated them through the modern context and language which many I think did not like,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9377905/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2023,"A binge worthy series, once again.",A huge family run empire at the height of its powers begins so crumble as one by one the heirs and offspring begin to die It s a binge worthy eight part series one you won t want to end It s a twisted look at one greed and vanity can do even among siblings It s dark and twisted it gets better with every passing episode Flanagan knows only too well how to spin a yarn and this is another wonderful series The final episode was perhaps my favourite segment how rare for a series to end on such a high note it s wonderful Beautifully produced as you d expect you get a real insight into what life is like for those that live with huge wealth sadly they re all monstrous every single time you think an Usher has come good you have to think again It highlights what it is to have everything and what it is to have nothing only you have to question what exactly is worth having does wealth amount to anything at all ultimately Lots of familiar faces and they all perform it s worth seeing for Mark Hamill alone although it owes a great debt to the versatility of Carla Gugino who gets some show stealing scenes Am already counting down for the next Flanagan series 9 10,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9382924/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2023,Ambitious. Sometimes forced. But overall engaging.,It doesn t really get going until the end of the second episode So bear with it Because this is monumental in its undertaking It is no secret that this is an amalgamation of dozens of Poe stories and references that goes well beyond the titular source That being said the modern updates to the principle tales are entertaining The overall story being a Succession like narrative of a unscrupulous family with a corporate empire and their ultimate decline Not a spoiler it s literally the title Each member of the family is then given their own chapter further inspired by another major Poe tale or two Within those there are even more minute details from increasingly obscurer Poe works Like the security guard s moniker and the name of the ubiquitous pharmaceutical Sometimes the poetic monologues and voice over get a little contrived shoehorned and corny But when all is said and done the multi threaded nature of the narrative meshes and resolves satisfactorily I enjoyed it,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9376417/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2023,A Gilded Dance with Demons,In the vast realm of storytelling some tales strike us silent and this is undoubtedly one of those The Fall of the House of Usher transports us to a world of opulent elites drowning in their vices without remorse willing to sacrifice their own kin for vanity They believe their wealth can shield them from consequences but as with all tales reckoning awaits This series a true marvel to my eyes sparks deep thoughts with its superb direction and unforgettable performances Bruce Greenwood already a talented actor truly shines in this series though he s not the only star The entire cast delivers exceptional performances The writing is beyond the usual small screen fare exquisite and captivating I can t definitively say if this is Mike Flanagan s best work but it s undoubtedly among his finest,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9376357/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2023,Quintessentially Edgar.,In my opinion polarising creations are always fascinating and generally I don t think ill of people who happen to dislike what I enjoy very much I m not particularly fond of being meta in my reviews either but I feel that in the case of The Fall of the House of Usher something needs to be said on this matter I m not going to question personal taste when it comes to the technical aspects of this show such as acting directing and production value Personally I think is an excellent TV series graced by some seriously spectacular money shots the rave party s abrupt ending comes to mind but that s just my take The hill I m ready to die on is about whether or not Flanagan did justice to Poe s work and I m afraid I won t be very forgiving to whoever says he didn t Poe didn t just write Gothic literature he added heavy personal touches to it that would eventually become genre defying and ultimately the most iconic aspects of his work If you ask Chat GPT to write like Poe that s what you ll get But whilst extremely picturesque and entertaining and tempting from a Production s pov the costumes the Victorian gloomy setting the riddles it s a guaranteed spectacle those elements are the proverbial arabesques on top of something infinitely more substantial The deep psychological implications of his work is what makes Poe a genius and not just a good writer The man described illnesses and neuro divergences centuries before there was even a name for them He delved in universal fears and anxieties that not only have transcended his time they couldn t be more relevant today the unhealthy approach toward death living in an alienating society that has lost its human touch feeling the constant pressure of uncertainty The core of Poe s work is bleak and modern and Flanagan captured it to perfection with The Fall of the House of Usher Above the must have iconic references he resisted the easy road of a shallow costume piece and focused his script to what s underneath instead I for once can t praise him enough for it The only reservation I may have with this TV series is about the title s choice which may have mislead some spectator to believe that this was going to be an adaptation of the eponymous short novel instead of a broad homage to Poe s greatest hits Other than that as a longtime fan of Poe s work I won t shy from stating that The Fall of the House of Usher is storytelling at its best and nothing short of one of the most quintessential Poe esque piece of content in existence,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9376289/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2023,A love letter to Edgar Allan Poe,Mike Flanagan is clearly a Poe fan The fall of the house of usher is my favorite Poe story The 1960 Vincent Price film of that story is one of my favorite movies of all time I came into this expecting a similar story told longer That is not what I got After the first episode I was actually kind of annoyed because I wasn t getting it I didn t get how this was the house of usher I thought it was beautiful and it definitely grabbed my attention but it wasn t what I was expecting to be And then after a few episodes I realized what was happening Every episode is a modern retelling of an Edgar Allan Poe story And then tying each of those stories into the house of usher It was genius Some people will catch that by reading the titles of each episode but I honestly didn t pay any attention to that until I was four episodes in Obviously the episode title does give away what the story in that episode will be but then the creative journey will show us how it ties to our main story I think from start to finish this entire project was so well done The acting is outstanding Every special effect was marvelous The sets were beautiful and unique The writing and the directing are top knots There are definitely some beautiful and unique shots in this work I could honestly write a book about how much I loved this This is something I will watch again and again,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9375551/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2023,A Numb Walk Through 'The House Of Usher',For those who read and understood Edgar Poe s stories the new Flanagan s work would be a revelation I agree with some other reviewers that the naming of this show is somewhat misleading especially for viewers who are trying to compare it to The Fall of the House of Usher story It is not an adaptation It is a hommage to Poe s legacy and the ideas the author encapsulated in his works You can easily notice the reference to at least one of Poe s stories or poems in each episode The Masque of the Red Death The Black Cat The Pit and the Pendulum The Tell Tale Heart The Gold Bug The Raven And maybe even more I read Poe a long time ago Flanagan captured Poe s gothic atmosphere and core ideas and translated them through the modern context and language which many I think did not like,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9427765/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,There are a lot of polarized reviews here.,The bulk of the reviews seem to have this polarized Mike Flannagan hate going on So you can really write off half the reviews If you havent liked Flannagan s work why are you people watching it What you need to know is that this is a homage to all of Poe s work Rating it poorly because it isn t a prevoius remake seems extremely short sighted By now you ve read the story is set around the house of Usher Like many of Flannagan s stories they are designed to be end to end stories Which is what I prefer The Usher house hold is the story of rich people greed and overall evil people Many people cite the parallels of Succession and they feel like it s underwhelming by comparison I however do not I actually don t like Succession Just like many of HBO s series they are drawn out wwwwaaaayyyy to long This is not You get what you get for the 8 episodes Mike gets a lot of the actors he continues to work with and Carla Gugino absolutely kills it in this role She uses a myriad of accents and makes the central theme of the series take on a life of it s own Many persons point to predictability in the plot but if you ve read The Raven or any of Poe s other works you ll know how things are going to go down This is a homage again Looking for something new and exciting other than story telling and visuals will set you up for disappointment,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9373612/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2023,Stop comparing every new series to the haunting of hill house,I loved the show and the performances What I don t actually love is seeing negative reviews of people that keep expecting Flanagan to make a series that s similar to the haunting of hill house Don t get me wrong that show was also my favorite like it was to many other people but I believe that every series should be appreciated in its own way I would recommend everybody to give this series a try because it won t disappoint you Also what I really enjoy is the fact that Flanagan recasts the same actors they are all very talented and I ve grown to admire them very much I m already waiting for Flanagan s next project hopefully it will be as good as the others and not like midnight club which is the only one that I didn t particularly like,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9376168/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2023,Mike Flanagan has done it again,I absolutely loved Haunting Of Hill House and Midnight Mass so I was REALLY looking forward to this I am on episode two and I am not disappointed Excellent cast including Rahul Kohli my crush excellent story and excellent scares Dark mysterious symbolic and the perfect amount of light humor I love that he uses the same actors throughout it shows a lot of their versatility And now Mark Hamill is part of the cast I read somewhere that this might be his last show and I really hope that s not true Mike is one of the few directors left making genuinely fantastic horror I recommend watching his other shows if you haven t already,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9372028/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2023,Fall Of The House of Sackler,It s not scary it s a mystery that takes too many episodes to spin the web of integrated Edgar Allen Poe stories and poems into a retelling of the House Of Usher Good idea but in the end it s long and a bit boring Bruce Greenwood is fantastic as usual a great actor the rest of the cast also good I just found the plot to convoluted and contrived to fit in the stories of Edgar Allen Poe Tale Tale Heart The Cask of Amontillado the Black Cat the Gold bug The Masque of The red death so in and so forth Great idea but I found it too slow to binge I suppose it would be better as a non binge series Love the nod to the Saclker family and Purdue Pharma and the opioid deaths they caused globally The real evil,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9376875/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,"Good story and structure, but is over sexualized.",It s a fun show I guess It s nothing like Haunting of Hill House which is an utter masterpiece This show is modern thus delves into garbage like orgies starfishing which I had to look up You quickly learn how debased and garbage all the bloodline kids are so you look forward to watching them die It s kind of a play maybe on how trashy society is now but I don t think that s the point The point was to modernize Edgar Allen Poe s work which is a cool idea but impossible to really do Definitely a good show the acting and cinematography was top level I just lost my interest a little with all the 2023 trash Society is on the down slope sexuality is being weaponized and exploited and I felt this show really didn t allow the stories to come through but instead cowered down to the new normal of over sexualizing things with words and images Overall a good show but kids shouldn t watch it 7 10,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9373803/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2023,Boring,I tried to like this after seeing the directors previous work which I loved I found this to be very slow with long monologues that were dreary and uneventful It could not hold my interest The pacing was slow and boring I was very disappointed not sure what now as expecting but I would say it s the directors worst production I only managed to watch a couple of episodes to which I had to give up Life is too short to watch this drivel I liked the actors but the script and storyline just could not hold my attention I wouldn t waste your time watching it It was not scary or creepy in any way,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9387058/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,A short review from the point of view of an average simpleton who never read Edgar Poe,For those who read and understood Edgar Poe s stories the new Flanagan s work would be a revelation I agree with some other reviewers that the naming of this show is somewhat misleading especially for viewers who are trying to compare it to The Fall of the House of Usher story It is not an adaptation It is a hommage to Poe s legacy and the ideas the author encapsulated in his works You can easily notice the reference to at least one of Poe s stories or poems in each episode The Masque of the Red Death The Black Cat The Pit and the Pendulum The Tell Tale Heart The Gold Bug The Raven And maybe even more I read Poe a long time ago Flanagan captured Poe s gothic atmosphere and core ideas and translated them through the modern context and language which many I think did not like,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9374936/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2023,"Well, that was generic and boring",What can I say about this series Perhaps the first thing I could wonder about is the high ratings The series was generic boring lightweight predictable and seen oh so many times The production seemed like a traditional product of Hollywood mass production lines odourless and tasteless compromised pulp for the masses The series also contained traditional Hollywood pseudo philosophical nonsense and pathetic declarations Everything was also exaggerated although that was probably a deliberate ploy for effect For example the Usher family s lawyer confiscated items from a crime scene including a knife used in the killing with the permission of the police Oh dear Yes I know it s fiction But if the series is also trying to take a stand on social issues at least some reality has to be maintained,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9388159/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2023,Seriously?,Seriously this is what y all are talking so highly of Anytime you see nothing but 10 10 ratings from people you need to be very suspicious Even a 9 10 is a super high score for any piece of media What we have here is another instance of Flanagan completely missing the mark People say if you re a huge fan of Poe than you ll love this How It literally has nothing to do with his short story This is in name only So yea specifically the acting for one is abysmal Completely unbelievable Story is predictable overly long and drawn out boring characters are unlikable and annoying and of course it wouldn t be a modern day retelling if It didn t have some stupid one sided social commentary in it like yea I went into The Fall in the House of Usher for modern day political commentary That s what I wanted Thank you Ugh I think I m done with Mike Flanagan,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9382920/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2023,What a terrible perversion of great story,I love E A Poe and I loved The haunted house on the hill or whatever it was called This was a 10 out of 10 show and I don t even like horror stories So my expectations where high Unfortunately I got disappointed big time The characters are all blown up cliches and every episode just shows how perverted the pictured character is Since The haunted house on the hill every show Mike Flanagan has made was a little bit worse than the one before and now we are at rock bottom Not only are the characters cliches and the storytelling is bad this show covers every sexual preference that there is Well done in diversity but also a cliche already,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9387135/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2023,What did I just watch?,The Haunting Of Hill House was a masterpiece of a series except the finale What happened to Mike Flanagan Not enough in the budget time constraints lack of resources The Fall Of The House of Usher is a prime example of what has happen to TV and entertainment over the past 5 years Zero attention to detail skeleton casts worst yet a lack of any logic and or relation to the human experience People generally act a certain way when you loose children no matter how rich a parent even when that person is demented the death of a sibling the role of a lawyer who does everything without a staff police procedure at a multiple murder crime scene the list goes on I painfully watched every episode and every five minutes or less my intelligence was insulted As I read the positive reviews I have to wonder if they re as fake as the plot threads Actually there is one redeeming quality they ve check boxed every demographic box for the modern audience When are producers going to stand up to that nonsense hire the best actor or actress it ain t that hard Or are we doomed to expect casting that s not cohesive for the sake of corporate enforced diversity and inclusion that contradicts the story being told Admittedly I thought the last episode was cleaver but it was too little too late I ve never read a Edgar Poe book but I m guessing this series reflects none of his great work,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9392131/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2023,3 hour movie stretched to 8,1 Neutral For Poe readers this is Usher in name only I am okay with adaptations being different as long as it is good remember The Shining 2 Bad First problem this is a 3 episodes series horribly stretched to 8 episodes This means hours of filler The filler Having the main characters recite Poe poems as dialogue Other scenes are rambling conversations about nothing 3 Good Outside of the lame actress playing the granddaughter almost everyone else are good actors which is very rare 4 Bad Problem is they had nothing to work with With 8 episodes there should have been some great character development no I barely knew the children s names or even that they were even children of the protagonist until episode 3 So there was little care when things happened 5 Good Atmosphere There was an effective use of lighting sound effects and create the gloomy something about to happen mood 6 Bad Everything else The traditional horror cliches multi million dollar houses with no security no police ever story only exists with everyone making bad decisions no logic or reasoning to people s motivations and people reacting in ways that are extremely over the top and nothing steeped in any sort of reality Example after things started happening in the next scene people are talking and acting like the previous scene never happened,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9399382/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2023,Boring and Overrated,It s hard to believe that this show was created by the person behind The Haunting of Hill House and The Haunting of Bly Manor It attempts to craft a thrilling ambiance but ends up feeling dull The attempt to develop complex characters falls short resulting in uninteresting personalities I found it challenging to sit through even the first two episodes My initial expectations were high but I couldn t persevere Why are there so many tedious conversations and why does it feel stretched out I m perplexed by what most viewers see in this show and why so many excellent shows go underappreciated Carl Lumbly s voice was quite grating and it seems like he plays the same character in every show Practically all the characters are annoying and hard to connect with The only character that stands out as worthwhile is Juno Usher,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9388430/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2023,The fall of sleep,Its pretty high rated now but I think the points will drop soon when the Flanagan army and Poe false lovers are finish votings Its like a painting on an artgallery no one likes it but standing there and describe how fantastic it is cause its a famous artist and then you must like it So I know I swear in the Church now when I say this is not a good serie even if Flanagan have done it and poe is in the background its just not good and the ones who likes it are in the hype Its boring amazing slow and boring as a movie this would work after cut away all the filling moments but as a 8 episodes long serie its insane boring since they dont have the material Flanagan invent his wheel all over again and its not working anymore also he put a knot on himself this time to be political correkt and the woke has turn out to be madness I will give it 5 points cause its a good story with smart ending but again would work well as a movie,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9397377/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2023,Profane pseudo intellectualism at best,This is a slur on Poe s legacy I had high hopes for this and at the beginning the atmosphere and the eerie music felt like this show would deliver But then everything went awry with cheap funny overlong expos s of the children with whom noone would be able to form a swnsible connection It is as if those parts were filmed by someone else and glued to the gothic narrative by force Everyone swearing their brains out as if they cannot speak without uttering a swear word at every sentence is desteuctive to the legacy of Poe who never needed such underhanded tactics to draw attention No need to swear no need for nudity and sex he used the best of language and poetry to arouse the imagination to action This drivel wont let you immerse yourself into the narrative at all This is the problem of the new age pseudo intellectuals grabbing at meaning behind even the grotesque meaningless gibberish Edit The last two episodes left me speechless They are boring terrible stretched out I dont know why lots of didactic nonsense that can work on a 5 year old maybe terrible terrible dialogue worse horror scenes This was the worst thing i have had the misfortune to watch I regret having exposed myself to such profanity,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9381838/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,"NOT a direct adaptation of Poe's Usher, encompasses a number of his works",For those who read and understood Edgar Poe s stories the new Flanagan s work would be a revelation I agree with some other reviewers that the naming of this show is somewhat misleading especially for viewers who are trying to compare it to The Fall of the House of Usher story It is not an adaptation It is a hommage to Poe s legacy and the ideas the author encapsulated in his works You can easily notice the reference to at least one of Poe s stories or poems in each episode The Masque of the Red Death The Black Cat The Pit and the Pendulum The Tell Tale Heart The Gold Bug The Raven And maybe even more I read Poe a long time ago Flanagan captured Poe s gothic atmosphere and core ideas and translated them through the modern context and language which many I think did not like,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9373513/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,Perfect for spooky October,I think this is my favourite series from Flanagan I m a fan of edgar allan poe but not so much that I know everything about it I did notice some of the detail and the references and it was all so delightful I love love this series For the stories the characters the cinematography the actors Everything just fit nicely Verna the Raven is my favourite She stole the scenes the whole series honestly I love that boots in the last episode So sexy Roderick was also great Everything just great basically It is tight storytelling Not that long and not that short The mixture of psychological thriller and magic are just perfectly combined,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9373615/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2023,A compelling story that happens to be scary and a thriller.,Perhaps the most alluring thing about this director is how committed he is to telling a good story and this is definitely a good story Like all his works there are scary moments and jump scares but that isn t the point The point is the story being told and the story being told in the House of Usher is as dark as it is mysterious I loved every minute of this series and binged it in one day There s something so compelling about the story it s narrated like Bly Manor and these characters are both relatable at point and yet so far removed from reality that you almost cheer when bad things befall them Given our current political climate I think it s no mistake that the family depicted here is wealthy beyond measure own an opioid pushing drug company and out greed above all things Flannigan has done it again and I cannot WAIT to see what he does after leaving Netflix This mini series format seems to suit him and I d love to see what his work would look like with the resources of HBO,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9378031/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2023,8 episodes for a 90 minute movie. Lame ending,I struggled to watch parts of this but endured expecting a decent ending as so much work was put into this series Tons of poetry that got to be a bit much after a while the endless rants of social constructs and vices Mostly it s just people seeing ghosts That s it Some pharma baddies of course as they are an easy target Then everyone is outrageously rich and they have to all have their faults and the audience is dragged through each child s demise it becomes boring The director is known for poor work and this is no different lots of hype and this is similar The absolute worst is the ending where we get to explore a rant from the rich people of the world I m not sure this is what people really want too see Disappointing cumbersome and just a simple wrap up This could have easily been compressed into a movie that doesn t make it better just shorter 3 10 Mark is good and Bruce kept me interested everyone else is just average at best Simple predictable and forgettable,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9375473/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2023,unwatchable,I really really really wanted to like this series I am a big Edgar Allen Poe fan and so of course the title immediately grabbed me Unfortunately I very quickly found out that the show has nothing to do with the Edgar Allen Poe masterpiece after which it is named The creators are obviously attempting to piggyback on the name of Edgar Allen Poe who is possibly the most brilliant American horror writer of all time Nice bait and switch I was quickly turned off by the obvious pandering to political correctness in both the casting and in the interaction between the brother and sister Of course every girl character these days has to be the tough one with her male counterpart being weak and scatterbrained and dependent on her I couldn t finish the first episode Yet another crap series released by Netflix NEXT,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9379938/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,The Fall of the House of Flanagan,The show should have been titled The Fall of the House of Flanagan From Gerald s Game to Doctor Sleep and even Midnight Mass Mike Flanagan had a remarkable streak However The Midnight Club left me baffled with its truly awful quality And now there s the new mess The Fall of the House of Usher Let s start with the positives although they are few The horror scenes were undeniably cool and the character resolutions at the end of each episode were well executed When it comes to acting Carla Gugino stands out as the shining star Every scene she s in she delivers a captivating performance that genuinely frightened me On the other hand the rest of the cast is quite forgettable The story unlike the compelling narrative of Midnight Mass failed to engage me The dramatic scenes were lackluster and I couldn t connect with the story of this dysfunctional family As for the original source material I can t comment on it since I haven t read it In summary I found this series to be deeply disappointing,5,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9373739/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2023,ZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,I managed to get through a little over half of this mess and finally gave up on it This is yet another bloated mini series with an excessive amount of unnecessary padding mostly in the form of ridiculously endless dialogue designed to stretch its running time out over eight episodes Is this really supposed to be horror For every one hour episode there s only about three minutes of actual horror content and the rest is just a never ending talkfest There are so many needless scenes solely created to pad out the 450 minute runtime that it became incredibly dull and repetitive I found it impossible to care about any of these mostly unbelievable characters After reading some of these reviews I couldn t care less if Mike Flanagan or Ingmar Bergman directed this snooze fest either way it would still stink,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9378443/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,Man... I really held out hope for this one...,I was really hoping Flannagan would make something again that was as decent of a caliber as Doctor Sleep or The Haunting of Hill House Even Midnight Mass although that was far too filled with scripture and run on rantings but still had it s moments But Once again This was a hot mess I cannot believe he took a work of Poe and turned it into this borderline tacky American Horror Story woke ill casted mess The story is all over the place the cast of actors is too far stretched and written to be absolutely obnoxious It is all too easy to lose interest very early on Disappointing to wait so long or something new from Flanagan and all the while hoping it is crap like Bly Manor or even worse The Midnight Club but nope Instead we get more garbage,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9374898/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2023,Mike Flanagan Needs to Stop,Here we go again Having made fumbling grasps at Stephen King Shirley Jackson and Henry James Mike Flanagan and his merry band of idiots are back to desecrate the legacy of arguably America s greatest writer in Edgar Allen Poe Here s yet another talky melodramatic soap opera that clunkily weaves in goofy and superficial references to superior source material And in this case source material is used particularly loosely name dropping The Cask of Amondtillado The Gold Bug Fall of The House of Usher and Annabelle Lee in a single episode doesn t make this nonsense an adaptation of Poe any more than setting Hocus Pocus in Salem Massachusetts makes it an adaptation of The Crucible Flanagan turns everything he touches into self indulgent gibberish and it seems like his worst instincts get amplified with every critically acclaimed monstrosity Netflix excretes on his behalf,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9376968/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2023,Another obnoxiously shallow Netflix series...,And obviously the horror killer Mike Flanagan made it Someone needs to explain me what is horror about any of his creations The drama is always heavy handed the suspense is nonexistent and the jump scares would frighten a five year old And in this show s case the characters are just as vapid and plain as the script With episodes that are repetitive to the extreme The only thing you re interested in is how the children will die and if it will be gruesome Which it isn t it s laughable at best The evil rich people thing is tired and tiring but the problem with the story is how they are not even portrayed in a compelling way where you can at least acknowledge their importance The acting is ok like watching hosts reading a teleprompter convincingly I can t say nice things about this production because it looks so full of itself it clearly needs nobody s approval to think how good it is And has several bots to convince us of its self proclaimed higher standards Which is what matters now right,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9409819/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2023,Mike Flanagan scores again.,Bloody hell this is a damn good show I won t put any spoilers here I m only writing a short blurb as a fan of all his work These actors are just so good I actually love his reoccuring stars This show might seem like it takes on a story that s been done many times before But this is a twist a blend of genres with great style great writing and as always great and memorable lines and scenes I have to say during the first two episodes I was reminded of the kardashians aswell as the brutality of the world Of the Hunger of people the never enough I need more the shallowness wants becoming need and getting lost in greed But these characters are not two dimensional the story is not one of shallowness Mikes work always goes deep into exposing the vulnerabilities and complexities of interpersonal relationships the rawness of human desire and insecurities It s not just plain old horror with jump scares There s meaning to his work Or its just good entertainment to put it simply Great execution of all production sides I love the distinct style he has for his characters I can t help but love Rahul kholi in everything he does aswell as kate siegal They both really nailed these roles I can t help but feel like we all know or have seen some form of these characters we ve seen them online content creators actors or people that are famous for just being famous Really I think the ridiculousness of these characters make this painted against a back drop of tragedy mystery and horror And watching this I just felt like I hope he keeps making series that he publishes books makes films and just keeps creating Made me want to watch hill house and bly manor Don t get me wrong I don t think anything will be as good as those for me Bly manor my favourite But I hope we see more of these anthologies from him Overall a great watch for Netflix in amongst lot of the usual mediocre releases Not just a typical horror,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9372241/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,"If Kardashians made an horror series... Nothing to do with Edgar Allan Poe,",I m really thinking whether suing Netflix for such a scam or just pray for they to delete this monstruos sacrilege they ve done to THE BIGGEST WRITER OF HORROR TALES you don t change ANYTHING to adapt Poe Poe adapts you Poe is PERFECTION itself every single word every single point every single comma every single color he describes every silhoutte every breath every scream every sound every step every noise he puts in his pieces are there for A VERY GOOD REASON you can t just erase all the inquisition part in the pit and the pendulum JUST BECAUSE like why This was a sacrilege reminded me more to the Kardashian s reality show but with a gothic and scary vibes like wth Kardashians have to do with Allan Poe How do you arrive to one of the biggest writters and poets in human history and you destroy it like if you are putting a show of some rich divas with glimpses of horror dude no this can t be legal I really wanna sue Netflix for the worst adaptation in history and of course for wasting my time,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9374299/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2023,I Found It Fascinating,It seems to be a very polarizing series but I personally couldn t stop watching It was very Meta and you could tell the pulling back of the curtain to show the ugly underbelly of mosern society was the real horror story I can see why people might be disappointed because it s really more of a social commentary piece Bruce Greenwood absolutely kills it as the Patriarch and Mary McDonnell is cold calculating and shrewd as always So happy to see Mark Hamill working again as well he did well in his role and hope to see more from him in the future And Camille Kate Siegel Mike Flanagan s wife is just the worst I mean her character is just so despicable,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9372945/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2023,Review not from an Edgar fan but a Flanagan fan!,Went into this with great excitement knowing this was Flanagan s last work with Netflix An end of an era as many of us found him on this platform and fell in love with his work Coming to The Fall of the House of Usher it s a good show that never touched greatness for me It s definitely better than Flanagan s last work for Netflix The Midnight Club but it wasn t a hard show to top The premise is good the writing is decent and the acting is convincing but the show itself is way too simple and predictable for it to make me intrigued about what happens next If you pay attention to the first episode you can get a pretty good idea of what will happen next and the show never tries to challenge its initial premise it s fun to watch the events play out but they play out without surprise I don t regret watching this at all and I believe it s definitely a worthwhile watch if you like Flanagan s previous work Excited for whatever he does next in the future,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9376854/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2023,7 stars solely for the haunting performance of Mrs. Carla Gugino.,For those who read and understood Edgar Poe s stories the new Flanagan s work would be a revelation I agree with some other reviewers that the naming of this show is somewhat misleading especially for viewers who are trying to compare it to The Fall of the House of Usher story It is not an adaptation It is a hommage to Poe s legacy and the ideas the author encapsulated in his works You can easily notice the reference to at least one of Poe s stories or poems in each episode The Masque of the Red Death The Black Cat The Pit and the Pendulum The Tell Tale Heart The Gold Bug The Raven And maybe even more I read Poe a long time ago Flanagan captured Poe s gothic atmosphere and core ideas and translated them through the modern context and language which many I think did not like,7,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9392395/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2023,Pretty bad!,I watched 1 5 episodes and decided what was billed as a Drama Horror is actually more of a comedy I was disappointed mainly because it has a few of my favourite actors namely Bruce Greenwood Carl Lumbly and Carla Gugino This fact did little to lift my opinion I just did not like it or them much I was a little afraid to even watch it as a film of the same name had scared me half to death some years ago As this comes across more as a comedy it absolutely does not All in all I am sorry I even tried I had high hopes silly me There is so little on any streaming service worth watching indeed more and more older items are being added The writers actors strike not helping I guess,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9396532/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,Flanagan does it again all right. Another trash series.,After the admittedly excellent Haunting of Hill House except for the awful finale he s now made three absolutely terrible shows The failure Blah Manor Midnight Mess and now The Fall of Quality TV Midnight Mess contained endless scenes of people having long extremely long nonsensical diatribes that would terminally bore any normal person Now we have this new trash emulating another trash show Succession featuring the biggest low life s ever seen on TV Usher has again endless worthless conversations about nothing in particular We easily bowed out after the first episode I didn t have much hope for this but I didn t think it would be this bad If anybody is looking here for any type of horror they will be sorely disssapointed Actually if you re looking for any type of entertainment then you should seek it elsewhere You ll only find trash drivel Avoid at all cost,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9373199/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2023,True Poe Fan,I have read several of the reviews and wonder if most people either didn t watch the whole series or aren t as familiar with Poe as they think I thought this was BRILLIANT This isn t just about The Fall of the Usher House This is a collective work of several of Poe s writings Read the episode titles and then watch the show I promise it will make it much more enjoyable and keep you wondering how a modern take on classics stories might be told I am a Flanagan fan I love the use of actors from project to project They are a perfect working group It was awesome to see Mark Hamill again Although I must admit his character was very creepy This will be a favorite that I watch again and again I m sure I will see hear and feel more of Poe each time,10,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9373968/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2023,No,Using Poe for cover this is a bad VERY bad slop off of HBOs succession The spoiled spiteful kids and grandkids of the rich and debaucherous It s all so tiresome trying tear down those you re so envious of by building them up There is nothing redeeming about this hackneyed and self indulgent mess that Poe wouldn t even recognize enough of to spin in his grave If the studios had watched this poorly written agony before caving into writers they would have done the whole world a favor by letting the strike drag on I won t offer up any spoilers primarily because something has to be good before it can be spoiled,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9373062/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2023,Nevermore! Nevermore! Nevermore!,The Fall of the House of Usher on Netflix is an absolute disaster of an adaptation of the classic Edgar Allan Poe story I don t know whether to laugh or cry at how far off the mark this series is It s a masterclass in how not to adapt a beloved literary work First and foremost the show takes the essence of Poe s eerie and atmospheric tale and throws it out the window The characters are barely recognizable as Poe s creations Instead of the tormented Roderick and Madeline Usher we get vapid one dimensional caricatures who seem more interested in their social media presence than in their family s dark history The acting is so wooden that I wouldn t be surprised if the cast was made up of actual wooden puppets Plot wise The Fall of the House of Usher decides to take the story in a completely different direction apparently because the writers had no faith in Poe s original narrative Instead of a slow descent into madness we get a rushed and nonsensical narrative that feels like a rejected soap opera script The supernatural elements are replaced with cheap jump scares that wouldn t even frighten a toddler And don t even get me started on the dialogue It s as if the writers took a thesaurus and randomly selected words to create lines that make absolutely no sense The characters babble on and on about nothing leaving viewers scratching their heads and wondering if they accidentally tuned into a foreign language channel The Fall of the House of Usher on Netflix is an abomination that should never have seen the light of day It s a disrespectful and disastrous interpretation of Poe s masterpiece Do yourself a favor and read the original story instead it s a thousand times more chilling and thought provoking than this cringe worthy series,3,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9372669/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2023,A brilliant reimagining of Poe's legacy,Mike Flanagan the creative mind behind Gerald s Game and The Haunting of Hill House has delivered a brilliant rendition of Edgar Allan Poe s work The Fall of the House of Usher is a well structured and meticulously crafted series where the entire narrative including its backstories is masterfully interwoven throughout For those seeking a faithful literal translation of Poe s works this series may be a challenge to watch While Poe s themes poems and short stories are carefully sprinkled throughout each episode especially in the gripping finale Mike Flanagan reinvents the enigmatic author with his own signature voice tone and style Speaking of themes Flanagan adeptly captures Poe s obsession with the macabre From reanimated corpses to the dread of being buried alive from being sadistically encased behind walls to the pervasive sense of irony and ludicrous extravagance Flanagan brings all these concepts to life beautifully for a modern audience A series that builds suspense and classically rooted horror with each episode complete with gorgeous storytelling and of course an outstanding cast of familiar faces it s Flanagan s most ambitious project yet A must watch for Flanagan fans,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9402771/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2023,Mike Flanagan is back with another great series,Mike Flanagan returns with The Fall of the House of Usher Another complex intriguing and well executed horror mini series I have been a huge fan of his previous work Hill House Bly Manor Midnight Mass so I was extremely excited to start this one And it did not disappoint Great to see so many actors from his previous series return as well as new faces like Bruce Greenwood House of Usher follows doomed siblings Roderick and Madeline Usher and the dark secrets that even their wealth and privilege can t keep buried The series reimagines and remixes several works by Edgar Allan Poe in a modern setting,9,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9372177/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2023,"Boring, unambitious, uninspiring.",I liked Gerald s Game I thought it was an interesting premise I haven t found anything Flannagan s done since of merit This isn t particularly bothersome it killed an afternoon or so and I did watch the entire first episode with my full attention Episode 2 I started multi tasking with some computer games and it s still VERY easy to follow and I ll admit being quite familiar with the works this is based off so Flannagan s competent but let s face it Netflix is TV and this miniseries is definitely made for tv I do expect it to be at least a bit better not being Hallmark it IS Netflix so I wavered off 4 Stars if it were Hallmark Some of the cast were alright some weren t there s an early scene where the Usher kids go to the obese angry guy across the road when mummy s dying he was terrible and I laughed out loud at how bad his acting was same goes for Juno Ruth Codd just awful probably cheap though This won t age well If you ve got a Stephen King reading age you ll start seeing holes problems and failures on your second viewing I would guess I m not going to do a second viewing Flannagan s a hack,2,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9372778/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2023,"[8.5] ""White math and hollow mercy""",Mike Flanagan the Heisenberg of deep horror themed series the leader in narratives creation brought in perfectly by the stellar Carla Gugino and the trademark leader in weaving in based on creative dramatic horror storylines and screenplays to viewers near utmost satisfaction The Fall of The House of Usher is no exception in those slow at times philosophically gut wrenching at others bercing rocking us to higher tips with its bright soothing mesmerizing narratives all the while feasting our eyes and soul with the rise and fall of the Usher dynasty It is slow it is gripping and it is breathtaking in its own world monument and we are so fortunate to have many of Edgar Allan Poe s works and dramatic arts interplanetary woven in thin yet strong webs and multitudes of corpses and stars raining down on our faces tender skin Watch it with a broad heart and praise Carla Gugino for existing and possessing such an immense combination of aura charisma and spatial tremor inducing voice,8,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9377321/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2023,Falls Short In Many Ways,Maybe this could have been a good movie but the show just drags on and on endlessly Simply put we get too much filler time served The production and cast are okay but the sound design is terrible Any movie adaptation of the old times from Hammer Films is superior to this potpourri of The Fall of the House of Usher which in the end is the equivalent of grave robbing I knew before watching that the show is not an adaptation of Poe s work but based on which these days means that people use other people s ideas and material to come up with something original but mostly just fail to please because well not everyone is a Poe or Stephen King himself I confess I did not watch the show to the end but quit in the middle of episode four and I have the impression that I wasted too much of my time enduring the show for that long already I do like some of Mike Flanagan s movies such as Oculus and Hush but this show is no cut for me,4,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9380749/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2023,Everything wrong with modern tv,Was excited to see a new project by Flanagan but OMG this was painful I was done after the first 20 minutes Bad acting painful modern audience cliches and poor writing But I figured I d stick throughout it and it only got so much worse Other than the actor playing Mr Usher nobody and I mean NOBODY in this show can act There are some seriously wooden performances But that s the trend these days Why find talent when you can just check boxes Why write anything with suspense or engaging when you can instead right the wrongs of a century of bigotry in the industry seriously the amount of times I heard the down with the patriarchy and it s time for a matriarchy And why create a genuine horror show when you can instead just create a boring drama for modern audiences There is no horror in the show Or if there is it sure as heck isn t in the first episode and I don t have it in me to slog through another 7 hour long episodes waiting for a scare to pop up Thank god for the writers strike because I hope everyone in loved in this never find work again,1,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9383895/?ref_=tt_urv
