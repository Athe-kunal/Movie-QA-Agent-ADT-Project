10 March 2021,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...

Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.

We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.

What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.

I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.",10
23 February 2020,Great,"Very beautiful and cinematic movie with lots of classic scenes.Also extremely sad at times.Absolute 90's classic.

3 July 2018,"Despite a lot of plot flaws and conveniences, this really is one of the best films ever made.","Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).

It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.

Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",10
10 August 2001,Actually it got better for me,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel.

12 May 2017,Timeless,"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.

4 November 2020,Greatest movie of all time,"Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world. Astounding as this may sound, I've just now got around to watching ""Titanic,"" 23 years on, and I'm staggered at all that I've missed my whole life.

Young love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it's also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle. Couple that with the story of a young teenage girl in the bygone era of aristocrat families and arranged marriage, side saddles and corsets, outrageous class inequality and rich powerful men in control of everything and keeping women under their thumbs - and you get ""Titanic."" And James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cracked it with a bang! They impressed. They dazzled. They shined.

They took our breath away.

18 February 2016,As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.

First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.

However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.

So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.

Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.",10
11 December 1998,One of a Kind,"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.

23 January 2022,Every time I see this movie....,"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.

While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.

I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!

My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope beyond hope that there is a better place they went to.",10
16 November 2002,A Superb Epic,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel.

30 March 2013,My review is this film's 2400th....so what more can I say?!,"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.

I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once.

20 January 2015,"Amazing in 1997, 2005, 2015, 2030, 3010 & forever more a Masterpiece!","You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!

Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!

12 September 2019,This Film Brought Me To Tears,"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece.",10
30 January 2023,"In retrospect, we were all too hard on this film","If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.

In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.

My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.",9
30 July 1998,One for the Ages,"This movie re-wrote film history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.

11 January 2015,"Haunting, Powerfully Resonant And Visually Stunning","James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.",
27 June 2019,the ultimate lovestory,"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.

when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.

its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..

the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list",10
9 August 1998,bravo,"Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor. Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters. I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake. I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them. But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie. Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet). But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning. Bravo to Cameron. He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail. I like detail in a movie. Very impressive job.",
3 June 2002,Amazing,"I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurances was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.

Kate Winslet was stunning as Rose and this movie belonged to her as you couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role.

Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack and he should have had an an Oscar nomination for this role and the ever brilliant Billy Zane didn't disappoint in his role as Rose's fiance Cal. His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.

James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.

Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film.

Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.

This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten.",
31 July 2020,Why low score?,"People are crazy. They rate Avengers so high and they rate this masterpiece low? This is beyond absurd. You guys should encourage great filmmakers like this one not stupid ones like the super hero franchises. For the love of god.

28 November 2005,"Despite some glaring faults,Cameron's mixing of romance with real life disaster is still impressive and occasionally brilliant","It's really quite odd. When Titanic first came out,the reviews were mixed but the public generally loved it,those who disliked the film were definitely in the minority. Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron. Mixing a real disaster with romance is harder to do than some might think. Maybe he did have a right to say ""I'm king of the world"" when the film won Best Picture at the Oscars. Just once.

The modern day opening is excellent,making effective use of some of Cameron's real footage he took of the sunken Titanic. There is a real sense of mystery. Than we flash back to the Titanic being boarded,and the film stalls just a little for around two hours. The attention to detail is amazing {even all the cutlery matched,you know} and there is nothing wrong with an extremely slow build up to action-think of The Seven Samourai. However,the central romance between Leo and Kate is often badly written and unconvincing. For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did {Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views}. We also have to suffer Cameron constantly labouring the point that the poor people on the ship are better than the rich people.

However,the final 80 or so minutes,detailing the sinking,is simply brilliant film making. The suspense is built expertly,even though we know what will happen,and climaxes with some technical shots which are still impressive. Perhaps there is a little two much emphasis on the central couple,but there are some truly moving moments,and it really feels true,although of course Cameron did play with the facts a little here and there,as at least one descendant of one of the survivors has pointed out. The following sequence involving the boats is extremely haunting,with some especially good use of sound. As for the final scene,it does manage to be pretty moving,it's schmaltzy but it works {though hardly original,think of Somewhere In Time and various 40s romantic fantasies}.

Titanic has some excellent use of CGI {watch out for the transitions from present to the past on the sunken ship} and one glaringly bad special effect-the iceberg which looks like polystyrene. James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation {such as Billy Zane as Rose's fiancée,who even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!}

Overall Titanic is still worth seeing,and sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should. It succeeds more than it fails,which is impressive in a film as ambitious as this.",
12 February 2023,"This is one of the greatest films of all time, and I will fight you on this fact.","This is one of the greatest films of all time, and I will fight you on this fact. This is such a beautiful film, and has one of the greatest love stories I've ever seen brought to screen. It's an iconic film, so I don't know if I can bring anything new to the table. But still... I must say that these are some of the best characters ever. Rose is such a wonderful character, and I love the arc she experiences over the film. Jack is a charming love interest, and Cal is such a dynamic character, and is a fine villain. So many of the characters are played to perfection. The sinking in this film is one of the best technical feats in cinema, and I feel every emotion I can in this film. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the costumes are also glorious. The music is also wonderful, and the song 'My Heart Will Go On' is simply iconic! This is a film that is so cinematic and wonderful. Also, I got to see this on the big screen for the re-release, and it was absolutely amazing, and the way the film was meant to be experienced. It's one of the best cinematic experiences, and I love it.",10
13 February 2022,"The general consensus rating on here should certainly not be as low as 7.9 for a classic, masterpiece, historical period piece romance drama film","My favorite film of all time. The best romance film ever made. The greatest love story ever told. When I was 12 years old, I watched Titanic for the first time and I felt so moved after this resonating cinematic experience. Everything about this film is timeless. From the mesmerizing lead performances, set design, costumes, cinematography, editing, music, and themes of love, loss, sacrifice, and social class politics of the early 20th century... this film will always have a special place in my heart. A notable mention is I consider Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet to be one of the best film couples of all time, and their undeniably beautiful, captivating, natural chemistry is unmatched.

Titanic is an iconic, classic film that I recommend for old, current, and future generations of film watchers.

29 January 2022,"A very good film, amazingly underrated on IMDb","It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity, there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.

Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her become humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.

Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie, there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.

The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance, DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all, it's moments like this where performance counts the most. But what makes these two work is their believable youthfulness and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair are irrelevant.

This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it is everything a movie should be.",9
11 December 2001,"A film with a heart that focuses on two lovers, and sees the disaster through their eyes...","I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",10
29 July 1998,Powerful Storytelling,"While some viewers were disappointed that this wasn't just another A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, I believe that the use of the fictional characters was an effective story-telling device.

We are brought into the story through Jack and Rose with the historical characters and events as a backdrop. The same device is used in such great films as GONE WITH THE WIND, THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE, and THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON. History is thus brought to life without being ponderous.

17 June 2002,"Timeless, moving, and epic","Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.

I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.

No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.

James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.

This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.

The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.

I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.

Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.",10
5 July 2023,"When the boat sinks, this film starts to rise","Since I was a teenager in 1997, I can say with some degree of confidence that Titanic was made for teenage girls. Almost all of my female friends of the time adored this movie and paid to see it multiple times in theaters, so I can see why it saw so much box office success. Also, there's no question that when the boat sinks, it's terrifyingly spectacular. However, the real downfall of this movie is the terribly corny dialogue. The script sounds like it was written by adolescents. Plus, the love story is overly melodramatic. I can see why Titanic made a splash, but I only really enjoy the last half.

13 November 2022,Wow,"OK, so somehow I've managed to get to the age of 27 never having seen Titanic. Sure I know people love it, it won all the Oscars, it's constantly talked about, but I just kept thinking ""can it really be that good, surely it's over-hyped""... reader, it really is that good.

The love story between Jack and Rose is just so engaging. So much so I was willing the ship not to sink so I could watch more of it. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet is spot on and I was so drawn in by the story they were telling. Just wonderful.

Then there's the actual sinking of the Titanic which is expertly retold by Cameron. You feel every moment of dread and panic. It makes for a harrowing and powerful watch and also a visual spectacle.

The set design and costume etc are all superb. You totally feel like you are on the ship and thrust into the time period.

Also, considering it is over three hours long, James Cameron manages to make it fly by. I must admit the length of the film always kind of put me off watching it but rest assured it does not feel long at all, such is the technical mastery and the brilliant story.

Fantastic score too.

Titanic is one of those films where, if like me you have put off watching it, you should remedy that as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed.",9
3 June 2009,"Very ambitious, but beautifully filmed and acted.","I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.",8

26 June 2023,Possibly the most disrespected film of all time.,"This film is an absolute masterpiece, yet whenever it's discussed people often dismiss it or rarely praise it.

There is so much more to this film beyond the romance and the iceberg, it's a time capsule. You can tell how much care and attention to detail went into it, the sets and costumes are incredible, the political/class subtext is very well crafted. There are so many characters involved and each have their moments where they shine, motivations and decisions make sense, nobody turns in a poor performance.

The pacing of this film is brilliant considering it's length. The numerous story beats and set pieces all build up towards a final act that's up there with the best cinema has ever offered.

It's one of those films that deserves a rewatch every so often; if ever you hear someone dismiss it you must implore them to give it another go. It has aged very well and deserves more credit, which is crazy considering it won ELEVEN Oscars, all of which were fully earned.",10
15 February 2023,First time in theater,"I have loved this film since the day I saw it in 1999 on two VHS tapes on my post-soviet TV. I have watched it since then countless times, but never on a big screen until now. I, once again, fell in love with Titanic as I watched it in the theater.

Titanic in 3D on a massive screen is the most epic film that I have ever seen. Nothing can come to the scale of it; every shot is made to drop your jaw, to blow your mind and give you most mind-blowing movie-going experience. Only someone as arrogant as James Cameron could make a film like this.

No film will ever dethrone Titanic as my all-time favorite movie.

14 June 2014,If you haven't yet saw Titanic. Get onboard! Titanic is king of the world!,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",8
3 August 2020,Powerful Film About Finding The Will To Live,"The true reason that Jack has to die doesn't lie in the physics of surviving in very cold water, but in the inner logic of the story. Jack has to die because he exists in order to empower Rose and give her the will to live. And once that story purpose is fulfilled, he's gone.

I think we tend to fixate on the insanely iconic romance scenes and the sinking of the ship. But a big focus of the actual movie is on the theme of finding the will to live. From Roses perspective, it's as if Jack conveniently springs into existence precisely when she needs him to stop her from ending her life and reveal to her a better way out of her misery. The moment that Jack dies is also the moment when Rose finally commits wholeheartedly to not dying. Jack teaches Rose to keep the fire going within her to rekindle in her the desire to live.

Before the Titanic hits the iceberg, money, expressed as the classes onboard, seems all-important, especially to the people in first class. But when we're facing down death, all the riches in the world are suddenly revelled to be worthless. The move illustrates this perfectly when Cal tries to bride First officer Murdoch for a seat on the lifeboat. But Murdoch is about to die; so what use is money to him? Therefore if your ship is going down what does it matter what class you're going to die in? Near the end of the movie, we're told Cal commits suicide after losing much of his money in the Crash of 29. So because Cal cant understand that money really isn't everything, it's as if he never actually learns what the value of life is. When the older rose throws the heart of the ocean into the water at the end, she's again rejecting Cal's value system and the idea that wealth matters anywhere near as much as those inner, spiritual things that drive us. So Rose is giving the heart of the ocean back to Jack and recognizing the way that he resorted her heart to her - helping her find the fire within that she needed to live this long, full life.

Rose appears at the start to be the ""damsel in distress' type. But it quickly becomes clear that Rose is our real hero - she's the one who undergoes a complete transformation, and this is her story. Jack exists to service Rose's story. Jack purpose in Titanic is to enable Rose's character growth. Jack has given her all the tools necessary for her survival, so his role in the story is complete. And that, essentially is why he has to die at the end. Not because he can't fit on the door but because the story has no more use for him. In the later story, the crew searching for the diamond tell us they didn't find anything on Jack and there's no record of him. The story gives us an excuse for this - Jack won his ticket last minute in a poker game. But it seems intentional that the movie plants the tiniest seed of doubt as to whether Jack was really on the ship after all. At the end of Rose's life. Jacks memory is completely erased from the world, except for the indelible impact he's left on her - so he's alive only in her heart. It's a bit of a stretch to read Titanic as Rose's romance with a guy who's totally imaginary - of course, many others interact with Jack. But the point is that jack has a subtle air of unreality about him... he feels like some fantasy of a sexy life-coach that every girl needs from time to time to help her reorient her heart in the right direction.

Jack is the piece of her that's missing. A woman getting in touch with her animus (Masculine Side) often involves finding strength of will and determination to act. These are things that historically, society hasn't really encouraged in women (espeically in 1912). But as soon as Rose merges with Jack, her animus, she becomes daring and holds, her own woman. In an incredibly accelerated timeline, she ditches her fiance and turns her back on her family and social class. Rose shows sexual agency, too, actively pursuing Jack in their romance. And after she has sex with Jack, Rose is assertive, holding and comforting him. When she arrives on the other shore, she assumes a new name in a new country. Taking his last name is a symbolic commitment to Jack, representing the idea that in her secret mind, she is forever married to him. But if we say that he's her animus her ""marriage' to this piece of herself would symbolize a promise that she'll never abandon her own agency and will again. Jacks death can be read as the moment when her animus ceases to be something sperate from her - and the result is Rose Dawson.

So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.

Great movie that sill holds up all these years. RIP James Horner & Bill Paxton",10
19 April 2003,"Come on, admit it. This is a great film!","When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see...

Jim Cameron didn't need to create this huge-scale, heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the movie-going world, though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history (9/11, Pearl Harbor, etc). Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail, this film is without peer.

The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a world-class actor, but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn't have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" is always likeable and the rest of the cast (mostly Brits) does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film's best performance as Winslet's greedy, snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguard/enforcer. As far as the special effects go, it's hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it, you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking, but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing, only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of, shoot, and edit the last hour of the film. The results are terrific.

There are flaws in the overall mix, however. Some of the dialogue (Mostly Leo's) is down right corny. ""When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose!"" or ""You seem like kind of an indoor girl"" are two examples. Also, the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today's economy would go for $80,000! These were some RICH people, and they wouldn't have let a guy like Dawson near them.

Anyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It's not that bad.

This film is tragic, exciting, sensual, pretentious, corny, extravagant, and even a little cheesy. And I love EVERY DAMN MINUTE OF IT!!!!!!!!

5 of 5 stars.

20 June 2003,"If this movie is ""over-hyped"" we only have the public to blame....","I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do! I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.

As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!

Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"". ha! Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!

Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It's not thier best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!",10
25 June 2023,One hell of a movie,"I've never watched Titanic until now. It caught my interest when I heard the story about those 5 people who lost their lives on an expedition to the Titanic.

I've heard about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it. It's honestly one of the best movies I've seen. I had so many emotions watching it. Laughter, tears, anger, terror etc.

The characters were phenomenal. To think of all of those people who really went through pure terror. I couldn't imagine.

Needless to say, if you have not seen this movie, please go watch it. I had to add it to my list of favorite movies.

Job well done to everyone involved in making this masterpiece.",9
30 December 2018,A division of morality,"I see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not? I saw this movie on its release, being a ten year old child I was more concerned about seeing a young naked female than watching fifteen thousand five hundred and three people die.

Such a movie was shut away in the back of my small silly mind and revived on the odd occasion through out my life. Over all I presumed this movie had little to no impact on my life until I realized it inspired my artistic talent.

That mysterious picture of Rose was set in my mind from a very young age and inspires me to this day along with the other pictures in Jacks portfolio. Anyone with an artistic flare would know what I am talking about.

Later on in life I presumed this movie was a propaganda piece and took less care to even notice it. Until I took notice. It became evident that this movie portrayed two peoples exceptionally well, the rich and the poor. That was the division and a sad one at that. Its easy to focus on the love life of Jack and Rose but easier to focus on the indignation of the rich and poor and I think the movie might of underplayed that. Which is acceptable.

Its easy to say the movie was a tragic one but its easier to say it represents a heart of darkness and it is that darkness that makes one cry. Its extremely well filmed. The filmography is brilliant, the music enumerates and over all the entire film compliments itself each second.

There was a dispensation in film making of peak performances, this era seemed to last less than twenty years, this film was filmed during it,",10

6 August 2022,An all-time great film,"Beautiful, feel-good and touching movie. All those poor souls that knew it was their end, I cannot imagine the horror. Leonardo DiCaprio is a generational talent; I cannot believe he was only around 20 years old when production began in 1995.

The portrayal and accuracy of the actual events is pretty accurate, as well as the raw emotions captured from the cast when facing the dire situation of a sinking ship with not enough time, lifeboats, or assistance.

I love movies like this that spread awareness and gives those who cannot speak for themselves anymore a ""voice"". Though this tragic incident happened over 100 years ago, I can feel sympathy for all those affected by the sinking of the Titanic. James Cameroon did a fantastic job.

31 August 2022,A Master Classic!!!,"""Titanic"" is a masterpiece in every single angle: beautiful plot, amazing direction, stupendous visual effects, perfect cinematography, outstanding soundtrack, and breathtaking performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. This is a typical Hollywood movie but on a grand scale. ""Titanic"" will be known as the ""Gone with Wind"" of the 90s. James Cameron with his vision created a classic. He involves us from the beginning of the film, with real scenes of the wreckage of the Titanic in the present day. From there, he takes us back to the past and introduces each character in his opera. For more than three and half hours, we are embraced by the love story between Jack and Rose and also by the tragic event in every single details.

This should be at least 8.9!!!!!!!!!

I literally can't get over it.

The scene where Rose jumped back to the ship and they run towards each other

The ending scene where Rose goes back to the ship and reunites with Jack in another world

"" winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me. It brought me to you.""

They are both willing to die for each other.

""My heart will go on "" just reminds me of all the beautiful scenes and I can't stop thinking about it

When the movie ends I feel this emptiness and I just can't help watching it again and again.

20 June 2017,Bravo,"Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",10

5 September 2010,Breathtaking recreation of the tragic voyage,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed ""Titanic"" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber.

Rather than go into the story, I'll just say that this film is a true masterpiece, meticulously researched, designed, costumed, and acted, and gives one the feeling of the desperation, fear, sorrow, and finality that the people on the ship must have felt. The entire time I watched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the World Trade Center on 9/11.

There have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as Rose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). DiCaprio is terrific - exuberant, passionate, and adventurous.

If you don't know a lot about the Titanic, this movie will pique your interest. When you read more about it, you'll be impressed by Cameron's commitment to bring this piece of history to life.",10
12 February 2023,PLEASE SEE THIS IN 3D!!,"I don't know why I have waited so long to see this but I finally got to see this in theaters during the 3D rerelease and oh how I messed up. This was the best 3D film I've seen as well as a top 5 movie of all time in my opinion. It has everything, romance, humor, terror, drama, and not too mention, one of the best ""historical"" movies out there. This also was the first time I cried during a movie, and I've seen too many to count. Someone may want to take my man card but I don't care. If this doesn't move you, you might need to get your pulse checked. Just an amazing movie. If you can see this in 3D, DO IT! It's worth the money and the slightly higher frame count is a really nice touch! It adds a little smoothness without the soap opera effect which can turn some people off. Cant wait for this to come out on 4K blu-ray! NEVER LET GO!!

28 June 2003,"Excellent, epic drama","I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",10
10 June 1999,Ultra-Hollywood Spin on one of the 20th Century's Most Famous Disasters,"Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",8
12 December 2020,One of the best,"I have watched Titanic dozens if not hundreds of times since I first got it on VHS as a kid in the 90s. I hadn't watched it for many years until the past few days when I watched it a few times in a row, and really appreciated it on a deeper level I felt, or maybe just remembered how truly great it is.

Sure it has its cinematic flaws, such as seeing waves lapping at the shoreline next to the set when it should be the Titanic in the middle of the ocean. But then again all films have their little quirks and errors scattered throughout. Despite those found in Titanic, the emotion that the film makes me feel is unmatched by any other movie. It is pure magic from start to finish, many times throughout the film my eyes well up with tears, or outright balling.

It's one of the few movies that I would pay good money to see again in a massive full theatre.

I really don't know why it's not in the IMDb top 250, when many films on the list are trash in comparison to Titanic, in my opinion.

Titanic is in my Top 10 of all time, alongside Lord of the Rings, Hero, Kimi No Na Wa, Princess Mononoke, and Lonesome Dove, and others.",10
18 February 2023,This movie is so hard for me,"First time i saw this movie was when i was 8, with my mother in the theater.

Next time it was with my stepfather, my brother and my mother when i was 15 and in that time i knew more about the life so i cried.

Third time was with my ex girlfriend 8 years ago.

Today this movie hit me harder then any time before. When i was a kid a whole life was in front of me and much more people around me. There was an idea and hope that i will find a perfect love one day. There was an idea that you could become Rose or Jack one day and make things right. And this movie being very powerful it makes you remember very good the moments when you watched it in the past, how you felt, how people around you felt. Today, idea of finding the perfect love, like the one from this movie is idea of a missed opportunity, or the lack of luck. Is idea that triggers the nostalgia and not promises for the future.

The big love that could happen.

In some amount there is some Rose or Jack in everyone of us. Or there will be.",10
23 November 2022,All time best romantic movie,"THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING!!! I love watching it! Jack and Rose, even though they are not real people and never were, feel so realistic and the effects and clothing and decoration they used in this movie makes it feel like I'm actually on the titanic with them! The flooding and sinking scenes were AMAZING and for a 1997 movie, I thought I was watching something from the future. This movie is a must-watch, and there is no wonder why it won so many awards, because it is most definitely the best movie this world has ever known. I also cannot think of anyone else to play Jack and Rose than Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They both did an absolutely awesome job and fit in very well with their roles, and the directors picked their entire cast very wisely. The ""My heart Will go on"" song was the perfect fit for the movie, and got stuck in my head after the 80th time I watched it, which is a very low estimate of the number of times I binge-watched this movie from my sofa with a bucket of popcorn. There are some bits of the movie which are not historically accurate, but oh so few of them, that it doesn't really even matter.

In other words, this movie is something you must watch at least once before the day you die, you will NOT regret it.",10
8 July 2013,Unforgettable motion picture,"Greetings from Lithuania.

I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work.

This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx ""movies"" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them.

Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.",10
21 October 2002,Neither as good nor as bad as you've been told,"If only James Cameron could write dialogue!

This is a well-produced fictionalization of the Titanic and her maiden voyage, with all the historical details just right (well, except for some really minor stuff ...). The romantic story overlaying it all lends poignancy and drew in the crowds, in record numbers. The performances are, by and large, good-to-excellent, except for Leonardo DiCaprio, who did much better in his earlier movies (up to and including The Quick and the Dead), and Billy Zane, who's never been able to do more than look like a movie star.

Cameron is a great director of action, and a good visual story teller. Too bad he's such a control freak, he ought to allow someone to re-write all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking, not T-1000's.

I give this a ""five"" only because the ""seven"" it's currently averaged at is too high.",6
23 February 2001,Triumph in Tradgedy: Titanic,"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game. If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.

The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred. One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic. With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned. Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed. The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted. They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed. The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help. The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own. The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle. Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.

Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real. The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk. The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations. In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'. Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic. Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water. Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912. The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do. The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted. Everything of the time was very formal. Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie. Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken. The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.

A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives. Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night. In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic. Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored. This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed. As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.

Technically the film is very well done. To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage. This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.

Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",9

However this movie is the most heart touching story i have ever seen on screen.I could see people's faces with tears rolling down after departing from the cinema hall.I could hear my father saying "" Never knew that these people could make such heart warming movies"".Maybe i am going a bit too far.But this is my way of paying tribute to the greatest movie ever made.

14 April 2012,Still Holds Up After 15 Years,"Titanic (1997)

**** (out of 4)

James Cameron's Oscar-winning love story about star crossed lovers (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet) who come from different back grounds but fall in love aboard the Titanic. I remember seeing this on its opening weekend and it's amazing to see how well the film holds up after all these years. Yes, since it became so popular there are always going to be those who hold that against the film and while it's far from a masterpiece I do think it holds up quite nicely against many of the classic epics that have been made since D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION. That film, GONE WITH THE WIND, BEN HUR and other epics were all grand on scale, told big stories with big effects and each of them had flaws here and there.

The most amazing thing about TITANIC is the way Cameron is able to tell the fake story and mix it in with so many real-life people and events. Since 1997 I've watched countless documentaries on the real subject and watching the film on its re-release made me appreciate it so much more. The little details given about certain real-life people was a major plus and so were the smaller touches. The amount of love and detail that Cameron puts into every single shot of the movie makes it very poetic and at any time you can't help but just look around and try to take in everything in the frame. Very few films have gone all-in with their subject matters but this here goes for everything and just comes up short at a few times. It certainly helps that you have two strong leads turning in fine performance.

Winslet was clearly the best of the bunch as she brings so much life to her character and perfectly manages to fit every side of her. Be it the rich, spoiled girl, the confused one, the heroic side or the love story aspect. I was less than thrilled with DiCaprio when I first saw the movie but looking back on the movie he too really stands out and delivers. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart also deliver.

I think the biggest flaws in the film can be had in the screenplay. Many people objected to having the fake characters so close to the real ones during the finale but this here didn't bother me too much as when we see the real people it's in situations based on what we're led to believe happened. What bothered me in 1997 and today is that Cameron decided to make Zane the main villain over the iceberg. I really think the story starts of go overboard during the third act as Leo gets chained up and then we have more drama wrapped around the real event. There's no question that the romance made this movie such a hit but I think it could have worked with everyone had the stuff with Zane been toned down. God knows there was enough drama with the sinking to make up for Zane running around with a gun. With that said, that's about the only problem with TITANIC and those things aren't disastrous enough to ruin the movie. There's no question that the romance works, the special effects are terrific and on the whole this is just a movie that works on every level.",

15 January 2020,"To be fair, when Jack tried to get on the door, it tipped up.","A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).

James Cameron's Titanic is what I call 'factasy'. In other words, it's a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.

A master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there's a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director's skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema's most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.

It's only the film's closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don't throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn't reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?

9/10.",9
21 March 2023,A masterful tale of love and tragedy in one of the best Hollywood productions,"Titanic is one of the best films both by James Cameron and in history in general for obvious reasons. It is a story of romance and tragedy that knew how to portray well the tragedy that occurred in Atlantic. It has many things going for it: an excellent script, very good production, excellent costume design, great cast with good performances, a beautiful soundtrack by James Hornet and Celine Dion, good direction, good special effects and the list can go on and on. This movie is certainly a true masterpiece of the seventh art that every movie lover can enjoy. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.

2 September 2007,Maytime On The High Seas,"Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell. They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.

This blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime. In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold, Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.

The film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time. Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14, 1912. The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime.

Winning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic, itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel. He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet. Unfortunately she's about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother, Frances Fisher, who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse.

Her prospective fiancé is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum/bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film. Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes.

One thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads. In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable.

Leonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did. The part is a romantic lead, the guy has no secrets or hidden issues, he's just a young man in love. Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get. It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.

Titanic is a story that's been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself. The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was, did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned. There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship. And the British did the classic, A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship's officers point of view.

Still they'll have to go some beat this one. Titanic is a film for lovers of all ages and run Maytime back to back with Titanic if you can get DVDs and/or VHSs of both films.",10
20 June 2022,It won eleven Oscars for a reason,"Outstanding movie!!! It could've been longer with all the deleted scenes but 3 hours and 15 minutes was enough. The acting was good! Most of James Cameron's movies are good. This is one of them!!

18 November 2020,Titanic for the romance.,"So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.

First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.

Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.

The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.

So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.",10

13 February 2023,25th Anniversary Review,"There are two love stories in this film: the first Romeo and Juliet and the second James Cameron and the ship. Every millisecond is thought through, nothing is compromised and the attention to detail is extraordinary. The holes for each rivet in the hull of the 1/20th model were drilled by hand and actors who actually resembled the 1st Class passengers aboard ate and drank using teacups and cutlery stamped with the White Star Line emblem. The production is a seamless mix of miniatures, practical effects, CGI and actual footage from the wreck site and also genius in terms of saving money if you investigate further. There's nothing wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance but Kate Winslet shines and, combined with the backstory of the search for the necklace, Titanic as a whole is an entertaining and respectful blend of fact and fiction, very well paced and doesn't feel like a 3 hour film. I'm a Titanic buff, so biased - the final few minutes of the ship tearing in two with hundreds of people still clinging to the stern makes me wince every time - but James Cameron's version of the disaster genuinely ticks every box. It's not only the most accurate account of the sinking ever committed to screen, but is still and will probably remain one of the best films ever made.",9

We must persevere this movie forever, its really one if the greatest films ever made.

Titanic got everything you could ask for, amazing actors, beautiful music and filming and a thrilling manuscript with an iconic story which made the movie itself to a iconic film of our century.

I have watched it over 10 times and you wont ever get tired of it!

It has the power to make anyone fascinated about Titanic and its impact on history.

This is overwhelming! Titanic is a must-see film and if you havent seen it, you have to watch it at least twice in your life. Its a classic!",10

31 January 1999,The Greatest Motion Picture of all time..??,"So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It's more than just a love story. It's an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway.

Brilliant use of photography is what stands out the best. Imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldn't fit on this message. Replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the Titanic while sailing on crisp, clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace. During the night, one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine. How tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half, sinking miles beneath the surface, and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects! A job extremely well done! Who will match this kind of excellence in the near future?

As for the players, the pair of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are now remembered as the Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh of the next generation. Both are young, of course, and they really can ACT! Winslet should have taken home the Oscar (what blasphemy of those Academy Awards judges!). Her performance as ""Rose"" is a show stealer, as she did most of the incredible acting far better than today's young actresses. From smoking a cigarette, to possessing true beauty, to posing nude, to being a heroine, and to become a survivor, this will be a role so hard to beat in Winslet's future films. DiCaprio, on the other hand, also does magnificent as a ""street boy"" and a ""troublemaker"". The second half is the most important time to discover his best talents, including the end. Both are sensational in almost every respect.

Well, you can't always expect a movie to be perfect. TITANIC's shortcomings are relatively minor. The ""modernized"" scenes don't quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations. Mr. Jerry Garcia Lookalike should've changed his shirt, instead of wearing the one with ""Happy Face"" shot in the head. But Gloria Stuart as the old ""Ross"" makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the Titanic story through her past experiences. It's also important that we already know how the disaster had become, and that the movie tells under a fictional basis.

Of localized interest: Diana Morgan was once a TV news anchor for an NBC station out here. She has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter, notably in BABYLON 5. You will hardly get to notice her on that small TV set shown at the start of the film, but you can hear her voice.

Over three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery. To date, it may very well be the greatest film ever made.",9
5 March 2023,Phenomenal movie even if you don't like romance,"I wasn't really looking forward to this film, its a 3 hour romance movie and I am not a big fan of romance, but I gave this a chance and I have to say this is genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie manages to focus on a relationship between 2 different classes while also keeping it interesting with mystery, an intensity of what might happen, dread for the inevitable ending and also make many other characters interesting in there own right. The romance is done in a very realistic way and because of all the reasons I mentioned, the naturalistic acting of the actors and just how fun most of the characters are to watch on screen the movie really works. They also show the present and while I personally think that's the weakest part of the movie it does supply some interesting plot points and make the film more enjoyable overall as you're not constantly stuck in the past, the ending is also given a much more satisfying conclusion due to the present time scenes. Finally the 3rd act of the movie where the ship comes to its end is done in a brutal way showing just how much ruffles death it caused, how desperate the people where and how sad it was. The movie doesn't pull a punch and due to its long run time you almost feel like you know what it'd be like and almost like you yourself where there. Honestly I massively recommend giving this movie a change 10/10.",10
8 August 2023,One Of Cinema's Greatest Triumphs,"Winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, the highest-grossing motion picture of its time and a cultural phenomenon that possibly has no equals, Titanic is an extraordinary feat of blockbuster filmmaking that presents its gifted filmmaker at the apex of his craft as he offers a spectacle of such breathtaking cinematic ingenuity & profound emotional depth that it can still rival & demolish most tentpole releases of today on most fronts without breaking a sweat.

Written & directed by James Cameron, the story takes a simple premise of two star-crossed lovers from different social classes who fall in love on the maiden voyage of the ill-fated vessel. It is a safe narrative framework to apply amid the backdrop of a tragedy but it is carried out with such warmth, grace & sincerity that we are fully immersed & invested in the unfolding love story and are already on-board when the inevitable happens and turns the sweet, tender romance into a tense, thrilling ride.

Despite the story marking a radical departure for Cameron when compared to his earlier efforts, he steers the production ship with sophistication and directs each scene with unfailing authority to deliver the desired goods. James Horner's exquisite & evocative score is as essential to the viewing experience, for it elevates & enriches the journey by an enormous magnitude. And it doesn't end there, for the performances are just as brilliant, with Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet leading from the front with an infectious chemistry that just works.

Overall, Titanic is an immaculately crafted & flawlessly executed Hollywood epic that blends old-school melodrama with astounding visuals to deliver a grand, memorable & powerfully affecting experience. Establishing James Cameron as the one artist you never bet against, catapulting its leads into overnight stardom and still retaining every bit of its magic, appeal & emotional impact after all these years, Titanic is one of the greatest achievements of its medium and is a romantic saga for the ages that engulfed & enraptured a whole generation unlike anything before or since.",

20 December 2022,"25 years Later its still the only movie to win 11 oscars and be the number one watched, loved and remembered movie of all time","In the opening sequence of Titanic, a group of treasure hunters send a robotic probe far beneath the ocean's surface in search of treasures (and one particularly precious jewel) still tucked aboard the titular sunken ship. The camera attached to the probe reveals a vessel that's certainly rotted but still carries hints of its prior glory. The explorers coo and sigh as they see what's been waiting a century for them, as if they're looking at their dreams made manifest. This is the day they've fantasized about, and the treasures of people who once lived and loved aboard the RMS Titanic are their bounty. When the film was released, it was a gamble the size of ... well, the metaphors present themselves a bit too easily. It was a wild risk, both for filmmaker James Cameron (who was known for Aliens and his Terminator movies) and for the studios that funded it, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Cameron's terrible temper and a runaway production with troubles to spare - one disgruntled crew member laced the chowder at craft services with PCP one night, provoking hallucinations in 50 people, including cast member Bill Paxton - had prompted people to wonder if the legendarily expensive film was doomed for the same fate as its subject. The production budget reportedly ran over $200 million, an enormous sum by any contemporary standards that was much more so in 1997. Titanic remained No. 1 at the North American box office for 15 weeks in a row. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11 of them, including Best Picture. The movie continued playing in theaters for nearly an entire year, and didn't close until October 1, 1998, after earning $600 million in North America and twice that worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when Cameron's Avatar wrested away the title. Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius: If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a ""movie for girls,"" but then there's this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that's gold.",10
3 June 2020,No idea why the rating is like that,"This movie is very very good. The characters, the effects, the story. It's epic and very exciting. It gave us and interesting perspective about history events, and had an amazing music too. I liked how it sort of started as a romantic comedy, and than turned into more of an action movie. I wouldn't say this is the greatest movie of all times, but it is a Great movie.

29 June 2018,Romance and tragedy conveyed masterfully,"James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it. This poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance, that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings.",10

26 March 2007,The most over -rated movie ever made .,"Everything about this movie it's garbage . Inane ,dull or boring are too gentle words to describe how bad is this movie .

I don't care anything about all the hype that this movie receives ,or that it won the Academy Award of best movie (so what ? Many bad movies receive a lot of praise and prizes for the success that those movies have in the box office rather than in the real artistic value ) The acting it's bad and all the story it's a bad soap opera that uses history as a excuse to tell the story of all the days . Deep inside ,it's just a glorified chick -flick . I'm not amazed that it was chosen to be part of the list ""100 years ,100 stinkers "" . ""Titanic it's the most over rated garbage ever made .Zero stars .

7 June 2020,Titanic,"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!

Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!

8 July 2022,A masterpiece that gets better as I age,"Titanic is a film I wish I had seen in a theater because of its epic scope. Unfortunately, I was a young, dumb teenage boy in 1997, and the movie was premised to me by all the other young, dumb teenage boys as a chick flick. Worse, everyone knows the ending! Ah, to be young, stupid, and crass.

Now, at 40, having lived some of life and experienced love and loss, I can think of few films that do a better job of capturing the joy of the former, and the pain of the latter. The titanic itself is merely the stage of the story, and while James Cameron's portrayal of it is expertly done, it is the story here that really shines. Like much of Cameron's work, there is little that is truly original about the story- it is a pretty standard tale of lost love, with themes that echo to all such stories through history. However, what Cameron, Di Caprio, and most of all Winslet pull off here, is marvelous in its execution.

Watching this in 2022, I marveled at two things that feel most poignant now. First, this is a deeply feeling film, which clashes strongly with today's cynicism. Indeed, cynicism here is almost the main villain (alongside hubris and classism, of course). Rose is trapped in a world of cynicism, and Jack rescues her from it and helps her to reconnect with her true self. It's beautiful to watch, and the payoff is Rose's story afterward. Even Brock, who is only searching for the titanic in order to find the jewels and become rich, is turned away from cynicism by this story.

Second is the protrayal of what I will call 'enthusiastic consent'. In today's world of MeToo and No means No, a distressing number of movies portray acts of love from a predatory male perspective. These portrayals reinforce bad male behaviours, and make it especially difficult for young inexperienced men to act appropriately and recognize a woman's degree of interest in them. The relationship Rose and Jack share, by contrast, does an admirable job of displaying enthusiastic consent. Jack is patient, understanding, empathetic, and above all a very good listener. He makes the first moves of the relationship, but does so gently, without expectation (in stark contrast to Billy Zane's character). Rose then initiates all of the more physical/sexual interactions. There is never any confusion about intent, because their communication, both verbal and otherwise, is so good. It is incredibly sensual. Likewise, there is never any real conflict between Jack and Rose, and the one instance it is tried to (clumsily) be inserted with the accusation of theft, Rose dismisses it rapidly. A lesser film would include some sort of conflict to cause 'drama' between the leads, but Titanic does not. This is a model of what a healthy relationship should look like, and I find it refreshing in this day and age.",10

The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",10
30 August 2006,Lies & Annoying Romance Ruined Story,"No sense going into great detail about this film, which just about everyone who watches movies saw when it came out. I still don't recall a film getting as much ""hype"" as this one did. I doubt if the Second Coming would get the kind of publicity this movie received. It was disgusting - the PR, the story and the favorable box office response.

Oh, once the ocean-liner hits the icebergs and the disaster starts, it's terrific but that's not until the last 45 minutes of this 194-minute movie. Too bad we had to wade through all the baloney before this climactic scene.

The baloney, in a nutshell, was (1) a stupid teen romance between two arrogant, unlikeable people; (2) most the film being a lie, defaming many of the people who were heroes in that disaster, instead choosing to picture them as selfish villains.

The latter is all in the name of 'political correctness,' some filmmakers like James Cameron, are filled with, something akin to horse manure.

To make it brief: in real life, the men in the First Class did everything they could to get the women and children safely off the boat. Just look it up! Relatives of those people were justifiably extremely upset over Cameron's totally-fabricated story, and I can't blame them.

Anyway, even with all the untruths, if they had cut down on the Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet rebel-type attitude and romance, it would have been a far better film, but then again you wouldn't have the billions of dollars in revenue from the 12-15-year-old girls who flocked by the millions to see this farce. The rest of us would have preferred to see the true story of the famous disaster.",5

28 January 2019,Absolutely beautiful movie. A Cameron masterpiece.,"This story follows Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio). A poor artist who wins his ticket onboard the Titanic in a card game who meets Rose (Kate Winslet). A beautiful young woman who is raised in an uppercrust society who sees her life as too predictable and in control by her pompous buffoon fiamce Cal (Billy Zane) and craves a life of somewhat uncertainty. When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage. Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites. And ignites a fascination for the tragic story that is the Titanic. So sad and outrageous how mostly third class passengers died in this disaster.

12 July 2022,Best movie ever,"I was 13 when this movie came out, remembering how impressed I was back then and still love it this day. I rewatch it every other year or so, and still get the chills, the movie stays the same but every time I watch it, I notice something different. One big thing I notice is how incredibly well it's been done (especially for back in the day) the work that went into it making it so realistic. Great chemistry between Leo & Kate, especially Kate caried this roll so well. It hits me right in my feels, and I love it when a movie does that. Now that I'm 37 and seen a lot between 1997 and now, I can definitely say Titanic is my number 1 movie of all time.

11 April 2010,Still stands out as the GREATEST film ever made.,"Thirteen years after Titanic launched and all it takes is the first few bars of that haunting music to transport me back to my first time watching the movie in the theater. It was beyond comprehension - the entire spectacle and production. I bought the books, read the history books and found myself immersed in all things Titanic.

I didn't hurt that my great, great aunt was on the ship and survived. It makes it a little personal for me. In fact, I happen to own one of the only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboat and did not go into the water.

Love the movie - it still is #1 in my book.

10 March 2001,Something amiss...,"I understand why every Dick and Jane on the planet liked this, but why did the critics give it such good reviews? I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There's no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he's starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando's status, so stop it now, Leo!). Billy Zane is awful, too, but it is mostly that his part is so insubstantial.

So do you believe in payolas? It's beginning to make me curious that such obviously bad films as Titanic, American Pie, and The Matrix all got rave reviews from critics. All three of the films were abominations. And you may ask, what does it matter if a critic reviews it well? I don't care about their opinion! Not true, my friend. Even if your insecurities tell you that critics are unimportant, you always secretly feel victory when the consensus is for a film you really like. Therefore, there are no guilty feelings after you have enjoyed something like Titanic so much. Instead, you feel for a fading second that, yes, you are part of high culture. You understand art. BLAH! It's all just sinister psychology working its claws over simple minds.

And for those of you who absolutely despise this film, I can guess your favorite pictures: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Fight Club, and, of course, The Matrix. Well, you people should actually begin to learn what REAL film is. Rent A Night to Remember, the best film about the Titanic's sinking. It is not the greatest film ever made, but it is great.",4
11 July 2023,Cameron masterfully balances moments of levity and tenderness,"Titanic"" is a visual spectacle that showcases James Cameron's mastery of filmmaking. The attention to detail in recreating the ship is truly remarkable, immersing viewers in the lavishness of the first-class accommodations and the stark contrast with the cramped conditions of the lower decks. The cinematography captures the grand scale of the vessel, from the awe-inspiring shots of the ship sailing across the vast ocean to the tense and heart-wrenching moments as it meets its tragic fate.

The performances in ""Titanic"" are exceptional, with Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio delivering powerful and heartfelt portrayals of their characters. Winslet brings depth and complexity to Rose, portraying her as a young woman torn between societal expectations and her desire for true love and freedom. DiCaprio's Jack exudes charm, warmth, and an infectious joie de vivre that perfectly complements Rose's character. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable and adds an extra layer of authenticity to their on-screen romance.

The film takes viewers on a rollercoaster of feelings, from the exhilaration of young love and the joyous moments of freedom aboard the ship to the heart-wrenching tragedy that unfolds during its fateful encounter with an iceberg. Cameron masterfully balances moments of levity and tenderness with scenes of intense drama and despair, making the emotional impact all the more profound.

In addition to its compelling narrative and stunning visuals, ""Titanic"" also boasts a memorable and haunting musical score composed by James Horner. The iconic theme song, ""My Heart Will Go On"" performed by Celine Dion, became synonymous with the film and further elevated its impact on popular culture.

If there's one criticism to be made about ""Titanic,"" it's that the film's runtime of over three hours may be a bit daunting for some viewers. However, the story is so engrossing, and the pacing so well-crafted, that it rarely feels like a burden.

In conclusion, ""Titanic"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to resonate with audiences worldwide. It combines a poignant love story with breathtaking visuals and a profound exploration of human resilience and the fragility of life. James Cameron's direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a captivating soundtrack, cements the film's place in the annals of cinema history. Whether you're a fan of romance, drama, or historical films, ""Titanic"" is a must-watch that will leave an indelible mark on your cinematic journey.",10
12 July 2023,Dramatic and Heartbreaking...,"Titanic, is a movie about love, the dramatic Titanic sink, difference between the rich and the poor and how people are only thinking about themselves. The movie is perfect in any way, including the acting, action, plot, camera-filming and much, much more. This is the first time I am watching Titanic, and I am impressed that this movie was better than I expected.

In this movie, the rich and the poor people, for different reasons, are traveling from England to New York with Titanic. This is also based on true story, by the way. They are showing the romance of a rich girl and a poor boy, that they are loving each other, but it is difficult when the two stages of richdom are combining each other. When the catastrophe begins, you can see how the rich people only cared about themselves, not the others.

The characters where played very well, including Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) it was a fantastic duo in this movie, and the rest of the characters where also played well and they made a great expression. James Cameron is making most of his movies great, very long movies usually, but he is still using the time well and not wasting it like some directors like to do. I think that it make sense that this movie have got so many Oscars and I recommend this movie for everyone.",10
6 January 2010,Timeless,"It's bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb's Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about ""Titanic."" The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film's most famous scenes came along, ""Titanic's"" reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film's popularity has sunk to where the real ship is.

I had fond memories of the film from when it was popular, so I decided to perform an experiment: even after the immense backlash the film suffered, could it still hold up? The answer is a resounding YES!

""Titanic"" opens when a treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for. Soon after releasing his findings, an elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) claims that it's her in the picture. So Lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamondAs a young woman, she was sailing to America to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage. Planning on ending it all, she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage. Thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began with.

The reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted. Leonardo DiCaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world (something he apparently hated), and it's not hard to see why. DiCaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work: he's good-looking and talented (Winslet was honored with an Oscar nomination for her performance, although it's hard to understand why DiCaprio was left out, because he equals her). Jack Dawson is an immensely likable guy. He falls hard for Rose, someone who he knows is clearly out of his league. But he's so immensely likable that we want him to win Rose's heart. His new lover, Rose, is no ordinary society girl, much as she tries. She can't stand the rigidly controlled life she's going to lead, and Jack is her escape. But while she may wear a corset, she's no damsel in distress. She's independent and tough. The romance works because Jack and Rose are meant for each other.

Their supporting cast is excellent. The two most important supporting characters are Rose's fiancée, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Cal Hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face. He comes from a wealthy family, and will do anything to get what he wants. He demands obedience from Rose, something she will not give (to anyone, much less Cal). Her mother, Ruth, is just as snobbish and cruel, but she's also desperate. Their family was left virtually penniless, and she's trying to save face. As cruel and despicable as they are, neither one becomes a caricature. Zane and Fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting. Bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash ""new money"" Molly Brown.

""Titanic"" was the most expensive film of the 20th century, and it's clear that every penny was put to good use. ""Epic"" doesn't begin to describe this movie. It's huge in spectacle, and the sinking of the ship, which takes up the last half hour, is jaw-dropping. But that's not the only place where the effects were used. We never get a sense that we're looking at sets or CGI; from every frame of the ship, we believe that we are on the ship with the characters. Interesting note: Cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there. But that doesn't stop there. Cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship (and in a way that's plausible.

James Cameron has long been considered a god of action movies, but this is the first time his skills were honored. Not only is Cameron a wizard with special effects, he is also a master storyteller. ""Titanic"" is a long film (as all epics are), but not one of the 3+ hours of footage is wasted. The film moves, and there is never a dull spot. He knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story, and uses this to his advantage. But the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance, one of the most difficult genres to dabble in, work with immense effectiveness. The romance burns up the screen, so much that we're more concerned with Jack and Rose's fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship. And the scene where Jack draws Rose's picture is potently erotic (especially for a PG-13 movie, which shows not real nudity or sex, but it is strongly implied).

I realize that I am not writing this to people who haven't seen the movie (are there such people?). I am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film. I assure you: it's as good as it was the first time you saw it.",10

The rest of the movie was Meh, didn't care for the love interest between the two leads, but it gave the movie some momentum.

Its well done and worth watching, it's entertaining and overall a great movie. If you've never watched it because you feel like you know what happened and don't need like 2 hours of love-story to tell you the story, I get it. So if you're in that category, watch it and fast-forward to the part where the ship sinks, you won't be sorry or bored by the love story situation.

29 March 2003,my heart will go on...,"One of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 Oscars in Hollywood in 1998, a huge success (well deserved) all over the world. The revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown. This is James Cameron' masterpiece. He chose to relate the tragedy of the Titanic that took place on the 12th of April 1912, through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman (Kate Winslet) and a modest painter (Léonardo Dicaprio). Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie. The love between ""Jack"" and ""Rose"" is so strong that can hardly believe the Titanic will bump into an iceberg and will sink. It's also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ship's sinking (although historically accurate).

Léonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet will stay among the famous mythical couples in the cinema's history. It's obvious that they are between the hands of a conscientious and carefully organized film-maker. James Cameron doesn't leave anything high and dry. He adopted a sustained rhythm not spoiled by the enormous means that he's got. It's useless to say that he masters them perfectly thanks to an important budget. Not only has this budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the ship but it has also enabled a reconstruction from the traditional life in 1912 with its contrasts, its oppositions. Moreover, the movie enjoys an outstanding performance from all the actors, even the minor ones and several sequences and dialogs don't lack humor.

But ""Titanic"" is also a limited place where takes place the confrontation of two different worlds: the proletarians and the middle-class persons. This confrontation is particularly well described during the ship's sinking: the rich are by the lifeboats whereas the poor are still inside the ship and they're forbidden to go outside.

The second part of the movie is remarkably well filmed and follows a logical advance based on the increase of fear and distress. Cameron emphasizes particularly on the madness that spread to the passengers but also on the officers. Little by little, these last ones are becoming mad (one of them will kill unwittingly one of the passengers who was trying to get into a lifeboat). Besides, a few touches make the movie surrealist (the four musicians keep on playing while the ship's sinking)

The other obvious qualities: a gorgeous music, some smart costumes. At the end, a movie that creates a deep emotion and where everything contributes to a perfect success.",10

11 February 2023,Incredible epic,"Titanic is an epic in every sense of the word, delivering everything from sweeping romance to horrifying spectacle, heartwarming moments of levity and heartbreaking drama. It's a James Cameron film through and through, especially with its fascination with water and it's all consuming nature.

Kate Winslet gives an incredible lead performance, likeable, confident and full of warmth along with an instant chemistry with Leonardo DiCaprio who's instantly loveable with boundless energy. Billy Zane is so good, playing his utterly despicable character perfectly and Bill Paxton is one of the better self insert characters from a writer/director.

James Cameron's direction is amazing, the film is meticulously crafted and the water based set pieces that dominate the third act are endlessly impressive and feel so real. The CG may be showing its age but it's still really impressive and blends with the practical elements rather well.

The music by James Horner and the song by Celine Dion are both excellent, they works so well with the melodramatic romance due to the heavenly, emotional and awe inspiring nature that is instantly recognisable and deservedly iconic.",9

26 March 2002,Still works for me...,"Well, it's been a year since my last review of this film (this is review #3). I saw ""Titanic"" on the big screen in 1997, and bought the DVD when it came out (which I still watch from time to time, maybe about twice/year).

""Titanic"" still works for me as an epic spectacle and blockbuster. The love story is OK, I don't really care... this is the movie to watch for eye candy and epic scope, not emotion. I never did get caught up in any sobby or sentimental emotions with this film. The overall story isn't bad... yes, some of the lines are cheesy and the dialog is corny, so what? The low point of the film has to be DiCaprio sinking beneath the waves... not sad at all to me, but so what?

""Titanic"" stands as a fabulous spectacle and a great movie watching experience. The years have not diminished that in the least, and the special effects couldn't be done any better today than they were in 1997. The nit-pickers are still picking, 'sentimentalists' are still getting outraged at the 'realists' bashing the film, and I'm still sitting back and enjoying a couple times a year a film that was highly overrated at the Oscars (so what else is new) but where every penny of the budget shows on the screen... the spectacle of it... the scope, it can sweep you away. Turn your brain off, turn the lights down, and enjoy on the biggest possible screen.

22 August 2007,"An Epic Masterpiece. A heart-breaking, sweeping story of love and passion.","Titanic (1997)

11 Academy Awards - Including Picture, Director and Score

The Number 1 Grossing Film Of All Time - $1,845,000,000.

Titanic is a glorious achievement; this isn't a film. It's much more than a film; it's an experience. You yourself feel you are on that ship; your emotions, your mood corresponds that of the characters.

James Cameron's direction is a technical triumph. The man did not only manage to put to use a $202,000,000 budget, capture never before built sets, but on top of all that he had to show us characters, feelings, stories, lives and the ultimate fate of a doomed liner. Cameron passes the test that really takes every cinematic element to the maximum.

Forget all that now. When you walk into a cinema and sit down for 3 hours which only seem like 90 minutes, you will know why Titanic is the film it is. A masterpiece in every respect. Maybe not the greatest film ever made, but a nearly perfect cinematic achievement, in terms of storyline, focus and technical superiority.

21 September 2007,Your heart will go on. We get it. Stop cluttering my screen!,"This movie is *pitiful.* It is *abominable*. In terms of dung heaps, it is second only to ""Superman Returns."" That's not a very honorable position.

Why do I hate ""Titanic,"" you may be wondering? Here's a list. 1) Leonardo di Caprio's performance as the lovable but down-on-his-luck guy could have been played better and more realistically by Paris Hilton. 2) Kate Winslet's fake American accent is the least of the woes left by her whiny, I'm-a-poor-widdle-rich-girl turn. 3) James Cameron should automatically be disqualified as the director of any real historical tragedy, because he makes us care more about the prettiness of the ship than the victims. 4) Where James Horner's music fails to nauseate (he was really off his game here), you always have the classic fallback: Celine Dion's mess of a theme song.

Those are the top four reasons-- I could write a 52-page essay on why this movie is so horrid, but IMDb doesn't provide reviewers with that kind of space, so I'll condense it a wee bit.

If you want to watch a disaster, this film is perfect... and I'm referring to the debacle of the film, not the Titanic incident.",1

8 September 2017,"With better characters, the romance might actually merit the running time","Well, it's not ""Avatar"" levels of disappointment, but ""Titanic"" is far from Cameron's best work. Don't get me wrong, there's a great disaster epic here, but you've gotta work for it. The actual iceberg doesn't appear until 100 minutes in. A hundred. That's a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build. And the less said about that song, the better.

This isn't a bad movie, and it's technically proficient when the effects take center stage. When it's actually about White Star Line's monumental hubris, and the destruction raining down (or washing in) the spectacle lives up to the director's name.

But the rest of it . . .

16 February 2012,"""Life's a gift""","It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.

Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.

Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.

The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it's moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.

This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be.",10
8 December 2021,7.8?????,"IMDB needs to take executive action with this rating. 7.8 is criminal. This is the definition of a masterpiece. James Horner steals the show again with the only score more haunting than Braveheart's.

9 May 2008,Dear God,"This movie right here is ""Overrating"" in its prime.

""The most compelling movie of the century"". That's a joke.

My question is: Why? Why Cameron? Why did you do it??? You're WAY better than this! But, since Cameron created some cinematic masterpieces like ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"", I'm willing to let this one slide. You got lucky this time, Cameron.

This movie was nothing but one misplaced drama scene after another. And it wasn't like you could sit through them easily either, this movie was more than 3 hours long! I understand that a lot of people liked this movie, and that maybe I'm being biased, but I really did not like this ""garbage"".

Don't get me wrong, there were some very good scenes, and some music score that was decent. But the tear jerker moments grew tiresome quickly. Why are Billy Zane and Bill Paxton wasting their time here? Good scenes and some interesting plot points could not save this mess of a bad drama. I'm sorry, but this Hollywood trash reeks and stains the true story of the Titanic, almost to the point of disgracing it.

If you like too much drama and romance badly put together with bad acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, ""Titanic"" is what you want.

6 July 2012,Watching This........I Got a Sinking Feeling,"Technically this can hardly be faulted. As a spectacle...its very good. For a three hours plus movie it moves along ..OK. There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is ""out of his depth"" here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project ""got to them"".The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern. The hype surrounding this movie before release was incredible (garaunteeing a successful picture) If your happy with technology and amazing special effects...this is your movie. But don't look too close....there are cracks here....

""Titanic"" has a solid place in movie history, with movie fans everywhere in the world, and a couple of bored and angry people are not going to change that. I love the movie and I always will.

7 July 2019,Shakespearean tragedy through and through!,"The increasing slight sense of foreboding, the humour at the climax that doesn't lighten up the tragedy but instead somehow makes it even more unsettling and ominous, the charming and extremely amiable star-crossed protagonists, to name a few. James Cameron's Titanic is one of the best indirect adaptations of Shakespeare's masterwork, Romeo and Juliet. Even when it comes to the issues I have with this film, most of them are pretty much similar to those I have with the play. And I've always found these issues justifiable to some extent. Also, the visuals are uniquely spectacular, and Céline Dion's My Heart Will Go On is timeless!

29 January 2020,Very good,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",8
14 February 2023,25th anniversary in theatre,"I was loathe to go to see this in the theater in 2023 however my friend wanted to experience it on the big screen so I obliged . I don't recall loving it when it came out, I was younger and everything was cringe back then. It is still cringe haha but in the best possibly way ! The acting and the pacing ... the unfolding of this story was so well done . It felt like a very short movie Also, having learned some of the facts about how the movie was made overhears and the attention to detail was moving. There was almost a coldness or a sterility to the experience which felt very much the setting on a brand new ship. The characters felt authentic and while of course Jack and Rose were a bit rudimentary ( for lack of a better term ) they were children of the time and their love felt wholesome and innocent against the backdrop of impending doom. The ship , the beautiful detail and it's stunning demise was truly epic ! I saw it in 3D and it didn't feel forced , it was beautiful to watch . Finally ,what I wasn't expecting was to wake up today with such vivid recollections and appreciate for how well this movie was done over time .

18 April 2016,"Your usual James Cameron movie - all style, no substance","A typical James Cameron movie, i.e. all style, no substance, and excruciatingly long.

Plot is basic - love story set against the Titanic tragedy, that's it. Just basically drifts for 3.25 hours around that central plot. The direction is all about the amazing special effects, another Cameron trademark.

On the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in the lead roles, and their interaction is spot-on. This movie pretty much launched their careers (well, in DiCaprio's case, shifted it up several notches).

1 October 2018,One of the greatest of all time,"I'm rewatching this now. It has held up very well after all these years. I saw this in the theaters when I was 22. It was just me and my boyfriend who I recently just started seeing. We are no longer together, but I still remember him saying that the way the two were holding each others hands at the bow of the boat, reminded him of the way we touched each other's hands at the time. We were in love, just as Rose and Jack were. This movie also touched home because I too came from money and thought most of the rich people I knew and had dated were uptight and didn't seem to let loose enough and have fun....and I was afraid too I would fall in a trap to it and live a boring existence. It gave me more strength to branch out and not search for someone to love just because of their wealth and status in the world, but instead find love for whats inside a person. My world is better now because of that decision. So I thank you Titanic!

26 October 2014,A Hyped Misadventure,"The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is – was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received.",3
15 July 2019,What an achievement!,"James Cameron's Titanic was something else. It's amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997. Titanic is a film that many will remember that broke ground. Not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in general.

Titanic is very, very well made. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for James Cameron. He wanted to make this movie special and he has. The amount of research that Cameron had to do to make the film look realistic is evident.

The entire set is a whole world in itself. Cameron's direction transports us to ins and outs of the ship which all look so beautiful. The atmosphere and grandness of the ship sticks with you especially during the inevitable sinking scene where you can feel the terror and panic aboard. The cinematography is pure brilliance. The ship has a very elegant feel and the set design and costumes from the inside also adds to that feeling. Visually, this is one the best looking films of all time.

The acting was sublime all through the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are in top form and have some of the best chemistry in a film ever. Their romance seemed so believable that I never felt bored during it. The supporting cast are also great, especially Billy Zane.

I have to give immense praise to James Cameron for handling this film. He took a lot of time researching and working to make this movie the grand spectacle it is and feel as accurate as possible to the real incident. Whilst some think this film is overrated, you cannot deny the sheer effort that went into crafting this movie.",9
27 July 2022,A legendary film for all time,"James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is undoubtedly an epoch-making movie created by a master director. The picture is one of three that took 11 Academy Awards at once, including the best film, direction, cinematography, sound and visual effects. This is an excellent indicator of how high-quality the film came out from all sides of consideration.

For decades after the release of the film, the film has acquired the most interesting facts about the filming and about the most legendary sunken liner. This is the creation of a mock-up of a ship in 75 percent of the size of the real ship, a mirror image of the liner on the motion picture at the time of the ship's departure due to the fact that the layout was made only on one side of the Titanic, and the real ship was moored by the other side, a huge picture budget of 200 million US dollars, which turned out to be more than the construction of the liner itself at the prices of 1997 and much more. However, the picture is remembered not at all by these statistical data, which can not be found even today. ""Titanic"" takes an unprecedented love story of two young people, a story that was so carefully and accurately placed in real events on a huge ship that launched in April 1912 on its first and, unfortunately, its last journey.

James Cameron approached this project already being a masterful director and screenwriter. He created his project so as to please, it seems, everyone. Many genres are closely intertwined in the film. ""Titanic"" is a drama, a thriller, a disaster movie. Attention was paid to every detail. After all, we know how seriously Cameron approaches his work and demands the same serious approach from his subordinates. Probably, creating the ""Titanic"", otherwise it would be impossible to do. Then the world would not have seen this masterpiece, which can be admired even decades later.

In addition to the global production, the gorgeous visual component and the magnificent soundtrack from James Horner, it is necessary to mention the well-chosen actors. Each of the characters allows you to reveal the acting talent of the artists. Actors also endow their characters with an unprecedented energy, which you definitely get into. You believe the actors, you believe in the fate of their heroes, in their decisions, which will necessarily lead to certain consequences.

Of course, the acting works of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet stand apart here. Their pair on the screen looks great. The chemistry between the actors is felt, thereby allowing the characters to become truly close to each other, even in the short few days that they have known each other. Maybe this kind of love is from the category of fiction, but it is a work of fiction. Let it be so - love at first sight, which teaches viewers to be selfless for the sake of their loved ones and loved ones.

Leo and his Jack Dawson shine on the screen. DiCaprio allows you to enjoy the variety of his acting skills in three hours of the film. His character evolves from an ordinary flighty 19-year-old to a person who knows how to make responsible decisions, who is ready to save the life of a loved one and knows how to do it.

Kate in the role of Rose gives an opportunity to see the difficult fate of a young person already engaged at the age of 17, who does not yet understand what kind of life she can enter by marrying an essentially unloved person. For Rose, getting to know Jack becomes a kind of push to rethink everything, to understand that she does not need the rich life she is used to, she wants something else. Sometimes it is very important to see yourself from the outside in time, especially if this allows you not to pass the point of no return, which will determine your future fate.

Other characters performed by Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stewart, Bernard Hill, Evan Stewart and others are also good. I would like to mention literally everyone, because the actors gave unforgettable images of the characters, regardless of their screen time and influence on the plot. A decent game allows you to really believe in everything that happens on the ship.

The story of the drama and the relationship between the main characters may seem naive to someone. Feelings that suddenly flared up, a short period of time for their development. All this may well resemble a kind of falling in love, rather than real feelings. Especially if we talk about young people who have not yet gained life experience and are quite capable and even ready to make mistakes. Well, let it be. It's a movie. It is important to understand something else. This is a general picture and a story that is placed in a certain situation. What if the shipwreck hadn't happened? How would two lovers live on? Would they have coped with the test of their feelings with time? There are many other questions. It is quite possible that nothing would have come of this pair. However, it is important that their age, worldview, more naive thoughts due to just the same age led to the fact that the story became legendary for the audience. A kind of analogue of Romeo and Juliet. After all, it was thanks to their actions that each of them learned true love, the desire to save each other. The catastrophe that happened on the ship forced us to make fateful decisions, to take responsibility. That's what's important.

As a result, the audience got a great story that will forever remain in the hearts of people. The majestic liner ""Titanic"", the way to the New World, unprecedented love, a heartbreaking catastrophe and an endless sense of bitterness, which, it seems, could not escape from those who survived this shipwreck and were able to stay alive. After all, one way or another, they remained with themselves and in front of thousands of faces of those who could not get out of that terrible story alive.

""Titanic"" is a legendary project by James Cameron, which makes people of different generations look at this story as something that warms the soul. After all, even in the face of a deadly catastrophe, people can fall in love with each other, become worthy saviors and remain in memory throughout the lives of those they saved.

24 June 2023,Stood the test of time.,"RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. Titanic was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.

The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a Turkish bath and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger ""marconigrams"" and for the ship's operational use. Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as ""unsinkable"".",10
16 July 2023,American Women Love the Bad Boy,"It's funny people think this is such a great story - when the spoiled rich girl 'falling for the bad kid' - mad because she's being 'forced to marry the good guy' - is the longest running cliche in Hollywood. LOL TV to movies.

It just takes place on the Titanic.

With that said, as far as quality film making goes, this one checks off all the boxes.

I will say, since the advent of hidefinition, you can REALLY see the CGI in this, now. It wasn't as obvious when first released.

Seriously, 9 out of 10 'stories for chicks' is this exact same story.

Really think about it.

From Casablanca to Aladdin - they all have the 'bad boys are more attractive' as the theme.

It's no wonder American women are so screwed up.

Even the men, for that matter.

Who wants to be the guy who doesn't get the girl? Lol When your sons choose to be outlaws instead of doctors - don't ask yourself why.

Even with something as masterfully done as Titanic - I refuse to give this tired cliche higher than a 7.",7

16 May 2008,An incredibly beautiful movie that holds up on every watch,"There are many who say Titanic is ""overrated"", ""over-hyped"" or some might inexplicably go as far to say ""boring"" and ""pointless"". The hardly arguable biggest blockbuster of the 90s, grossing near 2 billion at the box office and winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, has attained some hate from people over the years, people who love to hate this movie for everything they so wrongly think it is not and never will be. It has, however, attained a very positive social status among a lot of people whom their hearts were captured by this masterpiece. Those people can see just how magnificent of a movie this really is, and how underrated a classic it appears to be in today's film society; a dazzling and striking accomplishment in itself and never overlooked, but unfairly maligned by many.

The movie, aside from being set on the Titanic and called Titanic, actually has a love story that renders up most of the movie time, as most would already know. This love story, is positively brilliant in every sense of the word. I am always amazed and captivated to watch it play out on screen, because Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who were furiously snubbed out of Best Actor/Actress awards, have wonderful chemistry, giving me chills in lots of scenes, and they both separately give incredulous performances that enthrall and charm every step of the way as well. These two characters' strong likability, along with James Cameron's directing and the entirely fascinating special effects make this movie something much more than mere entertainment. The movie is excellently executed in the best manner it could be, the Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart present day story being very interesting as well, and a lot of the film's aspects are quite simply riveting and awe-inspiring whether it's the love story, the intensity in all the performances or the infamous, brilliantly portrayed sinking and sets that give true heart to the story of the Titanic and shows it's revelation quite undeniably like any other film on the subject.

While ""My Heart Will Go On"", receiving the Academy Award for Best Original Song, has attained some criticism from people as well, it makes the perfect score and theme song for every scene it is used in regarding the movie, especially the climax, which has had millions in tears, had me in tears, and always has me in tears when I watch it, even if it is not the saddest movie of all time, because it isn't. It's a film about love, a film about disaster, a film about memories, and it is beautifully shown how all of those three attributes tie into peoples' lives, but I am not melancholy, I am merely pleased with how stunning of a film it is, and how remarkably well it has held up over the years, not being overthrown by any blockbusters in recent years in likes of quality, in my honest opinion. James Cameron, even if not one of my favorite directors, is very talented and it shows with this movie. I do not understand a lot of the reasons why so many hate this, or do not find it as remarkable of a film as fans like me do, but I ensure you, this movie will always have a place in my heart, and will go down as a classic, already has even and will contine to whether haters like it or not, because of how many people were touched by it and are still touched by it. Underrated, powerful, breath-taking movie that, since holding up in quality on every watch, I intend to love for many more years to come.",10
27 August 2002,James Cameron has lost it big time,"A tragic story. And not in the sense that it made me cry. This film is pathetic. The love story is tedious, the depiction of Irish peasantry panders to the crassest stereotypes and Celine Dion's stinky theme song is just the icing an a horrible anti-cake. Somewhere along the line, around about Terminator 2 and True Lies, director James Cameron went badly astray. He became so obsessed with setting new Special Effects standards that he lost sight of characters, dramatic plausibility and any measure of emotional honesty, which are all far more essential to a film's credibility. The characters in this film are bland and uninspiring. To call them one-dimensional would be an insult to Geometry.

It's ironic that a film which cost so much to make in terms of special effects should go for the cheapest possible emotional return - Billy Zane is his usual camp, pantomime-villain self, Leonardo DiCaprio is as wet as the sea he eventually (thankfully) drowns in and even the usually reliable David Warner is flat and listless. This film gets three out of ten. And all those points are for the last hour when the ship sinks - the only good part of the film. The rest of it should be consigned to the bottom of the Atlantic and left there to rot.",3

8 February 2022,Pop culture perfection,"Titanic is pop culture perfection. It's everything wide audiences crave and has elite craft. Even the writing (its weakest aspect) is fair. The love story is generic, but it's efficient and accents the dramatic disaster. In some ways, that romance is just right because the setting is already complex. More nuance could've overly complicated the film. Sometimes, simplicity is not only desired by audiences, but also required by circumstances. Meanwhile, the acting is quality. Leo is fine, Winslet is great, and the supporting cast is strong. All together, this provides the ideal amount of emotional investment to synergize with Titanic's grand spectacle.

Despite Titanic's sentimentality, its filmmaking is its core. Each ingredient supports a sense of grandeur that elevates the experience. The steady camerawork is constantly sweeping, emphasizing the ship's scale and heightening the action. The elaborate sound symbolically amplifies the daunting ocean and immense tragedy. The editing begins gracefully and smoothly builds energy during the chaos. The music is iconic, elegant, and fitting. The production is incredibly elaborate and detailed. The effects are dedicated, real, and versatile. Lastly, the passionate direction wholly commits to authenticity, emotion, and excitement, making Titanic a truly captivating experience. Ultimately, Titanic has it all.

25 November 2002,"Good, but overrated.","I saw the movie for the first time when it arrived on video, needless to say that I had very high expectations for this movie because I heard a lot about it. I watched the movie and I remembered my first reaction when I finished watching it, my reaction was: ""This is it?"" Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, not at all. But I was disappointed about it all and it just didn't met my expectations.

Everybody knows the true story about the ship the ""Titanic"" and there are many movies/series made about it already. New about this movie is the love story. It's always dangerous to put a love story in a movie because if the love story doesn't work the movie doesn't work. The love story does work for most parts in this movie, except for some scene's in which I just don't buy it.

Although the movie is very long it doesn't really ever get boring, which is of course a good thing. The best part of the movie is the sinking and you can see that James Cameron is really one of the best Action directors in the business.

The acting isn't great but not bad either. The special effects look good with the exception of a few needless scene's. The movie is also full of visual mistakes (for instance you can clearly see the camera in a scene, which is a HUGE mistake that I noticed on my first viewing) and the characters in my opinion aren't really interesting enough.

Although the movie got more credit then it really deserved I can still recommend this movie to everybody. Good but not perfect...

7 December 2019,Incredible Movie Making,"An absolutely spellbinding film that still holds up over 20 years later. I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since. Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",10
27 May 2006,The King Of The World meets The Bitch Of The Sea.,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",7
7 May 2022,Undeniably Brilliant and Iconic,"Is it one of my favorite movies? No. Is it one of the greatest movies Hollywood ever made? Yes. Titanic is objectively one of the greatest movies of all time, and it's undeniable.

What works against it are the incredibly long runtime of over 3 hours, which can dredge along on rewatches at the beginning, and the fact that it's a Romance movie, which will likely turn off many male viewers who prefer action, thrillers, and some dramas. So while it's among the best movies of all time, it does have drawbacks for certain audiences.

Titanic excels best in the third and final act, the last hour or so, when they strike the iceberg and just before that as the romance heats up more. There it evolves into an action-packed, heart racing thriller with lots of moving parts. Beyond the unforgettable and realistic spectacle of the sinking ship (which amazingly makes you feel like you are right there), there is still plenty of story left to be told, and no matter how strong you think you are, this movie will pull at even the most stoic person's heartstrings, quite a tearjerker for most people.

It's a true epic. Director Cameron's ambition (the most expensive movie ever made at the time over 200 million in 1997) and commitment to consistency and quality being quite the ""movie"" experience, Kate Winslet's unforgettable lead performance as Rose (how did she not win the Oscar?; she should have), and the emotional components set in front of the background of one of the most infamous disasters of the 20th century, all factor into making Titanic one of the most groundbreaking and iconic love story movies of all-time.

9/10.",9
9 May 1999,The most undeserving of praise in the history of film,"What I think I'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, ""Phantom Menace"", is that it will likely blow ""Titanic"" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare ""Titanic"" is the greatest film they've ever seen, I think to myself, ""You don't see a lot of movies, do you?"" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than ""Titanic"", and for the same price tag.

""Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,"" as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.

I'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It's true, ""Phantom Menace"" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.

James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is. a) a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b) a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c) a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something left better to documentarians, which I would've enjoyed much more. e) a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f) a robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, ""I wish I could trade places with you."" g) a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h) thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.

The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting or length.",1
28 January 1999,The worst film to ever win a best picture Oscar,"Checking out the other comments, one caught my eye... somebody had the gall to make a comparison between this film and Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, ""The Seven Samurai"". To compare this film with ""The Seven Samurai"" is utterly rediculous and an insult to great films. With that said, I'll continue...

Let me start off with the absolute horrid screenplay that is filled with cliches. While watching this film, you can pretty much tell what is going to happen next... it's the ""Rich girl forced to marry a rich guy, but she finds a poor boy that she eventually falls in love with"" story you've seen hundereds of times before.... add a big boat, a historical disaster, and bingo, you have yourself a movie. The dialogue is almost laughably bad (""Oh Jack.... Jack!""). And the characters are almost as cliche-ridden as the story they're in. As you watch the film, you feel almost as if you're forced to like the characters.

A disaster as huge as the sinking of the Titanic doesn't deserve a film like this. It is an insult to the hundreds that died in that distaster to be represented in a stereotypical film such as this. And it's winning of the best picture oscar is absolute proof that the Oscars are nothing more than a huge popularity contest anymore. To even place this in the same category with films like ""On the Waterfront"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""The African Queen"", ""Rebecca"", ""The Godfather"", etc. is such a shame, and just shows you what direction the film industry is headed.

About the only good thing I could say about this film is that it is an enormous technical achievement. The recreation of the ship itself is amazing, but that alone cannot carry a film with a recycled, cliche-ridden plot such as this.",3
22 January 2022,A classic movie everyone should watched.,"This is a classic movie I watched as a child with my family. The whole family gathered around the TV and watched. My whole family loves it. People discuss many details in the movie after watching.

The content is about the classic shipwreck and the love between Jack and Rose. These are also my two favorite movie actors.

14 May 2023,After Thoughts,"I've seen this movie a lot while growing up and used to hate it, upon watching it with my wife it was alright. I still am not fully attached to the couple dynamic personally and I think that is what is needed to fully love this movie. Even though I will say that Kate Winslet was above and beyond in this movie! I will say Titanic and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind has gave me so much appreciation for her acting skills. I only knew her from the Titanic when I was a kid and didn't know how much of an amazing actress she was. But I was really impressed with her in this role. Also I don't know if it was just the Bluray disc I watched or maybe it's just always been this way, but there were some CGI that did not hold up at all. And by the end of the movie I hated that song, they played it waaaayyyy too much!

15 July 2023,A romantic movie based on a tragic event,"Titanic

In 1912, The Titanic was transporting 2,240 passengers to the United States. Four days later the ship hit an iceberg, only 706 people survived. Years later, in 1997, Cameron wrote, directed, and co-produced a movie based on these true events. It stars Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, and Victor Garber.

This movie tells a story about two fictional characters, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). They are from too different social classes, Jack doesn't have a lot of money, where Rose's family is rich, along with her mom wanting her to marry into a wealthy family.

The combination of practical affects, CGI, and set designs, made everything including the ship sinking look real. The water scenes were filmed in water tanks and made to look like the Atlantic Ocean, this is an impressive accomplishment of the crew.

Winslet does a good job portraying someone who is carefree, yet doesn't like her life with her fiancé she's supposed to marry. DiCaprio plays a charming guy who teaches Rose that she can just be herself. Together, they make a convincing couple. Its obvious Jack loves Rose, due to the decisions he makes towards the end. Billy Zane gives a strong performance, as he makes the audience dislike him, because of how he mistreats Rose. Titanic is a romantic yet sad movie, based on a tragic true story.",7

21 December 2004,Glug...glug...glug...thunk.,"Just outside Kursk on a sunny July morning in 1943 Obersturmführer Muller of the 3rd Panzer Division has a problem. His fancy new Panther tank, in a Meisterstück of environmentally sound engineering, has come with a two live zebra painfully welded to the rear and, as we know, Germans don't do back wheel drive. Vorsprung Durk Technic.

A similar, and no less surreal, problem plagues James Cameron's technical tour de force. It is impressive, groundbreaking and sophisticated but, let's face it, it's going nowhere with a plot like that bolted incongruously to its chassis.

Renowned to be one of the most expensive films of all time; it seems preposterous that a few quid couldn't have been siphoned from the ""huge-ship-sinks-dramatically"" budget into the ""story"" budget. But there you go.

The actors try their best. Plaudits go Leonardo DiCaprio for successfully rehashing Hollywood's cheesy Iorish stereotypes. Billy Zane is excellent as the ""creepy, violent one"". And, of course, our Kate furthers the plot significantly by putting her famous waps on display (they are very impressive).

In fact the plot is so bad, and the dialogue so awful, you can sense the huge directorial sigh of relief when the ship starts to sink. Listen carefully and you can almost hear Cameron mutter over tortured screech of ice on metal, ""Ah! This is the kinda film I understand."" Once the ship goes belly-up things do, indeed, liven up dramatically. Things slide around, people scream, chandeliers crash, vast imponderable drops open beneath peoples' legs and the huge, hulking edifice that is James Cameron's Titanic sinks gracefully and inexorably into the dark waters.

At least an hour and forty minutes before all this, Winslet provides one of the more amusing, unintentional ironies of the film, when she declares to the ship's designer ""Mr Freud has some interesting theories about men forever striving to make things bigger"". Biggest ship, biggest movie, biggest budget. Hmmm, save it for Oprah.

So impressive, expensive, huge and groundbreaking. Nevertheless, Titanic remains a towering cathedral to mediocrity - and the only film for which the best viewing experience is achieved by arriving two-and-a-half hours late and leaving ten minutes before the end. 4/10.",4
21 January 2002,Hate hate hate hate hate hate HATE,"James Cameron is one of my favorite filmmakers,but I loathe TITANIC. Of course,how can I argue with all the teenyboppers who turned it into a hit? This movie is worthless,albeit beautiful. It's just so incredibly precalculated and manipulative and annoying.

18 December 1998,Barf.,"Anyone who has even a glimmer of an idea of language, thought, or customs of turn-of-the-century US/Britain would be repelled by this film. I've read a number of survivor accounts, and people just didn't THINK or TALK the way they thought and spoke in the film. Anachronisms aside, it was, I suppose, only a love story. But there are so many better ones that have been filmed. Titanic was to me a real disappointment.

25 February 2018,A Titanic Bore,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",5
18 June 2013,Beautiful Romance - Tragedy Unbound.,"It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.

You jump - I jump.

Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.

Never let go.

So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10",9

28 March 2002,A Film So Bad It's Obscene,"TITANIC is actually two films. The first film is a very unlikely love story so syrupy it can cause diabetes. Then it suddenly mutates into a James Bond film where - wait for this - Bond is played by Kate Winslet. Maybe this isn't entirely accurate because James is total fantasy , but never becomes as unbelievable as this. Oh and at least in a Bond film the Brits are the good guys unlike here where they are invaribly cruel , stupid and/or cowardly. Also at no point in a Bond film does a script change the laws of physics where it's possible for someone to escape from the undercurrants of a ship weighing thousands of tons. Oh and the special effects are better in Bond films , TITANIC's are not entirely convincing.

But the most fantastic thing about TITANIC isn't the fact it made so much money at the box office ( This is explained by 14 year old girls lining up at the cinema to watch Leonardo for the 25th time ) but the fact this film won 11 ( Yes Eleven.You read that right ) Oscars, equalling the total held by BEN HUR. What the hell were the Academy thinking ? I know they didn't give any awards for the quality of the acting or even nominated the screenplay for an Oscar ( They got that right . Boy did they get that right ) but for it to win 11 Oscars including Best Picture ( Didn't any of the voters watch LA CONFIDENTIAL ? ) really upset me because films like GONE WITH THE WIND , etc didn't get that many",4
30 May 2023,All for sets and costuming,"The attention to detail on the sets and scale models is Oscar worthy. The same can be said about consuming.

The writing is abysmal. James Cameron makes his points with a sledgehammer. Every word of dialogue is exposition.

The fictional romance between Jack and Rose is nausea inducing. He goes overboard trying to establish Jack as a cool, brave, daredevil bad boy. He's actually a loser with nothing to give a woman. Rose is portrayed as a very proper young lady with an enviable pedigree yet one that should be resented because of privilege. One would think a teenager wrote this screepllay. Even Molly Brown comes across as stale.

Again, try to ignore this and focus of the sets and costuming.

21 May 2023,Best movie of all times,"I am writing this for those who have not seen it. Please give it a try, for this is the best movie ever made. The acting, the music, the decor, it is splendid.

The first half of the movie is more about the romance and I had to get used to that the first time I saw it. The second half is very much about the sinking and if you are into spectacle, you are in for a treat.

Regretably, Kate Winslet did not win the Oscar that year, but for me she is the absolute superstar of the movie. And ofcourse her career skyrocketed after this movie. She remains my favorite actress untill this day.

So go see it!

6 November 2007,Titanic - overlong and overrated,"I may not make myself popular with this statement but I hate Titanic. One reason is that it is far too long for a Hollywood movie. It spends most of its time waffling on and on and on. I went to see it in the cinema when it released it 97, it didn't impress me then it doesn't impress me now. I have liked James Cameron's previous work like Terminator and True lies but he has really disappointed this time around.

Now onto the good points. The last scene was so moving and the song My heart will go on is one of my favourites. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were very good in their roles. I feel that it should have been made like a documentary rather than a standard 90's disaster movie. On the other hand there are millions of titanic fans and I have been known to have unusual tastes in movies. Go and see it and decide for yourself

20 September 2019,Sweeping epic!,"James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic is timeless, moving, and a real visual splendor (though they could brush up on one or two CGI scenes). The attention to detail is stunning and breathtaking. It is perfectly written and perfectly cast - particularly with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They both are extremely talented, top-notch actors. You don't even notice how long it goes for. It grabs you and sucks you in. But it is also sad and a bit depressing knowing what will happen at the end. I haven't cried at a movie in a long time, so was surprised to find myself crying at this movie. I can relate in some respects to Rose and I really like the message about enjoying life. A strongly recommended movie.

30 August 2008,The Top of the Pyramid,"The movie is a total perfection. When it appeared back in 1997 and i watched for the first time it leaved an influence on me what no other movie had. Maybe The Lord Of The Rings ,maybe not :), that movie is another greatness of the film-making.

Coming back too Titanic with the record $1,835,300,000 Worldwide Box Office that is still no.1 after 11 years is amazingly great.

I cannot understand the users of IMDb because this movie is not in the top 250 movies . That is shame ,this movie it is at least in the top 5 greatest movies ever not too mention in the top 250. A movie at least 8-9 out of 10 ,IMDB USERS!!! Wake Up and see the movie again because you seen something else. I cannot find another top with movies somewhere else where Titanic is not included.

The movies prior theme beside the ship's history is the greatest human feeling: love what is universal and timeless. The picture presents us the meaning of true love. Our main characters Jack the poor artist and Rose the rich girl from the first class made us all cry even if we willing too recognize or not.

Inn all lines the movie makes us think if we can go further after loosing the the most precious person in our life. We'll we can go on because life must goo on but it will remain in our hearts forever.

With no doubt this is the best movie directed by James Cameron, among his other great achievements. James Horner's soundtrack is simply beautiful and completely matches with the movie ,there is no surprise that his soundtrack album has been sold with 30 million copy's

The movie is the greatest achievement in cinema ,it is the top of the pyramid...",10

2 July 2002,"No ""Night To Remember""","Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!

I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he's tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).

Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white ""A Night To Remember"" movie instead.

Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't see the spraying blood. This is life and death...better leave it to luck!

2 May 2012,Marvellous Movie - Excellent 3D Conversion,"I just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie, Titanic by James Cameron, in all its brilliance.

It's just like those 15 years have never happened. It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life: size.

After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.

Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.

This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.

We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.

To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice: NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will. But when it'll come back to the theatre's in a couple of years, I'll be right back to watch it there.",10

19 May 2001,Pablum for the brain dead masses.,"Really, why all the commotion over this movie? This schmaltzy soap opera bubble gum puke is way overlong, with every character some cartoon cliche'. With dialouge so frickin' corny that just made me want to throw a brick through my TV screen. Even at the end, that rotten, stupid cow could have let Leo share the plank she was on, but no, she decides to let him die! What the hell is up with that! When are people going to realize that all the special effects in the world aren't going to compensate for jejune scripts such as this one. It too bad that Cameron didn't line a few bird cages with his script to this manipulative, sugar coated bore-feast, if he would have, it would have put to good use.

5 March 2005,Best Picture?????????,"Are there lesser films in execution and entertainment? Of course. But I felt a ""One"" vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won ""Best Editing"". Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like ""Ghost"" winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The ""romance"" is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this ""eternal romance""..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a ""cow"" in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an ""eternal love"". Rather it gives us a bit of lust. While it is believable Winslet doesn't want to be permanently with Zane, why she has to be with Leo is not shown...I t is encouraging that this is not in the IMDb Top 250...Perhaps the worst film to ever win Best Picture.",1
23 May 2000,"Oi, Cameron. No.","The problem director and writer James Cameron faces with a story about the Titanic is that the majority of his audience will know what happens. So to make his audience care, he switches the action and main plot from the ship, to a socially inappropriate love story between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. The trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story, he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous Titanic films like A Night to Remember have had. Cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together. The first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters, while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner. This would be forgivable if it weren't for several key factors from the first half, the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with. From Caledon Hockleys loveless millionaire to Rose's trapped innocence to Jack Dawson's poor boy with a dream. Aswell played as these characters are, the performance can't make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given. Again, with the spectacle of the story of the titanic and the millions of dollars at Cameron's disposal, one could forgive the weakness of the characters, but then the first half of the story is so entirely cliché ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious. It is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love. It is almost as though Cameron knows how to tell this story visually, he's just not sure or not capable of making you care about it. Cameron's writing has always come under scrutiny. The comic book quality of films like True Lies and the Terminator films set the scene for his writing style. The childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldn't but does stand out. ""Something Picasso"" and Freud, is he a passenger?"" are so dire that they belong in a Farrelly Brothers film, not a $200 million blockbuster. Cameron does seem to be writing from the heart, the trouble is that his heart doesn't seem up to the task. ""It's pay-day boys"" and Dicaprio's now legendary ""I'm the king of the world"" seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film, but by Cameron himself. He is the master film-maker who can resurrect the Titanic and will make a fortune from it.

Questions that arise on investigation of the film closely are the gaping plot hole of Rose's narration and status as the main narrative agent. If the story we see is told from Rose's perspective, how are we granted access to scenes such as the Captain's death and Hockley and Lovejoy hatching the plan to trap Jack? Again, if the story we are being told is not from Rose's perspective and is a general overview of the events, why are we subjected to Rose's story telling voice over? Perhaps this is being overly critical of what is simply meant to be viewed as popcorn entertainment and indeed, the film isn't entirely without its merits. The hour long sinking of the ship is indeed breathtaking and the film does have probably three genuinely special moments. Winslet and Dicaprio's flying scene, the ship breaking in two and Jack's death which is surprisingly touching and moving. The trouble is, especially in a three hour long film, that these few moments don't make up for the other half of the film. In a three hour film, half is ninety minutes, the average length of a Hollywood film, perhaps Cameron should have sacrificed some of the unnecessary moments and concentrated the story into perhaps just over two hours.

Cameron's back catalogue of films should prepare us for what we are going to see. The Abyss, True Lies and Terminator 2 : Judgement Day show that as a visionary, he can amaze his audience simply by clicking his fingers. The problem lies with his misplaced attempts to try and bring humanity into his stories. In The Abyss, Cameron wants us to care about the relationship between Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris. In True Lies, we are asked to care about Schwarzenegger's flagging relationship with his wife Jamie Lee Curtis. Similarly in Titanic, we are asked to ignore the special effects and care about the characters relationship. If Cameron were to write a out and out blockbuster that did not need characters require the audience to care, he would probably create one of the most amazing films ever to be seen. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be what he wants to do.",
8 May 2023,Titanic Review,"Reviewed on May 8, 2011.

That's not all the movies I've watched today. After rewinding the Grease VHS and ejecting it out my VCR, I put in Titanic, and that was such a long movie. My parents also got this at Blockbuster back in 1998 as well. This is still an emotional movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's performances as Jack and Rose are outstanding, James Cameron's direction is great, the soundtrack is amazing (especially ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion), the special effects are well done, and the famous ""I'm the king of the world!"" line is so unforgettable.

Titanic is such a masterpiece. This was my favorite 1997 movie, but recently I watched Princess Mononoke and now that is my favorite 1997 movie.

The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it. None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy. Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery. When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!"" James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it. The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking. Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",1
11 June 2016,Titanic: the parody,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",3
10 February 2023,"Infinity rating, Movie that stands till the cinema live","Is there something wrong with the humans giving less than 8 or else humans can't feel the emotion of true love.

James Cameron is remarkable, visually presented his dawn dream and everyones fantasy in 3hrs. Showed every emotion just like straight from the story we heard.

It makes me to dive into the characters and feel the pain of their loses every time I watch it. Not only the agony they went but also the happiness they experienced.

James Horner never failed to make sure that we feel in the path of characters do. Never amazed he got the Oscar for what he gave to us.

Not expecting anything greater love story than this for the next sixty years.

3 October 2012,Titanic,"To admit this is the first time I have watched TITANIC from A to Z might hinder my credibility as a serious film critic (as least a self-acclaimed title), I have had several sketchy viewings during all these years but never conquered it entirely, then all of sudden it occurred to me a few days ago this is the biggest loophole in my filmography which I should mend ASAP, so after the lengthy 3 hour saga, now I could feel calmer in facing the numerous household names still stuck in my to-be-watched list and meanwhile other potential newcomers have never stopped emerging.

To be honest with oneself, no one could deny TITANIC is a monumental masterpiece, the visual stunts are so compelling and marvel me in its verisimilitude of reconstructing such a monolith setting (what's more indomitable is the fact that it has survived a 15 year interval which should have been a light-year in the evolution of digital technology, and will still stand out not only among its peers). Also the film is a well-crafted emotional vehicle of a catastrophe depicting in an impeccable way to render immaculate empathy towards its audience as if we were literally heading towards our own doomsday (I did redden my eyes when the valedictory score was accompanying the final farewell).

The love story of Jack and Rose, although being a bit predictable and the black or white of the character development is somewhat perfunctory given the ample running time it has, could universally strike a chord in any corner of the world, DiCaprio and Winslet have generated unparalleled chemistry on screen (especially for Kate, since she has a more narrative arc to accomplish). Billy Zane, whose past 15 years has testified that he could never outshine this tailor-made character. Gloria Stuart and Katy Bates are both in my top 10 list of the supporting category, and since I'm re-watching DOWNTON ABBEY these days, whose correlation with TITANIC has suggested that all the first-class passengers don't need to change any outfit to be grafted into the red-hot show, maybe Katy Bates could reprise her role as the survival of the calamity, Julian Fellowes might give it a shot.

To be the all-time highest grossing film in North America, and the runner-up if put under the international parameter (after Cameron's own brooding AVATOR 2009, 9/10), TITANIC has every reason to be loved by the majority of the mass, and it may not be among the top- tier darling among orthodox film critics, but will remain as a tenacious one in my list. Another afterthought is that I hope AVATOR will look as fabulous as TITANIC now when 2024 eventually arrives.",9
22 December 2016,Appalling- even Leo could not save it.,"While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the ""heartthrob"" title attributed to him. Conversely and inexplicably it boosted Kate's career beyond any explanation.

25 June 2014,Not As Good As I Was Hoping,"Titanic was not as good as I was hoping it to be.... I was disappointed in the film. I want to like this film because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the film because I like him - he's a great actor! But I could not get past the fictional romance the movie was focused on. I was hoping for more of a documentary type of a film but, alas, it was not so.

The casting and acting was quite good! The set was realistic as well. There are good moments in the movie so I can't knock it completely.

IDK, maybe I will have to be alone and in a romantic mood to enjoy this movie more than I actually did the first couple times I viewed it. Or, maybe, I really did want a modern documentary type of movie on The Titanic.

I hate to dislike this film but I do. It's a movie I should at least like better than I do but I do not. I have to rate the film low due to the fictional romance the film was focused on.

21 December 2003,"Yes, I think this is a GREAT film","""Titanic""....this movie on the surface would normally strike fear into the hearts of film fans like myself, who usually despise most typical mainstream drivel. While I am a huge film fan, I rarely go to the movies in theaters anymore because everything just looks so BAD. The last film I have seen in theaters was actually ""Spider-Man,"" a great film marred by the horrible cartoonish special effects.

My tastes in film vary greatly...I love the classics (Cagney, Bogie, etc), romance, B-flicks, Godzilla films, car chases, superhero stuff and much more. However, almost all the films I like were made before the 90's, when film started to get REALLY bad. I also love to observe a good phenomenon - whoch ""Titanic"" became almost instantly.

I read all about ""Titanic"" before it was released, how the budget went up to a staggering $200 million making the film a tremendous gamble. When it was released in late '97, it did very good but not great numbers - but the word of mouth on this film was unlike anything seen since Star Wars probably - the box office take remained steady for a LONG time. As weeks went by, it actually earned more and more, and the phenomenon had started.

Then in late 1998, when the film was still playing some theaters almost a year later, and for a whole year we've heard how unbelievable ""Titanic"" was and how Leo was adored by girls all over the world and how hot Kate was - I finally kicked in 2 bucks at a discount theater to see what all the fuss was finally about. Alone (in a packed theater) as not to be distracted by a friend, I got my snick snacks, found my seat, and watched with a completely open mind.

Three hours later, I, who again hates virtually everything mainstream these days, said to myself, that was one of the greatest films I had ever seen.

Many say ""Titanic"" is ""fomulatic,"" ""typical Hollywood drivel,"" and the famous, ""...but we know the ending, the ship sinks."" I say, ""Titanic"" was an extremely rare present-day excursion in old-school grandiose film-making. Huge sets were built as opposed to having everything drawn with computer effects. It was a great romantic story, which the audience was compelled to feel for, especially having the knowledge ahead of time that it would be doomed (""the ship sinks""). It had great drama, great music (even the one song I can stand hearing Celine Dion sing), and a lot of heart from James Cameron who, love him or hate him, showed amazing dedication to getting his epic on screen.

And say whatever you want about Leonardo DiCaprio - he was excellent in Titanic and is one of the very best actors out there right now.

Anyone who has read some of my other reviews would know that I hate computer effects. But the CGI in ""Titanic"" is the one instance where they actually do work a little, because they do not overtake the picture and aren't the focus. It definitely is not the same as watching a cartoon Spider-Man battle a cartoon Green Goblin in a film that is not supposed to be a cartoon.

""Titanic,"" dare I say, is the ""Gone With The Wind"" of our time. it's a huge movie, a blood, sweat and tears movie, a movie with some real elbow grease behind it. And never boring for a second.

""Titanic"" is arguably the best film of the 90's (only ""Goodfellas"" gives it a run for that title in my opinion), and is probably one of the greatest 40 films ever made. Now that may be a surprising thing for me to say given I am such a huge fan of the classics, but however rare it may be, there are extremely rare instances when something new is in the same league as something classic.

One last note - it is surprising that this film has such a bare-bones DVD out. While there are rumors that a ""special edition"" DVD is in the works, the present DVD is a disappointment with no extras at all. Considering this movie at three hours long had two hours CUT from it alone would make some good extras in deleted scenes. Add on the commentaries, a few ""makings of"" and add on a bunch of other crap and you have got a killer, proper DVD release for ""Titanic.""",10
5 June 2020,perfect,"The old couple fearless of death, the band that did not interfere with the outside world, the man who was a fake father for a living, the woman who whistled for her lover. All for a kind of spiritual attachment.

6 March 2023,A Masterclass of Filming,"When I first watched 'Titanic' I was just a 13-year-old boy and beacme fascinted with the whole 'universe' James Cameron created. It´s 2023 and I could finally rewatch this movie, now in the big screen with the 25th anniversary release, and there are no better words to define this experince than: mind-blowing. In a world with James Cameron, it's still worth it go to the cinema.

The acting and the plot, which are greatly influenced by the 'melodrama techinique'; the photography, that made us travel beyond classes, seas and intimate moments; the unforgetable soundtrack; the stage elements... and what could I say about the Titanic replica created for the movie? Everything in this movie feels so right, loved, connected and well-made.

Titanic is a love letter to art, a good anomaly in the highest-grossing film list and a timeless work. Definitely a story that made me cry, vibrate for the protagonists and that marked my heart.",10
28 March 2017,Phenomenal Film. Just Wonderful,"One of my biggest childhood memories was seeing Titanic in the theatre. I was only 7 years old when it was first released and I had no idea what a hell of a ride I was in for. My father always had a keen interest in the Titanic and its sinking, and I remember a large Atlas like book he had of the Titanic full of pictures of the wreckage, the dive teams efforts, salvage operations, etc.

It was just after Christmas 1997. We went to my grandparents for a weeks holiday. During our visit, the adults decided we were all going to go and see Titanic. So we arrive at the cinema, walk in through the front entrance and there's a line-up like you can't even imagine. a huge line-up, of people, all hoping to get in and see Titanic. we stood in line for a few minutes until an usher came and yelled out ""ALL THOSE WANTING TO SEE TITANIC, TICKETS ARE SOLD OUT FOR TODAY!"", and I think that was my first inkling of ""wow this movie really is a big deal"", So dad went to the ticket booth and got us tickets for two days later, in a 3pm session that had enough tickets left for all five of us.

Fast forward two days, we go in and get our seats for the 3pm session, the cinema is jam packed, i'm talking not one seat free. three incredible hours later, we walk out of the theatre, walk back through the shopping centre and get in our 4WD to drive back to nan and pops. The second I got in the car, I was just totally mesmerized the entire way home, thinking about this movie and constantly repeating wow, wow wow, inside my head. As a seven year old kid, Seeing this, all I can say this movie had me gobsmacked.

Anyway, onto the movie...

A 101 year old woman Rose sees a drawing of a young nude teenager on TV that was recovered from the wreckage, she quickly realizes the nude girl in the drawing is in fact her. She gets into contact with Brock Lovett (played effortlessly by Bill Paxton), who conducts frequent dive and salvage operations of the Titanic's wreckage. He is searching for a lost treasure known as the Heart of the Ocean which is an extremely rare and insanely valuable diamond. After a very disappointing failed salvage attempt, Rose and Brock come into contact and Rose is flown out to their salvage boat, Where rose ends up telling a group (including her granddaughter, Lizzy) her entire story on the Titanic from start to finish.

Her story begins with Her arriving in Southampton with her mother, fiancé, Cal (played wonderfully by Billy Zane), and Mr Lovejoy (David Warner), who kind of acts like family security. We are introduced to a young and very beautiful Kate Winslet. The Titanic is still docked and the docks are crowded with avid passengers and enthusiastic spectators, all itching to see the Titanic set off on its maiden voyage. We are introduced to the handsome and mischievous Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his friend Fabrizzio in a tense poker game. They're lucky enough to win tickets on board and merely make it on board.

The next portion of the film has various characters talking about the Titanic's construction, kind of as a way to feed the audience some background knowledge I guess. We're introduced to the ship's owner, builder and a whole array of other first and third class citizens. After Rose explains how depressed she was starting to feel after being caught up in the madness of being a first class citizen, and being forced to marry someone she denies her love for, we see Rose upset and about to jump off the ship committing suicide. Here, we have a lovely and eerily quiet introduction between Rose and Jack. For assisting Rose, Her fiancé cal, invites him to dinner in first class the following evening. We see the clear distinction between Third and first class. Jack has no idea how to behave like a first class citizen, and portrays that very nicely on screen to the point where it's actually quite humorous. Later on in the film, after a few more dramas, we see what I can only describe as the most Iconic and memorable on scree kiss, of any movie in history. Now we come to the part of the film we came to see. The sinking. The remainder of the film is pure epic. We see the ship slowly sinking, more water rushing through the various floors and decks, the passengers becoming progressively more panicked, The captain trapping himself in the wheel house, people turning on each other, distressed children and parents, people jumping off the ship into the freezing ocean trying to survive and it's incredible how much you do actually feel like you're there on the ship. All of it was done in studios but it literally does look like its sinking into a real ocean. And the scene where the ship splits in two, was the icing on the cake for me. After the ship has sunk, the survivors floating in the ocean become slowly more and more quiet, until there's complete silence. I still to this day find it a very eerie and disturbing part of the film. All in all, Titanic is quite simply put, just a ground breaking piece of cinema. The film makers got the Era spot on in terms of clothing and how characters look and behave, and as I understand got the look of the Titanic's interior spot on for the time period too. It really does feel like you're back in 1912, and it's always a movie I can come back to every few years and enjoy it as if it was my first time seeing it as a 7 year old. Phenomenal film. 10 out of 10. Fox.",
20 March 2002,"thank god they all die, mostly","The featured review of this film carries the line ""the scene shifts to Southampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912"" A minor point perhaps, to our american friends but Southampton is in England. Still, i only partly put that glaring error down to the unfortunate american who wrote it. After seeing Titanic i would have got the impression Southampton is in Ireland too. The ship was built in Belfast which was British then and is British now, so to make up for that and appease the Irish American audience they fill the ship with poor unfortunates from the emerald isle whose only role in the film seems to be getting screwed by the English ""tyrants"" who run the ship. Add a few poor but heroic Americans to the mix and you've got a blockbuster. To be fair, i hate this type of film anyway so it was never going to get a good review from me. 2 / 10

29 August 1999,"Inane Script, Unconvincing Characters","Hmm, I wonder what happened at the end? I must have watched 6/8 of this film before washing the dishes seemed a more appealing chore. Many actors can perform convincingly in period films, but this cast did not convince me at all that they were anything but 1990s actors with 1990s dialog trying to look like people from the 1910s. The script was inane, leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest. In the very-near future, when high-tech special effects no longer dazzle audiences, this moneymaking venture will be re-evaluated. I'll give it a 2/10 in order to be fair to the special effects staff, who clearly labored the hardest on this film and deserve some credit.

4 July 2008,"Spectacular, but with lots of flaws","After seeing this movie years ago at the cinema I thought it was one of the worst movies of all time (as far as major studio pictures go). Thinking about it before posting up a review here, maybe I was a bit too harsh.

In short, this story is a fictional tale of two star-crossed lovers on board a real life, famous ship (the ""Titanic"") that sank, killing a great percentage of its passengers and crew (um, sorry if that is a spoiler, but sheesh, you SHOULD know that!).

When I am feeling particularly unkind about this film, some of my criticisms are: only director James Cameron could look at the story of the Titanic and think ""Hmmm. That story could make a good movie...IF ONLY IT HAD MORE DRAMA!"". Yeah, sinking ship, hundreds dead, needs MORE drama!

Another peeve about this movie is how Cameron can't resist manipulating our sympathies to characters by resorting to melodrama and crudely drawn characters who we find easy to hate, in order to have us rooting for other characters. E.g. Billy Zane's character of Hockley. Didn't quite throw a chihuahua into the ice-cold ocean, but nasty enough to do everything short of this. Really, a more sophisticated script could have made him a figure deserving of our sympathy too.

A minor peeve is how one of those star crossed lovers, Kate Winslet's Rose, is quite prescient and insightful about the ship's situation...just didn't seem very plausible for one so young and unschooled in such matters.

Despite thinking this movie one of the all time stinkers (for a major studio release) I did, at the time, think it a master-stroke to have the two star-crossed lovers at the centre of this tale (Kate Winslet's ""Rose"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Jack""). It is just a brilliant device in order to hook you and reel you into this great historical drama/tragedy. Again, it was a great pity that Cameron chose not to make a victim of people like Hockley as well, instead of demonising him. And it's not as if Cameron didn't have alternatives in his own script. For instance, Jack's sketching of Rose could have provided a more believable foundation on which to base a relationship on instead of the hysterical melodrama Cameron resorts to to get them together.

Perhaps the time-frame of the sinking made melodrama necessary.Truly spectacular but deserved Razzies for things like script and direction.

Despite my criticisms, when Titanic eventually hits the ice-berg, the movie is an absolute thrill ride and quite exhilarating.

P.S. must put in a word for the great Australian song by Flash and the Pan ""Down among the dead men"". It's not in this movie (Celine Dion does the theme song), but the Flash and the Pan song is actually about the Titanic and is a brilliant pop song...beautiful too. Look it up on You Tube.",4
19 March 2021,Why so low rate?,"Not a single thing on thia movie is bad. I repeat not a single thing. I think it's even pointless to give a review about it because every human being loves it. This is even famous and loved to those countries, those people who isn't familiar with English Movies!

20 July 2018,"Great cinematography, even greater hype","This Hollywood tour de force is too mainstream for its own good. Great visuals, expensive sets, great hype, but ultimately shallow, it perhaps does not deserve all the hate if often gets, but by all means it did not deserve the hype with which it was initially met. So, in reality, a mixed bag. Hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces. This moneymaker is neither of the extremes, but it is certainly too soulless manipulative and shallow to be considered a master piece, but when stripped off its dumbest pandering it has some decent side to it, mainly of the technical nature.

13 September 1999,Take the disaster home,"Perhaps the most overblown and ridiculous flick I have sat through. Also, did Picasso's ""Les demoiselles D'avignon"" really go down on the Titanic? I thought it was hanging in the museum of modern art in New York? Am I the only person who thought this was odd? Then again, the movie was so unbalanced and ill thought out that this doesn't seem out of place.

19 February 2002,An apotheosis of cheese,"I am not as much offended by this movie because of its historical inaccuracy. It is true that for all the hype about how the china, carpeting and furniture reproduced exactly those of the Titanic, and how the ship sunk exactly in the way described by the movie, and so on, the plot is entirely fictitious and proud of it. In itself that is not bad, what's bad is how cheesy and cliché this plot is, and that this cheesy, cliché and invented story occupies 90% of the movie's attention, with the sinking of the ship treated as something on the side. The only important people are the main couple, Jack and Rose, her fiancé and her mother. The remaining characters are treated with a disinterest that borders on disrespect. We only get to know that the third-class passengers are fun-loving and warm, and those in first-class are stuffy, snobbish and exceedingly preoccupied with dinner cutlery. Wow, isn't that new! The whole thing is so fake, it was really difficult to get minimally interested.

This movie is the triumph of Hollywood's latest formula, followed also by `Armageddon' and `Pearl Harbor': some action for the boys, romance for the girls, everybody happy (though from the comments I've read here from boyfriends dragged kicking and screaming to see it, maybe I'm wrong about everybody being happy). In the case of Titanic it worked: Leo's fans went to see the movie over and over again, sending its box-office gains into the stratosphere. Truth to tell, it is too much to ask of a megazillion-budget movie like this to be anything but cliché: it just had to be meretriciously agreeable for the largest possible number of people, so anything adventurous, minimally controversial or profound was out of the question.

But, as I said, so many people liked it, so, what do I know? However, if you are interested in seeing something really related to the Titanic, watch the British movie `A Night to Remember.' The special effects are not so cool, and it is in black and white, but it is far more accurate and infinitely more dignified.",
25 March 2002,Just plain wrong in so many ways,"I am one of the few people, I think, that has not seen all of Titanic. I saw most of it, and couldn't sit through the rest.

You see, I have a great interest in the *real* Titanic. And I truly believe that this three-hour 'epic' is the greatest insult to the tragedy ever to be put on film. It has nothing to do with the ship, or what really happened. The story would have been more realistic set in some city! As it is the ship is just pushed into the background of a love story that could never, and I repeat never, have happened in true life. Rose would never even have met Jack, and most likely she would not have wanted to! Steerage passengers on the Titanic, and all other ocean liners of the time, were strictly prohibited from association with the other classes, and first class held themselves so aloof that they did not even look on second class, let alone steerage, as human beings let alone material for lovers. Rose would have been raised with these attitudes; they would have been engraved in her no matter how 'free-spirited' she was! And what are the chances that a noblewoman, who has likely never done a lick of work in her life, could ever swing an axe without chopping off someone's hand? Nil.

This movie is nothing but Hollywood capitalising on a tragedy that cost hundreds of lives. The only really fitting tribute to the doomed liner is Titanic the musical, which has done it's research and is a triumphant tribute to the ship and the world she sailed in, in which the characters become secondary and the doomed liner takes on a life of it's own.",1
29 May 2012,Movie which touched the core of my heart !!!!!!!,"The movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real titanic, which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional. Bill Paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women & then later on it's been telecast on TV. The movie goes into flashback & here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship titanic. The bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of Belfast, which also includes the male leading start Leonardo winning the ticket of titanic on the lucky hand of poker. The movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship & according to the facts everything in the movie is been re-designed from the furniture to the decks, lamps, the door way, life boats, & along with the engine room.

The real movie beings after Rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship & Jack take her mind off the track & saves her. As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too.

The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie.

There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him "" what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it "" ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray.

True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern.

On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.

The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.

My rating – 10/10 !!!!!!!",10
13 April 2017,Filmmaking on the Grandest Scale,"James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired.

I highly recommend Titanic and encourage you to watch it on the largest screen possible, films like this do not come along often. The 3d Blu ray is also exceptional and shows what can be done when a 2d film is converted in the right hands into 3d.",10

18 January 1999,Awful,"A glorified sit-com, or soap opera. This is one big hustle; I'm told it's the best movie ever...I must be from Mars. It's an insult to 1500 who died in 1912, an insult to women, and a patronizing film in 1998.

6 August 1999,Cardboard story and cardboard acting,"Actually reading a lot of the previous reviews (lots of them) has restored my faith in humanity.

I half expected to read 'best film ever' which pops up far too often for average films that hollywood rams down people's throats.

This film was so poor. I'm generally a fan of Cameron and normally his writing is very good, but the sub plot to this film was appalling. Why did Rose, who was meant to be English played by an English actress have a bad American accent. Why did every Englishman/woman on the boat (which incredibly was an English ship you know, not American as the film tries to push) an evil nasty character.

The acting was probably the worst in film history and the love story was so silly and badly done. All the scenes on the boat looked like Hollywood stage sets.

It's very disturbing that a film like this can win Oscar recognition. It was bad enough that Braveheart won an Oscar, but that was much better than this.

Film making and hype at its worst from a normally reliable director.",1
25 July 2007,Only to be Idolized by Starry Eyed Tweens,"Titanic {dir. James Cameron, 1997} (*½/****)

Somewhere on its way to becoming the all time box office champion and biggest Oscar winner of all time, James Cameron's Titanic etched out a place in my mind as the one film that can most easily send me into a frenzied rant against the dangers of big- budget, epic film making. Sure, I might not have put it that way when I first saw it (I was seven) but, upon first viewing I knew that this film was nothing special. Four years later, I was able to identify it as simply money thrown onto the screen with little room left for intelligence, emotion or character. Yet even as I professed the evils of this production and its vapid screenplay (penned by director Cameron), there were those who maintained that Titanic was an achievement. Among those people are esteemed film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert , both of whom included it on their top ten lists of 1997. Those celebratory citations led me to revisit Titanic again recently, for the first time on DVD, a disc which preserves the film's original aspect ratio and presents the clearest available picture and sound. The Verdict: As the old truism goes, ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig.""

The film isn't all bad; the cast is solid (considering the material..but more on that later), the score is rich, the cinematography is evocative and the production design and visual effects are impeccable. Yet as it turns out, all these elements do not a great film make. Titanic's greatest weakness lies at its very core: the screenplay. It reaches a level so wretched that I will be blunt in my metaphoric criticism. Cameron's script isn't just a turd, it is a floater; it refuses to just be flushed away to haunt us no longer. It insists on having an epic length and employing a framing device that may very well be the cause of a sudden onset of narcolepsy. I'm sorry to resort to such infantile comparison, but I believe that is best to convey the utter insult that is Cameron's screenplay. I consider myself a romantic, yet the so-called romance of this film left me cold, with nothing to do except roll my eyes. The film lacks any new vision or originality, and that can never be commended.

I'm fed up at this point; three viewing, each one revealing an un-plundered area of Cameron's incompetence. This film remains an interminable, and wildly popular, mash of tired formula only be idolized by starry eyed tweens.",5
7 June 2003,James Cameron's worst-- though that's not too bad.,"I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",10
2 May 2016,A 7.9? Are you kidding me?,"Titanic is my all-time favorite film. This film breathed life back into the Hollywood epic. Sadly, many people don't see it as an epic. They see it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story. But contrary to popular belief, the film focuses just as much on the ship as it does on the love story. It blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very easy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've ever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also has one of the important life morals: only life is priceless and making each day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue is predictable and at times stilted. But that doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece. Because there is nothing in the film that I would improve, I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING.

12 July 2020,GOAT,"How is this not in the top 250? This movie was breathtaking and inspiring. My new favorite! The love story goes deeper in meaning than any other. In some ways this movie is also a tribute to the power of memory and means so much more than is seen on the surfce. The cast was well picked, I cannot think of any actor or actress who would have played the roles better. James Cameron did an impecible job of being detail oriented when it came to the true events that took place in 1912. Additionally, the movie was so well done that while watching, it feels as though you are transported to the actual event. MASTERPIECE

2 January 2023,10/10,"It's been several decades since I had the chance to watch James Cameron's masterful epic, and watching it again after all this time, I can honestly say that my feelings haven't changed: this is an exhilarating film from top to bottom, from the magnificent visuals and a love story that deserves its place among Hollywood's best.

For starters, the entire cast is a knockout, with appearances by actors such as Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Maggie Smith, and Billy Zane, to name a few, but it's Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performances where Titanic truly shines.

Despite being victim to countless parodies over the years, the spark between Rose and Jack remains every bit as powerful. There's also a surprising amount of humor - I especially loved the moments we see Rose abandon her ""polite girl"" status in order to help Jack, or when people begin breaking down gates or doors in order to navigate their way out of the ship.

Director James Cameron truly hit a grand slam visually, and seeing that ship captured in such a beautiful and expansive light was every bit as exciting as I remember seeing in the theater. Now that I've aged a bit since then, watching the sinking of the ship made me realize why this is such a long movie - it takes time for the entire event to unfold, making the infamous tragedy all the more nerve-wracking. The entire final act is one of the most beautifully staged and thrilling sequences the movies have given us, with tension becoming higher and higher as the water slowly makes its way through the ship, and the panic and chaos among the passengers rising to terrifying heights.

All in all, TITANIC certainly earned its place among cinema's finest moments. It's an exciting and emotional ride that hasn't lost its glow, and I'm beyond happy to have been able to watch this again, despite my own reservations.",10
17 March 2019,Brilliant,"Such a masterful film with great performances by winslet and di caprio. He definitely deserved an Oscar for this one. A film based on a real life tragedy

16 October 2001,The most OVERRATED film of all time along with Gone With The Wind!,"I cannot for the love of God, believe how extremely OVERRATED James Cameron's pile of garbage known as Titanic is! This film, which should have been about the actual sinking of the great luxary ship Titanic, instead relies on a 90210 idiotic love story to ""carry"" the picture through. IF the two main characters had been interesting, it might have been a better picture, but, alas, the two leads, Jack Dawson, and Rose Bukater are about as interesting as watching paint dry. Rose isn't suffering from oppression, she's suffering from SPOILED BRAT syndrome! Jack comes along like a teenage pretty boy rather than a compelling character that the audience relates to. The film does have a few assets such as costume design, and some of the special effects are pretty good. However, it's the whole script and it's 90210 meets the Titanic setting that makes this the most OVERRATED film in the history of motion pictures! This film grossed $600 million in the United States?!?! James Cameron must have put mind altering drugs into the prints of the film to hypnotize movie audiences and academy members who gave this stinker Best Picture of 1997 over the great L.A. Confidential. One on a scale of 1-10. Great costumes and special effects cannot make up for a ridiculous screenplay and dull leads. Want a great motion picture try L.A. Confidential, or Citizen Kane instead!",1
20 November 2021,"The greatest movie, ever.","From start to end, Titanic is a beautiful movie depicting a horrible tragedy. Titanic has the most romantic scene in cinema history that truly will never be toped, and also some of the most painful, gut wrenching scenes of humans trying to survive, and accepting the inevitable fate. This movie was an instant classic in 1997, and it proved that by still being atop most peoples all time movie lists and still be adored and talked about even in 2021.

12 April 2005,The most overrated film ever,"I don't get it. What was spectacular about Titanic? Sure, the special effects were nice for the time, but groundbreaking? Not in my book. The characters were... well likable. Not lovable, nor classic, but likable. The plot? Cookie-cutter. Poor boy meets rich girl, poor boy falls instantly in love with rich girl, rich girl does the same, poor boy dies (Seriously, were you not expecting someone to die. You knew the boat was going to sink). Throw in a historical tragedy, and Wam! Insta-plot. And it gets 11 Oscars. What happened? I mean, Titanic certainly wasn't a make-up Oscar for Cameron for T2.

Titanic is one of those films where they intentionally stuff as many things to tug on the heartstrings as possible without actually being engaging or interesting. Pearl Harbor did the EXACT same formula, yet critics panned it.

It's OK, yet not sensational in anyway.

6 August 1999,One of the worst films ever,"It isn't that this film is bad. It would be good if it didn't receive all the hype that it got. Why in the world would it win Best Picture Oscar. That should have went to L.A. Confidential or As Good As It Gets. I do enjoy Kathy Bates in everything I see and Kate Winslet was all right. But James Cameron's cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomed ship was just a way to sell tickets, and adding ""DiCraprio"" was just icing on the cake for him. If you like good movies, rent ""Boogie Nights"" and if you like a Titanic movie, rent ""A Night to Remember"", please.

3 May 2003,Skip It,"Romance movies are not my genre. There I said it, now all you teenage girls (or ex-teenage girls I should probably say) can come with torches to my house and protest. That said, I think this movie is not only a dud on the technical level, but also on the content plateu.

James Cameron loves creating megadose action flicks (Terminator 2, True Lies, etc.) that usually require little background or very uninvolving plots. The guy has little to no screenwriting ability (if you read his scripts, particularly for ALIENS, you will see that there is nothing to applaud. Fortunately, as a director, Cameron can transcend the difficulties of putting images on paper and creating some impressive images (even if the scenes themselves are rather dull).

By all means, ABYSS and Terminator 2 deserved Oscars for Cinematography, but this movie is merely overrated end-of-the-year garbage (see also CHICAGO) that lacks emotion and style in his camerawork. Much of his work here in Titanic seems more like he's stealing ideas from Brian DePalma rather than being inventive.

Cameron learned from Corman, plain and simple, and that similar attitude is displayed here. Grabbing a cast from a fashion catalogue, Cameron proves (once again) that he hasn't lost his touch in how to be EXPLOITIVE of human emotion. That might explain his love life problems.

On the rest of the technical notes, this movie did NOT deserve most of the awards it was nominated for. The Sound is on par with T2 (read: awful) and the effects were unenlightening. Someone want to explain how Face/Off didn't get that award? The visual and SFX were fair. Fair to poor that is, Cameron has lost his ability to know when to use CGI and when not to. Film editing= totally awful, this was waaayy to long even for me. Hence I fell asleep three times during the sinking.

Music= James Horner's score is nothing new. It rather reminded me of ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"". If I had a time machine, I would've given him the Oscar for ALIENS instead. And as for the Director, what a joke. Now Cameron has become a recluse crackhead rather than therecluse genius he was.

So do the math, I have succeeded in knocking off 7 Oscars from this overrated POS. Now it's on par with Forrest Gump where it belongs. Overall: 1.5 out of 5. Don't waste your time.",
25 November 2020,Had the ending spoiled by my history teacher,"James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron...

James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron IS James Cameron.

Oh and this film is flawless.

3 October 1998,I'm sick and tired of hearing about this piece of ....,"This is one of the most boring, unexciting, lame, worthless pile of dog heap I have ever seen. I know some overly stimulated people love this film for its emotional romantic story and great acting by 'Leo' and 'Kate' I can't help but feel this is less than rubbish. If this deserved best picture and most successful film of all time, I'm sure The Stupids and Godzilla deserved to be in the AFI Top 100 list. This has no meaning at all, and encourages stupid teens to steal girls from their fiances. I mean, who is the villain here if a poor try-hard gambling artist who seduces rich women and goes into a rich man's car and makes it dirty and makes her think not to marry the man she truly loves and wanted to get married with? That's either a very sick surfer-dude or ONE, DUMB woman. When he dies, he only makes it worse for Kate and basically ruins her life. She has no mother, no husband and no life anymore. It was that S.O.B. who made her live with her daughter in a haystack cabin 80 years later, if DiCrapio wasn't there she would have died happily rich and loved by her family.

Yes, James Cameron did a good job wasting his time here, he did probably deserve Responsible for the Biggest Mistake Ever, but he did much better in T2, The Abyss, Aliens and True Lies. Those films actually entertained me. And, Jim, you're NOT the king of the world.

The script was wonderful. Glorious is all I can say.

""I'll never let go Jack, I'll never let go..."" (Rose lets go of Jack) -audience cries. oh jack. oh jack-

""Do you love him?"" ""Pardon me"" ""Do you love him?"" ""None of your business!"" ""It's a simple question."" (Jack stares at Rose very angrily) -audience holds each other's hands, anxiously waiting for an answer-

Touching..

All in all, Titanic is one overrated pile of nothing which DOES NOT DESERVE its acclaim i'm telling ya. And to all you MEN out there who love this movie, what is this world coming to?",1
