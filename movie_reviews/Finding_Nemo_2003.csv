10 December 2003,"Yes, it's THAT good !!","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",8
15 October 2005,Pixar's best feature to date,"I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"" to DreamWorks films like ""Shrek."" But ""Finding Nemo"" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the ""Toy Story"" movies and in ""Monsters Inc.,"" but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.

Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in ""Finding Nemo,"" as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of ""Far Side"" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.

Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.

The story employs the same basic formula used in ""Toy Story,"" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.

Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, ""Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat."" That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.",9
28 November 2003,amazing visuals,"Has there ever been a better-looking feature-length animated film than `Finding Nemo'? We doubt it. With its shimmering underwater landscapes - be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium - the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before. The fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eye-popping, many-hued visual splendor.

Although the script by Andrew Stanton doesn't scale the comedic heights of, say, `Aladdin,' `Shrek' or `Toy Story 2,' it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing. I hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and off-color humor that have blighted so much alleged `kiddie' fare in recent years. This is a film on e can watch with one's children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so. Creators of children's films please take note (and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take).

Like many tales designed for the junior set (`Dumbo,' `Bambi' etc.), `Finding Nemo' taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents - and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children. It is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film. In this case, it is little Nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia. The subject of the film's title is Marlin, Nemo's overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke. Along the way, this Nervous Nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and Nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is.

Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love. Those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their live-action performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying.

As directed by Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and executed by an army of wonder-working animators and technicians, `Finding Nemo' takes PIXAR technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection - till the studio's next release, that is.",
22 January 2005,Another Disney/Pixar Classic,"Those guys and girls at Disney/Pixar have done it again, they've created the perfect underwater world, full of fascinating Disney characters.

A truly enchanting story of a father (Marlon) who loses his son (Nemo), and with help of his new found friend (Dory) ventures out into the ocean to try to find him. On this epic voyage he gets to battle sharks, surf with some turtle dudes, dice with some jellyfish and survive an encounter in a whales stomach.

All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but my favourite is Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, pure genius.

All in all this is another success for Disney and Pixar, It brings out the child in all of us.

Solid family fun 8/10",8
20 March 2006,Swimming with Sharks is a Whale of a Time,"Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.

As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.

The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.

The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes  from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.

Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes  ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents.",10
28 July 2003,Pixar Remains the Best Family Film Industry Out There Today...,"Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2 and ""Monsters, Inc."" are some of my favorite family films; ""Finding Nemo"" isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like ""A Bug's Life,"" and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.

As always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In ""Toy Story"" they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" they showed us the monster world. In my review on ""A Bug's Life,"" I said that the reason the film didn't work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because ""Finding Nemo"" is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.

This tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.

Years later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot's son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)

Pixar doesn't let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.

""Finding Nemo"" gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist's office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe's vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist's tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie ""Platoon"" might have something to do with that.

This is taken from my ""Monsters, Inc."" review: ""Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my 'Toy Story' review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for 'Toy Story 3') and gives them the bare minimum.

With ""Finding Nemo,"" I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they separate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it's almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself.",8
11 January 2004,Who said fish are boring?,"""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.

The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.

There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.

I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.

The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.

Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.

Mine, mine, mine!

5 June 2003,"""Finding"" A Flight odf Fancy","Remember back when you were little.you know, back when tall to you was about as high as a mailbox? In those days, Disney animated films (e.g. `Lion King' and `Beauty and the Beast') were some of the coolest things out there and were movies to watch over and over (much to your parents' chagrin). Now, animated movies aren't exactly the `coolest' things to see, but an exception can be made for the uber-hip Pixar movies, the most recent of which being `Finding Nemo'.

After losing all but one of his brood, Marlin (Albert Brooks) an over-protective clown fish that strangely lacks a sense of humor, has resolved to protect his one (slightly disabled) `child' remaining, Nemo (Alexander Gould). But disaster strikes as Nemo is taken by a Sydney dentist and plopped into a fish tank where he is comforted by a host of other captive fish (William Dafoe, Vicki Lewis, Allison Janney, et al). But back in the big ocean Down Under, Marlin has resolved to search out his one remaining progeny.

Along the way on his quest, Marlin acquires a tag-along `friend', Dory (Ellen DeGeneres)-a fish with, well, the memory capacity of a fish. The two must surmount hurdles like a group of sharks (Eric Bana, Barry Humphries and Bruce Spence) that have (mostly) sworn off eating other fish, a nasty swarm of jellyfish, a bird-brained flock of seagulls, and others.

This is the bridge! Well, in a way. Back when I was younger, one of my favorite films was `The Incredible Mr. Limpet', which, for the uninitiated, combined live-action with under-the-sea fish animation. What Pixar has done here was bring back that film to my mind and start me thinking, because they have created a wondrous undersea environment (with `normal-looking' fish instead of 1960s animated fish).

My favorite feature in this movie chock-full of sweet treats must be the sharks. I have always been partial to the shark family, but what has been done in creating three humorous sharks (what a movie concept), just sent paroxysms of laughter through me. Another thing that (mostly) works is Ellen DeGeneres' fish (character?) that provides a fairly constant source of laughter with her antics (although a couple gags do wear on the viewer with time). On the whole though, there is not a single bit of shoddy voice-acting or animation in it.

Compared to `Monsters Inc.', `Finding Nemo' is something of a revival for Pixar. I like how they have stepped up their efforts to make an altogether pleasing film without any big flaws. The thing that I did not like with `Monsters' was the inclusion of a single key (but EXTREMELY annoying) character. Director Andrew Stanton has done an excellent job at making the film work and be (basically) non-annoying to most of the general public (and this critic).

I suppose life has come full circle-now that I am (relatively) old as a high school graduate, animation is cool again, thanks to high-powered computers, at any rate. `Finding Nemo' is one heckuva movie and a good one to take anyone you know to, trust me on this-nine out of ten.",9
12 August 2003,quite a catch,"Pixar Studios have done it again. I have to say that these guys are totally good in computer animation, as well as in storytelling. Rarely do those qualities come together but here they are, delivering unto the audience once again something that one can only be drowned with wonder. Such is the marvel of Finding Nemo.

The story is about Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a young clownfish who is fed up with his dad Marlin's (Albert Brooks) excessive paranoia over him. He swims to a place where his dad forbids him and ends up being captured by a scuba diver. He is then placed in a fish tank in a dental clinic somewhere along the harbors of Sydney. Thus the quest of Marlin, along with Dory (a hilarious forgetful blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) to find Nemo before it's too late.

The story is a simple one but where the film more than makes up is on the overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colors and textures as if we aren't really watching an animated film at all. Scenes such as Marlin bringing Nemo to school while swimming through corals and anemones, to the aquarium where Nemo was taken to, are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtedbly one of the most outstanding animation ever to hit the screen.

The world of ""Finding Nemo"" is simply alive with lovable creatures swimming about their daily lives under the ocean, darting across the screen in playful manners. The viewer almost literally dives into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely captivated.

The music and screenplay also blend very well with the visual feast that it produces such a high quality movie. From its basic storyline, to the father-and-son relationship theme, to the wonderful underwater world throughout, this is really an adventure through an ocean of stunning visuals and storytelling.

Grade: A",
3 May 2009,What an outstanding movie!,"This movie is just gorgeous to look at, really the animation is just stunning, with the blue backgrounds and colourful characters. My only criticism is that although there are some very funny moments, like Doreen speaking whale(Ellen DeGeneres was born to speak whale, really she was) and Barry Humphries's shark, I don't think it is as laugh-out loud funny as Toy Story. Finding Nemo is definitely the most beautiful visually of the Pixar movies, I would certainly pick it over Cars. The music by Thomas Newman was just beautiful, and I always look out for this in a movie, and it was a delight hearing ""Beyond the Sea"" over the end credits. The characters are genuinely memorable, especially Doreen and Bruce. And who can forget the girl Darla, with the Psycho music?(that is really terrifying)The voice talents are very good indeed, especially Ellen DeGeneres, and I liked Willem Dafoe's Gil. Albert Brooks made a wonderfully paranoid father figure, and I loved the plot about Marlin's son Nemo being taken by divers and Marlin (a clown fish) racing to find him. That is simple, but we meet characters like the turtle, so the film is filled with fun, enough to satisfy the fussiest child. In conclusion, 9/10 for the visuals and the characters. Outstanding!

10 July 2005,Just keep swimming...,"Can Pixar and Disney miss with a film? Both Toy Story's, A Bugs Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. These movies are instant classics.

The movie in focus is Finding Nemo, a story of a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to find his son Nemo who was taken away by scuba divers. With the help of a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres)Marlin bumps into on his journey, they set out on finding Nemo. The only problem is that Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She can't remember anything except her name. It's sad but brings a lot of comedy to the movie.

Along the way they meet some priceless characters like Crush (voiced by writer/director Andrew Stanton), the thrill seeking sea turtle. They also encounter a trio of friendly sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. They have sworn to never eat a fish again. They also run into some potentially deadly situations with an ugly deep sea fish, also a huge swarm of jellyfish, and a whale. Marlin and Dory must tough it out and make it to find Nemo.

Meanwhile, Nemo is now the new addition to an Australian dentist's office aquarium. There he meets some interesting characters. Peach the starfish, Bloat the blowfish, and more sea dwellers. There Nemo tries to fit in, becoming a member of the tank named ""Shark Bait"". He tries to help out Gill (William Defoe) with his plan to escape from the tank and get everyone out. Nemo must come through in order to see his father ever again. A local pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) also tries to help out in the escape. Word has spread around the world of Marlin's trip to find his son, reaching Nigel.

FInding Nemo is an instant classic. With great lines and unforgettable characters, this movie is a delight. The animation itself is remarkable. It's as though the fish are really swimming. You can even see particles floating in the water. Light shines through and currents make the fish and surrounding react. The animators have done their homework for this picture.

This movie is quite an experience. It is a film the whole family can enjoy for years to come. It is a timeless adventure that people can enjoy. Don't let this film drift out to sea...",10

22 May 2003,Worth your time.,"Okay, Disney and Pixar did a fabulous job. The images were so great, the storyline was typical but fun, the characters were well-defined, and the sound was emotive and effective. And, who could not love a flick that makes references to The Shining, Psycho, and other quality films?

I seriously got attached to the little Clown fish, Nemo. The movie just sucked me in. Anyway, watch it. It's worth your time, especially if you enjoy Pixar animation. The first 10 minutes is a visual overload in a good way. Very good way.

By the way, the voice of Jesus (Willem Dafoe) embodied by a Tiger fish? Awesome.

23 October 2008,The little fish movie that could.,"My Take: Simply magical, down to the last computer-animated detail.

I was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out, and only now am I reviewing it. But that can't stop me, I have to lay out my sentiments for this clever and occasionally brilliant animated achievement. Not only is it the best, so far, in Pixar's portfolio of animated films, it's one of the very best animated films ever made, period. FINDING NEMO is a well-told fairy tale adventure, but a well-told story is only a bonus compared to the film's awesome look and feel. The movie is visually stunning, with images that flow like living paintings, some of which almost but leaps out the screen. The movie is beautifully crafted, and sometimes, I almost didn't care about anything else. Almost.

On the contrary, the story is quite simple. After a tragedy introduced in the opening scenes, Marlin the clown fish (voiced by Albert Brooks) becomes too over-protective of his last son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). Every move he makes is always under the watchful eye of his over-protective father, who couldn't afford to lose him. To prove that he can walk with his own two feet (or is that swim with his own fins?), Nemo approached an anchored divers boat and is abducted by two curious divers and taken far off the Great Barrier Reef. Marlin, guilty for his loss, is determined to find his son, captured by a dentist and placed inside a too-small-for-a-fish aquarium in the dentist's clinic. Along his side is a joyous yet forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who gives a helping fin a long the way, whatever she can remember.

This is quite an adventure too. Not only are we introduced to a closer-than-life-like reef, we are also introduced with a clever and elaborate band of characters, including a trio of sharks who swore their lives to be vegetarians (until the call of the wild kicks in), a couple of surfer-dude turtles, a charade-playing school of fish and many other wonders. The animation here is, by far, the most brilliant ones I have ever seen. A colorful and life-filled reef, a forest of jellyfish and a crystal-clear aquarium filled of plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine in this lavish and elaborate adventure. But other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough to recommend the picture, the film is not without a good story, and it is told well. The characters have a great deal of features and characteristics. This is most evident on the character of Dory, who not only has the showmanship of the voice who dubbed her, but also the delight we expect from a true family film.

If the story may not apply to you, or you might find it cliché, then FINDING NEMO will still do as a brilliant eye-candy, with one of the best sights I have ever seen in an animated film then and now. Sometimes, sitting in front of a theater or even the small screen and just let the elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough to see a movie. Sometimes it's a movie like this one that reminds you the fun that going to movies are.

Rating: ***** out of 5.",10

30 September 2003,The now-traditional mix of adult wit and kiddie laughs  although less sharp than usual (but still very funny),"Scarred by the loss of his wife and eggs, Marlin has over sheltered his only child, Nemo. However when Nemo's first day at school comes about, that mothering leads Nemo to swim out to the open ocean where he is caught by a scuba diver and be put in a fish tank far away. Enlisting help from the forgetful Dory, Marlin tracks the boat and his ocean adventure begins.

Now as much as a tradition as national holidays, the latest Pixar animation arrives in the UK on a wave (d'oh!) of hype and marketing. Officially the biggest summer film in the US and all over buses and Happy Meals (which seems a little perverse when you think about it) it is hard not to want to see it or prevent your kids from demanding they see it. Happily the well establish benchmark of being kiddie friendly but fun for adults is maintained and the film does exactly what you know it will. The plot is a little like Toy Story's quest but is fleshed out enough to be interesting and the themes of `letting go' and loss are actually quite well handled and will speak more to adults than kids.

The slight problem with the film is that is does do just what you expect and the `animated film with adult wit and kiddie characters' stuff is hardly cutting edge anymore. However this is a picky flaw as it is still very good fun. It may not be the strongest of this genre, indeed some bits flag and the sentimental core, while a break from cruel humour or sarcasm, does then to slow things down a bit at times.

The adult references are all good but not as frequent as I'd have liked  they seem to be separate from the main flow where I wanted them integral with all of it. Clever homage's to Jaws (Bruce was the pet name of the rubber shark) and The Birds are distracting and make you feel good about yourself, and the banter is mostly witty if lacking a real sharpness at times.

The voice cast are all good are quite an all star bunch. Brooks does a workmanlike job in the lead  it must be said I didn't think he distinguished himself but then he did have to carry the moral weight of the film. DeGeneres is much better and her dippy character is a delight at times. The support cast is not as deep and fun as in other films  Janney and Dafoe are both fun in the tank (as are all the tank characters) it's just that none of them are really consistent. My favourite characters were the one word seagulls  `mine?'

Overall I have been unfair to this film in my review. If I saw this in isolation I would be praising it to the roof, however using the others as a benchmark this does have a few weaknesses that show signs of wear and tear in the genre. Not to cancel everything I have said, these weaknesses are all things that I realised after I had watched it  while I was watching it I was too busy laughing! Biggest downside for me though  no comedy outtakes, booooooo!",
11 May 2005,Pixar has gone beyond our limits,"Pixar has made some of the enjoyable films in the past years: The Toy Story films, Monsters, Inc., and A Bug's Life to name a few. What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in ""Finding Nemo"" where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own.

""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish name Marlin (Albert Brooks) who takes on the responsibility of his young son Nemo after the mother and the babies were killed off screen. Now as a single parent, Marlin worries about everything that his young son does, even when he goes off to school for the first day.

There is a universal moment in about every Pixar movie where there is always a human nature to relate towards the animated films; with Marlin's parental worries as a single father, most of the dads in the audiences can relate to him, especially when Nemo is kidnapped by a sea diver after getting near a boat.

Marlin goes through the sea of Australia where he meets with a blue coral fish name Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has STM (Short Term Memory) where she can remember things and than forget until the final moment. They go on adventures from escaping sharks, getting sting by jellyfish, swimming with turtles and going inside a whale's mouth.

As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.

""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.",10
1 December 2015,Fishing for courage,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",6
10 June 2007,Cute and pleasant fare for the kids,"Okay, I am NOT a huge Nemo fan, but considering the film's modest pretenses and how much kids loved it, who am I to complain--especially since the animation is so nice? Plus, the film is much, much better than the knock-off film, SHARK TALE.

The film has one of the simplest plots I have ever seen in a kids movie. Nemo loves his dad and vice-versa. When Nemo is captured for a home aquarium, the timid dad springs to the rescue with rather predictable results. There are no major surprises BUT the journey along the way is pleasant and cute. The kids will no doubt love it but some parents may find it a bit ""sticky"" and shallow like I did. But considering how much fun my daughter had watching it, this can all be forgiven.

8 March 2006,Pixar's best movie.,"I didn't see this movie until it came out on DVD. My family and I don't go to the movies very often, mostly because there's hardly anything worth seeing.

But this movie was absolutely flawless. The voice cast was super. The voice of Nemo is Alexander Gould, who is 11 years old now. I saw his picture, and I really like his smile.

""Finding Nemo"" is a classic. It'a among my favorite movies, and is a movie everyone should see. Unlike about 96% of movies, this movie is Rated ""G"", and can be viewed by children. There might be a few moments when it gets ""scary,"" but they soon turn into comedy.

Watch ""Finding Nemo"" and I think you'll be a happier person by the end of the movie!

My Score: 10/10.",10
13 May 2021,A delight from start to finish,"As charming as it is beautiful, Andrew Stanton (and co-director Lee Unkrich)'s 'Finding Nemo' is a joy, both visually and cinematically. It is a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that warms your heart from time to time. The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is excellence and beauty in every frame. Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable. All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. A delight from start to finish.

14 October 2008,Another Pixar Great!,"Finding Nemo is a very good animated film, probably it's in the top 10 animated features of all time. The story is about a little clown fish named Nemo. He ventures out into the open sea while not listening to his father. He gets captured by a dentist and now his father, marlin has to save him from the clutches of the dentist and his ""evil"" niece. The story of the film is unbelievable. I don't know how a movie about a fish can be very popular. The voice acting is pretty good. The all-star cast did a great job voicing their characters. The music in this film is sweet. The music will lure you more into the movie. The song in the film is great for people who like music 40 years ago. Once again, Pixar did not fail in its ability to make classic animated films. Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.

16 April 2015,Finding Nemo (2003),"""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.

The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.

As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.

""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.

Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.",10
11 March 2013,Finding Nemo — A great animation adventure to be enjoyed by all,"Finding Nemo is the heroic tale of fishes, and it's excellent. It opens up with a tragedy and quickly leads us to a great adventure and multiple acts of courage. Who would have thought that such a simple idea could result in such a great production?

The animation is extremely colorful, brought to us in great details for a breathtaking look at the life under the sea. The dialogs are funny. The script is very inventive and doesn't call on evil or songs. The story is riveting, with each scene a novelty in itself. Voices are chosen to perfection, and the reactions realistic.

A great movie for both adults and kids.

23 August 2015,"Finding Nemo is just a delight, pure and simple.","When I grew up, I always thought the concept of Pixar movies was ""what would life be like as a ____"" Toys were fun, Monsters in the cupboard were fun, bugs were fun, and now we landed on fish. And I loved it because it was colourful and funny and touching.

Now, watching Finding Nemo with all I know about film, I am able to understand how brilliant early Pixar was. Every one of these early films has two ""whats life like as"" - one for kids (toys, bugs, monsters) and one for adults. In Finding Nemo, its ""what life is like as an overprotective parent."" Finding Nemo is one of the most beautiful stories that can appeal to families that I've ever seen.

The film opens with one of the most downright upsetting moments I ever watched as a child. Albert Brooks' perfect voice casting really captures the grief and desperation that Marlin feels, and it so perfectly sets the stage for the rest of the film. Every one of Marlin's overprotective scenes is not completely justified, but so believable to come from him. We also enjoy Ellen DeGeneres' delightful sidekick Dory, who is absolutely hilarious and charming and I could not love her presence more. As Marlin and Dory set out on the titular quest, Pixar does what Pixar does best - gives us a funny and wondrous understanding of their universe. A gang of sharks are recovering addicts from fish flesh. Seagulls are sadistic and brainless. A group of sea turtles are perpetually high. Throughout each of the encounters, not only does Marlin learn more about the ocean he has been afraid of for so long, but he learns about how his overprotective parenting isn't going to help Nemo forever, and he's better off learning to take care of himself wherever he can.

Meanwhile, Nemo is confined in a dentist's tank with a gaggle of kooky fish characters, each of whom has their own little ticks because of their confinement (a beautiful little addition to the story). Emmy king and queen Brad Garrett and Allison Janney are hilarious and even funnier is the addition of Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush, who pops in as a Pelican taking an interest in dental hygiene.

The film's story is so perfectly constructed that I can't fault it. The catalyst moments are spread out by moments of character development and sprinkled with perfect doses of humour. Even the final challenge doesn't come across as ""just one more obstacle"" but provides closure on Marlin's overparenting and provides his first real test. Thomas Newman's serene score keeps things moving along at a beautiful pace, and the animation is as superb as anything we've come to expect from Pixar.

Finding Nemo is just a delight, pure and simple. Its a lesson to kids and parents alike, but its also so colourful and funny that its a fun watch just when you're feeling flat. Perfect for all occasions.",10
6 February 2021,Pixars Genius,"A touching and humorous story. As mentioned in my review of ""How to train your Dragon"", for me a good animated film is that both children and adults can enjoy it. The animated film is less funny than other Pixar movies, but still fun enough for the little ones. And the big ones can enjoy a lovingly drawn father-son-story, finely developed figures and nice film allusions.

25 October 2003,You know what they say about not fixing something that ain't broke...,"A number of folks have complained about ""Finding Nemo"" not being up to the standards of ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" - and it's true that it's not perfect; when you think about it, the Andrew Stanton/Bob Peterson/David Reynolds script has a slightly similar plot to the adventures of Buzz, Woody et al (for a toy being taken read a little clownfish missing). Plus the movie suffers from a few too many climaxes (probably because unlike most American animated features, this has a three-figure running time), and there's a definite sign of a formula to Pixar movies.

But we'd be so much better off if all movies had it: Pixar movies have proper screenplays, packed with wit and warmth (and restraint - like the pinnacle of the climax of ""A Bug's Life,"" the horrible incident that launches the movie takes place off screen); they have good casts performing the characters, with a particular nod here to Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Barry Humphries and Willem Dafoe (though one wishes Nemo had a bit more dimension to him); they have plenty of effort put into the look of the movie (one of the strongest achievements is that the undersea world of the Pacific is a lot more comforting than the dry land world of Australia, so that you feel alarmed whenever the action cuts to Sydney); and they have the sense to not go overboard with any cultural references.

It has to be said that it's a bit slow going at first, but fears that it'll be Pixar's first real disappointment are soon allayed; with some impressive animation, plenty of fine moments throughout and a wonderful score from Thomas Newman that gives the proceedings a breath of fresh musical air after his cousin Randy's efforts (so when can we expect David Newman to work for Pixar?), this ultimately ends up as another good effort from the bouncing lamp - who else would have a family movie include the music credit ""'The Murder' Written By Bernard Herrmann"" (it serves as the ""theme"" for an Elmyra Duff type who Nemo's in great danger from in the air-breathers' world)? It goes without saying that staying for the closing titles is a must, Robbie Williams's undesired song notwithstanding - no ""outtakes"" this time, but never mind.

""I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine. And he shall be my Squishy.""",
8 October 2006,Amazing - really funny,"Finding Nemo is one of a series of Pixar animation features made in past decade or so and is probably the best of the lot. My three year old watches the DVD at least twice a week and doesn't show any sign of getting tired. The reason is obvious - Finding Nemo creates a complete under the sea world inhabited by creatures with complete personalities.

The plot has Marlin, a clown fish, losing his only child Nemo (named after Capt.Nemo of 20,000 leagues under the the sea) to a deep sea diver. While Nemo is stuck in a fish tank in a dental office with lots of other interesting characters, Marlin sets out to find his son. On the way, a crazy blue fish called Dory joins him and turns this into something of a buddy movie (although Dory is female)......

There are lots of jokes peppered throughout the movie with Dory supplying a large chunk of them. Writer-director Stanton plays a 'dude' 150 year old sea turtle straight from the 60's and adds to the fun. The visuals are superb, storyline is great and it all makes for a great adventure. I rate this 9/10 because I'm a little sick and tired of seeing it on the DVD every weekend for over a year now!!",10
4 October 2014,A cherished childhood favorite,"Having watched this movie back when I was in my 8/9 years of age, Finding Nemo struck me as a very funny movie and I, of course, loved Dory and her quirkiness. Over time I began to appreciate the emotional impact of the story and the detail that went into the animation process, which in turn led to the establishment of this movie as my favorite of all time. Having only been surpassed three years ago by Toy Story 3 (another Pixar gem), Finding Nemo still holds a strong impression on me, as well as remaining one of my top 10 movies and my second favorite animated movie.

The plot follows a clown fish named Marlin, that after his son is taken by a human, sets out on a dangerous and treacherous journey to get him back. Along the way he will meet Dory, a blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Together they will stop at nothing to get to Nemo, Marlin's son, who along with a group of ragtag aquarium fish will also plan to escape to the ocean in order to avoid a bratty, but, deadly child and get back to his dad.

So like I said, there 3 reasons why I love this movie. The first one is the comedy, provided mostly by the goofy sidekick Dory, as well as other characters. The combination of the smart script, plus the voice talent involved makes for the great comedic side of Finding Nemo. The other great quality of the script, is the emotional turmoil that ensues in the movie, and personally I believe that some parents might resonate with it most, even though I myself do not know this reality. Finally Pixar proves why they are the top of the animation game, by assembling the proper research and creating a great oceanic world, as well as the Sydney landscape.

Finding Nemo will forever be a cinematic mark in my cinematic history. It is a funny, energetic and entertaining picture, and that is all I can ask from a movie like this. Rating: 10/10",10
17 March 2016,One of the Best Animated Movies of All Time,"Finding Nemo is Pixar's crown jewel and one of the best animated movies of all time! They create an entire world under water, it looks beautiful, but it also captures the scarier things below the surface. Together, Dory and Marlin travel the Atlantic ocean in search for Nemo and along they way they run into some of the most bizarre characters imaginable! The audience is in the same position as Marlin, he is exploring the ocean for the first time, just like us as the audience, and it is intoxicating. The ocean to most people is a giant, wonderland full of mystery and you never know what you will run into, and Pixar takes full advantage of that as we meet a variety of characters.

Along the way, we are given the treat of having some amazing comedy bits as characters cultures clash amongst one another. But even as we travel across the ocean and back, the core of the story never leaves us, it's a love story about a father and son and it is an emotional roller-coaster. They brilliantly take the most notorious fish movie, Jaws (which made the ocean seem terrifying), and turns it upside down, making the water now seem like a wonderful land full of amazing creatures. Finding Nemo is the epitome of Pixar's imagination and creative abilities, they have made an eternal classic here.

Let's hope the sequel lives up to the first film!",10
13 December 2019,Pixar has yet to top this movie.,"Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after.

2 June 2003,"Thoroughly enjoyable, but the sum does not equal the parts.","Fresh off a viewing in a packed theater of kids and parents, my initial impression of ""Finding Nemo"" was that I had a great time throughout, but don't necessarily remember why. The film is similar to the ""Toy Story"" pacing, in that we follow two different protagonists in their attempt to return to one another. In brief summary, Marlin the overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear of open ocean to try and find his only son, Nemo, who has been captured by a diver and transplanted to an ocean-view dentist's office fish tank.

The visual impact of ""Finding Nemo"" is unparalleled in animated film. At its best, it compares to the experience of seeing the sweeping landscapes of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" for the first time - not until we own the DVD and my son has watched it a dozen times will I really have an opportunity to see the details crammed into the lush backgrounds of the coral reefs. It was noticeable, however, that frequent close-ups in open water were used to reduce the amount of time spent rendering those brilliant backgrounds. In comparison to Pixar films like ""A Bug's Life"", where every moment of the film includes rich textures and detailed background perspective, this seemed jarring at times. It should be noted that this is true to what the ocean looks like - if you're not diving in a coral reef, you are probably seeing a lot of floating detritus and gray water - but it's worth mentioning that the fish tank environment of Nemo and his fellow captives is, at times, more interesting than the open ocean.

Pixar took chances (or else saved money) with many of the voice actors used in the film. It was refreshing not to instantly ""know"" a voice was familiar in the case of many of the characters - all of them did a serviceable job, although the well-known actors also turned in some of the best performances. Ellen DeGeneres had no fear as the voice of Dory, gleefully pulling off vocal pratfalls that would have been hampered by someone else's sense of dignity. I can think of only one other actress - Julia Louis-Dreyfuss - who I think would have been able to do Dory well. Kudos to Ellen. Willem Dafoe is also noticeably brilliant as Gill, and it's a bonus that the animated character he plays is gorgeously realized. John Ratzenberger does a hysterical turn as the school of fish we all saw in the previews.

I am surprised at the number of characters whose voices are not credited in this film. I wanted to know, among others, who voiced Mr. Ray the schoolteacher and the trio of parents with whom Marlin banters.

I laughed out loud frequently and heartily throughout the film, but at the end, I looked back and wondered how those moments of amusement added to the story. Many people have commented that they loved the 12-step program for sharks (""Fish are our friends, not food!"") but in the final analysis, it added very little to the arc and seemed out of character (I realize I'm stating the obvious). The frequently-dropped comedic digressions were the weak point in this picture, especially compared to ""A Bug's Life"", where the funniest moments of the film are all critical to the progress of the protagonist and impact the end of the story.

My 2 and a half year old son was frequently frightened to the point of crying out and grabbing on to me during the movie, and he followed the primary issues easily. At a particular moment in the film when things seemed hopeless, I heard dozens of young children beginning to cry. If your child is very affected by scary or dramatic moments in movies, you may want to talk with them about ""pretend"" versus ""real"" and prepare them for the eventuality that everything will turn out all right well before you go into the theater. His final analysis was that ""the fish movie was good!"" - so take it under advisement if you have kids of similar age.

I give ""Finding Nemo"" an 8 out of 10 on the strength of its visual lushness, its enjoyable voice work, and its moments of perfectly timed humor. It does not, in my opinion, match the strength as a *film* of earlier Pixar offerings, but even in its innocuous state, it's higher quality than most of the family films I've seen in the past 3 years.",8
30 January 2006,"There are 3.7 trillion fish in the ocean, and they're looking for one.","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

6 December 2003,Just right as rain...,"God bless Pixar. I am not really religious, but for Pixar, I'll convert. Because they are the precious few, part of the species of that rare kind of filmmakers who necessarily have to check out every detail, every bit and particle of their work, and necessarily turn all of them into sheer brilliancy. Today, Pixar has accostumed us to a pattern of quality beyond measure, not only because their work needs special attention but also because the technical part is only a vessel to something much important: a heart. And since every Pixar film requires half a life and half a soul to make from each and everyone of its founding craftsmen, the results are so exquisite and unique that no other movie can be compared to them. One may wonder about their ""secret"". No secret. Just real feeling and love to their job. ""Finding Nemo"" is the new crowning jewel in Pixar's flawless hall of fame, again a movie based on the buddy formula we love so much, this time in a whole new world: the ocean depths. And the prospect of doing a movie in this setting is probably something for the Pixar artists to drool on: just imagine all the quirky ideas they can have in this unexplored realm. And they deliver, big time. Once more, the filmmakers never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue. And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing. Movie magic at its best.",10

19 January 2004,Finding Nemo,"Never, and I mean, never, in my entire life, has a movie effect me the same way Finding Nemo did. It's the best movie I've EVER seen, and I know I say that about alot movie, but I actually mean it this time. Never, did I ever come out of a theater after seeing a movie smile for the rest of the night. The movie just completely blew me away. I knew it was going to be good, but I had no clue what was in store for me when I saw it opening night. This movie is a work of pure genius. The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance. And it all blended together beautifully. This is why I gave this movie a full 10. Believe, me if I could give it more, I would.

11 October 2004,Lovely Adventure,"Marlin loses his beloved mate and all their eggs but one after the attack of a shark to his home. He swears to protect his son Nemo for the rest of his live and becomes a super protective father. On the first day of school, Nemo shows himself off to his friends, challenging his father and getting close to a boat, and is caught by a diver and put in a private aquarium in a dentist office in Sidney. His father, together with Dory, face the dangers of the open sea trying to find Nemo. 'Finding Nemo' is a lovely adventure, indicated to viewers of any age. The story is funny and all the characters are very sweet. Another great movie of Walt Disney / Pixar. My vote is eight.

Good family fun from Disney and Pixar. Entertaining from start to finish, with a touch of emotion too. Some funny moments and a rollicking story. Hardly slows down for a moment.

Superb animation - such vivid colours, and a seamless movement effect. Certainly a far cry from the old colour-in-inside-the-lines animation.

However, it is probably the voices that make the movie. Superb casting in this regard. Ellen DeGeneres steals the show as Dory but every voice is well-chosen and spot-on. Filled with stars too, so it is often a case of spot-the-voice: Willem Dafoe, Albert Brooks, Geoffrey Rush, Allison Janney, Stephen Root.

Kids will love this, and so too will adults.",8
28 May 2003,A Must sea Movie,"The technical magicians at Pixar are back with the new animated film `Finding Nemo' that tells the story of a loving but overprotective Clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks), as he ventures out into the deep ocean to save his son Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has been taken from his home by divers.

The loss of Nemo is devastating to Marlin as he lost his wife and all of their eggs save for Nemo and has become very timid in the time since and he fears venturing beyond the safe confines of his home area.

Driven by the love for his son, Marlin sets out to follow the boat that has taken his son, even though it takes him deep into the dangerous Ocean and forces him to confront his own fears to save his son. Along the way Marlin encounters Dory (Ellen DeGeneris), a sweet but very absent-minded fish who tags along with Marlin to provide comedy relief for the story.

There is also a very good side story involving Nemo and a group of fish in a tank as they bond and try to formulate the grand escape to freedom and return Nemo to his father.

What follows is a very funny and charming story as the two fish encounter everything from sharks in a 12 Step program trying to change their image to a migration of surfer dude turtles. Of course there are dangers along the way and parents should be cautioned that some scenes did cause tears from some of the very young viewers in the screener that I attended.

While the plot is not the most complex story in the world, it is more than appropriate for the target audience of the film and there are more than enough laughs and smiles in the film to keep even the most jaded adult tuned in. The computer artistry is amazing as it is awash in motion, textures, and colors without being to frantic and providing an array of amazing visuals. I was very impressed at how each creature had detailed facial expressions that carried their emotions without having to rely heavily on the dialogue to convey feelings. In summary, `Finding Nemo' is an absolutely charming film and a true family classic that should not be missed. The film is easily the best work ever from Pixar, and that is saying something with their very impressive resume.

4 stars out of 5

30 June 2005,An underwater coming of age story in gorgeous splashes of color...,"The underwater visuals here are as gorgeous as anything Disney ever did in PINOCCHIO, and the colors are dazzling enough to keep anyone hypnotized by the lushness of it all.

The slender story about an outgoing clown fish, Nemo straying far from his over-protective father (voiced by Albert Brooks) and getting scooped up by a scuba diver (to be deposited in a fish tank), is played for laughs all the way through. Despite all the humor, there are plenty of tense situations that might frighten the very young. The writers have made sure that the plot is a virtual obstacle course full of forces that have to be overcome before the boy becomes a hero who saves the day.

Along the way, Nemo's closest pal is the daffy, amnesiac Dory, a bluefish with a terrible memory, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres in what has to be the film's best voice-over. Her lines are all guaranteed to remind you of the comedienne herself and she comes close to stealing the film with her antics.

The movie is slanted at the youth market, of course, and kids and their parents will probably both be enchanted and satisfied with the quips that come fast and furious. I had to use the caption feature on my remote to catch all of the one-liners.

On an artistic level, the underwater seascape is fascinating to observe and the jaunty background score keeps the pace flowing nicely.

My favorites: the seagulls all shouting in unison ""Mine!"" whenever prey was cited and a whole army of them getting their beaks caught in the mast of a ship.",7
12 February 2015,Fabulous Fish Tale!,"This is a fun-filled Disney/Pixar movie that is pretty much on par with the Toy Story trilogy. It's a story about a clown fish named Marlin, who swims through the vast ocean in search of his son, Nemo, who was taken by a diver for a pet. Along the way, he meets a blue tang fish with short term memory loss named Dory, who joins him in the search. What follows is an incredible adventure full of dodging sharks, riding with turtles, swimming past jellyfish and trying to go through other obstacles to search for Nemo, while he himself tries to deal with life being somebody's pet.

Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich did a great job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention from the start with a dramatic intro, followed by one adventurous scene after the other, making the plot very fast-paced and exciting. The story quickly identifies the issue of Nemo being pretty rebellious and the issue of worrying about his father's fear of the vast open sea. The tide turns within the story as Nemo is fished out of water and Marlin ends up taking the sea on to find him. All these plot elements and unpredictable moments make this an edge-of-the-ride film from start to finish.

The entire voice cast did a great job in their respective roles, making the characters very lovable. Ellen DeGeneres did a hilarious and upbeat job in voicing Dory (you could see Ellen's humorous personality in the fish) and Willem Dafoe did a mysterious yet caring portrayal in voicing Gill, who tries to keep a lookout for Nemo. I especially enjoyed seeing the every day human traits and dialog being acted out in these sea creatures, making the movie that much funnier. In addition, the music score from Thomas Newman is quite spirited and the animation team did a spectacular job in capturing the splendor of the sea.

I thought, though, the story goes too fast at times, leaving little room for the audience to generate sympathy during the more tense and solemn moments, and I thought some of the characters acted a little too excited. But overall, it's a very fun and heartwarming Disney tale that is great for the entire family!

7 October 2013,'Sea' It to Believe It.,"Marking the biggest leap for Pixar Animation Studios since their groundbreaking debut with Toy Story in 1995, Finding Nemo brings a whole new level of maturity in Pixar's method of storytelling, a new surge in its humour, creativity & imagination, and another elevation in its already unparalleled animation to succeed not only as one of the best films of its genre but is also exceptional enough to be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.

Finding Nemo tells the story of Marlin; a clownfish residing in the Great Barrier Reef who's very overprotective of his son, Nemo. When Nemo is captured by scuba divers & taken to Sydney, Marlin sets out on a journey throughout the ocean to find his son, is joined by Dory; an optimistic blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss, encounters many more dangers & adventures and in the process, learns to appreciate life a lot more than ever before.

Directed by Andrew Stanton, Finding Nemo is drop-dead gorgeous from the first frame to the last, is crafted with immense care, passion & love, has a surprising level of depth in its story, is filled with characters that are rich, charismatic & colourful, captures ocean life unlike ever before in cinema history, brims with clever use of humour, expertly balances its storytelling aspects with jaw-dropping animation and has something in store for viewers of all ages.

It's pretty evident from its presentation that Pixar's production design team did a massive amount of research before animating it on the film canvas, the camera-work is jubilantly carried out & fills the screen with vivid colours. Editing makes sure every single scene plays a relevant role in pushing its story forward & steadily paces its 100 minutes of runtime while Thomas Newman's score makes the whole experience all the more touching, mesmerising & emotionally resonant.

The level of precision, sharpness & detailing in its animation is no short of an achievement, every single character is skilfully drawn & rendered whether it's the shark, whale, turtles or jellyfish, and is perfectly voiced by its terrific voice cast. And while everyone shines in their given roles, it's Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who turns out to be the show-stealer for she is without a doubt one of the most optimistic characters to surface on the silver screen.

On an overall scale, Finding Nemo is love at first sight. It's a stunning, bewitching, magical, emotionally rich & truly unforgettable cinema that has a lot to say about parenting, friendship, trust & determination and sets a higher benchmark for its genre. One of Pixar's biggest home-runs on critical, commercial & emotional scale, Finding Nemo is a spellbinding underwater adventure that you'll want to experience again n again. 'Sea' it to believe it.",
16 April 2014,A breathtaking adventure that you can watch again and again,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
7 March 2017,"""Nice""","There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much. First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun. Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old. Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them. ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception to any of those categories.

For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks). As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.

Visually, ""Finding Nemo"" is stunning. Watching it on blu-ray is truly a visual treat, with the underwater landscapes and their various colors making this effort perhaps the best-looking Pixar flick ever.

In terms of humor, ""Nemo"" has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling. It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.

The main plot line--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.

Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors. Though nothing may ever quite top ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"" belongs on that ""1-B"" slot right along with ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"".",10

8 April 2022,One of Pixar's best,"This is absolutely one of Pixar's best films. Having rewatched the four films they released prior to this previously,

I can also say that this is their first film with 100% flawlessly aged animation. There's a few janky moments in their earlier stuff, and maybe a few nitpicks when it comes to the animation in Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc, but Finding Nemo looks great from start to finish, with amazing water effects, great character animation, and tons of variety in all the environments.

The characters are all fun and almost every single scene is memorable. I also love the music, and the way its emotional impact kind of sneaks up on you. As great and as sad as the most moving scenes in Toy Story 2 and Up are (to take two examples), Finding Nemo feels a little more subtle in how moving it is. After the opening scene, it doesn't really hit until the end, and that sense of making an audience feel something without being direct/obvious about it is something Pixar doesn't do a lot (I'd say they kind of do it in Wall-E too, which funnily enough has the same director as Finding Nemo).

After Toy Story 2, this is my favourite of Pixar's first five films, and I think it's close to perfect, even now, some 20 years after release. A near masterpiece, and it remains just as funny, fun, imaginative, and moving as it was back in 2003.",9
23 May 2021,"A spiral of unlimited fun, a mind-blowing adventure, and an ode to everyone who does not give up looking for the most important aspect of life: the love of the family","Apparently, Pixar wizards love challenges: after the Toy Story and Toy Story 2 dolls, the Insect Life ants and the Monsters SA creatures (including the extremely difficult task of animating Sulley's millions of hairs), the artists from the company led by John Lasseter decided to set their new work in one of the most complicated environments in digital animation: water. The result, fortunately, is a colossal technical victory: in addition to being totally credible, the ocean seen in Finding Nemo offers Pixar artists the opportunity to prove (once again) their visual accuracy, since the extremely complicated underwater photography is beautiful, with amazing lighting effects.

When Finding Nemo begins, we are introduced to the happy couple of clown fishes formed by Marlin and Coral, who have just moved, alongside their hundreds of roe, to an anemone with a 'panoramic' view of the (bottom of) the ocean. Unfortunately, a predator's attack results in the death of practically all of Marlin's family, leaving him a widower and with little Nemo to raise - something that turns him into an overprotective father. Thus, it is with great terror that, one day, the poor fish sees his son being caught by fishermen and taken to an aquarium. Determined to rescue Nemo, Marlin embarks on a risky journey in search of the goldfish, being helped by the friendly Dory - who, unfortunately, has a very serious memory problem.

As it has already become standard in Pixar's productions, Finding Nemo immerses the viewer (pardoning the pun) in a multicolored and nuanced universe: inhabited by an infinity of cute creatures (and others not so much), the ocean seen here has their own versions of road signs, highways and even support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. Filling every inch of the screen with details that reveal admirable preciousness, the team of animators pays particular attention to the elaboration of their characters' facial expressions, transforming them into fun and charismatic figures - notice, for example, the changes in the face of the turtle Crush while you talk to Marlin and also observe the look of pride that appears on Nemo's face when he hears a certain news about his father. At times like these, the expressiveness of the characters is such that the dialogues become even dispensable.

Like all good animation, Finding Nemo presents us with a tale in which family and friendship relationships are the safe haven of its main characters. But this question, which can be considered (in fact it is) cliché, is treated in such a beautiful, fun and extremely intelligent way that one cannot fail to notice the numerous parallels with the reality of the spectators, whether children or adults. This is where the film differentiates itself from the others and shows its maturity. The work is a pearl from Pixar that focuses precisely on the concept of family and how much we are willing to risk when fighting for our family. It is a sweet tale, full of adventure, suspense and a genius humor that leaves us absolutely amazed. It is not just a movie for children, on the contrary. Morality is very adult and the teachings that come from the film illustrate that we should never judge a ""book by its cover"" or give up on those that are most important to us. Something that, in adults, we value much more than at a young age.

In addition, Finding Nemo also includes some curiously complex subtexts: the title character's 'fin of luck', for example, is a clear reference to the physically challenged - and brings a beautiful message about the way they face the obstacles that arise in their lives. No less complex is the relationship between Marlin and his son - something that is summed up in a very sensitive way by Dory: 'If you insist on protecting him in this way, nothing will happen to him. On the other hand, nothing is going to happen to him'. And while Pixar's previous work relied on his dramatic moments, none of them ever reached the intensity of the scene in which Marlin swims across the ocean screaming, desperately, 'My son! My son! '.

Even though Finding Nemo is an animation film mostly centered on a banal theme, it is the way it combines the elements by providing an excellent evening for the family, which makes it so genuine and so adorable. It is a tale about challenges, about loss, abandonment and above all about reunion, love and companionship. The characters are striking, with strong human traits, which give children a perspective on how they will become when they are adults, recognizing the unconditional value that the family has for all of us.

Getting the audience to see themselves in these little fish was the director's first step. The second was to create a world in which the audience could dive, achieving this through an art direction that lives up to the spectacular double between human creativity and the biological diversity of the ocean. What also makes ""Nemo"" timeless is director Andrew Stanton's talent for combining magnificent visuals and exotic worlds with extremely human themes. The fights between Marlin and Nemo can occur anywhere and the public can easily identify with the positions taken by both characters. In this, neither of them sounds, at any time, unsympathetic, but flawed as either. However, unlike, for example, Bryan Mills in the first ""Relentless Quest"", our protagonist is an absolutely ordinary father, not the king of the seven seas or even a heroic action animal. Meanwhile, Nemo experiences his own dilemmas and difficulties at the aquarium, with David Ian Salter's montage skillfully switching between the two narrative lines.

On the other hand, Finding Nemo cannot escape its road movie structure (or should I say 'ocean movie'?) And, unfortunately, allows that to make it episodic and irregular. Developing parallel actions (Marlin's search and Nemo's escape attempt), the film jumps from one narrative to another always in a similar way, abusing, for example, the fade-outs (screen blackouts) that illustrate the characters' fainting. As a result, the rhythm of the story cannot be as constant as that of most of Pixar's previous work.

As for the pace and dramatic appeal, we shouldn't worry: for every dramatic incident seen in Finding Nemo there are countless other comic reliefs to balance things out: in addition to the jokes involving Dory's memory, the film's script features very inspiring scenes involving three sharks who struggle to improve the public image of the species; a school with a talent for imitation; a group of 'surfing' turtles; and, of course, curious jokes throughout the final credits. The production also includes several hilarious references to works by Hitchcock (the little girl Darla, who could be considered a female version of Sid from Toy Story, is always accompanied by the theme of Psychosis) and adventures such as Mission: Impossible (the plan Gil's escape route is tragically funny).

Navigating an ocean of creative possibilities, ""Finding Nemo"" features incredible catchphrases (""keep swimming"", ""worm u-ha-ha""), hilarious situations (vegetarian sharks and hippy turtles) and a range of memorable fish (the aquarium dentist has one of the best Pixar groups). And although the journey in search of the young clownfish is the main adornment of the narrative, it is in Dory that we find the most fun portion of the story. Dory literally has a fish memory. He forgets what he is going to say or do with frightening frequency. And, despite the comic aspect, it is when she teaches us to speak ""whale"" that brings us to tears from laughing so much. It is amazing how both the North American version and the Portuguese version manage to highlight the inevitable perfection of the character. Both Ellen DeGeneres and Rita Blanco are adept at bringing this fish so adorably comical. Dory's success was so acclaimed by critics and fans that she was entitled to her own feature film.

The interesting thing is also how Nemo and Merlin's trajectory grows, far from each other, makes both grow. In his search for Nemo, Marlin ends up meeting different groups of sea animals that show him how to be more open, not only towards his son, but also towards new friends. The clownfish, in fact, has nothing funny (one of the big draws in the film), because with the trauma of the loss he ended up totally reclusive. Situation begins to change as he enjoys the presence of the clumsy Dory (a spectacular dubbing work by Ellen DeGeneres, as good as what Robin Williams did for the Lamp Genie in Aladdin, 1992), enhanced when Marlin almost loses his friend burned by a gigantic group of jellyfish.

Everyone knows the end of the story, even if they haven't seen the movie. What counts here is not the outcome (which, although not original, can be treated with dignity), but the trajectory and evolution of its characters. Even if Dory says at any time, ""Nemo? Cool name!"", Finding Nemo is not just above average fun, but a subtle way of thinking about the complexity of educating a child and, at the same time, treating this growth in a light way. With a simple, well-intentioned humor, affectionate animation and delicious characters, Finding Nemo is one of the best productions to date at Pixar. A timeless animated classic with a sweet message and its own vision of the concept of family and how much it means to us. It is a spiral of unlimited fun, a mind-blowing adventure, and an ode to everyone who does not give up looking for the most important aspect of life: the love of the family.",8

26 February 2004,Pixar goes to the fishes,"This is a good film but overrated. There, I said it.

This was just too reminiscent of when 'Shrek' first hit the screens, in 2001  the 3D animation everyone was going gaga over, repeatedly hailing as the greatest animated movie ever, and yet didn't really impress me all that much. Seemingly, I was the only person on the planet to feel that way. I didn't really 'get' 'Shrek', don't especially 'get' it even now, and for some reason I didn't quite manage to 'get' 'Finding Nemo' either, the next 3D film to get the 'greatest animated movie' ever proclamation, in spite of the fact that I was really, really determined to kick off my socks and enjoy this one. Well, it's cute and it's colourful, and the idea of a father clownfish (named Marlin) trekking the ocean to be reunited with his missing son (named, oddly enough, Nemo) is a nice one for sure, but there was just something about it which left me feeling strangely unsatisfied. All in all it's a worthy venture for the Pixar cabinet, visually gorgeous and with a handful of effective moments, but seriously, they have done better.

The main problem comes in the story structure, which is too rambling and disjointed to do it for me. I actually agree with another viewer who commented that it felt more like that of a multi-levelled video game than a movie. All it really involves is Marlin swimming along and avoiding getting chomped by dangerous sea-dwelling predator after sea-dwelling predator. We meet plenty of interesting characters along the way, but the nature of the story means that they're removed from the action within minutes. For example, the trio of sinister but slow-witted sharks struggling to go veggie, who have a lot less screen time than the promotional posters and trailers might imply and are never given the chance to amount to much more than a few time-filling wisecracks. Nigel the pelican, in spite of Geoffrey Rush's spunky voicing, is a mostly bland character whose motives for befriending and assisting the fish are left conveniently unspoken (after all, naturally he's another sea-dwelling predator himself), and I found the surfer turtles just a tad annoying (particularly the young ones  call me heartless, but bleh!).

Another pretty nagging drawback is that neither protagonist, be it Marlin or Nemo, is nearly as sympathetic as past Pixar creations like Woody or Sulley. Marlin is too whiny to be truly likable, and Nemo doesn't really get the great deal of development you'd usually expect in a title character. The script is notably also less sharp than previous Pixar instalments. There was one scene in the dentist's waiting room which had me in stitches, but that was about it. It's mostly just movie in-jokes for most of the time. While in 'Toy Story' the various nods to other movies were little more than subtle extras for the sharp-eyed viewer to enjoy alongside a script brimming with plenty of witty gags of its own, they're pretty much integral to this screenplay. 'Finding Nemo' suffers from the same 'self-indulgent movie spoof' syndrome that you can find in most 3D animation from the Dreamworks stable, with a slew of constant parodies (that most of us have already seen at some point in 'the Simpsons') substituting for real humour. Usually, Pixar are always one step ahead of their rivals in this respect, but this time round even they were unable to resist succumbing to it.

There are certain aspects of 'Finding Nemo' that I liked. For example, Dory, the regal blue tang who trails Marlin insistently on his travels  technically she's as 2D as everyone else in this flick, her whole character consisting of little more than the one-joke comedy gimmick that she suffers from short term memory loss and can never remember quite what she's doing. There's so much potential here to be annoying, but somehow she manages to pull through and, against the odds, prove a surprisingly charming character throughout. Perhaps it comes down to Ellen DeGenere's brilliant voice work. Also, I like it that the standard comic relief sidekick can finally be female, and that Marlin and Dory manage to maintain an entirely platonic relationship throughout (no token love interests here).

But the most interesting character by far is William Dafoe's hard-bitten Moorish idol, Gill  he's given some hints of a personal history, yet it goes curiously understated throughout. Many of the 'Tank Gang' sequences seem pretty out of place (what does the welcome ritual have to add to the story, other than establishing the existence of that bubble volcano?), but nonetheless, some of the dialogue exchanged between Gill and Nemo is quite nice and add a sprinkling of depth to a film which I otherwise found to be just a little toohollow?

Plus, the sight of an angler fish caught up in a pair of diving goggles is unexpectedly alluring - still, the poor, poor creature ;)

'Finding Nemo' isn't a bad film by any means. In fact, it's pretty darn good. But Pixar have made other movies which, ironically, could blow this clean out of the water. In short, it's sweet and pleasant but  there's that word again - overrated.

30 November 2005,Great adventure trip for all kids and family,"I have to admit that I have been positively surprised and congratulations to all the stuff that helped to making alive the fishes and birds. My three old year son says ""again, again"". Yeah, he liked it too of course and so my wife. The story has many original twists and plots packed in a solid and entertaining adventure trip. But the most I liked was the real special effects and the very clear animation that makes very believable that these fishes are real. Therefore some scenes could have been cut because they were too slow paced and unnecessary but this is not a problem. If you want to spend an unforgettable moment with your kids and family then you shouldn't miss it. Fasten your seat belts and enjoy it. 7/10.

17 January 2023,Nemo Brings the Joy & Laughter,"I had modest expectations going into my viewing of Finding Nemo, and those expectations were completely upended by this totally charming film. All of the performances are on-point, DeGeneres in particular shines bright. I won't rehash the story specifics here as that's already been done by many others but I will say that for the most part Finding Nemo moves along at a brisk pace as we follow a clown fish's journey to find his lost son. Along the way we meet many interesting characters and unique and dazzling sea creatures. In the end it's a fun adventure film with lots of heart and very much worth checking out.

6 April 2004,Pixar's own Jaws...not focusing on the shark,"Pixar Studios is one of the world's most exciting and cool film studios. They deliver every single time for the whole family; fun, dramatic, brilliance, entertainment, moral...everything! Before this instalment Pixar has given us TOY STORY 1/2, A BUG'S LIFE and MONSTERS INC. that's all extremely good films! This, last one, FINDING NEMO is just as jolly good!

We follow Marlin, a clown-fish that's on a desperat look for his only child, Nemo, that as said before is the only survivor after their family was brutally attacked by a barracuda and almost everybody were eaten. Marlin hooks up with another fish that shows herself to have extremely bad memory and forgets thing almost before she's get to know them! Now, these two goes on the search of Nemo, who's lost in the big blue ocean, where there are sharks, bombs, whales, birds and much more!

The story is this time probably the best detail, off course together with the humour that is also brilliant fun! It is packed with funny scenes and the animation is getting more and more stunning, the dialogs are brilliant, everything works as good as it gets! Dozens of genius characters are packed into this story. It is a very choosy movie and it keeps up it's entertainment in a very fine way, the only thing that's something to put anything on is the end, that's really nothing. But the rest of the movie is pure entertainment and is very, very nice watching!

FINDING NEMO's got entire scenes. Like the one with the three sharks that has decided to form a club where they have to promise that they shall not eat other fishes, cause that's cannibalism. Either it's small characters or big, they're all over the place! You laugh a lot, and if it isn't funny, it's just so entertaining or nice made that you can't keep your eyes off the screen. As the movie goes by you feel a small piece of boring in the middle, but FINDING NEMO fixes it with smacking some more characters and keeping the tempo up and keeping the paralell - story interesting with Nemo actually being caught in a aquarium together with other fishes.

STARS: 5/5",10
26 November 2014,A sequel very much welcome!,"Disney/Pixar blockbuster about Nemo (Gould)—the only surviving clownfish in a clutch of eggs and born with a small right-fin—going missing and his father Marlin (Brooks) swimming all the way to Sydney to find him. Dafoe is perfect as Gill, a moorish idol, and DeGeneres is a nice touch as Dory, a Pacific regal blue tang, even with her cheap jokes of forgetfulness; and let's not forget Stanton as Crush, a green sea turtle. Especially fun for fish-enthusiasts. The scenes taking place in the dentist office aquarium are priceless! A sequel very much welcome!!

8 December 2012,It's alright but just didn't seem all that special,"I remember the first time I saw this Pixar movie when it first came out when I was in elementary school. I thought it was alright back then but nothing special. And didn't have the impact on me during my childhood like the movie ""Lion King"" or the first ""Toy Story"" did. Didn't think it was a bad film back then but wasn't enthusiastic about it to the point I wanted to see it a second time. Now seeing it again as an adult in 3D my opinions about this movie is still about the same but I appreciate it a bit more. So the story is about a Clown fish that loses his only son and he goes across the ocean with a friend fish named Dory played by Ellen DeGeneres. Who did a amazing job with her role, in fact her character stood out the most in the whole movie. And through the journey it shows what Nemo is going through after being captured by the humans but mostly shows Nemo's dad's journey with clever fish scenarios thrown in different areas. And the clever scenarios mixed in with different fishes is what drives this movie. Overall it was a alright movie and you can tell quite a bit of effort has been thrown into this animated flick. But it didn't really have that impact to make it all that memorable.

25 August 2022,A masterpiece until this day.,"Additionally, it adds an unexpected element of beauty through its use of color and form, making it one of the rare films that made me want to sit in the front row and allow the images to fill the rest of my vision. The majority of the film is set in the colorful underwater world of tropical fish, on a shallow warm-water shelf not far from Australia. Even without the story, the use of color, form, and movement makes the movie a delight.

15 January 2023,My favorite Pixar film,"Finding Nemo may be my favorite Pixar movie. I've first seen it as a kid in 2003, and I instantly got obsessed with it and I've watched it numerous times.

Finding Nemo is about a clownfish named Marlin and his son Nemo living in the ocean. Nemo is then captured by us humans, and Marlin is desperate to find his son, who is ""imprisoned"" in an aquarium in a dental clinic in Australia.

The characters are perfectly voiced by Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould. Ellen is also charming as the voice of the hilarious Blue Hippo Tang with short-term memory loss named Dory. The movie is animated beautifully with a moving soundtrack composed by Thomas Newman.

Finding Nemo is an unforgettable film that will still capture the hearts of many in the years to come.",10
14 July 2005,Finding Nemo,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
18 July 2006,An animated film with both Pixar and Disney qualities,"Finding Nemo can be seen as the bridge between Pixar Studios and Walt Disney Studios. It is the result of filmmakers and crew meeting halfway on this bridge and including aspects from both production companies and making it work. Finding Nemo brings some of the adult humour of Pixar (as seen in Ice Age, Monsters inc, etc) and combines it with the morals and lessons that Disney wants to teach (as seen inuh.. every Disney film).

While it would be more than OK with me to simply omit the latter in animated features to leave room for comedy and nice visuals, I see at least some faint need for moral statements as films like this primarily cater to children. These kinds of morals and values lessons are thankfully kept to a minimum in Finding Nemo - but they are present and they do drag the film down on occasion.

Finding Nemo tells the story of a widowed clownfish named Marlin who frequently goes overboard trying to protect his only living son, Nemo, from the dangers and non-dangers of the ocean world. One day, Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and Marlin, devastated, is left to face his own fears to go and find Nemo.

Finding Nemo is an ocean ride with superb animations of sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans. The film parodies human behavior by creating an ocean world that greatly reflects our own (crayfish mowing their lawns, sting-rays as teachers). At the same time it brings some of nature in. I loved the sea gulls more than anything because they are seen in such great contrast to Marlin who is so human; he is complex, thinking and refined. The gulls are simply ""rat with wings"" in this film and are portrayed as such. Totally brainless creatures but providers of the greatest comedy in Finding Nemo. So it is not only Disney and Pixar meeting halfway, but nature and human behavior meeting halfway too.

This is probably the closest (aside from maybe The Emperor's New Groove) Disney has come to making an adult-humoured animated film - and they needed Pixar to do it. 7/10",7
30 September 2014,A timeless animated delight!!!!!!,"In this stunning underwater adventure, with memorable characters, humor and heartfelt emotion, Finding Nemo follows the comedic and momentous journey of an overly protective clownfish named Marlin (voice by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (voice by Alexander Gould) -- who become separated in the Great Barrier Reef when Nemo is unexpectedly taken far from his ocean home and dumped into a fish tank in a dentist's office. Buoyed by the companionship of Dory (voice by Ellen DeGeneres), a friendly-but-forgetful Pacific regal blue tang, Marlin embarks on a dangerous trek and finds himself the unlikely hero of an epic effort to rescue his son -- who hatches a few daring plans of his own to return safely home.

19 March 2021,Just keep swimming..,"An enchanting experience. Kids probably will really enjoy it but for teens and adults I dunno it might be a mixed bag, It was good that I saw the movie and I enjoyed it but FOR ME it was nothing too crazy or special. And the first time I saw this film was when I was 6-7 so I ain't biased or anything it's more of a nostalgia feeling for me.

Solid story filled with character exposition and adventure and had a lot of positive messages to it. There were a ton of characters actually most of them being side characters but somehow they manage to make them interesting and unique. The dynamic between father and son, Dory the short term memory fish, and the short screentime for the turtules were hilarious. The visuals were great considering the time it came out in. The animal's design, the habitats, etc. The music really matched with the movie and had great voice acting.

Overall an enjoyable film.

23 May 2021,Starts out slow but does Get better.,"When the film started I honestly was kinda bummed and thought this film was just another overrated nonsense. The whole Nemo getting lost thing seemed kinda forced. An overprotective father causing his son to get annoyed and in turn disobey him which eventually leads him to get trapped by a diver felt annoying because all this feels like it could have easily been avoided. But then in order to enjoy it I thought it would be best to ignore that part and to watch the rest of the movie with an open mind. As the film progresses I find myself actually engrossed and enjoying the scenes as they come along. The new characters, Dory, shark, turtles, etc. Are introduced who are quite fun and interesting. The shark part was a bit unnecessary though. They could've kept it as a friendly shark or something, but the bloodshed was too much I feel since it is a kids movie.

The last 45 minutes of the film are the best as we are taken out of the ocean for a breath of fresh air and are in a search for Nemo. The dentist scenes are the funniest part of the movie and the little cruel girl haha is the highlight for me as it is during her scenes that I found myself laughing the most. It's a pretty cool story and the way the fishies in the tank act to Help Nemo return back to the ocean is pretty wholesome and sends out a good message to kids.

It's really impressive how fine the animation is in a film released in '03. It's just beautiful to look at and especially the scenes that are outside the water.

Extremely beautiful film. You may feel bored or annoyed I the start but it just gets so much better and ends on a high note.",8
17 November 2022,Still a Perfect Film,"An overprotective father attempts to find his kidnapped son, all the while learning about what it means to have a real relationship built on trust and mutual understanding.

This movie feels perfect still today. No line or moment feels wasted. The film is perfectly entertaining. Every character feels real, fleshed out, and developed. For a movie about talking fish, it is surprising grounded in real human experiences and emotions.

I would be hard pressed to find someone who would actively dislike this movie. It is a film that captures the complexities, joys, and sorrows of being human in a way that speaks to adults and children.

23 January 2023,A Masterpiece Dive into the 'Finding Nemo' Adventure,"""Finding Nemo"" is a heartwarming and visually stunning film that tells the story of a timid clownfish named Nemo who gets captured by a diver and taken to an aquarium in a dentist's office. Along with the help of a forgetful fish named Dory and a host of other sea creatures, Nemo's father, Marlin, sets out on a journey to find and rescue his son.

One of the strongest aspects of ""Finding Nemo"" is its animation. The film's use of color and detail brings the ocean to life in a way that is both beautiful and believable. The characters are also incredibly well-developed and likable, with Nemo's struggles to find his courage and Marlin's overprotective nature leading to both comedic and emotional moments.

The film's themes of family, friendship, and determination are expertly woven into the story, making ""Finding Nemo"" not only a visually stunning film, but also a poignant and relatable one. It's a film that can be enjoyed by both children and adults alike, and is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good adventure story.

""Finding Nemo"" is a classic that will be enjoyed by all ages, with a story that will make you laugh, cry and leave you feeling inspired.",8

21 March 2004,Finding it distressing...,"Hmm, let's start with the death of a mother fish, an overprotective, wimpy father fish, jr. fish who says ""I hate you"", then have jr. kidnapped. And all in the first five minutes! Throw in big, scary fish and tons of melodramatic search and rescue action, and you've got...a ""kids"" movie?? They don't know any better, so this becomes their only alternative at the theater, which in turn makes it three hundred million dollars. Usually these family films pack jokes for the older crowd that only they'd understand to keep them awake, along with the kiddie stuff. Not here. No fun of ""Toy Story"", with characters and imaginitive action passages to keep you engrossed. Here we're saddled with a dull hero (voice of Brooks), a quickly annoying ""dumb funny"" fish (voice of DeGeneres) and a slew of not even recognizable celebrity voices who you'd be hard pressed to guess who it is. The only, only, plus is the always reliable Pixar imagery, colorful and striking. Otherwise, run. ""Nemo! Nemo! Nemo!"" Shuddup and get me outta here!

31 March 2015,An Underwater Treasure!,"Pixar's animation wonder Finding Nemo, is a shimmery, velvety undersea coming-of-age story which is aglow with translucent sea flora and gleaming, iridescent creatures. Australia's Great Barrier Reef provides a stunning starting point for this aquatic parable. Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a spunky little clown-fish with a slight disability - a foreshortened front fin. Nemo's single father, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a dry, wry clown-fish with an excess of anxiety (He is also a clown who can't tell a joke, though he keeps trying to do so quite hilariously). Despite Marlin's suffocating attention, his small fry is scooped up by a scuba diving dentist and gets separated from his father. Determined not to lose his son, Marlin begins a long, arduous albeit seemingly hopeless rescue mission across the sea and soon bumps into an overly exuberant, sweetly scatterbrained regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). They search for Nemo together in the face of stinging jellyfish, exploding mines, noxious sharks and other irritable flounders. In the meantime, Nemo makes some very good friends in the dentist's aquarium, including a tiger fish (Willem Dafoe) who helps him plan an escape. From then on, it's a relentless journey of visual excitement and wonder, as the distraught father sets off to rescue his offspring and Nemo finds ways to escape from the aquarium. As is mandatory for a family film, there are plenty of life lessons for kids to learn, but they come sugar-coated with humor and fun. Meanwhile, a more adult undercurrent offers grown-up laughs, and there's even some old-fashioned tear-jerking to complete the emotional roller-coaster ride.

Andrew Stanton plays the viewer like a fiddle, and it's a privilege to be played. Its animation is truly stunning, awash (pun intended) in a dazzling array of colors and creating the impression of a living, breathing sea. Every moment is magnificently orchestrated to tease a response from us - anything from awe to aw-shucks. Yes, it's a visual feast, but more importantly it's an epic journey filled with adventure and discovery that encompasses the grandest sweep of the ocean's vastness and the tiniest longing of the heart. While preserving the characters' intrinsic ""fishy-ness"", the silver- tongued voice cast offers great supplementary texture to a marvelous sensory experience. While Brooks is amusing as the ever fretful Marlin, it is DeGeneres who gives a bravura comic performance as the guileless but whacked-out Dory. Ceaselessly forgetful, her endearing Dory makes a difficult traveling companion but a scintillating friend – Dory is a complete hoot.

Instead of rising to a challenge, Finding Nemo plunges into it and comes up a winner. All in all, a buoyant adventure that manages to evoke the quicksilver trait of the ocean without necessarily feeling 'wet'!",10
4 March 2005,Mine! Mine! Mine!,"""Finding Nemo"" is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful films you are ever likely to see. Next time you watch it, try this for an idea. Press your mute button and watch it without sound for a while, particularly the scene where Mr.Ray (Bob Peterson) takes all the little fish, including Nemo (Alexander Gould), through the coral reef towards the infamous drop off. It's still as enjoyable!

The film starts off quite darkly, which is odd considering the nature of the rest of the film - quite light-hearted. It is, however, an essential part of the story, explaining how the fear of Marlin (Albert Brooks) towards the ocean came about, and also as a result the over-protectiveness he has over his son, Nemo.

The storyline itself is pretty simple: Nemo gets captured by a scuba-diving dentist, Marlin swims off to rescue him. What helps the story is the many different and fantastic characters that he meets along the way to ""P Sherman, 42 Wallabe Way, Sydney"". This is of course where he meets the fantastic Dory (played here brilliantly by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory is quite possibly one of the funniest characters in a Pixar movie EVER. Her short-term memory loss is an inspired comedic characteristic that results in some great lines. For example:

""It (the memory problem) runs in my family. At least I think it does. Hmm. Where are they? Can I help you?""

There are other good characters in this story, though. there are the three friendly sharks, whose motto is ""Fish are friends, not food"". This proves to be their undoing, particularly Bruce's (Barry Humphries - you know, Dame Edna Everage?), resulting in a good chase sequence through a sunken submarine and mine field. We have the school of fish who enjoy making exciting 3d moving pictures (voiced singularly by John Ratzenberger, Pixar's lucky mascot). And of course you cannot forget the ""Righteous! Righteous!"" sea turtles.

Nemo meets interesting characters in the dentist's aquarium as well, including Gill (Willhelm Daefoe), who is constantly trying to get back into the ocean from whence he came. The rest are all pretty much bonkers - a cleanliness obsessed fish, a smelly blowfish, and a schizophrenic fish whose ""sister"", Flo, appears every time she looks through the glass of the aquarium.

Finally we have the non-swimming characters. The dentist is probably responsible for the scene where more people became scared of them then Laurence Olivier's performance in ""Marathon Man"". His removal of the tooth of the ""Prime Minister"" is a great line that doesn't register first time around. This is probably because Nigel (Geforry Rush) has just crashed into the window. Very funny, and also a rather interestingly detailed knowledge of dentistry. Finally there is the movie's token ""villain"" of sorts - Darla, the dentist's niece, and now famous for been associated with the ""Psycho"" theme for young people.

The movie is enjoyable every time you watch it. Throughout it we see the change in attitude towards the ocean in Marlin's behaviour and dialog, and Dory is always there beside him to provide yet another witty comment. (My girlfriend particularly likes the one about men asking for directions). It is also interesting to note that the final opponent to the success of this magnificent quest is humans themselves - in this case, fishermen. Just as in ""Bambi"" with the hunter and his mother - sniff - we are portrayed as heartless predators who are tampering with the beauty of nature. The fact that there is no dialogue or anything at all characteristic about the two fishermen makes the anonymity of them even more sinister.

Overall, a brilliant movie. Watch it. Watch it again. It rocks! And remember, ""just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming...""

10 February 2023,Adorable,"Finding Nemo is a light-hearted cartoon that any audience would appreciate. The film tells of a fish (Nemo) who is abducted from the Great Barrier Reef and the quest of a bunch of fish to find Nemo.

There's some humour elements that are relatable to both kids and adults. I've watched this film several times. I am also an avid snorkeler and can't help but find myself looking for some of the characters in the water.

It's a beautifully crafted film with some expert voice acting, great visuals for its time and a musical score that I still listen to periodically. Please watch this if you haven't already!

26 January 2016,Yet another Pixar classic,"Upon its release Finding Nemo solidified Pixar's position as the masters of animation. Just like they did with Toy Story, they'd crafted another fine film that was packed with everything for children and adults alike. On a technical level it is a masterclass, but it also provided a flowing story and a wide variety of characters that it was easy to get invested in. The story concerns overprotective clown fish Marlin whose son Nemo is taken by divers and he then purses them across the ocean. Along the way he meets a fish with short-term memory loss named Dory, sharks who have quit eating fish and a party of sea turtles. The film is effectively Marlin's journey and the colourful characters he meets who help him on his way, whilst Nemo tries to escape from the dentist fish-tank that he's ended up in. The story is straight-forward, but it is packed with so much emotion and excitement that it works to its advantage.

The plot works like a road trip movie, we continually come across some colourful characters and we move on, except that there is a goal to achieve at the end of it all. What really makes the story work is that it addresses the connection between a father and son as well as knowing when it's time to let your son have his own adventures. This helps give the film a strong emotional centre not just for the turmoil that Marlin and Nemo have been put through, but also for Dory who simply wants someone to stand by her. Working with the plot is the animation which is truly superb, some of Pixar's most impressive. The ocean can look both overwhelmingly beautiful and incredibly dangerous, while they really capture the vastness of the deep seas pretty perfectly. The colour scheme is also wonderful, everything from the bright character designs to the coral reef simply leaps off the screen in a wash of beauty.

With that said, it's the characters that truly make the film shine. Marlin is a typically anxious and neurotic father, but he's never a stick in the mud. He always appears to be very genuine and the journey he's willing to undertake for his son makes him so likable. Dory (a brilliant Ellen DeGeneres) makes a fantastic companion. You'd think her memory loss would get annoying but it's kept fresh thanks to her bright sense of humour and her almost childlike wonder at the world which is surprisingly endearing. Nemo is a pleasant innocent and his enthusiasm is charming, whilst the tank gang are all very enjoyable especially the mysterious Gill. I also enjoyed the tanks pelican friend Nigel and the three sharks that come together like an AA meeting to discuss giving up fish. Virtually all of these characters are different and memorable, having interesting designs and distinctive personalities.

Another big positive is the score by Thomas Newman. It is simply lovely. It manages to convey the wide-eyed wonder of the underwater world beautifully thanks to the gorgeous melodies and soothing compositions. There's a real sense of adventure to it that brings you into the ocean world even more and it manages to heighten the excitement at times perfectly. The film also has many memorable lines and inspired comedic pieces. Many of these were so successful that they are now widely known in pop culture, whether it the seagulls constantly repeating ''Mine!'' or the tanks outrageous escape plan. To be fair to it, the film has very few weaknesses. The lack of an over-arching villain isn't an issue because of the type of film it is and both stories are given the perfect amount of screen time.

It's fair to say that Finding Nemo is up there with Pixar's best films. It excels in pretty much every area that matters because it does what Pixar does best, which is craft a gripping adventure that is packed with plenty of comedy and emotion. This is a story that is very easy to be engaged in and the massive amount of characters all manage to get enough development. So when the two key areas are as strong as they are here then the film is already on the right road. Adding to that, the animation is some of Pixar's most expressive, the score is wonderful and the film is simply very memorable. There is just something so gripping and rather timeless about the films approach that makes it such a success.",8
18 January 2004,One of the great animated films,"`Finding Nemo' is one of the best, perhaps THE best, animated films ever made  in a class with the Disney masterpieces, `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' `Pinocchio,' and `Bambi.' It is gorgeous to look at, exciting, funny  often very funny  and moving. `Finding Nemo' is a great film, 10 out of 10.

24 January 2004,Amazing how fantastic computer graphics can be,"This is a great movie, and i don't see how anyone can say differently. Pixar has once again made magic using cg. I swear sometimes it is hard to see the difference between computer animations and real film. I find that especially the ocean is masterfully done. If you haven't already seen this movie, go see it now!

12 September 2008,Disney's Beautiful Achievement...,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",10
20 August 2020,Grew Up With Finding Nemo,"What can I say about Finding Nemo that hasn't been said before the script, animation as usual for a Pixar film is great and the ability to make a boring animal fish which can be hard to adapt as seen in Shark Tales in 2004. The whole story is a father-son bonding after the mother dies.

12 October 2007,"Whether you're 1 to 100, Finding Nemo is sure to please!","Finding Nemo, Pixar's best yet. Stunning visuals, a great star cast to voice it, an original and heartwarming story, and amazing humour. What more could you want!? Every character plays an important part in Finding Nemo, as opposed to movies that focus on the protagonists. The star cast that voiced this film were purely perfect, e.g. Ellen DeGeneres for Dory! That was absolutely brilliant! She steals the show!

Finding Nemo, has what some Pixar/Disney films don't have. And that is morals. They aren't forced into you, they're very subtle, but they are strong enough to keep you thinking and to make an impact on you - which I think is fabulous. The moral is: Loving your kids is great...over-loving them isn't. A moral like this makes sense for the present and I'm sure many young people would understand and relate.

The film also defines ""universal"". Many universal films you see have a couple of drops of crude humour, its harmless, as its too little for young kids to understand, but it's still there. Finding Nemo is completely clean, squeaky clean in fact.

Whether you're 1 or 100, Finding Nemo is sure to please. This one is definitely a must watch.

Watch it! I command you!",
30 August 2003,A gem.,"Hands down - this is the best movie I have seen all year. These days it's rare to come across a flick that has you walking out of the theater feeling like you really did get your money's worth, Finding Nemo is one of these.

Being a late session, the entire audience consisted of teen/adult viewers and I feel confident enough to say, judging from the incredible amount of laughter, everyone enjoyed it. I certainly did.

The three major selling points. The gorgeous rendered visuals, Pixar continues to out do themselves with every film they produce. You can't help but be amazed, and if it weren't for the colorful cartoony fish darting around on screen, you would swear this was filmed live.

Secondly, the amazing voice acting, I dare say this film wouldn't have done half as well without it. You'll recognize a number of familiar voices in this film and they all do a wonderful job, but I have to say it, Ellen Degeneres completely steals the show. Her characterization of Dory had myself and the audience in stitches many a time.

Bucket loads of humor and action mixed with some drama and quiet, poignant moments all tied up with a wonderful story, the most important aspect of all. With so many animation studios releasing these days, Pixar is the *only* one that is able to get it right, creating stories with heart that are able to connect with people of all ages, on every level. The tale of Finding Nemo is an enjoyable journey from start to finish and not once did I lose interest.

I know this review is incredibly gushy and all, but I honestly cannot fault this film. I cannot wait to own it on DVD to see it again. With so much rubbish being released into cinemas, both animated and live-action, Finding Nemo is a gem. Adult, teenager, kid, whatever - do yourself a favor and go see it now.

Long live Pixar.",9
31 March 2013,I finally watched this.......,"I used to laugh when friends and girlfriends over the years watched these animated films but since I've turned into a daddy in 2008, I've sort of been forced into watching. Enough of that lets get to Finding Nemo. I LOVED it!!!!! what a great film to watch with my four year old son. It was perfect two boys watching two male fishes in search of each other. It was just a perfect viewing.I just love how the daddy of Nemo just wouldn't give up his search for his son. It was very sweet and I will say a couple tears did flow down my cheeks. My son caught the tears and said ""Daddy why are you crying"". Great stuff and a viewing experience never to be forgotten. Thanks Pixar!!!!!

23 March 2013,One of Pixar's Best,"After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home.

I do not even feel the need to write a review of this film. It is so well known, and so well loved, that I have no reason to praise it. Do I really need to convince anyone that this is a great film? Do I need to explain why?

If I had to say anything, it is that this was probably the film that got people to fall in love with Ellen Degeneres. I feel like her sitcom and subsequent talk show were popular, but not hugely so... this role probably broke her through to a wider audience and a new generation. Well done, Ellen.

23 September 2013,Another brilliant Pixar production,"When his only child Nemo (Alexander Gould) is captured by divers in the Great Barrier Reef, his extremely shy and anxiety-ridden father (Marlin) sets out on a journey to rescue him. Along the way, he meets many friends and foes, including Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with a short-term memory.

After 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' is probably the Pixar movie everyone likes to talk about. It took me ten years to watch it, but it was well worth the wait. 'Finding Nemo' is a very good film. What makes the movie so good is what has made so many other Pixar movies so good – the emotion. Yes, visually, it's brilliant (and we'll get on to that), but that Pixar crowd has this amazing ability to tell great stories.

In what has become a staple of the company, this film centres on the bond between two characters – in this case, father and son. The opening sequence is heartbreaking, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The strength of that first scene is such that we invest in the relationship Marlin and Nemo have. We believe in Marlin's fear and Nemo's rebellion. I'd argue that Pixar were able to capture that emotion with much more depth in 'Up', but this was perfectly fine for a first attempt.

More than the two leads, the show is stolen by the character of Dory. I've never seen Ellen DeGeneres act but she's extremely good with the voice. The role was supposedly written for her, and she makes the most of that opportunity. Laugh-out-loud funny at times, Dory is a delight to watch, and it's no surprise that she's the focal point of the upcoming sequel.

As with all Disney/Pixar animations, there has to be humour, and there is a lot of humour. My only problem was that, for the sake of humour, the story does get sidetracked somewhat. Marlin's desperate search for Nemo gets put on the backburner as he's shooting the breeze with turtles, or taking part in vegetarian shark meetings. Okay, so it's for kids, so maybe I shouldn't look too deeply into it, but it did irk me.

Of the Pixar movies I've seen, this isn't at the top. All three 'Toy Story' films probably trump it, and 'Up' is possibly just that bit more funnier; but, with such a strong filmography, 'Finding Nemo' coming up fifth (maybe sixth behind 'Wall-E') is not a disservice at all. Great for kids and adults, it's highly recommended.",9
31 May 2004,4 Stars!: Pixar strikes gold,"4 Stars: With a sense of imagination that only a child could have, Pixar has finally struck gold. En route to becoming the highest grossing animated movie in history, and deservedly so, Finding Nemo is a real gem for both kids and their parents. Its first move in the right direction is setting the picture underwater. Amid a previously unseen and pleasantly quirky world of spaced-out sea turtles and 12-step program sharks, the movie presents a heartwarming story about a father's search for his son. Add in witty dialogue and extroadinary performances by both Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks and you got a movie that's too good to miss.

1 June 2003,Pixar has done it again!,"Pixar Studios (with Walt Disney) has done another incredible computer-animated family film. (Their previous works were Toy Story 1 & 2 and Monsters Inc).

This one involves a clownfish (voiced by Albert Brooks) trying to find his young son who was ""captured"" by an Australian dentist for his fish tank in his office. He's ""helped"" by another fish (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who has no short-term memory.

This film is just dazzling to watch. The underwater sequences are beautiful, full of color and life. In every single case the voices match the animals perfectly. The jokes are great--they can appeal to both children and adults (my favorites were the shark being called Bruce--a reference to ""Jaws"" and DeGeneres trying to ""speak"" whale). There are some scenes that might frighten very small children involving some vicious-looking animals with big, sharp teeth--but the movie is not violent or bloody at all (it IS G rated).

Basically a really fun great film. See it!",10
16 November 2003,How the heck is this on the top 250 films?!,"OK, I went to Best Buy the day this movie was released. I just wanted to look around for some movie to watch later in the night. As I was checking out, I noticed everyone had a copy of ""Finding Nemo"". Some even had 3 copies! I couldn't believe it. So, I figured that it has to be some movie. But I knew my aunt bought the movie already, so I'll watch it with my cousins at home.

Boy! Do I regret that. Now, it was cute at times. But not as funny or amusing as ""The Lion King"". And computer effects? I'm getting sick of it. But it's for the kids, I'll let it go. But I'm looking over the top 250 films of all time, and this was on it?! Over other classic movies?! Why? All I want to know is why?! ""The Lion King"" isn't on there, but it was the most successful Disney movie. And ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Peter Pan"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"" were not on there. What the heck?!

2 June 2003,Found Classic! One of the best animated films in years!,"FINDING NEMO (2003) **** (VOICES OF: Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, Geoffrey Rush, Allison Janney, Austin Pendleton, Brad Garrett, Vicki Lewis, Stephen Root, Joe Ranft, Barry Humphries, Eric Bana, Andrew Stanton, Elizabeth Perkins, Nicholas Bird, Bruce Spence, Bill Hunter, Jordan Ranft, Erica Beck, Erik Per Sullivan, John Ratzenberger). Wonderfully enchanting animated instant classic from the geniuses at Pixar keep their winning streak alive with this remarkably lively tale about life under the sea and focusing on neurotic clownfish Marlin (ably voiced by Brooks in full panic mode) whose overprotective parenting gets the best of him when his only off-spring Nemo (Gould) winds up in the net of a diver from Australia, thus sending him on an incredible journey to reunite with his progeny. On hand to aid him is the dotty blue fish Dory (DeGeneres who is pitch-perfect hilarious and steals the show) whose positive sunny disposition is only circumvented by her consistent short-term memory loss making it a bumpy ride along.

Fun for the entire family with some serious belly-laughs of one-liners and sight gags that deserve a second viewing to get them all. Kudos to Stanton (who co-directs with Lee Unkrich and voices a surfer-dude sea turtle dad) who co-wrote with Bob Peterson and David Reynolds the cleverly antic script. ). But it is the amazing visuals conceived via CGI that proves groundbreaking in capturing the absolute FEELING of being in the ocean's murky depths and uncharted splendor. One of the year's best and most entertaining animated films ever made.",
28 July 2021,Continuation to Pixar's 2000s winning streak!,"Amazing. Another W for Pixar, Another essential Gen Z childhood starter pack film. You can really tell how much better the animation is getting as the years go by. Tbh, every single Pixar film through 2010 is incredible. This is no exception, the story is as entertaining and sentimental as it gets, with amazing characters like Nemo, Dory, and Marlin. No wonder it's a classic, it is to this day still one of the best movies Pixar has put out. It is still very funny, and is definitely up there with my best animated films ever.

26 December 2007,Swimmingly good,"I'll confess straight away to having a fish-tank indoors and admit to loving my fish. I've always coveted the tropical fish tank with their beautiful colouring but never been encouraged to take them on as they're notoriously short-lived. This lovely animated feature showed me what I 've been missing as well as royally entertaining me too. The twin stories are skilfully inter-cut in a proper cinematic way, combining Marlin & Dory's ocean-wide search for Nemo is well inter-cut with Nemo's attempts to escape captivity from the evil fish-tank (now I feel guilty about owning one!). The dialogue is smart, occasionally funny, rarely sentimental and well delivered by the not-so-starry cast (and all the better for it - people like Hanks and Murphy hardly need the income after all), even if Albert Brooks as Marlin keeps reminding me of a young Mel Brooks!. The real stars of course are the animators, bringing to life, well, sort of, all manner of aquatic effects, from a shoal of fish on the move, to turtles riding the current and even the depiction of whales in motion. There's a light ecological message too as you'd expect, pushed just far enough to register but not repel, particularly with the children in the primary target-audience and of course the expected stuff about father - son relationships, growing pains, generation gap - can't believe I'm writing this about a movie about cartoon fish. Anyway, lasting a just-right 90 minutes, Finding Nemo is a pleasant warm-hearted family entertainment and I'll certainly think twice next time my fish-tank filter breaks down!",8

25 July 2008,The Underwater World.,"A breath-taking movie. Pixar had created a wonderful world through animation. A real treat for our eyes. Great story. Great comedy. Great action. Great adventure. Great world. Great characters. Great ride. My favorite, the fish Dora.

It's about a father fish trying to get back his son fish who had been kidnapped by humans to Sydney. He travels all over the ocean to get his son back no matter what it cost him. An amazing movie about a father's love for his son.

All praise goes to the creators. They have done an amazing job. Capital ""A""mazing. The animation water-world and fishes looks so realistic in nature. One of major plus point for Pixar Studios. They are real artist. Their hard work had really paid off.

It's no surprise for this movie to be awarded the Best animated movie of the year.

18 February 2014,Vanilla Pixar,"Many of the earliest screen savers were of fish tanks - so perhaps it's fitting than an early computer-animated movie should have told a story of tropical fish. Some of Pixar's movies have had dark, poetic sides to them; but 'Finding Nemo' is a straight up children's adventure, with a whole shoal of colourful characters, a fast pace, and a positive, upbeat message. A few things made me smile but to me this is vanilla Pixar; there's a one dimensional story here, with little underlying depth, and the gorgeous animation is something we have come to take for granted from this studio. Compare, for example, the opening of this film and that of their later movie 'Up'; they cover similar ground, but the later film's treatment is altogether more poignant and adult.

13 March 2004,Depends how you find it,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

Ever since his wife was killed,Marlin the clownfish has guarded his young son Nemo like a hawk and is especially apprehensive of his first day at school.On the day,Nemo finally tires of his father's constant over-protectiveness and commits an act of open defiance.This results in him being caught by a deep sea diver and taken up to the surface,setting Merlin on a desperate course to find him.

Despite the mass rave reviews,I was initially sceptical about seeing Finding Nemo,as I couldn't really see the appeal a film of it's ilk would have for me.However,I was then reminded of a film from Disney and,more significantly,Pixar Animation Studios from a few years ago that I really enjoyed called Toy Story and,to this day,I still find that enjoyable,so maybe I could hold out some hope for this.

It was an enjoyable film for what it was,very funny and charming in parts,but something of an uninvolving experience.***",
24 May 2004,"Great animation, but I think the plot gets too much praise","I can't say enough about the animation. It was so realistic. The fish looked like they were solid, especially, Bruce the shark. He ""felt"" so much larger and like the shark actually took up space. You see the seaweed swaying in the water, etc... There's no telling how long it took to put together.

With that set aside, I didn't think the story was that great. It was OK, but definitely overhyped. And I was expecting a lot of laughs based on other reviews, but I laughed once. The story wasn't very original either. Rather than a friend searching for a friend, it's the dad going on an adventure to find his son. Along the way, he gets help from an oddball. And since it's Disney, you know how it ends with lessons learned.

FINAL VERDICT: The story is OK, but the visuals are amazing. It's worth at least one viewing.

18 December 2003,A delightful film for kids and adults alike!,"""Finding Nemo"", Pixar's latest project, is a wonderful story about the unbreakable bonds of father and son. Clownfish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is an overprotective father who tries to shield his underdeveloped son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) from the ills of the underwater world. One day Nemo is caught in a net by a fisherman, and with the help of a friendly and forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), the duo go about trying to locate the missing boy-fish, encountering various characters along the way (from a shark in rehab to a family of sea turtles). A wonderfully fresh and inspiring film, this box-office hit can only get better with each viewing. A winner. ***1/2

18 July 2011,"A Pixar Classic,","Finding Nemo is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. It is a heartwarming, as well as frequently funny film, it had me shedding tears on several occasions, the dedication of Marlin to find his lost son is powerful, making it hard to believe it is just a cartoon. My only issue was the lack of development for Nemo's friends at the dentist, we learn little about Gill and his crew, and their story does not conclude properly, which disappointed me. The voice actors are outstanding, perfectly delivering the personality traits and emotion of these characters as they struggle with this insane adventure, Albert Brooks conveys Marlin's sadness for his lost child, Ellen DeGeneres showcases Dory's amnesia perfectly and Willem Dafoe emphasizes Gill's desire for freedom effectively, as well as many other great performances, such as Geoffrey Rush as a helpful pelican. Filled with beautiful animation, a heartwarming story and likable, varied characters, Finding Nemo is a must see for animation fans.

A clown fish searches throughout the entire ocean to find his son Nemo, who is kidnapped by ocean divers.",9
17 February 2005,My brief review of the film,"Delightful to the eye, this is a beautiful creation, but not only that  it is excellent entertainment too. The exploration into ocean life is perfectly animated, however most amazing is the realism with which Sydney is portrayed. The visual style is not alone what makes this great however, it is as the film's delightful characters and sense of humour that make it enjoyable. All the characters are funny, each in their own way; the film reaches hilarity many times; and the whole production buzzes along well to the brilliant choral music of Thomas Newman. The sound in terms of the sea and seaside noises is excellently recorded and edited too. This is not only perfect family entertainment, but also a perfect film overall.

11 June 2003,"Too cute and innocent for me, but still pretty good","Pixar can never do wrong, it will never do wrong, and it will make money from any movie it makes. Without a stellar voice cast or an obnoxious ad campaign, this movie proved that Pixar doesn't need to hype its own films anymore. I really thought this film would be a sinker, but the first week grosses proved otherwise. What I do admire about this film were the underwater sequences, which proved to be rather vibrant and more cutting edge than the previous Pixar films. While being a cynical 20-something, I can't say the film was particularly brilliant beyond visual appeal and animation, but for the younger kids, this is definitely quality entertainment a parent can take their child to.

21 June 2019,An Unforgettable Journey,"Finding Nemo still remains as a Pixar classic. Near perfect animation and writing bring this vivid ocean world to life. With a vast array of fun characters and set pieces it is impossible to become bored, the humor spreads across every age range, from one of the most perfectly timed fart jokes, to Crush the turtle saying he waxes his shell, there's never a shortage of belly laughs. Pixar really nails down their message with his how far a father is willing to go to save his son, with an underlying theme of teamwork and acceptance. This is a film for animation and non animation fans alike, there's something in it for everyone, as it's just an absolute gem of a movie.

8 November 2003,This is great.,"I loved it. Typical fun, touching, fast moving, intelligent Pixar flick ala 'Monsters Inc' and 'Toy Story'. I enjoyed the Three Sharks, the Turtle Race and of course, our friends in the Fishtank. You gotta like Willem Dafoe and Brad Garrett doing their things especially. Many fun gags-the Pelican(Geoffrey Rush!) and the Cliff Clavin fish school...great.

Lotsa heart too-you care about these guys an awful lot more than you do the live actor portrayals in 'Matrix Reloaded', within the first 4 minutes. This one will live on for ages as a classic. As for say, Shrek-it's like watching an old episode of 'Miami Vice' or 'Satruday Nite Live'-great fun at the time, but you hadda Be there, it's already real dated, and....it ain't holding up too good.

**** outta ****. See this one again.

6 February 2015,The Pixar Quality,"Animation, maybe one of the hardest movie to be made. It's filled with the digital image, that isn't easy to be changed. Once the scene is done, the editors sometimes don't want to remade or retake it. The ""cooking"" phase is in the writing section, must be ripe enough to be served by the editorial-department. Especially, when it comes to the blockbuster of cinema, just like ""Finding Nemo"". It's not worth when the screenplay is not as good as the editing, the emptiness of amazing animated feature. But, Pixar never miss the point of great movies,e from the technology in film editing, until the deep message for the young generation. For ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar gave so much visual pleasure with the classic problem of human life. And, still holds the reality of the fish in front of human. Yes, I mean it's from the fish perspective, and it's maybe happened in animal's life, but human haven't notice it yet, even fish is not as smart as in this movie. The colorful settings bring joy to every child who watch this. Moreover, the funny scenario, just added other delicious seasoning in this Pixar first mass blockbuster.

Next, to the core of the story. It's simply entertaining and cinematic. I mean this story can be told only by movie, not story or music, etc. Two points of view, with exact transition. The beginning, is honestly like a template-idea. But, just the intro, not the entire. The classic problem of family is given with humble way of cinema. A dad-son relationship, which every child probably feel it, so does the father. More than that, Pixar still gives the smart and funny comedy. Children is pleasant with the animation, story, and the comedy. What's more for them to enjoy. The film actually doesn't only takes one or two settings. It is an adventure, and has many powerful scene. Every scene with new supernumerary, but with educating characterization. Yes, why not added some sciences for children. Catchy fish in every scene, and though-provoking plot. They can't leave the cinema before the end of the movie.

And, I may add some critics on this new-standard of animation. Again, maybe some blockbuster not as good as the non-visual-effects- movie. I mean it is good, not excellent. For the warm-up of studio, it is great, but let's not talk about the dimension of time. I really know the perfection of animation, but why not add some more twisting and deep plot. You know ""Toy Story"", is just what Pixar done in genius way. Focus on some deeper characterization of that extra-character and it could be really delightful. My opinion is just for another Pixar's movie. It has already got the mass-editing- experience. And it's ready to launch another classic to the upcoming generation. With that superb quality, and the developing technology, I think Pixar will be made some other ""Finding Nemo""s. And I expect with the mass-effects and wonderfully-written story.

A must watch of every 2000's generation, a beginning of new era of American animation.",9
5 April 2015,hilarious Dory,"Clown fish Marlin and Coral start a new brood. Coral battles and loses to a barracuda. Only Marlin and one egg survive. Respecting Coral's wish, he names him Nemo and becomes an overprotective parent. Nemo sees a boat in the open waters. After being berated and belittled by Marlin, Nemo swims out and is captured by scuba divers. Marlin tries desperately to follow them with the help of turtles and Dory with short term memory lost. Meanwhile Nemo finds himself in the dental office aquarium and he must organize a break-out. The animation is great and the story is terrific. It's PIXAR after all. The best thing is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. She is hilarious and she's does great voice work. The short term memory lost is insanely funny.

7 August 2015,Great Animation/Delightful Characters,"Pixar brings it on. This wonderful trip to the bottom of the sea is worth watching again and again. It centers around a misbehaving clownfish who gets himself taken away to a faraway place, with little hope of ever seeing his father again. The characters along the way are priceless, with clever dialogue, quirky sensibilities, and, ultimately, love for one another. The creators were able to capitalize on the innate, somewhat stereotypical, qualities of the individual sea denizens by using some of our current comic geniuses (like Ellen DeGeneres) and make them charming. If you've not seen this, make time. You don't even need the kids.

2 December 2003,One of the best movies of all-time,"Pixar has done it again, it seems that whenever Pixar and Disney come out with a movie it is always a tremendous success, and Finding Nemo is no exception. This is the best Pixar film yet and it will be tough to beat. The visual effects are amazing; everything in this Pixar ocean looks so real, from the sand to the sunlight hitting the water. You almost feel like you're underwater and it's hard to imagine that this is animation is not real. The voice work just adds to the animation and makes the movie that much better. Hands down, Ellen DeGeneres is the best in this movie; her voice work as Dory is just hilarious. Every scene that Dory is in I couldn't help but laugh, and with help from the script, the film has some of the funniest scenes in a children's movie. This movie is perfect for kids as it will amuse and entertain them or whoever else may be watching with them. The animation literally comes alive, the humor is everywhere and this all makes Finding Nemo a movie that is extremely enjoyable to watch.

18 March 2006,Just Keep Swimming...,"Just keep swimming...--This is a line from the movie that is funny. This film is simple. A fish gets kidnap by humans and his father goes on a look out for him with a help of Dory.

Dory has a short term memory that runs through her family. Or maybe its not. Well, she's played by the funny Ellen DeGeneres. She's the one who makes everyone laugh during the whole film. This film is funny for both kids and adults. It's really entertaining with peril here and there. This film is also sad, including the beginning that is hard to see, even for me.

The animation, overall, is great. Obviously, Pixar's animation is always great and it'll never become bad. It's wonderful to see the ocean. Everywhere is colorful on the screen. This is a masterpiece. It'll soon become a classic. This film is not overrated. It's fine where it is right now. This is the best animated film of 2004, in my opinion. The moral of the story is good for all of the parents to hear: Do not become over protective to your kids. Sooner or later you'll have to let them go with their own life. Ellen is the perfect character for Dorry. She's just adorable that it makes you put a smile in your face.

This is an entertaining and funny piece of work. It's great for all ages and everyone should see it. Go SEA it and have a hopping good time!",10

16 December 2003,Albert Brooks in clownfish clothing.,"FINDING NEMO is a typical Pixar product: A stunning visual enterprise. Its avant-garde computer imaging technology wiped out the century old, cel animation process. It's done, curiously enough, by a studio headed by former Walt Disney people who for some reason bolted Disney to form their own shop. One can only guess why. Of course, Disney will distribute. After all it's not only entertaining product but fulfills the single ultimatum of Hollywood: Make Money. Forget Shakespeare's injunction: to celebrate life.

Thus, we find ourselves with an engaging story about a father fish in search of his missing, remaining son after a mean barracuda has gobbled up his spouse and other offspring. Alas, a skin-diving Australian dentist has lifted the son for the tank in his office, to be held there for Darla, his ever-so-frightening, brainless, little daughter.

Finding Nemo is always interesting to watch. It's a, very clever, sometimes hilarious, six-minute, shtick-filled cartoon stretched into 100 minutes. One can forgive its story flaws in all the fun. However, the use of a talented, well-known actor like Albert Brooks in the lead role is puzzling. Disney himself avoided the use of major names in order to evade the audience confusion of hearing an easily imaged voice coming out of a drawn character. The most distinct instance of this is in SNOW WHITE where he chose the completely unknown voice of Adriana Caselotti over the reigning voice of the day, Deanna Durbin. Shamus Culhane, for whose biography I helped him find a publisher and who worked on that classic film, assured me that the decision to use Caselotti (who passed at 80 in 1997) was intentional and not forced by the then prevailing funding shortage. This was Disney's first feature length cartoon and he wanted the best for it. Indeed, it lives today, still, over half a century later, as meaningful as the day it was released.

Finally, the most unfortunate aspect of NEMO, an otherwise fine product, is its lack of meaning. It lacks my hallmark for greatness, a soul at its center. As such, NEMO, like all of the other Pixar products thus far, will be long forgotten when films like SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO are still being heralded as classics. Why Pixar does this when it has a $94 million budget to lavish on a product begs the question: A shallow fish story in deep water.",5
11 June 2003,Pixar's best since Bug's Life- The voice work corresponds magnificently with the artwork,"Finding Nemo, from co-directors Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich (who have worked as directors on past pixar films like Bug's life and Toy Story 2) have devised an adventure film that takes the viewer far beyond anything imaginable with Little Mermaid. In fact, much of the humor and dialogue reminded me of the sophistication that went with an animated movie like Antz, where the top celebrity personalities came forth to give voice to wonderful creature creations.

And speaking of Antz, this time there is a neurotic, obsessive caricature of a comic in Finding Nemo, here named Marlin and played by Albert Brooks. After his wife, a clown fish, and his hundreds of eggs are devoured by a larger fish, he finds one egg left and becomes compulsive in securing it's safety. His son Nemo, it turns out, gets caught in a diver's net and taken to a Dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. This sets Marlin off on his quest across the ocean, along with a fish who forgets things as soon as their mentioned, voiced by Ellen Degeneres. They encounter sharks in rehab, turtles with Californian accents, a whale (quasi-Pinnochio there), and much more, all the while little Nemo, inside the fish-tank and renamed Sharkbate, starts to gain the courage his father never considered he had, and vice-versa.

The Pixar team, like in their previous treats, deliver worlds that usually can only exist in the imagination - the under-the-ocean scenes, making up about 65 percent of the film, are obviously breathtaking in design while not going overboard in realism, and the scenes in the dentist office and on the pier are precise too. It's like we've thought we've been here before, but now the filmmakers take us right into the nexus of it. This splendor, along with the voice work by Brooks, Degeneres, Willem Dafoe as the leader of the fish-tank pack, Geoffrey Rush as a pelican, and all the supporting parts, give anyone in any age group the finest animated spectacle of the summer.

By the way, those seagulls are the funniest thing Pixar's come up with since the aliens in Toy Story!",10
9 January 2021,Finding Nemo 2003 Review,"Finding Nemo is honestly one of the few films I count as perfect. From the absolutely stunning animation, a beautiful story, breathe-taking visuals, and some memorable characters (protagonists and side characters alike), this film is just top notch. Watching this as an adult (I watched this so much as a kid) it still holds up extremely well and it's charm still shines bright. Some of Pixar's best work.

31 July 2008,Andrew Stanton's Masterpiece,"Pixar makes the best animated films and Finding Nemo is one more jewel in their crown. Like most Pixar movies, Finding Nemo too deals with universal themes  parenting, father-son relationship & friendship. With his crisp, funny & sometimes thought-provoking dialogues, director Andrew Stanton takes you on an adventure ride under the rich and colorful sea full of interesting creatures. This movie is so engrossing that you sometimes forget it is just an animation, especially when you see animated characters display genuine human emotions. Dory is the most unforgettable character I've come across in animated movies. Other characters too remain etched in your memory long after you've seen the movie. This movie certainly deserves a spot among the top movies of this century.

1 August 2009,Everything works here... (non important spoilers),"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
23 May 2003,Walter E. Disney has been reincarnated as Pixar!,"If Walt Disney was alive today, he would be proud of Michael Eisner. Building an alliance with Pixar and distributing Pixar's genius speaks well of the good chairman.

I guess I was not surprised that(at the advanced screening of the new Pixar/Disney flix,) ""Finding Nemo"" would be brilliant. Entertaining my 5 1/2 year old child, my wife and I, ""Nemo"" made for a great family event. Yes, my son will make sure I pay for a second showing... and you know, I will gladly do so.

I guess, all tolled, this animated movie should make $250 million easy. Perhaps $300 million... Okay, let's go for it! $366 million.

Enjoy.

24 April 2004,a whole lot of blah,"After the over-the-top praise this movie received, I was surprised to find it to be an pretty unremarkable movie, and one that's not especially imaginative/visual. It is uncomplicated by any element not approved by committee, which means you get regurgitated under-sea relationships, with slightly modernized shtick. (Yep, there's a shark chase, but he's in recovery ?!) Take any three familiar mass market plot lines and average them together and you get something as tepid as this. This movie was gone from my mind the second it ended. I don't recall a frame of it.

The only way you could be a fan of this movie is if you think a movie is supposed to spell everything out for you and cause you to emote every twenty minutes. It never touched me and it never engaged me.

Nobody ever went broke tossing look-alike projects at undiscerning American audiences.

27 January 2021,Fantastic Kids Movie,"This movie has a ton of memorable moments but there's not much besides that.

Marlin and Dory go from event to event but there's not much substance in between. Because kids don't really care about this, I would give this a 10/10 for children 10 and under.

The ending also didn't have that much going for it and felt like another random event.

Overall, a great family movie.

3 September 2008,Not bad for a CGI motion picture,"I am really not big on CGI productions because what I really like are the old cartoons drawn by hand. However, ""Finding Nemo"" isn't such bad for a CGI production. It isn't ""Cars"", but it's a little better than ""Toy Story"" for example, and much better than movies like ""Shrek"", ""Madagascar"" and so on...

""Finding Nemo"" is technically very acceptable. It has great graphics which make the whole scenario look so real and so natural. The story is clever and the movie has lots of dangerous adventures lived by a clownfish and a funny regal tang with memory problems. However, although the graphics are in general good thanks to its quality sceneries and well-designed various fish species, the human characters are awfully designed, especially that horrible little girl who looks like the annoying Sid from ""Toy Story"".

Aside the movie's faults, generally speaking the movie is okay, entertaining enough and offers fun for everyone who's watching it. The movie has some quite funny gags, such as whenever a character says something like «He's a clownfish, but he's not funny at all». Another good joke is when Marlin is trying to tell a joke to the sharks and, while he's making a fool out of himself, he suddenly yells «Nemo!!!». Bruce (the shark) is a funny and interesting character. Bruce is a very humorous shark and he's got a funny way to invite the fishes for a dinner with his other two friends sharks. After all, «fishes are their friends».

Oh, by the way, I think it's very good that for once a movie includes a blue whale, which is a very forgotten animal in animated films. It is the biggest animal on Earth and it sure is a fantastic creature.

Overall, one of Pixar's best films (although not a tremendous film for me) and better than the overvalued and overrated ""Toy Story"".",7

13 October 2015,Summary And Review of Finding Nemo (2003),"Finding Nemo is a fantastic movie about a little fish named Nemo. Nemo was trying to rebel against his dad when he got taken from his father! Now Nemo's dad (Marlin) went everywhere to try and find him. Along the way Marlin picks up a newfound friend named Dory, and she follows Marlin on his misadventures to try and find Nemo.

Overall, Finding Nemo was a fantastic movie, with a detailed plot. It teaches kids about companionship and teamwork, shown by Marlin and Dory restlessly trying to get Nemo back from the people that took him. The way the story unfolded would keep anyone enthralled in the story of Nemo and how Marlin tried to find him. Finding Nemo will become a classic for all kids around the world and hopefully will become a favorite everywhere. In the movie, the voice acting is one of the best from Disney to date. The acting and animation meshed extremely well and showed true emotion from the characters. Overall, this movie was a solid 9/10

19 November 2005,Absolutely the BEST movie ever!,"There is nothing I can say about the movie that has never been told before. The music was great, the voices were great, the scenario and direction was magnificent. A fascinating story, made by the creators of masterpieces, Pixar...If I could, I would talk about this movie forever, or until I run out of words and adjectives. The story is funny and touching when it's necessary. It made me laugh out loud and even cry for a second. Fantastic. A must-see!

Excellent work by the musicians and the director. That's just it. If I go on, I will get on your nerves as I am extremely enthusiastic about this movie. THE movie, actually.

15 November 2020,A Little Bit Dull,"Even as a kid sitting in the theater seeing this movie not once or twice, but three times, I can distinctly remember becoming quite antsy before the end. It's a slower-paced movie than a lot of the other Pixar films and, quite frankly, it bored me a lot. My mother liked it, so I went along with it, but it was never my kind of thing.

It's a beautifully animated film that's appealing to look at, and it hasn't lost a bit of its quality in that regard with the passing of time. The voice acting is great and, according to Google, it was scored by Randy Newman (who, yet again, I'm not a big fan of). But the biggest appeal of this film is Ellen Degeneres playing the forgetful fish Dory. She was the comic relief in an otherwise grim film, and I think a big part of the film's appeal relies on her and her ability to offer up the lighthearted forgetfulness and stupidity.

Overall, though, even on subsequent viewings, the film doesn't really do a lot for me in terms of maintaining interest. It's most definitely worth a watch for anyone who hasn't seen it before, but it's not in my top 5 Pixar films.",6
17 December 2005,Best Animated Film Yet,"I have watched this film umpteen times with my 3 year-old granddaughter (I own the DVD), and I'm going to go against the grain and say that, while others may say that Finding Nemo doesn't quite measure up, I say that in many ways this film excels.

I believe that what most people find lacking in Finding Nemo is the adult-oriented humor. And it's true, there is very little of it here. There is nothing approaching the risqué or double entendres here either, those things that are supposed to go over the kids' heads and give the adults a big guffaw. So, as a result, adults looking for that kind of stuff don't find it and are therefore disappointed.

But if my granddaughter is any kind of a yardstick to measure it by, the kids love it.

While this film may not be a masterpiece, it's the next best thing to it. That's because the artwork is superb, unparalleled and unmatched. The coloration, textures, use of light, and shadings are the finest that have ever been done on any animated film ever, before or since. Shrek2 and Shark's Tale, for instance, came out *after* this movie, and, good as they are (and they are very good) they are nowhere near as beautifully rendered as Finding Nemo. Particularly Shark's Tale, which in some ways seemed to be a blatant theft and rip off from Finding Nemo, but in my opinion fails because it's just not as good, either art-wise or story-wise. But Finding Nemo remains a visually beautiful piece of artwork, and the kids love it. And that counts for a lot.",9
13 January 2004,An Absolute Whale Of A Tale,"Wow, the digital realm is easily forgotten when you first lock eyes on the visual wonder created for yet another charming tale from Disney/Pixar Animation. `Finding Nemo' is Pixar's fifth outing and after a moderately spotless track record they keep this one swimming in a wealth off colour and three-dimensional form. Their visual language has proven to be a clear and successful method of storytelling. It captures the imagination and accommodates some fairly decent stories to-boot. And what setting could be more exciting than Australia's exotic eastern coastline.

But it's a mix of Pixar's wonderful craft and a well written story that keeps audiences enthralled, and this time director/writer Andrew Stanton serves up just that, on a silver platter. What remains is the winning formula of comedy and gravity within the screenplay. Stanton has been involved with all of the other Pixar features in the past, and it shows. Even deep under the ocean, far removed from the human subtleties that are woven into usual animations, is a rich tapestry of lifelike environments and genuine character's that are easy to connect and relate to. And in the usual Pixar tradition you get a film that bridges the age boundary and becomes wholly enjoyed by all, young and old.

I enjoyed myself for the entire duration of `Finding Nemo' (that included the final credits). I recommend it to all, no matter what your cinematic preference may be. Besides the lavish visual elements that have made Pixar much admired this has been a labor of love for Andrew Stanton that started way back in 1992, prior to Toy Story. It's a new development in the path the entire production house is heading. Thomas Newman's involvement in writing music for this project shows us exactly that as his score gives the film a new emotional style. It's also a `new high water mark' for CGI (computer generated image) animation in general. Pixar is now an established force in animation but politely recognizes others in the industry as well. For example you have the address (amongst other things) Wallaby Way that will be instantly recognizable to ""Wallace and Gromit"" fans and a way-cool Sea Turtle (Crush, voiced by Stanton himself) with a very close resemblance to those four ninja friends of his. There are also plenty of fun references to Jaws, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Monty Python and nearly every previous (and upcoming) Pixar feature. You also have Pixar's own Joe Ranft, who made famous the character of Heimlich the caterpillar from `A Bug's Life', making another special appearance as the voice of Jacques the cleaner shrimp. Kids won't get these in-jokes but for the adults it's a warm welcome. But, when it comes down to it `Finding Nemo' is aimed at just about anyone, as long as you enjoy a well-told and inventive story. From the vibrantly lush to the murky dark this is an absolute lure for the eyes and a treat for the funnybone.

26 June 2014,Great story. Good moral. Fun time.,"I have to admit it... I am hooked on animations. Did you get it? :)

OK. This is another proof that animations are for all ages and if the story is good and it has a moral that relates to all of us, it's a success.

Really well done. Great voice acting. Fluid animation and cute characters that are alive.

Loved it! Watched it several times... and every time you discover something new...

Try to catch the pelican saying ""nice"" with an Australian accent and flying way... did you get the reason? Hilarious. Smooth humour.

All together: Beautiful!

24 August 2018,For Gods Sake!,"Ellen DeGeneres/Dory: What to say about this? Apparently, if youre famous you can't do anything wrong? She's beyond annoying, but she's never funny. Her voice is disgusting to listen too, so if the intent was to capture how annoying that type of character with a memory problem could be, that was a good job, but totally unnecessary and harmed the movie. That character didn't need a recognizable voice but a sweet one. The situation was annoying (and could've been funny) without an annoying voice.

Barry Humphries/Shark Bruce: And then this. My GOD. How can you screw up a shark? The thing of not wanting to eat fish was clever (playing with Sharks sense of smell). But again, the voice was obnoxious (when he was on eating mode) and dumb (otherwise) rather than terrifying and dumb, which is the way it should've been.

You had WILLEM DAFOE and GEOFFREY RUSH BUT YOU GAVE THIS PART TO BARRY WHO? ARE YOU STUPID?

This movie has an 8. That's disgusting and shows you that you can throw dirt to people's faces, but with the name Pixar/Disney they would love it.",1
10 December 2003,Fantastic,"Quite why I haven't commented on this before is beyond me, but still, here I am

Put simply, Finding Nemo is a brilliant film with funny and endearing characters that are a joy to watch. Pixar have again pushed the boundaries of computer animation to bring us a realistic yet still cartoonish film that will appeal to anyone from 3 to 103. I'm sure most people's favourite bit was the whale speak by Dory, which had me in stitches. However other little incidents in the film really made me laugh so much. When the little baby fish falls off the sponge bed is so typical of how children react when they hurt themselves. The animators and writers at Pixar really know how to capture the way people react to situations. All the little facial expressions throughout the film are beautifully animated.

The water effects must have been tremendously difficult to achieve, but they are fantastic. The lighting changes that were required really help set the mood of a scene, even when Marlin and Dory were inside the whale. The story although basic was successfully pulled off with no dip in any of the action. The story kept going when it shifted between Marlin's desperate attempt to locate his son, and Nemo's dispair of being alone with no one to look after him except the new collection of strange friends in the dentist fish tank.

Overall I give it 10/10 because it was great. I can't wait for The Incredibles next year, I'm sure it will be just as good.",10

The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life.

9 July 2011,Finding Nemo (2003) - There's a Fish Out of Water!,"Talking toys! Talking bugs! Talking monsters! Now, there's talking fish? Awesome! The movie, ""Finding Nemo"" takes place on a father who tries to find his lost son fish, with the help of a fish with a load of short-term memory loss, portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, which made me laugh a lot. Along the way, they encounter sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish, and tank fish. The story then explains a true loving message of father and son. Okay, I think Nemo is another personal favorite film from Pixar. The story felt true to life, the characters were all hilarious, including Dory, the best Pixar character ever, for most of the laughs, and the heart of this tale kept beating like it was going to teach a big lesson where to respect your loved ones, and taught the true meaning of father and son. And they use this true fact with talking fish! How cool is that? ""Finding Nemo"" was quite a story to die for, and the story was so loving and sometimes heartbreaking that everybody wants to see a movie like this! Looks like Pixar has a soft side of drama, and has a big heart for family. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again, and I'll never be tired of it. This is one of the best animated films of all time. ""Finding Nemo"", in my review, ""a loving portrait of father and son, with talking fish"".",10

1 January 2004,Best Animated Film Ever.,"This is truly the best animated film ever. It is pure Disney magic. In my opinion it was the best film of the summer of 2003. It also has to be the funniest Disney movie ever made. I hope there is a sequel to this. The only problem is what they are going to call it. They'll have to call it something else unless they're finding Nemo again. Anyway, getting back to this movie, I thought that the absent-minded fish Dori was the funniest character. I also thought those Seagulls that always said ""Mine"" was funny. For some reason when I first saw the movie I thought those Gulls were saying ""Mike"". Then I realized that they couldn't say ""Mike"" because it wouldn't make sense. 10/10. I always love it when Disney and Pixar work together.

4 September 2003,Sorry Pixar... Sigh,"3D Animation Quality: Beautiful 5/5 (truly spectacular)

Story: Meh! Lacks creativity 1/5 (Find a better script next time)

My 2-Cents:

Disney and Pixar are an amazing team. Pixar has put together some really nice films that will go down in history for their impact in the animation industry. There is no question that this film was an excellent a crowd drawer and everything Disney and the industry needed at this time.

I love Pixar and their contributions to contemporary cinema. The film however was a great disappointment to me. One of the things I have grown to enjoy when watching a Pixar Film is their shorts before the actual movie begins. They showed their classic short, ""Knick Knack"" which was produced in way back in 1989. I was hoping to see a new short. I loved ""Geri's Game"" and ""For the Birds"".

My biggest beef was not about that. It involved the story itself. Toy Story 1 & 2 was written to appeal to both young and older audiences. Finding Nemo seemed to have it's target directly on the kids. There's nothing terribly wrong w/ that, it's just the story was too simple. It seemed like the movie was jammed full of FILLER just to lengthen the movie. We could have done without the sharks, for example. Their role in the film was simply to extend it by a couple of minutes.

The novelty of 3D animation is gone. It's not the 1990's anymore. People are familiar with complex 3D animation. It's everywhere we look. Pixar cannot rely on drawing an audience simply because the film is a 3D animation. Remember how poorly Final Fantasy did? The film had great animation with incredibly realistic human characters. Square One did an amazing job on the animation that just blew me away. But the story was not appealing to the mass audience. So, where are they now? The movie BOMBED and the company literally went bankrupt.

Pixar should remember one thing. Parents have to sit through the film too. Just spend a little more time on the script for your next movie.

You haven't lost a loyal viewer in me, however. I have a lot of faith in John Lasseter's team. I expect great things from the Pixar and Disney in the near future!",
15 October 2011,"""71% of the Earth's surface is covered by water. That's a lot of space to find one fish""","After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clown fish sets out on a journey to bring him home.

I hate people bashing on animated movies for it being too childish or too.. animated. I, myself, will have to say (other than Pixar) I agree. But what Pixar has done to animated movies is just genius. To start off, Finding Nemo presents a lot of hidden adult themes that adults would only understand. It also contains heart, which no animated movie has ever done. It makes you actually feel for an animated creature and that is just almost magic. Pixar explores childhood in a way nothing else can, and I just adore these movies. I also have to admit, Finding Nemo put a tear in my eye (and for an animation) that is just complete brilliance. I respect Pixar for doing these such things. The film also has amazing voice acting and you can actually see the emotion the actors put out to make this movie, something only Pixar could do. This movie is an absolute heartwarming, hilarious adventure that digs into your heart and toys with your emotions. For all you punks out there you cannot look past the childish aim, you are missing out incredibly. This is definitely the best animated film. 10/10.",10
15 May 2023,evergreen classic,"I may be one of the few people out there that doesn't love Finding Nemo, it was ok but it didn't really do anything for me.

First and foremost, it is GORGEOUS. The colors are striking, the blue tones of the water are realistic at times mesmerizing and the movements of the various creatures are realistic and fluid.

Most importantly though is the story. Nemo's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.

30 August 2008,Cartoon Perfection!,"I love this movie. Although it has a sad beginning, it's a wonderfully funny & touching movie. Albert Brooks' character, Marlin, is very funny as the overly cautious (with reason to be) father. And Nemo is a sweet kid, who manages not to seem bratty at all even when he's being defiant. All the main characters are super funny (& endearing) whether in the sea or in the aquarium. Examples: Bruce & friends are sharks that don't want to eat fish (though it's hard to fight their natural urges); and Jacques is a neat freak, so naturally very bothered when they decide to let the tank get filthy in order to force the owner to clean it, allowing them the chance to possibly escape. However, Ellen DeGeneres' character, Dory, tops them all though. She suffers from short-term memory loss (at times, very short-term), which makes for many laughs. And she thinks she can speak whale, which makes even just stating that very funny. One of my favorite parts is when she tells Marlin that they're not the only two ones in here (the ocean, that is). Basically, it's one of my favorite movies.

21 February 2006,One of the Disney and Pixar Team's Worst...,"When my family rented this movie, it's an excellent thing I was working on a school project while this movie was made - they didn't like this movie! The first time I've actually seen this movie for myself was in Spanish sound with English subtitles in my Spanish II class back in early 2004. While I was awake to fully comprehend the Spanish and the English words very well, the movie itself seemed mostly boring and not-up-to-it to me. I've finished watching this in English when my family was in a limo in Florida. I was glad when the movie was finally over! But the real saving grace of this movie, however, is the aquarium screen saver on the DVDs; I put the tiki one up on the limo screens! But still, pass.

27 November 2003,Pixar created another masterpiece,"With Finding Nemo (which has just been released in cinema's today here in the Netherlands) Pixar once again delivers a true masterpiece, easily the best of their films so far, and maybe even the best animation I've seen (and that long list includes Shrek and The Lion King).

All one hopes for is provided: stunning images, lovely music (by Thomas Newman, always a firm favourite), a great story with humour, humanity and warmth, great voice performances... Simply perfect.

When the words ""The End"" appeared, the entire cinema was sorry (sighs all around) - that says enough now doesn't it... :-)

5 June 2003,WAY too intense for young ones,"If your idea of family entertainment is a nonstop series of intense action sequences--almost getting eaten by a shark, almost getting eaten by another fish, almost being eaten by jellyfish, being eaten by a whale--then go ahead and sit through this headache of quick cuts, loud sound effects, and screaming characters. You know, you could cut out half of these cliffhanger sequences and give us some characterization or some sweet memorable moments. Now THAT would be a good family film. This is the most visually striking of all Pixar movies, and the most disappointing as a family entertainment. Pass this one up if you have younger children, please!

22 November 2016,Excellent Adventure Story,"Finding Nemo (2003)

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

Absolutely delightful Pixar film has Nemo being taken by a diver and put into a fish tank in his dentist office. His father Marlin is then forced to face his fears and travel through the ocean with the help of Dory to try and get to his son.

FINDING NEMO is one of the most beloved Pixar films and while I didn't think it was as great as TOY STORY 3 or UP, it's certainly a classic animation film that has a lot going for it. Obviously the animation itself is wonderful and it's really amazing how great the look of the film was. You really can forget that you're watching an animated movie because the visuals are so great that you just get sucked up into the atmosphere of the movie.

The greatest thing the film has going for it is the fact that the story itself is just so great. Obviously the main plot is the fact that this father loves his son more than anything and is willing to do whatever it takes to save him. This here is an easy set-up and the adventure that follows has one terrific sequence after another. There are so many fascinating characters and situations that Marlin and Dory get into along the way that you can't help but laugh and be caught up in the story.

The vocal performances are all terrific and especially Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres. Their comic timing together is perfect and we get other great work from Willem Dafoe, Alexander Gould and Austin Pendleton. As I said the story is great, the animation is great and there's just a wonderful adventure from start to finish.",
21 July 2009,Pixar,"A brand name, when you say it, you know you'll get quality. Their recent effort ""Up"", just came out and is in the IMDb Top 100. Now that's saying something. Pixar stands for quality. For movies, that can be enjoyed throughout every generation/age. The same goes for Nemo here too!

How they do it, who comes up with the crazy characters (like the turtle(s) in this movie)? I don't know. What I do know, is that they achieve what others dream of. Making entertaining movies, that have a message too. This time, it's about growing up, letting go of things you love. And all this interwoven in kid friendly environment, which still has some dark sides to it. Watch it, and be amazed!

15 April 2006,Clever!,"I guess that what truly differentiates the children's movies that my generation has grown up watching from those of previous generations is the various references to other things (think the popular culture references in ""Shrek"" I and II, and the genie's Rodney Dangerfield and Jack Nicholson imitations in ""Aladdin""). ""Finding Nemo"" brilliantly continues this. It focuses on Marlin (Albert Brooks), a tense clown-fish searching for his son Nemo, who got caught by an Australian dentist. Along the way, Marlin meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a big blue fish with short-term memory. Maybe it sounds too wimpy to say that the movie is about the importance of having solid relationships in one's life, but you might say that.

And the popular culture references? I never would have imagined a kids' movie spoofing scenes from Alfred Hitchcock's and Stanley Kubrick's movies, but they do it here. I don't know how they did it, but they did it. A very well done movie. Also starring Willem Dafoe, Brad Garrett, Allison Janney, Austin Pendleton, Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana (those last two of course later co-starred in ""Munich"").",10

6 March 2013,"Little fish, big ocean","Finding Nemo wasn't one of my favourite Pixar films when I first saw it but with every passing watch my enjoyment of it increases.

First of all visually it's stunning. Should it ever be re-released in 3D it would be quite a treat because the way the ocean is created on screen is magic.

Like all the best Pixar films (and probably any kids film) it appeals to both adults and children with a simple story that is overflowing with warm characters (with a few famous voices thrown in with good measure) and the ability to make you laugh and cry. Pixar really do excel at making quality family films that I have no doubt will be entertaining audiences for many a generation to come.

I have my doubts about the proposed Finding Nemo 2 but it's ultimately a case of 'in Pixar we trust'.",6
21 September 2012,Watching Finding Nemo again in 3-D after nine years felt like a new experience all over again which I liked very much,"So nine years after first enjoying this at theatres, I decided to watch this again in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend. I was astounded to find out how much I forgot since that first time so I was mostly experiencing this as if I hadn't seen this before which made for a wonderfully touching, thrilling, and, of course, very funny time for both me and my friend. So hearing Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres as Marlin and Dory brought plenty of laughter from me especially from the latter. And seeing their adventures in looking for Marlin's son Nemo was even more pleasurable when we find out who all three main players encounter. Really, all I'll say now is if you like seeing classic movies on the big screen, I highly recommend you once again watch Finding Nemo at your neighborhood movie house right now!

22 April 2009,Nothing fishy about this delightful briny piece.,"Marlin is an overprotective father who dotes on his only son, Nemo. When in an act of defiance, Nemo is captured by a diver, Marlin must overcome his fear of the ocean and search for his missing son.

Pixar ventures underwater and manages to make a normally sounding plot into a charming and visual treat. Awash with colour and marine characters so delightful that they enthral constantly, Finding Nemo is something of the perfect family picture. Deft with its humour and dolling out life lessons to the watching kids, it stands as one of the most expertly crafted pictures to come from Pixar's wonderful stable. You can play spot the homage or merely enjoy the craft on offer, Finding Nemo most definitely has something for everyone, it's a must see for the discerning cinephile. 9/10

29 April 2005,An Underwater Treasure,"""Finding Nemo"" finds the Pixar animation studio back in top form after their somewhat disappointing (I thought) ""Monsters, Inc."" This group has always had a knack for finding source material that will give them full freedom in unleashing their animation imaginations (the toy-chest world of ""Toy Story,"" the insect world of ""A Bug's Life,"") and in ""Finding Nemo"" they take us underwater and show us the beauty, wonder, and danger of the sea. There are any number of jaw-dropping set pieces in this film: a field of jellyfish, a shark attack, a mass escape from a fishing net. As usual, Disney fills its film with liberal messages about the treatment of wildlife and the environment, much welcome and needed messages in my opinion. But great animation alone cannot sell me on an animated movie--that's done with the quality of the story and characters, and ""Finding Nemo"" delivers there as well. The Pixar movies are never as cloying as the traditionally animated films produced by Disney--there's always a drier, cheekier brand of humour, and you get the feeling that just as many jokes are aimed at the adult audience as at the kids. The voices are terrific, the story is quick and funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. Grade: A",9
20 July 2003,Overrated!,"When the credits for Finding Nemo started to roll I asked myself, did I see a different movie then everybody else? I do not know how people are saying this is the best movie of 2003 and one of the greatest of all-time. Sure, the animation is outstanding (great job Pixar), but the story is awful (shame on you Disney). After movies like Toy Story, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc I expected a better film. This movie is for people under 10 or for people who act and think like they are under 10. This is NOT a good film at all. Save your money and 100 minutes of your life, don't see Finding Nemo.

3 September 2023,"Whoa, Dude. Mister Turtle is my father. The name's Crush","On the first day of school Nemo wants to impress some misbehaving kids and disprove his overprotective father's concerns by touching by far the biggest butt he's ever seen, but, it goes wrong and he ends up missing, so the two, now separated, have to get back together.

As someone who has ADHD, I really relate to Dory, who has short-term memory loss and gets very happy when she's able to remember something, and in general tries to keep an optimistic spirit. Great action. Funny for both kids and adults. Really well animated.

Like every Pixar movie it will get you emotional, maybe even make you cry. Also, someone should really check on the writers... at least one of them must be terrified of little girls, because there's one made out to be scary in this, and most of their features leading up to it. Like, A Bug's Life is the only exception.

This features some intense and disturbing content. I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.",8

26 November 2005,"Great family comedy adventure, under the sea, in the aquarium, and through the deadly ring of fire.","This movie was a very family friendly and funny movie that both kids and adults can enjoy. Great voice work really makes this one, as both Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenerous do outstanding jobs with their characters. I especially enjoy Ellen's spacey character, that does not have to good of a memory, but is so cute in her delivery. I love the part where she takes her turn at the shark intervention. Great scenes everywhere as the father goes looking for his son Nemo who is captured and placed in an aquarium of a dentist. In the tank are some of the most neurotic fish ever, including one determined to escape the tank. They all band together when it is found out that Nemo is going to be given to the dentist's niece who lets just say isn't very good with handling fish. Nemo's father faces many perils in the quest for his son including jellyfish, a lantern fish, a whale, seagulls, and many other very funny perils. So watch this movie and enjoy as it is one of the better computer generated movies I have seen with great voice acting. I enjoyed almost every minute though the opening is a bit sad it makes up for it with great comedy...look for John Ratzenberg as a very funny school of fish and check the end where the flaw in the escape plan is obvious.",9
6 October 2004,As good as animation gets,"I'm not a big fan of animation. In fact, up until I saw Finding Nemo, I had never seen an animated film that I love. Now that I have seen it, however, that's all changed. With it's vivacious characters, sublime animation and wonderful voice acting; Finding Nemo is a winner all the way. The story follows a young clown fish who is, believe it or not, called Nemo. A shark killed Nemo's mother and siblings, and this has lead his father to be overprotective of his only son. This over-protectiveness leads to rebellion from Nemo - you know what kids are like - and no sooner has his dad told him not to go near the boat, is he tapping the bottom of it with his fin, getting caught by a diver and then being taken to a fish tank in a Sydney dentist's surgery. Of course, his dad isn't going to take this lying down and so begins an epic journey in which he risks life and fin (sorry) to, you guessed it, find Nemo.

As mentioned, the animation in this film is absolutely wonderful. By far and away the best picture that Pixar have ever created, in terms of looks and finished item. The colour scheme for the movie is extremely vibrant, and is therefore aesthetically pleasing for the duration. The film also does a fantastic job of creating it's own world; the sea is a place that is busy and bursting with life. Throughout the film, our hero's are confronted with many challenges and inventive characters - from the sharks that want to stop eating fish, to the forest of jellyfish, down to the escape artist Gill (voiced to perfection by William Dafoe), Finding Nemo has no shortage of vivacity in it.

The film is as impressive as far as substance goes, as it is on the visual front. The characters in Finding Nemo give the film a lot of it's substance and, aside from the fact that they're mostly talking fish, feel very real and almost have a life of their own. In an animated children's film, you don't expect to see characters the likes of what's on show here, but Finding Nemo delivers on the character front too. Our main hero's are great creations; we have Marlin, the father. He's very neurotic and wouldn't be out of place in a Woody Allen film (aside from the fact that he's a talking fish, obviously). His opposite number is a lovable, if forgetful female blue tang fish called Dory. Dory is a brilliant character, she is funny yet never irritating throughout the movie and it is somewhat because of her that the movie plays out so well. These two have a great chemistry on screen, which is better than a lot of the chemistries in 'serious' films. Nemo himself is your typical child  thinks he knows it all, but doesn't. And the film wins realism points for this too. There is a great menagerie for the support cast, which includes turtles, whales, sharks and much more; and all of them are brilliant examples of the kind of imagination that has gone into this film.

There are also several life lessons on display in this film, and those are what lifts Finding Nemo from merely an animation film, to a film that can be respected by adults, as much as by children. The life lessons on offer are; listen to your parents, shown clearly by the fact that this whole fiasco is born of a result of Nemo disobeying his dad. There's also themes, on the other hand, of how overprotecting your children can lead to them viewing you with contempt; and the movie strikes a balance, like it does on the whole, between both sides of the parental structure. Aside from the family based messages, the film also has things to say that certain people and countries would do well to note; first of all, interfering with nature is not nice, and stemming from that is the message that if you have the power, it doesn't mean you have the right to use it; clearly portrayed by the diver that takes Nemo from his home. The fact that the film has all these themes, and still manages to be deliriously entertaining is testament to it's brilliance. Many films that profess substance don't have as much as this little caper does.

Overall, animation doesn't get any better than this. Finding Nemo is fun for children, but there is MORE than enough for adults to enjoy, and I would have no qualms with recommending this movie to anyone.",8

9 June 2023,Finding Nemo,"""Nemo"" is your typically adventurous and curious offspring. Living amidst the wonders of the Barrier Reef has began to wear on the young clownfish, though, and he yearns for the open ocean. His dad knows best and has forbidden him from leaving the safety of their home waters but one day his nose gets the better of him as he espies a fishing boat and next thing he is caught by a diver who whisks him off to the surgery of a dentist where he is deposited in a tank with some fellow prisoners - awaiting the arrival of the man's daughter who is to be the new owner of ""Nemo"". Now young as he is, he's not without nouse and is soon working on a plan to return to the open sea - which they can all see from the window! Meantime, pop ""Marlin"" is in a panic and in his search for his wayward son encounters ""Dory"" - a forgetful fish who thinks she's seen a boat, but then again... Loads of colourful and enjoyable escapades follow as the pair use ingenuity and take quite a few risks to become reunited. First things first - ""Dory"" just annoyed me. Right from the start I was hoping that she would become shark fodder. She has short term memory loss - but how does she remember that? Anyway, apart from that there are loads of endearing characters here from the vegetarian sharks, the loveable ""Peach"" and the characterisation of ""Nemo"" imbues him with an innocence and mischievousness that has to raise a smile - and even engender a bit of concern - as he seems destined for transit in the same plastic bags we all used to use for our goldfish back in the day. The animation is gorgeous and the clever soundtrack (there's even a bit of Herrmann's ""Psycho"" in here) adds loads to enrich this classy and charming adventure. It's really a big screen experience, if you can.",7
23 April 2016,Diving into Finding Nemo,"Pixar has done it again! That is a phrase we have become accustomed to hearing these past few years. Pixar Animation Studios has taken the children's movie industry by storm. Andrew Stanton takes us head first into the beautiful, strangely bewildering, world of the big blue ocean with Finding Nemo. We expected children to be captivated by this new installment of children's animation, but parents are also catching the wave as well. This isn't just some fish tale! Okay, well maybe it is. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a paranoid, highly overprotective clown fish. His son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is a young child full of energy, enthusiasm, with a dash a rebellion thrown in there. Nemo was left crippled at birth after an attack that took his mother and all of his siblings. This leaves NEmo with a deep desire to be independent. This is shown while on a school field trip. Nemo, trying to show off to some friends swims out into open waters. A pair of divers come from the darkness and kidnap Nemo.

Marlin, with the help a newly found and hilariously forgetful friend Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) start the adventure to save the only thing that he has left in this world. Little did they know Marlin and Dory will run into all sorts of roadblocks along the way. They encounter sharks that have sworn off eating fish, a horrifying Angler Fish, a bale of sea turtles, and a forest of jellyfish. All of this just to track down his son. That's what I call being a good dad! Finding Nemo is the perfect mixture of a great story, witty comedy, and enticing animation. The bright colors of the underwater world are extravagant. The dialogue keeps viewers entertained and laughing. While the depth of the story of a father losing his son hooks them in for good. This tale is fit for all, young and old. When a child sits down to watch this movie, they can relate to Nemo. A young child looking to do his own thing and go on some adventures. Nemo grows along the course of the film. He goes from being a rebellious little punk, to someone who understands the importance of family and how much his father loves him. As Nemo grows, any child who watches him grows as well. This is one of many reasons why this is a fantastic movie for children. As Pixar will continue to reel in fantastic stories every year, Finding Nemo will go down as one of their greatest hits. Children and parents are flocking to this new spectacle. This thrilling tale will warm the hearts of fathers everywhere who care for their children. Although Marlin could be a little extreme at times, it was very clear that he would do anything for his Son. I believe I echo the words of everyone saying that we want more from Pixar.",10

8 May 2016,Finding Nemo,"""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish named Marlin losing his son Nemo. This movie is about friendship and how friends can help you accomplish the hardest things in life.

""Finding Nemo"" is story written and directed by Andrew Stanton, produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2003. Finding Nemo is about a clown fish named Marlin looking for his captured son Nemo. In this journey, Marlin meets a blue tang fish named Dory. Dory is a fish that is suffering from memory loss, but she helps Marlin find Nemo. Both Marlin and Dory face great danger, and hard situations in this journey. Meanwhile, Nemo is trying really hard to find a way to get out of the dentist's fish tank and find his way to the open sea in search of his father. But it's not that easy when you have Darla the fish killer (the little girl with the braces).

""Finding Nemo"" is a great Animated Movie. The movie uses amazing shades and colors, great sound effects, and amazing camera angles. In the scene where the diver pops up in front of the screen is amazingly realistic, it makes the audience feel like they are the ones in the movie. It also makes the audience feel like they are the clown fish when a huge human face pops up in front of the camera; the audience would feel small and also panic like Nemo. The director of the movie (Andrew Stanton) did an amazingly great job at animating the movie and adding scenes that will make the audience feel what the characters are feeling.

The theme of the movie is there throughout the whole movie, but the audience realizes it near the end of the movie. The theme of the movie is friendship, and Marlin was able to accomplish his goal when Dory helped him through all the danger they faced. Another place friendship was used was when Nemo was captured in the fish tank in the doctor's office, where Nemo's friends saved his life from getting flushed down the toilet.

""Finding Nemo"" is one of the BEST animated movies Pixar Animation Studios made. I strongly recommend for everyone to watch this movie. This movie would make you feel like you are in the movie and not watching the movie.

1 July 2018,Just brilliant!!,"Finding Nemo did for clownfish what 'Lassie' did for the Collie. Since the release of the film, clownfish are now being referred to as Nemo, with kids exclaiming ""I found Nemo"" when they see one. The film is as endearing as any animated film should be, with fantastic characters and a good plot. Dysfunctional Dory does steal the show, though, wonderfully voiced by Ellen Degeneres. Fantastic animation, cute humor and a few chills and thrills in the mix, as well. One of my all-time favorite animated films.

16 April 2005,Not just for kids,"I've seen this movie at least twice, parts of it four or five times...the humor resonates on all levels (not just age levels, but visual versus audio, double indentures. etc, and reflects realities of modern industrial family and existential experience; it's a simple but great story line (although, much of the entertainment is in a series of vignettes; characters you (well, sort of) care about; spectacular animation. The casting of actors doing the voices is about as good as it gets. One of the amazing things for me in watching this movie a second and third time was the subtleties in the facial expressions and these animated characters. I highly recommend this movie - even for people (such as myself) who don't normally care for animated films.

18 April 2022,Mine!,"A clownfish embarks on a journey to find his missing missing son.

'Finding Nemo' is an excellent animated feature film.

The plot is both character and adventure focussed with a number of memorable moments. Some standard Disney formula is applied, like the controlling parent, but it is a major part of several character arcs that works very well.

For me the opening scene is brilliant and sets up the characters perfectly. Then splitting into two narratives cleverly puts as much emphasis on Nemo's personal journey as it does on Marlin's adventure.

There are lots of fun scenes and characters throughout the movie. I think everything involving Gil, Crush, the seagulls, and the three sharks is classic Pixar. The character Dory, who is a big part of the movie, borders on annoying in some scenes, but not enough to spoil it. Comedy is in the eye of the beholder, so some people may find her hilarious.

Visually it is awesome. The animators created an underwater world that looks realistic and is full of Disney's trademark anthropomorphic personality. The character design is flawless. I also love the sequence with the submarine and naval mines. Plus everything that happens in the fish tank is superb.

The voice performances are excellent as always with Pixar. Albert Brooks leads it well and there are great contributions from the likes of Willem Dafoe, Geoffrey Rush, Andrew Stanton, Barry Humphreys, and others.",9
12 October 2009,A Fun Underwater Adventure,"""Finding Nemo"" is a very well done movie for the whole family. Technically, it has the high quality of animation that Disney/Pixar are famous for, but what it also had was another feature Disney is famous for that hasn't always been clear in some of its more recent work - it's real, and at times sad and tragic, and doesn't get lost in the idea that children should somehow be shielded from the reality that sometimes bad things happen. In an opening that reminded me a bit of Bambi's mom being killed, when clownfish Marlin loses his mate Coral and most of his babies in an attack from a predator you knew that this was not going to be just a silly cartoon. In the aftermath of the attack, Marlin is left to raise his only surviving child Nemo by himself. Not surprisingly, he becomes over-protective, Nemo becomes resentful and in the end Nemo is captured by divers and ends up living in a tank in a dentist's office while his dad desperately tries to find him and rescue him. This runs the whole range of emotions - it's happy, it's sad, it's funny (the sharks who belong to the AA-type group - ""fish are friends, not food"" - are hilarious) and in its own way it's very educational for young ones, as the animation really does give them a sense of what some of these creatures look like. Ironically, probably the worst animation (at least in the sense of not looking anywhere close to real) was of the humans who periodically appear in the movie. Clearly, another winner for Disney/Pixar. 8/10",8

4 October 2020,Funny Fish!,"Finding Nemo is a great addition to a strong list of outstanding animated movies made in the last 20 years.

It ultimately becomes the Nemo and Dory show after a time as both characters steal the movie with some classic cinematic moments.

A simple tale beautifully told via gorgeous animations.

Lots of fun in this really sweet movie :)

4 December 2003,Wonderful!,"A spectacle in every way, this film is guaranteed to delight viewers of all ages. An instant classic, and an example of cinema at its most spellbinding. The animation is cutting edge, the jokes fly thick and fast, there's not too much maudlin sentiment to weigh one down, and the musical score is among the best I've heard in recent years. Flawless!

26 June 2021,One of the most beautiful and well-conceived films from Pixar's early period.,"This film was one of those that marked a generation and consolidated the upward trajectory of Pixar, a studio that, for nearly ten years, had been threatening Disney's monopoly as the top studio in animated film. It wasn't the studio's first feature film to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Film (that honor belongs to ""Monsters Inc."", released two years earlier), but it was, in fact, the first to win the coveted award.

The script is relatively simple: after several incidents, a clownfish that lives in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia leaves in search of his son, Nemo, who goes through several adventures and ends up being caught and placed in a home aquarium in Sydney. To succeed in his quest, the tireless father will rely on the unlikely help of another fish, Dory, a sea creature who really seems to have a loose screw in his head. The script was wonderfully developed and works very well, with a moving story full of emotional moments and adventure, being one of those movies that will please the whole family with ease. The characters were conceived with imagination, creativity and are really nice, they stay in the memory and capture our sympathy.

The film is technically elegant and visually magnificent. To me, it was the most visually beautiful film that Pixar made in its initial period, and it still remains one of the most beautiful made by the studio to date. Colorful, with a vibrant range of colors and excellent contrast and saturation, the film is a sight to behold. The tight stroke, the relative realism of the animation (for the time it was impressive, but today there are clearly better and more advanced features), the way it was edited, all helped to make this film magnificent. The range of voice actors is good, and Ellen DeGeneres deserves all the applause for the inspired and committed way in which she lent her voice to Dory. Also noteworthy are the successful efforts of Albert Brooks, Willem Dafoe, Barry Humphries, Eric Bana and Andrew Stanton. The movie also has a good soundtrack and excellent sound effects.",10
13 January 2004,best of the kids flicks,"Loved it! A simple story well told. I also thoht the voices were good. Including the fantastic Geoffrey Rush. I liked this more than Shrek as it has more soul than Shrek that seemed more cynical. It's the best story in a long time

21 April 2011,Pretty great,"I saw Finding Nemo a LONG time ago.... back when it came out. I was not able to review it until today.

What else can I say about it? It's great, just like every other Pixar film. It's emotionally engaging, visually amazing, and the characters stay with you. The highlight is Dory, the fish whose voice is done by none other than Ellen Degeneres. Hopefully she never makes another animated voice again so this one is even more special because of that. The ending is pretty emotional, and the film tackles some important family themes that will hit hard. This is one of Pixar's best. Go see it for sure!

25 January 2005,nemo...that's a nice name...,"possibly the second best animated movie of all time (first being Aladdin) and it is definitely the funniest!! the story was great, and the jokes are unforgettable. props to whoever played dory, because that was the FUNNIEST talking fish i have ever seen in my life. the fish in tanks were cute, and the turtles were cool. i liked the sharks, and the way nemo's name was constantly mispronounced (fabio, etc.) i wouldn't necessarily recommend it for really little kids, as it was a little sad. but overall, i absolutely loved it. i hope they come up with some sort of sequel that doesn't absolutely ruin it, but even if they don't , it's still an absolutely awesome movie.

25 August 2003,Look What I Found.,"Another excellent production from the Disney Pixar Studios as the only child of a clownfish is kidnapped from the ocean by an Australian dentist. The dentist plans on giving the titled character to his bratty niece and now it is up to Nemo's father and a whole cast of colorful fish, sea life and other animals to help him get his son back. Mind-blowing technology once again endears what could have been a silly cartoon into a cinematic marvel. The film-makers push the envelope on computer generation and succeed with easily one of the finer films of 2003. The colors are bright, vibrant and outrageously loud. A really fun film to watch. Perfect for all. 5 stars out of 5.

25 January 2019,One of the Best Movies,"9 June 2003. Like its predecessor ""Bambi,"" ""Finding Nemo"" represents one of the best examples of animation and one of the best movies I've seen. This movie uses advanced technological animation techniques to enhance a fine, entertaining script that contains solidly comic and dramatic dramatics to produce an excellent and vibrant motion picture experience. The standard for both animated movies and children's films has been raised significantly. Emotionally and aesthetically pleasing, this movie contains a combination of separate motion picture elements that are interwoven into a brilliant exciting almost mini-epic voyage of discovering in a waterworld that breaths of life. The cast of characters are imaginative, the emotional ties some temporary other permanent all have their counterpart in the real world. This movie surely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.

23 August 2020,Anxiety metaphor,"This film is a compelling story of a fish's quest to find his son, brought to life by realistic environs and fleshed out characters. Although there is a lot of humour, especially from the supporting character Dory, the main point of the film is the emotions felt by all. By that I mainly mean anxiety and fear of the unknown which form the real core of their quest.

27 March 2005,Get blown out of the water!,"I saw this film at a 9:40pm show about a good month after it's release date. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but lo and behold Pixar completely blew me out of the water. Finding Nemo is a beautiful and gorgeous film about a clown fish desperate to look for his adventurous son, who has been captured from the ocean and put in a destist's office fish tank. The adventures along the way never stop Marlin's quest from being accomplished. It's a wonderful story on love, determination, and tenderness delivered with pure wit and magic.

The film's visuals are Acadamy Award worthy. I went to Hawaii last Christmas and went snorkeling in a reef and I instantly thought of this film. Pixar animators captured the colour and life of a tropical reef wonderfully, alive with magic, and beauty. And not many films can do that. And the voices are top notch. Ellen Degeneres is side-splitting as the not-so-smart Dory. Other voices provided by Geoffrey Rush, William Dafoe, and Eric Bana are also nice touches.

Whether you have children or you're a child at heart, Finding Nemo deserves to be bought and added to your DVD collection.",
5 December 2021,Relationship between son and father.,"A relationship about independance, liberty, freedom and the causes of it. I enjoyed it because even if its can be seen by kids some of the themes make the movie very adult and can be seen by them. I enjoyed it.

3 March 2023,Still a classic,"Although ""Finding Nemo"" isn't up there with the best of Pixar in my opinion, ie. ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""A Bug's Life"", it's still pretty fantastic, and has most of the hallmarks of what makes Pixar so great.

The movie has less pathos than the Toy Story franchise, but still has a couple of affecting moments, at the very beginning and very end.

I was surprised to see Australia play such a role here. The only location on dry land in the movie is Sydney, namely its harbour and a dentistry. Also many of the characters are voiced by Australian actors, such as Eric Bana, Bill Hunter (R. I. P.), and the legendary Barry Humphries. I wonder why they chose Australia?

Pixar probably does voice acting better than any other animation studio. Here, it's almost all great, with one unfortunate exception: Albert Brooks as Marlin, Nemo's neurotic dad. For the first time watching a Pixar movie I found myself annoyed by one of the voice actors, who kept taking me out of the movie. The character of Marlin needed to be less whiny and neurotic, not more so. Albert Brooks is known as the west-coast Woody Allen for a reason, and I don't think his voice and vocal mannerisms really suited the movie.

Although she seems quite unpopular these days, Ellen DeGeneres's work as Dory, paired with Marlin to save Nemo, really ameliorates the harm done by Brooks to the movie's atmosphere. She also has most of the movie's laugh-out-loud moments.

The other thing is that the movie is less of an adventure than you'd expect from a Pixar movie. There are only really two locations in it - the vast, featureless ocean, and a dentist's office. The ""adventure"" mostly comes from all the different sea-creatures the characters meet in both places (the dentist's office has a fish tank). And Nemo's escape from the fishtank is surprisingly not that visually interesting.

I feel like I'm ragging on ""Finding Nemo"" too much. It's still got more than enough of that Pixar magic to make it a good time. It's a classic animated flick, just not up there with the best of its studio's output.",8
22 July 2020,The film does an outstanding job,"Utterly stunning.

There isn't anything to dislike about 'Finding Nemo', it sets the tone perfectly and expertly tells the tale of Nemo, Marlin and Dory. Considering how the story goes, the film does an outstanding job at seamlessly switching between Nemo's adventure and his father's - it's truly terrifically done.

This also includes a whole bunch of memorable characters and voices. Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are the obvious stars as the early mentioned trio. There's a load of others though, with Willem Dafoe (Gill), Geoffrey Rush (Nigel) and Barry Humphries (Bruce) all giving excellent performances.

The animation is superb, a few moments haven't aged as greatly but the absolute vast majority still looks unbelievable. The premise is funny, cute and heartwarming - as it keeps one's attention from start-to-finish. The score is fantastic, too.

Highly recommended.",9
7 January 2020,finding nemo,"Finding nemo is animated classic for a lot of people who spend their childhood watching it including me,this is one of pixars best films and it is noticable in all sort of ways,animation looks still impressive 17 years later only in some seconds you can see some outdated tiny part,but that is unimportant for this film,finding nemo keeps one of best told stories of father son relationship and their journey to connect each other again,this film will be a great watch for children in a many years to come and i will defienetly show to my own one day i hope,finding nemo is for me one of best animated films of all time with great and insparing story and fascinating and beautiful friendship

4 January 2019,Under the sea... they have parenting problems as well,"A morose and neurotic clownfish named Marlin is raising his son Nemo alone after a barracuda ate his wife and all the rest of his children. (Trust me, it's a family film.) But then Nemo gets taken by Man, that great monster from the above world. And so Marlin has to go and find him. And we have our movie.

I remember seeing this film when it came out and thinking that Pixar had really upped their game. Monsters, Inc. looked nothing compared to this and it's only a couple years older. All the locations underwater are breathtakingly beautiful, even today. Bursting with colour and life, hiding all sorts little details, nooks and crannies. And the fishes look great as well. There's a subtle scale detail on Marlin and Nemo that you only see in close-ups, but it's that extra layer of detail that completely sells it.

True, the human characters are still a bit wonky, but even they have improved a lot from Monsters, Inc.

Unfortunately, what keeps this film from being one of Pixar's all time greats, is the fact that the characters are not as good as they have been up to this point. Marlin especially is an aggravating character with his constant whining and scaredy cat antics. Yes, it's understandable and sympathetic to a point, and he does learn, but it's played up just a bit too much.

Nemo is also a bit underdeveloped, but luckily the film has good characters as well. Chief amongst them being Dory, who's a bit of a one-joke character, but somehow the design, the jokes themselves and the voice acting by Ellen DeGeneres make it work beautifully.

Finding Nemo is quality entertainment, don't get me wrong. It only pales in comparison to other Pixar films, and even amongst them it's up there. Definitely worth a watch for kids and adults alike.",7
18 May 2009,A Joyous Encouragement to Expand One's Experience and Acumen of One's Environment and Inhabitance,"Andrew Stanton's rejuvenation of Pixar by deep-sea adventure is a joyous encouragement to expand one's experience and acumen of one's environment and inhabitance. Look at Marlin, Albert Brooks' clownfish protagonist. In the opening scene, his wife is eaten by a barracuda along with all of their eggs, except for one. Marlin finds that egg and promises it he will never leave it, naming it Nemo. His journey is a testament to the catharsis and philanthropic imposition of chaotic situations, ones that happen within the context of the natural pitfalls of one's existential habitat. Parallel to his titular quest for Nemo is Nemo's own quest for the sanctuary of his father, and so in the superconscious of this deep-sea adventure, opposite energies are negotiated. Marlin's principle of orderly civilization, maintained by fear and the haunting wounds of his loss, is converged with the reality of messy nature. Stanton's precept paints the natural world with a wildly natural brush.

The Pixar films are the American vanguard's long-overdue equivalent of Japan's Ghibli Studios anime films by Miyazaki and Takahata. The reason is that they are creating a new standard for American family films, filtering out the complacence and tampered ideology of the contemporary cartoon-animated Disney films and the like. This has, naturally, been ignored in pertinence to this particular film: The film's prominent use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the animal as pets in America, even though the movie portrays the use of fish as pets with strong negativity and saltwater aquariums as elaborately tricky and expensive to maintain. In Vanuatu, clownfish were being caught on a large scale for sale as pets, motivated by the demand.

But I believe a lot of kids know better. A movie like Finding Nemo portrays nature not only as something to fear and not only as something to seek out, but both, enmeshed in a sort of way that applies to what these characters, Merlin, Nemo, a flighty little regal tang called Dory with Ellen DeGeneres' voice, learn about themselves. They are oppressed by the sea's natural peril, but transformed by experiencing the very nature of the sea.

The film has its handful of cornier moments, bits of humor that are meant more for the clean minds of wholesome children and their mothers, but they do not detract any more than they may in one of Steven Spielberg's more fantastical films for younger audiences. It nonetheless assumes you are absorbed in its world rather than popping it into the VCR during a birthday party. It makes sense, it tells a thematically diverse story, it has lessons, and it's moving. But more than anything, it's fun.",9
18 October 2014,I enjoy this movie so much...,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9

6 June 2003,score another one for Pixar; a blast from start to finish,"Enchanting animated feature about a not so funny clownfish living with the anxiety of being a single father. His parenting skills are suddenly put to the test when circumstances force him to go on an impossible trek through the ocean depths to try and rescue his only son. Yet another engaging, heartfelt tale from Pixar Studios that works just as well for kids as it does for adults; a breathtaking, imaginative view of the aquatic world overflowing with clever ideas, astonishing visuals, along with pleasant humor, aided by a very talented cast of voices. Brooks is simply perfect as a neurotic, overprotective father, DeGeneres even better as his voluble, scatterbrained sidekick; irresistible entertainment for Pixar fans. ***½

29 December 2020,Pixar's most visually beautiful film,"The story of this film-about parental, guardian relationships-is strong Pixar material. There's obvious thematic flourishes-like how Gill is too lax, and Marlin is too protective or how Marlin learns to trust Nemo because of his friendship with Dory. As always the voice case is stellar; I legit think Degeneres (and the character lead animator) should have been nominated in best supporting actress at the Oscars, BAFTAs etc. And of course the film is very funny. But it stands out because of how lush the visuals are.

Some of this is just the setting but the film fully captures the natural beauty of coral reefs and various ocean locales. You can freeze frame basically any shot and you have a breathtaking landscape. The visual splendor is so strong I fear it sometimes overwhelms the emotional core of the story. It is too easy to get lost in the visuals.

9 April 2020,"Another Excellent Blend of Cartoon Excess and Rich, Stirring Humanity from Pixar","After losing his wife and most of their unborn offspring to a predator's tooth, an overprotective father fish goes out to sea in search of his only child, stolen away on his first day of school.

Tons of heart and emotion in this, Pixar's first underwater fetch mission. Unfathomable sights, too, as the screen explodes with hypnotizing colors, impressive environs and staggering changes in scale. The ocean is a marvelous setting for such versatility, not to mention an unusually fresh one, and this team knows when/where to shine the spotlight. It's bright and vibrant like a kids' movie; lush and expansive as an unexplored frontier; sufficiently dangerous to transform any down beat into an opportunity for suspense. There's more than just superficial drama, too, with a deep human experience at its heart: the inner struggle between protecting one's children and allowing them to learn for themselves.

Great voice acting all around, from Albert Brooks (the scarred, neurotic dad) to Ellen DeGeneres (comic relief with a side of simple compassion). Fantastic, playful screenwriting that's capable of exploring timeless, meaningful themes without losing the youngsters along the way. Gorgeous visual effects and cinematography, still (somehow) impressive after almost two decades. Finding Nemo does it all, standing tall as a cornerstone of the now-legendary early Pixar filmography. These guys are masters of the craft.",9

No doubt, ""Finding Nemo"" is a winner in my book and rates as the best animated film I have ever seen, second to Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winner ""Spirited Away"".

15 July 2004,The Disney Fisher King,"`Finding Mula' should the title for the sequel to `Finding Nemo'. Yea! That's it! Here's the hook: Nemo discovers he has a long lost sister, and daddy Marlin (not Jack Mckeon) are on a quest to find sister Mula. Ok! Ok! I know! Sounds kind of fishy! Actually, the `Finding Mula' I am referring to are the astronomical profits of `Finding Nemo'. This is the supreme jewel from the Disney/Pixar winning collaboration. Oceanography will never be the same because of the film's existentialism cinematography. Moreover, the screenplay of Nemo is in the school of the great Disney comical scribes. The acting voices were also primo! Albert Brooks as the neurotic Marlin was simply in the class of Fisher Island. We should also thank the wit queen Ellen Degeneres for her generosity here for her work as the memory-challenged Dory. It was `adoryble'! All in all, I had a whale of a time watching `Finding Nemo'. **** Good

Fellow youth film critic Cheyenne Nguyen, age 8, was captivated by the cinematography and visual effects, sharing, ""The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures."" Morgan Bertsch, age 7, thought that the 3-D makes all the characters really come to life. ""It was amazing. It made you feel like you were really in the ocean. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming."" The father's long journey from the safety of his coral reef home through the vastness of the ocean to where Nemo had been taken in Australia is fraught with danger and even earns him fame among the other creatures of the sea.

It all starts with Coral and Marlin, Nemo's mom and dad looking at all 400 eggs and trying to determine names for each of the eggs. Suddenly, a barracuda comes to the coral and knocks Marlin unconscious. When Marlin wakes up, the reef is empty; with no fish around, the only egg left under the coral is Nemo. Marlin becomes a very protective dad and will not let Nemo out of his sight. However, Nemo is the opposite of his dad. He always wants to swim into the unknown. On the first day of school, Nemo wanders off outside the reef and is captured by a dentist. This starts Marlin's journey to find his son. He swims as fast as he can and asks for help finding Nemo. The only fish that stops to help Marlin is Dory (voice by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory has a big heart and always positive. The only problem is she has short- term memory loss. The story line is the father and son love, unpredictable and very funny. There are so many punch lines in this movie that will keep you laughing throughout the movie. The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures. I can see the layers of rainbow coral reef, several rows of teeth in the mouth of Bruce the shark, the pelican's beak, and jellyfish seem so soft and real. The best 3-D part is with the whale and the krill swimming toward the audience. I love how production and design make Dory velvety, Marlin and Nemo soft and gummy. The rest of the fish are metallic, typical scaly fish. This makes Dory, Marlin and Nemo more lovable. The sound effects of water sloshing and crashing are very realistic. The only part I did not like is what happens to Nemo's mom. Will Disney come back with Nemo reunited with his mom? The lessons in this movie are Marlin deals with his fear and swims all the way to Australia to find his son, Nemo, and he learns to have faith. My favorite character is Dory with her big heart and Crush the laid-back father turtle and his children. The message of this movie is listens to your parents — they only try to protect you and give you good advice. Parents are alive longer so they know a lot more than their children. I rank this movie five out of five stars. I give this film an age range of 3 and up.",10
22 December 2005,A Funny Joy!,"""Finding Nemo"" is a complete joy!

It shows the value of using character actors for voices, rather than bimbos and himbos whose faces you can't see anyway. Not only wonderful are Albert Brooks as a worry wart dad (that's not a fish species) and Ellen DeGeneres (whose character is clearly inspired by Ani Di Franco's song ""Little Plastic Castle"": ""They say goldfish have no memory/I guess their lives are much like mine/and the little plastic castle/is a surprise every time/and it's hard to say if they're happy/but they don't seem much to mind.""), but we get to hear real Australian accents via Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana. Phil Procter (of Firesign Theater) was listed as one of the many ancillary voices -- my husband commented that he could have done all the voices.

The side characters are more than charming -- surfer dude tortoises, 12-stepping sharks and dynamic interactions in a prison, er, aquarium. The references to old movies are very funny, including ""The Birds"" and ""Psycho"" (with credited use of that screechy music).

As a dentist's daughter, though, I do protest the stereotypes about pain and tooth-pulling.

And why do all Disney movies have to have a dead parent?

But at least we didn't have to suffer through the usual schmaltzy ballads as surprisingly this isn't a musical.

It's worth staying for all the credits as the amusing animation continues to the very end.

Though the jokes should appeal to all ages, the toddler running loose in our theater was probably too young, until a character on screen shouted out ""You there, stop!"" and she did, mesmerized wide-mouthed that the movie was talking to her, giving her mother time to catch her and take her outside.

9 April 2017,One of my absolute favorites!,"Finding Nemo is hands down one of my favorite films of all time, and it's not just one of my favorite animated films, but it's one of my favorite films period. The first thing I'd like to cover is the perfect casting for the voices of the characters. Ellen DeGeneres is so perfect to play Dory. Her voice fits the forgetful fish so well! And it works well in the comedic scenes because Ellen is an accomplished comedian, so it makes scenes like speaking in whale hilarious. Albert Brooks is a good fit to voice marlin the clownfish, fits the overprotective nervous single father role well. And the script has such great skillful writing that it gives the characters hilarious lines when it's supposed to be funny, and sentimental/touching when the moment calls for it. The screenplay really did deserve an academy award nomination. The dialogue really gets deep with the character development. It's not just silliness, the movie really focuses on not only the father-son relationship between marlin and Nemo, but also on Dory and her being alone in life and finding solace and peace in the newfound friendship with both marlin and nemo. Animated movies that will please both children and adults like this one is sure to. It's got a little something in it for everyone to enjoy. It's hard for me to believe that there's people out there who still to this day have not seen finding nemo, but I'm sure they're out there, and if you're one of them, go fix this problem! See this great animated classic! 10/10!",10
2 September 2020,Adventure for family.,"This film is extremely adventurous. The protagonist deals with tons of dangers and all kind of interesting situations in order to fin Nemo. There's also a lot of drama imvolved, which makes it slightly more serious than most other animated films. If you love animated or adventure films, you'll probably love this.

25 January 2008,"Amusing, Tender, Beautifully Animated Story Of A Fishy Family Reunion","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",6

25 February 2004,Take your kids along with you,"These more or less anthropomorphic cartoon movies in which animals behave like human beings can convey strong moral messages while at same time amusing your kids a lot. Therefore it's very appropriate to take them along with you. On the other hand they can also feature animals (or some species) as friendly creatures ready to love and be loved and prone to tribulation sometimes too. In this concrete case we have an animal species not very often portrayed: fish. Which can also be nice and attractive like any other animals. I remember now ""Bugs"" another movie featuring a much less attractive species and which was also a good one. If you can make bugs appear as nice beings you can make it with any other kind of animals. Nowadays those movies are all made with the help of computers which makes them much easier to make without by saying this, belittling the directors and other technicians' talents. In this movie fatherly love is the main theme and you can draw the following maxim from the story: kids must obey their parents to avoid getting into trouble. A last word to the images and visual effects. Yes they are beautiful visions of underwater seascape and of the sea bottom, full of colour and fantasy. In conclusion I can say that I've seen better cartoon movies but also some not so good therefore the final conclusion is largely positive.",7
16 June 2020,It was great when it came out and it still is!,"I remember loving it when it came out and after a recent viewing, it hasn't aged a bit and still is one of the best Pixar classics. I would gladly recommend it to any parent with a kid who has never seen it; they would both have a great time watching it together! Bonus: the lack of Disney-style song the kid will want to play on repeat and have the parent wish they'd never showed them the movie.

11 September 2003,superb animated film,"Stanton, who helped write ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."", co-wrote and directed this computer-animated comedy-adventure about finding a very small fish in a very large ocean. Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) is a more-than-slightly paranoid Clown Fish who is extremely devoted to his young son, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould). Nemo is the only survivor after a hungry barracuda swallowed up Nemo's mother and her other offspring. It's not Marlin's nature to explore unfamiliar waters, but when Nemo is captured by a diver near the Great Barrier Reef and ends up in a dentist's fish tank, Marlin gathers his courage and sets out to find his son. As Marlin searches for his son, he makes friends with a friendly but absent-minded Regal Blue Tang named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), a Great White Shark named Bruce (voice of Barry Humphries) who is trying to cut fish out of his diet, a beach-rat Sea Tortoise named Crush (voice of Stanton), and Nigel (voice of Geoffrey Rush), a Pelican who can take Marlin's search from the ocean to dry land. ""Finding Nemo""'s impressive voice cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney, Eric Bana, Stephen Root, Brad Garrett, and Bruce Spence. ""Finding Nemo"" is a superb achievement on three distinct levels. First, the look of the film is gorgeous. The Pixar crew has created a fully realized underwater world. The colors are bright and entrancing, while the movement of the fish is so realistic that the viewer never for a second suspends disbelief. The story is beautifully structured. After establishing the relationship between Marlin and Nemo, the film sets up the separate worlds they each inhabit (the ocean and the fish tank). The screenwriters have dreamed up creative plot points, formulating exciting obstacles (like the wrecking of a filtration system, a dangerous jellyfish zone, and a fish-killing eight-year-old) that allow the film to maintain an exciting pace without sacrificing character or humor. Each member of the cast appears to have been hired for their skills as a performer more than for their name recognition. Brooks, DeGeneres, and Dafoe all communicate real emotional truth in their characters, while such talented vocal performers as Root, Rush, and Humphries lend pitch-perfect comedic support. ""Finding Nemo"" is an inventively written, gorgeously drawn, and perfectly acted animated film.",8

4 October 2005,Stretched but largely enchanting,"Animated tale of clownfish dad and son's attempt to find each other after son's capture by Aussie diver. Dad has to cross miles of sea with new friend Dory in tow, while son finds himself part of an aquarium mini-culture devoted to escape. Although he overplays a tad Brooks is right as worrisome father and DeGeneres is spot-on as forgetful Dory. There are portions of this movie that are as inspired as any Disney entry, including the Dory character, the aquarium scenes and the EAC turtles. But I found some other parts tired or forced (particularly the sharks), and generally feel like they were working too hard to pad this out to a 100 minute running time. Watching this (again & again) with my son I find myself skipping through some of the scenes. The final credits are inspired and as good as any part of the movie.

29 November 2010,Allows me to tolerate Ellen Degeneres' voice for 90 whole minutes!,"A young fish is separated from his (single parent) Father fish, who alongside a dizzy female fish must cross vast oceans and various threats and obstacles in order to get him back Out of everything listed here Nemo is the film I have seen most in the last year, I must have now seen it a dozen times, which is not a bad thing.

The voice acting is superb, the sea bed scenes look spectacular and the film is paced incredibly well and never seems boring, even though I know exactly what happens next I have seen this so often.

It is the bit characters that remain with you with Finding Nemo, the turtles, Bruce the shark and Mr Ray provide much of the funny stuff, and the ever reliable Albert Brooks steps in to make Marlon nervous, paranoid and determined all at once. They even managed to make Ellen Degeneres genuinely likable for the better part of two hours.

(And if you're a Dad the last few minutes might have you tearing up.) What you hope kids will learn: For God's sake listen to your parents every now and then. Trust your friends sometimes and never give up.

What they'll take away: Gee Dad lighten up yourself sometimes.

26 October 2019,My favourite as a kid and still one of Pixar's best,"I have fond memories of watching this film at the cinema as a kid and enjoying every minute of it. The story, the characters, the vibrant animation - I loved everything about it. The reason 'Finding Nemo' was such a success is that it appeals to all age groups, the story and visuals are something everybody can enjoy and the humour is clearly intended to appeal to adults as well as kids.

Pixar created something special when they created 'Finding Nemo' and still to this day it remains one of their best. The word 'timeless' comes to mind as I think, even with the rapid advanced in CGI and animation, this will always be a classic family movie that people will continue to revisit. 'Finding Nemo' is not just a great kids/family movie, but a great movie full stop.

26 April 2022,"This film was released wide in the USA on May 30th, 2003","I have always liked this movie, so much so, that myself and my friends, once set up a white bed sheet on a tennis court fence and watched the film outside, with friends and family on a video projector. I also went back to the movie theaters, when Disney re-released the film in 3D, for the 10th anniversary celebration. It shows this film is awesome on all platforms. Ellen DeGeneres had a busy year in 2003. On top of beginning her long running daytime talk show that year, she also was cast as the voice of Dory for this fantastic CGI animated film from Pixar Animation Studios. Her contribution to the film is excellent and she gives her character a great voice. A voice that would return again in the sequel, Finding Dory (2016). This would be Pixar's fifth film for Walt Disney Productions and Finding Nemo (2003), is so good it almost rivals their classic film, Toy Story (1995), almost. It's modern animation at its best.

It's the story of a young clownfish, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould), who gets separated from his family and his attempts to get back home. His father, Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks), goes out on a search to find him. Along the way, both Marlin and Nemo befriend other creatures of the sea, in order to complete their tasks. Many colorful, humorous, creatively conceived characters come into their paths, such as, a pelican, Nigel (Geoffrey Rush), Bubbles, a yellow tang fish (Stephen Root) and Gill, a disfigured moorish idol fish (Willem Dafoe), just to name a few. This animated adventure takes us all the way across the expansive ocean, as the search for the missing Nemo continues. There also is a separate plotline involving a group of fish, that Nemo gets trapped with, in a fish tank, that sits in a dentists office in Sydney, Australia. It's not a horrible place for Nemo, but his fate from this point on could be worse, as the dentist's daughter is a little monster. It's at this point, that we really begin to fear the danger that Nemo faces. It's a fantastic movie and one that works well entertaining people of all ages.",9
13 November 2003,TROUT NOT KIPPERS,"Well obviously this is ""The Searchers"" underwater, and has references to ""The Shining"", ""Jaws"", ""Psycho"" and many more. Of more importance 2 year old Iris Mathilda loved it. Mum and Dad were entertained too.

It looks beautiful, and should help plasma screen sales in 2004. Not quite a ""Toy Story"" but Pixar have struck gold(fish) again.

16 April 2006,Pixar's 5th and another great movie.,"Finding Nemo is one of the best animated movies of 2003.

It's taken place in the Pacific Ocean and Sydney, Australia.

The story involves Marlin the clown fish who is a single father with his son Nemo. He's been a worry wort about Nemo's first day of school for sometime. He keeps having fears that something bad will happen to his son. After what happened to his wife(which you'll find out why in the movie).

When Marlin took Nemo to school, he kept making sure that Nemo will be OK so he followed the school without being notice. Nemo and 3 other fish found a bottom of a boat and they dare each other to go touch it. nemo took the dare which made Marlin jump out of his hiding place and warn Nemo not to go near it. Without any surprise a sucubadiver comes out of nowhere. And takes Nemo away.

Marlin is now after the boat that took his son. He's going to be on a long journey in finding his son.

Finding Nemo is another must see Pixar Movie. It's perfect for the whole family to watch. There's nothing that would offend any young viewers. It's a real treat.",8
26 December 2020,The pinnacle of creativity,"Not just computer technique to actualize complicated ocean, sea creatures, and marine algae. How the screenwriter brings each species' characteristics into his or her character. For example, jellyfish having poison and anglerfish leaving in the deep sea and tempting small fishes with the light greatly affect Marlin's adventure. In small scale, octopus shooting ink when scared and vegetarian shark relapsing after smelling blood are fun laughs.

30 May 2008,"A well-deserved success from Pixar, with so much to like!","As I'm sure you know, Pixar made their feature-length debut with ""Toy Story"", which turned out to be a huge hit, and without a doubt, they've made a good number of other massively successful movies since then. I went to see a good bunch of films on the silver screen back in 2003, probably more than I ever had in a year before or in any year since, but unfortunately, ""Finding Nemo"" wasn't one of them. However, I first saw the Pixar hit on DVD in early 2004, and was very impressed! I've seen it more than once since then, and it seems to hold up well.

Marlin and his wife, Coral, are two clown fish who are about to become parents. Sadly, however, a predator soon comes, before their young are born, and knocks Marlin unconscious! When he awakens, he soon discovers that he is now a widower, and only one egg has survived the attack! Marlin names his one surviving offspring Nemo. When Nemo gets older, he starts his first day of school, but not long after he starts, he is caught by a scuba diver and taken away to a fish tank in a dentist's office by a harbour in Sydney, Australia! So, Marlin bravely sets out through the oceans to try and find his son, and soon meets a blue tang named Dory, who suffers from short term memory loss. She joins him on his adventure, and together, they face the dangers of the ocean as they try to make their way to Sydney! Meanwhile, Nemo and the other fish in the tank make plans to somehow escape, before the young clown fish is given to a rough little girl as a present the next time she comes for a check-up!

Some of the humour in this Pixar effort may be more for kids than adults, but this isn't usually the case. There's a lot to amuse adults as well. The last time I watched this film, I found some laughs around the beginning, but wanted more, which was eventually what I got, I think starting with the part where Dory, voiced by comedienne Ellen DeGeneres, comes in, as she is a memorably humorous character. There are other characters who add humour as well, including the seagulls, who say ""Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!"" when they see creatures they want to eat, as well as certain fish in the tank with Nemo, and certain creatures Marlon and Dory meet on their adventure, such as the sharks. Speaking of characters, that's another upside to this film, the characters are usually likable, whether they're funny or not. Another merit is definitely the very colourful and 3-D animation! Last but not least, it's a good story, with a fair amount of excitement, as well as slightly touching moments.

While ""Finding Nemo"" may not be a perfect family film, I would say it definitely comes close, so it's no surprise that it turned out to be such a big hit! It seems Pixar really knows how to appeal to kids and adults alike, and this effort of theirs does not hide that! The film wasn't around when I was a kid (I was a teenager when it came out), so I'll never know what it's like to see it during childhood, but since it's not strictly for kids, I wasn't too late. Probably for computer animation fans of all ages, there's lot to like, including the things I've mentioned above, as well as maybe other merits which I've failed to mention, though I'm sure others have pointed them out already.",9
21 October 2006,Finding Movie Making at its best,"What a delightful film. It's difficult to crack a top ten list, which hasn't changed in seven years (since Dances with Wolves), but this movie gets in my top ten. Ellen Degeneres' Dory creates her own chemistry with the sea and all the characters with whom she interacts. Yes, there is a special spark between Dory and Nemo's protective father fish, voice by Albert Brooks. Degeneres character would test the most stodgy and stoic of audiences. Who could mot crack a smile under Dory's amazing repertoire of forgetfulness and forget-me-nots?

Who knew Nigel (Pelican from down under) was voiced by Geoffrey Rush? I think we are all still throwing in our own ""mine, mine..."", whenever we find the opportunity. All the way to the end and beyond (don't forget to watch the credits!)it's a story of adventure, heroism and love. Even if you think you a have an aversion to animated features, I double dog dare you to watch this movie, and try NOT to crack a smile. Nemo will wear you out with laughter, and make your heart grow fonder. Even if you thought you didn't have one (a heart that is).",10

20 November 2004,"Entertaining, but not HIGH CLASS Disney stuff","While Nemo certainly entertains it is in no way a classic. In fact, disregarding 'A Bugs Life' I think it is the worst collaboration between Pixar and Disney. While watching the film, I felt that the emotional depth of the events could have been explored a lot more and I also felt that the film was not as funny as other animated films I've seen. To be honest, I felt that there wasn't that much magic around this time. I found Dory to be the most annoying fish ever (I can safely say that she wasn't funny 5 % of the time and annoying 95%) and frankly I felt that the other characters weren't too good either. I mean I liked Nemo and Gill and I thought everything with Crush in it was pretty cool, but in the end I felt that the majority of the characters just were NOT likable and cute enough. Also the film seemed to suffer from the lack of a true villain. All in all, this is an entertaining film, your kids will truly enjoy, but as far as adults are concerned, this one might have fared better if there would have been more magic, better characters and maybe even a shorter running time. Not the MUST-SEE it is made out to be and certainly not one of Disney's best. Well certainly it won an Oscar, but hey, when was the last time THAT meant something, not to mention that from what I've heard there wasn't much competition (as in ""the other 2!!! films had even less quality).

7 out of 10

post scriptum: I rented the 2-DVD set and must say that the animated short ""Exploring the Reef"" is even worse than Finding Nemo itself (a small 6 out of 10), thus making the animated short ""Knick Knack"" (bigger 7 out of 10 than NEMO) from 1989 the best thing (in more than one way) on the 2 discs",7
14 March 2015,~~^~/\~FiNdiNg~neMo~\__/~j~~,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
18 May 2005,Here Fishy Fishy Fishy Fish,"Finding Nemo: 6/10: As a kid's movie Finding Nemo is great. If somehow your munchkins don't already own a copy, have the toys or God forbid seen the ice show (there is something about fish on ice that's a bit creepy. Funny but creepy.) Feel free to buy a copy. You'll get your moneys worth, as the little animatrons will undoubtedly view it endlessly.

But as an adult with no little minds of my own to feed the movie left me wanting. For one thing I've seen it before... about a hundred times before. Parent loses kid, kid loses dog, dog loses family, family loses toy, and so forth. Then the endless journey filled with danger, setbacks and endless comic relief characters begins. Finding Nemo, at least narratively, doesn't bring anything new to the party.

The fact that Pixar themselves are guilty of using this exact same plot in all their movies doesn't help matters. (Pixar's next feature The Incredibles would actually break this trend somewhat and is the most adult friendly toon of theirs to date) The simple fact is after being spoiled by Shrek (or even Ice Age) I like my kids films to be more accommodating to adults.

Not that some things don't work very well indeed (Bruce the 12 step shark and the ""mine, mine, mine,"" seagulls are particularly effective). It's just that the whole film had a cloying sentimentality I usually associate with NBC Olympic coverage or a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie about a Depression Christmas.

That said kids will love it. The animation is spectacular. And as these things go it certainly is very well done. Just not my cup of tea I guess. I prefer my fish with a little more bite and lemon and butter.",6

29 July 2004,A new age classic.,"When it comes to animation,I consider myself a devout traditionalist. I will always prefer hand drawn animation over computer any day of the week.However,there is no escaping the fact that this is a well done, entertaining film from Disney and Pixar.Keeping in mind the fact that fish,or anything else under water,can't talk,it's as if we are looking into an aquarium or watching actual undersea footage for the duration of the film.It is excellent family entertainment from start to finish. Pixar and Disney always seem to come up with a magical combination of near perfect animation right down to gestures and eye movements,and perfect voice casting.Ellen Degeneres is particularly hilarious as Dory. What we have here is a new age classic that even traditional,old fashioned people like myself can enjoy.

30 July 2018,"Oh Pixar, you keep on doing it!","Finding Nemo is yet another creative idea filled with memorable characters in a touching story about trust, family, teamwork and all the good stuff.

No character without memorability or a reason for doing what they do. Nwemo's father, Marlin, is overprotective, but since Nemo is his only son after a tragic loss at the time of his infancy you can't blame him for it.

It is much more a story aimed towards parents, and that's great, because that is a strong argument against the misconception that animation is just for children.

And Ellen DeGeneres makes us all crack open in laughter and still maintains a sense of importance to Marlin learning a lesson.

All characters are memorable, the story is beautiful, the animation was groundbreaking for its time and still looks great. What more could you want from an animated feature?",10
1 August 2005,A cut above....way above,"I saw Monsters, Inc. and thought it was a good film, but the animation and plot were a predictable technological evolution to the old Saturday morning cartoons. I couldn't bear Toy Story or A Bug's Life, so I'm definitely not a fan of the Pixar style, but this film transcends its genre and is one of the all-time classics, animated or not. All that is required for an incredible viewing experience is the suspension of a few minor disbeliefs: fish can't talk, and their eyes are on the sides of their heads (not their foreheads). That said, we have a nearly perfect film in that it couldn't have easily been improved upon.

Before I continue, let me give credit to what makes this film perfect rather than merely great: ELLEN DEGENERIS. She should have gotten the Oscar for Best Actress with her portrayal of Dory, a character that could easily have been butchered by a weaker talent. Without her performance, this film is just Monsters, Inc. with better animation and a slightly better plot. Of the other actors, Albert Brooks is predictably competent as Marlin, while Willem DaFoe's jaded Gill is a treat for all ages. The remaining cast was decent, but interchangeable.

As for the plot, it's simple: Marlin and Coral are proud parents of 400 eggs, all but one of whom (along with Coral) are killed in the opening sequence by a shark, which sets the tone of the movie in that we are repeatedly reminded that the Ocean is an underwater jungle. This is also a main strength of the movie in that the other fish in the ocean are portrayed as more than plot devices, and have lives (and goals) of their own, many of which involve putting Marlin (and Dory) in harm's way.

The surviving egg, Nemo, is captured by a scuba diver and winds up in a fishtank in a dentist's office with a group of ""POW"" fish who are always trying (and failing) to escape. The ""secret world of fish"" angle does seem appropriated from Dr. Doolittle 2, but this can be forgiven as necessary for the plot. The story is a coming-of-age one not for Nemo, but for Marlin, whose quest for his lost son distracts him from his normal phobia of the ocean, sending him on an adventure which is inspirational as well as educational. I learned more about the ocean from watching this film than in all of my school years put together! Children under 12 should not watch this movie without an adult, as some of the scenes are downright scary, but this only adds to the realism of the film.",10
30 May 2023,"Finding Nemo still holds up after 20 years with engaging drama, relatable characters, and some of the most beautiful animation","I remember seeing this in theaters back in 2003 when I was 9 years old and loved it so much. 20 years later, I still love it I consider it one of the best Pixar films since the Toy Story trilogy.

The animation is beautiful with some of the most breathtaking underwater effects while the character designs of the fish are both cute and expressive. The music score from Thomas Newman is both beautiful and haunting which enhances the dramatic tone of the movie. The story is superbly written as you understand Marlin's motivations in keeping Nemo safe after the death of his wife which makes the overprotective father cliche work. In fact, it even fleshes out the side characters especially Dory, a fish with short term memory loss, who is not only a good comic relief, but shares some good chemistry between Marlin. Even the other side characters like Crush the turtle and Nigel the Pelican are entertaining as they help the main two characters on their journey to find his lost son.

The characters are both likeable and relatable at the same time with some superb voice performances. Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres and Alexander Gould both did great in their respective roles while the supporting actors like Willem Dafoe, Geoffrey Rush, Andrew Stanton Barry Humphries (who passed away last month R. I. P), Eric Bana, Brad Garrett, Allison Janney, etc, all did good jobs as the side characters especially Gill.

Overall, Finding Nemo still holds up after 20 years since it's release. :)",10

Nemo's father then meets Dory, a hilarious absent-minded fish and they go on many adventures together in order to find Nemo. The movie had many laughs and excitement. A great family movie.

5 April 2020,My all time favorite 9/10,"I love Finding Nemo!. It is considered one of the best Pixar pictures ever and definitely a game changer. What i love so much about it is the great dynamic between marlin and dory. The jokes are great. And I've seen this movie too many times to not like it. Besides it is very emotional and Pixar are always masters at creating emotional movies that can be so fantastic. The whole journey is full of excitements and key moments. Many messages are planted in this movies such as: father and son relationship and how you gain friends in unexpected ways.

25 December 2007,Grab Shell DUDE!!,"If I could rate this movie higher than 10, I most definitely would!! Pixar has done a phenomenal job over the last several years! Antz was horrible. Finding Nemo is a personal favorite of mine! The humor is innocent, yet, I have line's memorized, and I can't stop laughing!! One of my favorite actor's, Sir Willem Dafoe, who provides the voice of Gil, play's Norman Osborn/Green Goblin in the Spider-Man franchise, did a phenomenal job!! The acting is great by all the voice talents. Ellen Degeneres is hysterical as the short term memory struggling blue fish! The story line is great. This is a great movie for everyone! I enjoyed this a lot more than Shrek The Third!! This is a MUST for Disney fans!!

24 November 2005,Cute but annoying,"'Finding Nemo' is a touching little story about a cute little clownfish who gets separated from his father. The father sets out on a journey to find Nemo, the lost little clownfish, and he meets several new friends along the way, including a blue fish with memory problems named Dori and a group of Australian turtles.

The story is a cute one with a wide range of characters that will appeal to children and events that are frightening and challenging that the father must go through in order to find his son. It's a typical children's cartoon, really, using the ideas of other stories before it.

The animation is done well - particularly under the water, which is difficult to animate. However, the pacing of the film gets a little bit slow in some places. While the father is searching for Nemo, the events seem to go on and on. Also, I found Dori to be very trying and annoying. The jokes about her and memory loss went on far too long, and I just found this to be too annoying. Children may like that, but it made the film less enjoyable for me.

Overall, I would rate this as an average film - particularly over other children's films. I cannot fault the animation, though.",4
16 October 2003,"Call me unpopular, but...","This is great entertainment, don't get me wrong, but i can't help feeling that Disney is cheating the consumer by making movies more like products than artworks. There are some new jokes in this movie, but they've just used the same formula they've been using since Walt was a boy.

When Shrek first came out, i thought - wow! Disney has taken a big leap here. It was clever, satirical, and hugely funny.

Then, when Monster's Ink, Toy Story 2 and then Finding Nemo came out, it made me remember every single handdrawn Disney since the forties - there's always two people, usually males, a big person and a little person, at first they don't get along, and at the end they realise the most important thing - their friendship. Shrek and Donkey, Buzz and Woody, Sulley and Mike, Flik and the circus bugs, Simba and Nala, Timon and Pumba, Fox and Hound, Beauty and Beast, Lilo and Stitch, Mermaid and Flounder, Lady and Tramp, Mannie and Sid (Ice Age), Dumbo and Timothy Q Mouse, Pinnochio and Jiminy Cricket, Alladin and Abu, the list goes on. Ooh, i almost forgot: Marlin and Dory.

It was sweet the first time, but by now its tired. The latest toy off the production line is ""Brother Bear""... need i say more?

Give us something remotely new, innovative, like the small step forward Shrek was.",6
9 January 2009,Charming film with outstanding animation quality,"Finding Nemo is a thoroughly charming animated feature and continues Pixar's dream run. Telling the story of how a clown fish struggles to reunite with his son, the film has a slightly scary beginning and invokes memories of Bambi's mother! The animation quality is stellar. Special mention for the dream-like jellyfish scene with its hidden menace. Ellen Degeneres steals the show with her wisecracks. Albert Brooks is occasionally annoying as the over-protective dad. The film is just a bit too long and could have been trimmed. It has a 'three hanky' emotional ending and you will probably leave the film with a smile on your face.

Overall 8/10

24 January 2004,Overall pretty good,"This is a well-executed film that is pretty entertaining. The animation is great (kudos to Pixar again) and the folks who provided the voices were spot on - except one, that is. The character Crush sounded like a VERY poor imitation of Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I'm a huge fan of that film and so I didn't take to the imitation. Other than that, this is a thoroughly entertaining piece of work, and one that the folks who put it together can be proud of.

13 September 2006,"Overrated, But Still A Good Movie","""Finding Nemo"" is obviously a good movie. But, like many Pixar films, it's overrated. It seems they give more attention to CGI movies than older animated classics like ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"", that deserve to be in the Top 250 instead of this kind of film. There are good Pixar films, like ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"", but I don't think that it deserves to rank the 2nd best Disney film ever behind only The Incredibles. Now, they also leave out ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"", ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"", and other classics created during Disney's life. This is a very good movie, but I think it deserves the highest rating of a 7.3 or 7.4.

23 November 2012,Great animated movie.,"I have always like animated movies and as the time goes on to my delight the animation keeps getting so much better and this is one of the movies that depicts that. Everything looks so well done and easy on the eye its just great. The acting is good and the story line is heart warming with many humorous moments.

This movie is about a young clown fish named Nemo who while on his first day of school gets snatched up by a diver. He is taken away and his father although terrified of the open ocean goes on a hunt for his only son.

This movie is very enjoyable from start to finish. It will make you laugh and at the end it make you tear up. Just a great family movie or anyone who loves animation.

26 December 2007,I was just so bored ...,"Judging from the reviews I just read of Finding Nemo, it looks like there are two kinds of reviewers: those who want a film that mirrors and idealizes their lives, no questions asked, and those who want a film that raises interesting questions. I'm in the latter category and as such, I have to say that this was perhaps the most boring and vapid film I have ever watched. For me, watching replicas of family, school life, dentists' offices, etc. without some sort of commentary just isn't interesting. And no, beautiful animation is not enough. So maybe we need to revisit the eighteenth century, when people -- Americans included -- were proud to think, question, and use reason in their everyday existence. Maybe that would produce an animated film that would allow Nemo and his dad to move beyond platitudes, tell the audience something new, and actually be funny (jokes in the Eisenhower era were funnier than this film). ""Sapere Aude!"" Thank you, Immanuel Kant.

1 August 2003,No wonder everyone likes this one. It's great!,"Hey, I was skeptical. All the flap...over a fish cartoon? But, as the rave reviews came surfing in, my suspicions grew. What could be good about a fish searching for another fish...? My grandkids came to town and drug me along. AND, I loved it!

This has got to be the best Disney in a long, long time. This has great personal emotional moments without being maudlin and sentiment without being overly sweet. The bad guys are not evil...they're just on the other side of the firing line. The AA-like ""Fish are friends, not food"" sharks with their meetings, saluting and confrontations (""Denial!"") are hilarious, as is the dentist and his kid-from-Hell niece, with the braces and music from Psycho.

There's just lots in this film to enjoy-- for everybody. Hey, I'd go again, if the kids would only ask me.

18 February 2015,Best Anime FIlm Ever,"I really enjoyed this movie from day one. I can't help but to find myself watching 'NEMO"" every now and again. This movie has a great story line, and will keep you anxious based on the characters. I will have to say that ""DORI"" played by the wonderful Ellen DeGeneres would be my favorite character in the whole movie. I love how comedic she is. She is clumsy, forgetful, and well you will just have to watch the movie to really she how funny she is. This movie is perfect for all ages, I'm 19 and I still watch it. I can't tell you how excited I am for the movie ""Finding Dori""to come out. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Definitely a 10/10.

2 March 2008,A unique film.,"This is arguably the most beautiful and most captivating of all the Pixar films to date. It is good for most children because they will like the characters, find it funny and exciting and learn valuable lessons. Adults may like it because of the beauty of the CGI, the characters and the feeling of charm and a different kind of friendship and love in this film. Adults and children may feel sad with love for the film and the characters when catastrophes happen, they may feel happy when there are funny scenes and when something good happens to the characters.

This is one truly magical, beautiful and entertaining film, possessing few flaws and just about every quality an animated film should possess.

The storyline of the film is exciting and captivating - also funny. It starts sadly, when a mate of a clownfish dies, Coral, the mate of Marlin. All of their eggs are also eaten - save one egg. Marlin calls the little fish inside (the name that Coral wanted to give one of their babies) Nemo. A few fish years later, Nemo is ready to go to school, but Marlin is an incredibly protective father and is not so sure. Despite his worries, he lets the eager Nemo go to school, but is still cautious. It turns out he has a right to be - when Nemo is captured by divers! Marlin does the unthinkable, he goes out into the open ocean to find his son - encountering dangers and a new friend (Dory) on the way...

Good for just about everyone. I hope you enjoy ""Finding Nemo"", whoever you are!",9
29 August 2023,One of the better Disney movies out there,"Dang, this was created 20 years ago? That can't be right. It came out in 2003 which is only... 1...3....5...7... ugh 20 years ago.

Well I will say this for a 20 year old cgi movie it's hard to tell how old it is, the way they designed the graphics for it, it seems pretty timeless.

The story has to involve an orphan and dead parent(s) because it's disney right but even though Disney uses the same old formula over and over this one feels a bit difference because it's less about the kid this time and more about the widowed parent trying to keep his only son from harm but really only ending up totally neurotic from the whole thing.

A nice play on an old style. Would recommend this one to anyone as it's fit for young and old alike.",8
26 January 2011,Overrated,"I don't hate this movie but it's not as perfect as everybody says it is. When I first saw it I loved it but looking back on it, it just doesn't hold up to me as it did before. I can understand why Marlin is so over protective over his son because he lost his wife and other kids. But for one Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) was annoying. A lot of people say that Dory is funny but I disagree I thought she was irritating. I just wanted to strangle her. She kept on forgetting everything. At around the end of the movie she says to Marlin (Nemo's dad) that she ""Remembers stuff whenever she's around her"" Um I have to call BS on that because the only thing she could remember was Sydney and she couldn't remember anything else. And the sharks. The sharks are hypocrites. They say that ""Fish are friends! Not food!"" but you clearly see a shark with fish bones in its mouth. That's really hypocritical! Sometimes Marlin got annoying with how overprotective he was. I mean god I thought Simba was over protective in Lion King 2 but Marlin tops him! The music in the movie is nothing special. You might think that I hate this movie because of the negative things I have said about it no I don't hate it. I liked the turtles, the birds that repeatedly said ""Mine!"", the main character that was a bird that helped Marlin and Dory. The plot was good enough to keep me interested but as I have said, it's overrated. Doesn't top Toy Story 1-3. So I give Finding Nemo a 6 out of 10.",6
1 June 2023,So Much Good to Find,"""Finding Nemo"" is a 2003 Pixar Animated film about a clown fish named Marlin trying to rescue his son Nemo. When it came out it was one of the highest grossing animated films of all time, making over 840 million dollars at the box office. On top of that, it was a critical darling, being nominated for 4 Academy Awards. What do I think of the movie? Yeah, it is really that good.

I watched this film when it first came out as a 12-year old, and I enjoyed the film. I thought it was funny and at times heat-warming. Since then, I have gotten the opportunity to re-watch this movie quite a bit. It was my nephew's favorite movie, so he would want to watch it a lot. At school it was a go to movie for the substitute to put on to entertain the students. In total, I have seen this movie over 20 times in my life. And upon these numerous viewings I have grown to appreciate the beautiful details the story tellers at Pixar have put together.

This is a very tightly told story. Every bit of dialogue moves the story forward, reveal something about the character, foreshadows something to come or gives a good joke, sometimes it does all of this at once. This is an impressive feat considering that one of the main gimmicks of a main character is how forgetful she is. You would think that would mean that they have to repeat a lot of the same information again. But, no, the team use her in very clever ways throughout the whole runtime.

The set ups and pay offs they have in this movie are things that film classes should be studying. They are able to convey a message that kids can understand, while at the same time not coming across as preachy or heavy handed. The ending when all the story beats come together is clever, intense and funny all at the same time. Speaking of the ending, the beginning is also one of the best cold opens to any movie. An absolute gut punch right out of the gates.

The animation is beautiful, all the emotional beats work, the characters grow in believable ways and it is an enjoyable ride from beginning to end. I highly recommend watching it, you don't have to watch it 20 times to realize that this is fish movie is gold.",9
23 June 2007,morality tale,"I am interested mostly of the effect of this movie on young kids, not on the adults dragged along.

Most of animations are terrifying -- being stuck in the mouth of a whale, being surrounded by flocks of seagulls, being caught in a net. Animation's ability to exaggerate makes these events shocking. I remember being five watching Snow White terrified out of my mind hiding under my seat. Perhaps today's kids are more jaded.

The movie sees human activity through fish eyes, and the mindless destructiveness of human activity. Just as Bambi put children off hunting in my generation, Finding Nemo should work against commercial fishing for this one.

Nemo and his father are repeatedly caught in totally hopeless situations, but the both refuse to surrender and by the skin of their teeth prevail. This is great conditioning for kids. Dory's ditzy lack of understanding of the danger takes a little of the edge off the terror, even though logically she is adding to the predicament.

I laughed when it turned out the arch villain of the show was a little girl who liked to buy pet fish then not care for them.

As an adult, the schmaltzy opening between Marlon and Coral was just so anthropomorphic it put me off. I would have preferred a slightly more realistic representation of fish ""thoughts"". The characters were just too crass to be clown fish. It just did not fit.

That's an odd criticism coming from someone who found a Meercat in the Lion King doing the hula was the funniest thing I ever saw.

One final comment. Albert Brooks as Nemo's father sometimes appeared to be channeling the late Sterling Holloway.",8
10 June 2020,Finding Nemo,"Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2 and ""Monsters, Inc."" are some of my favorite family films; ""Finding Nemo"" isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like ""A Bug's Life,"" and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.

As always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In ""Toy Story"" they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" they showed us the monster world. In my review on ""A Bug's Life,"" I said that the reason the film didn't work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because ""Finding Nemo"" is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.

This tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.

Years later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot's son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)

Pixar doesn't let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.

""Finding Nemo"" gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist's office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe's vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist's tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie ""Platoon"" might have something to do with that.

This is taken from my ""Monsters, Inc."" review: ""Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my 'Toy Story' review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for 'Toy Story 3') and gives them the bare minimum.

With ""Finding Nemo,"" I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they separate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know",8
1 August 2003,Finding Nemo: 6/10,"The line between fantasy and reality is becoming rapidly blurred. It seems that all computer-animated movies are doing extremely well, while the hand-drawn ones seem to be either direct-to-video sequels nobody wanted, box office bombs, or have horrendous ideas. Finding Nemo may soon be the highest grossing animated movie ever, simply because it's easy to look at. It's not as good as Pixar's other movies because it lacks the one key ingredient that made Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. work so well. Most kids never feared of being taken away by a man and being put into a fish tank in a dentist's office. However, I don't think there's a child alive who never thought that their toys moved when they weren't there or that there were monsters in the closet. Because of this, Finding Nemo couldn't connect as well, because, simply, it wasn't something that anyone thought of in real life.

The plot has Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clownfish who can never tell good jokes, with his wife Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) (where DO they get these names?), who just moved into a new home. A shark, however, eats Coral and all but one of her eggs. A few years later, Marlin raises Nemo (Alexander Gould) in an overprotective environment. To prove his dad wrong, Nemo swims out into the open ocean and is scooped up by a diver. Marlin goes on a search to find Nemo, and, along the way, meets over-the-top Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss.

Finding Nemo has lavish landscapes. It really looks like the ocean, and, although none of the fish or creatures in the ocean looked real, they were well done. The best animation that Pixar does is with real things (like in the opening short, Knick Knack). Although they have some work to do with humans to make them look realistic, a few scenes, set in a doctor's office, looked incredibly real. Maybe if Pixar and PDI (who did Shrek) exchange secrets than Pixar could have better looking humans and PDI could have more realistic surroundings.

The only character that made me constantly laugh in this comedy was Dory. Although most of the target audience would not understand most of it, her short-term memory loss was a genius addition to the script. She was so uninhibited, it was really hilarious. However, Brooks, as Marlin, didn't really do much for me. If his ability to not be able to tell a joke had been played out more, it would've worked more. His paranoid behavior also ebbed and flowed, while if he had another quirk that he could do throughout the movie, would've worked more, also. The fun part about animated movies is all of the voices. I couldn't tell most of them, but I did recognize Willem Dafoe. Others include Allison Janney, Brad Garrett, Erik Per Sullivan, Stephen Root, Vicki Lewis, and Geoffrey Rush.

There's not a real moral to Finding Nemo. What is there to learn? All I've learned is from the opening credits that snowmen desperately want to leave their snowglobes. Basically, Finding Nemo won't go into the same category as Toy Story or Monsters, Inc.. Instead, it'll probably go into the `forgotten' category like A Bug's Life.

My rating: 6/10

Rated G.",6
7 June 2020,Great,"Oscar-winning animation of the category in 2003, Finding Nemo was a huge box office hit - estimated at about $ 871 million worldwide - and marked the memory of millions of viewers, children or not, worldwide, for their affection , friendliness and humor of his fish-characters.

Many people identified, in fact, with the lack of notion and memory of the lovely Dory, the little fish that accompanies the protagonist, Marlin, in the long journey across the ocean in search of the lost little boy, Nemo. In the original version, too, Ellen DeGeneres won a well-deserved award, The MTV Movie, for best comic performance. The other original voices are: Alexander Gould (Nemo) and Albert Brooks (Marlin). But, in this relaunch in 3D, only dubbed versions will be available.

As a matter of fact, the new 3D version does not strictly add anything to the excellent animation - whose strength is what most of the genre (and not just him) lack, good scripts. The ingredients for general identification are all there: parent-child relationship; overprotection after tragically losing his wife; the son's desire to show courage and challenge the limitations of a slightly defective fin; the inexhaustible generosity of friend Dory, despite her own limitations; overcoming countless dangers, including environmental ones, to be victorious at the end of the journey.

Putting it all together in a beautiful and detailed underwater scenery, in which sharks, turtles, dolphins and all kinds of fish coexist and cooperate, the drawing becomes an epic adventure, tempered with humor. It was not for nothing that, in 2008, the American Film Institute nominated Finding Nemo as one of the ten best animated films of all time. He deserves it - 3D is just cute to please today's fashion, but it doesn't hurt either.

I liked this criticism of Cineweb

Film reviewed on the 6th to the 7th of 2020.",9
13 June 2006,Beautiful Film,"What makes this so special is about this is the story, the touching story about father and son; and also friendship. This is a great work of our beloved Pixar Animation, and once again they prove that they are still looking for quality rather than anything else.

After his son was taken away by the screwdriver, a crown fish father tried to search the whole ocean for him, with the help of his short-term memory friend, and the entire ocean of sea creature.

There is no doubt of how great the story is, it consists of everything - humor, good solid character, brilliant plots, good pace, and with great story comes great movie. There are also loads and loads of characters in the movie change from one place to the other, this make sure you'll never get bored. The action are also very consistence. Ellen did absolutely a brilliant job renting her voice, so is other actors.

I love this movie and without doubt so is millions of people both adult and kids. It is so famous that nowadays people called crown fish ""Nemo"". From my experience this is definitely one of the best animation movie ever created. I have so much fun watching it, and definitely a must own movie.

Recommendation: The World Best Animation Movie.

Rating: 10/10 (Grade: A+)

21 April 2004,"""Wow, he's a clownfish, oh, c'mon tell us a joke.""","Finding Nemo is another classic film by the pixar production studios. I loved this film very much. It's not just a kiddy film but u can still be 95 and see this movie. It's hilarious especially when Bruce and the sharks have a meeting with Marlin and Dory, also another one is when Dory is speaking whale. This movie has wonderful humor and jus flat out hands down the best animated movie ever recorded in movie history. The story of the film was actually good to of when Marlin loses his son by divers and comes to save him while meeting all other types of sea creatures. This movie is just excellent and is never boring or slow. Great job Andrew Stanton!! Once again you pulled it off.

1 June 2003,Pixar's Excellent Fish Story,"Ever since they made their feature-film debut with ""Toy Story,"" the Pixar studio has proven itself as the master of computer animation. Now, with their latest feature, ""Finding Nemo,"" they have outdone themselves. The visuals are excellent, filled with eye-catching details (including the formations of the fish school). The story is great as well, containing both laughs and heartfelt moments. Albert Brooks is perfectly cast as the voice of Marlin, the neurotic clown fish father to Nemo. Ellen DeGeneres also puts in a funny performance as Dory, a blue tang with a short-term memory. Other memorable characters include Bruce, Anchor and Chum, the trio of sharks, and Crush the sea turtle. One great detail was the epilogue, which was an original replacement for Pixar's formulaic ""blooper reel."" So I think we can call ""Finding Nemo"" the new jewel in Pixar's crown.

14 January 2014,Entertaining,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
14 March 2023,Aren't Disney & Pixar pathetic?,"You CANNOT dislike Finding nemo, or despicable you... But my dislike might just come from my thalassophobia, not gonna lie!... I wouldn't say I dislike animation at large, though. When I had small children and looked for something to watch with the family, I did choose & favour animation. The list is long. I took my children to see The Care Bears (ugh) Basil, the Rodent Sherlock Holmes (OK) Roger Rabbitt (marvelous) The Simpsons (very amusing) Aladdin (ditto) Thumbelina (weakish) The Lion King (best of them all) Toy Story (very fine) Hunchback of Notre Dame (OK) Hercules (OK) Mulan (OK) and so on and so forth, including Nemo.

28 September 2022,This is one of the best CGI animated films in cinema. How does it hold up today? Check out my review below!,"""Finding Nemo"" (2003), ever since the first teaser trailer came out for this movie, I was beyond eager to see it. During that time in my life, I just so happened to be obsessed with the ocean and sea creatures. You can only imagine my excitement! Right? Well, the day finally came for it's theatrical release and my hype was overwhelming. Sure enough, it exceeded all of my expectations, and then some. It even managed to find a spot on my top ten all-time favorite CGI animated films list! How about that? To this day, whenever I watch it on DVD, or on TV, I get the same excitement as I did when I originally saw it in the theater. Every single time! That's how you know when a movie is a winner. ""Finding Nemo"" has a perfect story, perfect voice acting, stunning animation and a great soundtrack. The plot is, a young clownfish named Nemo accidentally gets captured by scuba divers and it's up to his nervous and overprotective father to seek him out and rescue him. Looking at the synopsis as an adult, one may think that it may be a little too basic. That being said, the simplicity of the story is one of the biggest reasons why it works so brilliantly. It may be classified as an adventure film, but at the same time, it also has a seamless blend of comedy. Therefore, all the jokes and humor stands out and is one of the highlights. Once the storyline gets going, you're immediately intrigued and eager to see what happens next. I won't go into any extra details about the plot. But, let me assure you, it's a story you'll remember for the rest of your life. Like most other Pixar movies, ""Finding Nemo"" is full of heart and charm. To be honest, the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it. This is one of those films where if it happens to be on TV, I find an excuse to stop what I'm doing and watch it. How about that? One final thing I'd like to point out, is the gag with the seagulls. Every seagull yells: ""MINE! MINE! MINE! MINE!"" Whoever wrote that, give them a raise! To be honest, that's one of my top ten funniest recurring gags in any animated film. To tell you the truth, if you were to translate seagull voices to English, that's most likely what they'd be saying; ""MINE!"" Just typing about it is making me laugh out loud. Bottom line, the story here is one of those rare ones that will appeal to people of all ages. Although, to be fair, I think I enjoy it even more as an adult. It's the epitome of timeless and absolutely holds up to this day! As for the voice acting, it's just as flawless as the plot. All of the cast members nail their respectable character(s), and then some. The voice cast is exceptional and they really help bring their characters to life. Their exceptional performances make you personally care about the characters, and want them all to succeed in the end. For example, Albert Brooks does a phenomenal job as Marlin, Ellen DeGeneres is hilarious as Dory, Alexander Gould nails it as Nemo, etc. The whole voice cast provides such impeccable chemistry and makes the movie all the more special. As for the animation, it's beyond gorgeous. It's stunning to look at, and it's so appealing to view on any screen. Here's a little fun fact for you all, when Pixar did their original test animations for the film, they did a side-by-side comparison between their animation and an actual underwater shot of the ocean. They couldn't tell the difference! So, they had to dial it back and make it look less realistic. How ironic! Even though they dialed down the animation, it still looks phenomenal. In my opinion, it's easily one of the most beautifully animated movies in the history of cinema. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Thomas Newman is outstanding. His film score for this movie sets the absolute perfect tone for the storyline. Most of the soundtracks he writes and composes are incredible and this one is no exception. Props to you, Thomas Newman! ""Finding Nemo"" is a CGI animated masterpiece, and is without question one of the absolute best CGI animated films of all-time. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Finding Nemo"", what are you waiting for? Go and check it out today, I insist! I promise that you won't be disappointed. Watch it as soon as possible, or you'd better be on the lookout for sharks!",10
17 June 2003,Entertaining film for the family,"The latest effort from Pixar Studios has its charming moments and the typical top flight animation one has come to expect from these guys.. and I enjoyed this story of the fish searching for his missing son more than the overrated ""Monsters, Inc."" A fun film for the family, though this one doesnt break new ground or really stand out afterwards. GRADE: B+

2 December 2003,A movie about . . . fish?,"`How in the world could a movie about fish be interesting?' That was my reaction to this film's announcement and advertising. But fortunately it is a Pixar film, and I love Pixar's films from Toy Story to Monsters Inc. so when a friend called looking for someone to see Nemo with, I agreed still expecting to be bored out of my mind. The people at Pixar truly surprised me and put my expectations in their place.

Where I pictured gloomy underwater shots through and through, Pixar envisioned a remarkably colorful world seen through a slightly distorted dreamy lens. Very seldom has the canvass of the silver screen been utilized so ingeniously with its composition. Where I saw emotionless/expressionless creatures swimming back and forth, Pixar created the full spectrum of emotion and a plethora of fun personalities, then sent them on family-fun roller coaster ride along the ocean's bottom, and packed the rest of the film with the gags and jokes found in abundance in Toy Story and Monsters Inc.

An entire underwater world opens up to the viewer in ways the Little Mermaid could only dream . . . in ways far beyond the grasp of live action films. A visually fantastic world, with plenty of surprises up its sleeve. I couldn't help but smile as Pixar would tease and hint at the next landmark the film would take me to, then chuckle when it arrived in its fun and heartwarming way.

With other studios laying their own claim to the realm of feature length computer animation films (and fairing extraordinarily well with the likes of Shrek and Ice Age), it's a pleasure to see that Pixar has not gotten lazy. They still possess their own edge, and if Finding Nemo is any evidence, there's going to be a damn good fight over the title of `best computer animated film.' That's wonderful news to the viewers . . . I for one don't have any problem seeing more from the makers of Toy Story, Shrek, and Ice Age.

Though next up for Pixar or Dreamworks or Fox, I wouldn't mind seeing a renewal of the animated musicals reminiscent of late 80s, early 90s, and classic Disney features. Anyway, I'm getting off topic. I went into Finding Nemo expecting to be bored, and I came out of the theatre very happy with the time investment.

I will also add, it's refreshing to find animated films can still hold up even after the viewer has grown up. Ten years ago, in middle school, The Lion King caught me in a way that few films ever did; for me, films like Finding Nemo and Shrek affirm that animation holds that magic regardless of what the viewer's age.",
6 August 2019,Movie Review Profits,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",7
27 July 2008,Has the ability to entertain anyone of all ages.,"Finding Nemo (2003, Dir. Andrew Stanton)

When his son, Nemo (Gould) is taken from him by a diver, Marlin (Brooks) the clownfish sets off on a journey to rescue him. Together with Dory (DeGeneres), a blue tang fish with short term memory loss, they set off through the oceans, whilst joining a club with sharks, dodging jellyfish and hooking a ride with turtles. Whilst this is happening, Nemo and his new tank friends hatch a plan to escape from their new home.

Pixar has once again mixed the beautiful computer animation with its selection of talented stars. Finding Nemo is a tale which combines all elements to create a wonderfully crafted film which has the ability to entertain anyone of all ages.

First day of school! Wake up! Come on. First day of school.  Nemo (Alexander Gould)

21 July 2004,A let down,"I just have to mention this first to anyone who's about to read this comment - I am not reviewing ""finding Nemo"" just as a movie for children, but as an adult who loves Pixar's animated movies and knows that other adults love them too. So, let me start by saying this is the 1st Pixar movie that I wasn't impressed with, and I actually never thought this could happen. So far their movies have been simply amazing and breathtaking, and the animation in ""Finding Nemo"" never ever embarrasses this statement. There were however a couple of problems that I simply couldn't forget.

-the character of Marlin. He's just to obnoxious and mistrusting to be anywhere near likable, let alone the quiet ""hero"" of the movie. I was sure that sooner or later he'd realize that he just has to loosen up and trust people, but he sadly never does. Even in the last scene where Nemo tries to save those fish he does't let him at first. and I know that he's just being protective and all, but isn't that just the whole point of the story, put in words by Crush the turtle; ""You don't really know? Like when they know you'll know, ya know?"". Him being over protective is just stupid but he never realizes his mistakes, which is the biggest reason why this movie blows. It just doesn't make sense - throughout the whole movie he just bitches about stuff that Dory suggests and even after realizing on many occasions that she was right he doesn't learn.

-Pixar is much more that this movie. Had they been their usual self they would have made it into one of the best movies of all time. I'm not kidding, throughout the whole movie I expected and guessed how the characters were going to evolve and roughly what was going to happen, but hardly anything if it did, which was a shame because I came up with some great stuff in my mind. I should have written about it immediately after the movie because I forgot most of it. Most importantly, they should have changed the scene where Bruce chases Marlin and Dory. Why you ask? I'll tell you why. It's because of a certain movie called ""Jaws"". And to make a counter effect Pixar could do some good by not portraying every single shark as a vicious killer. Granted Bruce & co have the vegetarian thing going on, but after smelling blood he turns into the usual killing machine and it just ruins the whole concept. The scene should have looked something like this. After smelling the blood, getting his killer eyes and his killer cravings back he should have said, in a controlled, yet tempted fashion, something like: ""daaaarn mate , your AB- sure gives me the munchies!"" Then. for a moment, he'd be very very tempted and start munching his mouth. And then Dori'd see what he's thinking and she'd smack him on his nose so he'd just kind of snap out of it, first excusing himself, but then saying ""Hey Dori, you wouldn't mind doing me a small favor, would you?"" Dori: ""Sure:). Just name it"" Fade to black for half a second. We see them both moving slowly in circle, Bruce just behind her, with a kind of hypnotized and silly goofy-happy look on his face, kind of praying, yet knowing that he must not hurt her(a kind of therapy if you will). And Dori is all worked up and having fun because she's leading him around in circles as if he was hunting her, but knowing very well that he just needs to work on his veggy thing some more. And that's how you do it!

-next, what on earth were the writers thinking when they just left the tank fish to save themselves. It had to be the saddest and most shocking thing in the whole movie for me because it was so mean of Nemo & co to forget his buddies.

Pixar really should have though this one through. They could have made a movie that was environmentally (even politically!!!)conscious, be a breakthrough movie where sharks weren't killers first, friends later, showed how animals are easily mistreated by humans(OK, they actually have this one), show how parents can be overprotective and not realize when their children should have the right to make their own decision, show how children shouldn't disobey parents too often, just about anything they could think of. The saddest part is that they have every single thing I just wrote in the movie, they just don't use them to their fullest potential or miss them completely.

Otherwise a fairly decent movie that probably looked amazing in the cinema. 7/10",7
25 December 2012,you just have to see this,"Since the day I saw this movie it has always stood as my all time best animation and my all time Disney favorite. It is funny, entertaining and captivating as we watch a father clown fish Marlin (Albert Brooks) is thrown into a state of desperation to save his son and he goes through all form of adventures in his dying need to make sure he keeps his promise of letting nothing happen to him, his son Nemo (Alexander Gould). Nemo was captured by underwater divers, and taken to Sydney. So Marlin (Nemo's Father) went on an unwilling adventure to save his son, with him was Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a fish who suffers from short term memory loss.

There is not much to add but this is a classic that all should see, not because of the high ratings and the accolades and records that it holds, but for the gentle breeze of a cool soothing story that can only bring smiles to the face of any viewer.

Written and directed by Andrew Stanton (WALL-E 2008, the Toy Story trilogy), this computer animated master piece was at its time the highest grossing animated film, and the 3rd highest of all time behind Toy Story 3 and Lion King both of which are also Disney movies, it also holds the record as the highest selling DVD of all time, selling over 40 Million copies by 2006. It also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature during its time and the American Film Institute named it the tenth greatest animated film ever made during their Top 10 Animated Films of all time.

The movie idea is based on a series of experiences by the director Andrew Stanton. As a child, he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, believing that the fishes were gotten from the ocean and wanted to go back. Also when he took his son for a walk in the park his overprotective nature made him feel he lost a father-son experience. He also stated (to the National Geographic Magazine) that the idea of using clownfish as his leads, came from when he saw a picture of two clownfish peeking out of an anemone.

Funny thing is that Stanton casted Ellen to play Dory the forgetful fish when he said he saw Ellen DeGeneres in her show Ellen ""change the subject five times before finishing one sentence"" (quoting Stanton from Finding Nemo Commentary)

Finding Nemo is one movie that you just sit and enjoy as the graphics are good, the story is engaging and there seems to be something happening at every point in time; from the strike of the barracuda, till the reunion and eventual happy ending of a father and son tale Finding Nemo is more than just a cartoon is a needed experience, a necessity for all movie watchers of all kind.

Disney plans a sequel to be released in 2016, with Stanton coming back as writer and probably director.

29 December 2003,Second best CGI-movie i've seen,"Yeah, like what the title of the comment says... I just like the movie just a little bit less than Shrek (who can forget: CAN'T WE SETTLE THIS OVER A PINT?) but I laughed more than during the times I watched Shrek. It's -to my honest opinion- a lot funnier than Ice Age. And the story is beautifully realized, without overdoing it, like Disney sometimes does.

And eeeeeeuuuuuuh... I SPEAK WHALE!!!

4 November 2003,Way overrated.,"Decent Disney film that is fine for the whole family but lacks the heart and style of the other pixar films that came before it. The voice acting by all involved is great and the animation is as clear and precise as ever but it lacks a lot of what the first two Toy Stories had and lacks the heart that made those movies such landmarks in the first place.

It's a good movie but it really not as good as some people made it out to be.

7 May 2004,Pixar's funniest to date.,"*** 1/2 out of ****

Sure, the message of this flick (parents should have as much respect for their children as said children should have for them) is pure bland Disney all the way, but there's no denying that Finding Nemo is the funniest and most visually complex Pixar effort to date. And consistent laughs and great animation is all that I ask from such a picture.

The laughs are mostly the result of the film's many entertaining and unique characters, from Dory (voiced perfectly by Ellen Degeneres), the fish with short-term memory, to Australian-accented sharks and sea turtles that sound stoned. Ironically enough, it's arguable that the film's two least interesting characters are the clownfish themselves, Nemo and his dad Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks, who's generally funny but whose constant shouting can be a tad ear drum-piercing).

The story concerns these two clownfish, the only survivors from an attack by a barracuda. With his mate and the rest of his children dead, Marlin promises to always look over his remaining spawn, whom he dubs Nemo. But as time passes and Nemo has grown into a curious young fish, Marlin is still the most overprotective parent in the sea. In an act of defiance, Nemo swims too far from safe territory and is caught by a scuba diver and placed into the aquarium of his office. Desperate to find his son, Marlin enlists the help of the forgetful Dory, and it's their long journey proves to be the highlight of this movie.

One of the film's smartest touches is dividing the screen time between Marlin's journey and Nemo's interaction with the other sea life in his aquarium. In fact, the aquarium bunch boasts the film's most hilarious mixture of eccentric characters, led by the always memorable Willem Dafoe. Also very funny are Brad Garrett as a puffer fish and Allison Janney as a sea star (""Scum angel!"").

Adventure fans will probably also want to give the film a look. The search for Nemo consists of an abundance of obstacles that range from dangerous to amusing. The eye-popping visuals ensure that this is a movie that's always visually entrancing in one way or another, and there's so much attention to creating a detailed underwater environment that it's practically begging for repeat viewings (this isn't as rewatchable as, say, traditionally animated efforts like Lilo and Stitch or Treasure Planet, but it'll definitely hold up in the coming years).

Virtually every other Pixar picture I've seen either simply didn't provide much in the way of laughs (Toy Story 1 and 2) or just couldn't keep the momentum all the way through (Monster's Inc.). I consider Finding Nemo a lesson learned; even though it's actually the longest of Pixar's work to date (running at 100 minutes), the filmmakers realize we want to see adventure and laughs, not earnest attempts at sentimentality (though, as if it's requisite, we still have some sentimental moments).

Finding Nemo's pacing is probably the biggest concern, the middle segment is a tad slow and runs short on laughs compared to the much more enjoyable opening and closing half-hours. But that's only a minor complaint; be sure to stick for the final scenes, the funniest since, unbelievably enough, Stephen Sommers' horror/comedy Deep Rising; both actually boast an identical line of dialogue to wrap up the film.",
27 September 2009,Great fish story.,"'Finding Nemo' revolves around 2 clown fish: Marlin and Nemo.When Nemo disobeys his father, he gets captured by scuba divers and is taken to an aquarium.Marlin must do whatever it takes to find his son.Soon enough, he meets a blue tang fish named Dory, who has short term memory loss.Their journey to find Nemo involves almost every kind of peril you could imagine in the ocean.They encounter sharks, giant jellyfish, a whale, pigeons, and fisherman.This is definitely not your average fish story.'Finding Nemo' has remained a classic after being around for 6 years.The movie never gets old and will appeal to both kids and their parents.There's also some stunning animation and lots of humor and adventure.The movie also has a wonderful role model.Marlin is actually willing to risk his life and search the whole ocean just to find his son.Now that is what I call bravery.

31 May 2003,The Best of the Best,"Nothing really needs to be said here about Pixar that hasn't been said before. Their track record for producing amazing entertainment is currently unparalleled. That track record just gets better with ""Finding Nemo"". This movie is gorgeous, heartstopping and hilarious. I don't think many of the adults in the audience were really expecting it to be as drop-down funny as it was. The characters are instantly relatable and, in a nice touch, there are really no villains. Even the shark and the whale become quite endearing. (there's just the barracuda and he's gone before the opening credits)

Ellen Degeneres is wonderful as Dory. Every line that she delivers in the entire film is absolutely perfect. Actually that can be said about all of the performances, but her character steals the show because she is, at the same time, the funniest and sweetest fish in the ocean.

This movie is perfect for adults, perfect for children, heck, perfect for teenagers. See it again and again because it is, without question, the movie of the summer and deserves every bit of praise it gets.",10
18 July 2003,One of the films of the year!!,"Another fantastic film from the Pixar guys, and while this isn't the best I think it narrowly beats out Monsters Inc but I'm sorry you'll have to do something pant wettingly special to beat Toy Story 1 and 2. Of course saying `this isn't the best that Pixar have done' is kind of like giving a starving man 5 slices of Pizza and him saying the fifth slice isn't as good as the first!

What makes this film is the witty script, the engaging story, likeable characters and superb vocal talent. As with many kids films there are messages to both parents and to children, about believing in yourself and what have you but Pixar have a knack of making the entire audience sit their with their mouths open, laughing, flinching and holding back a tear all in unison, with the odd separation at poo jokes (for kids and big kids) and subtle innuendo (for the grown ups and youngen's who know too much for their age).

The cast of voices is impressive, headed up by Albert Brooks as Marlon, searching for his son Nemo, and also Ellen Degeneres. Admittedly I have always found Ellen funny but tiresome after too much, here no such problem, quoting from another review, `Ellen gives the sort of vocal performance that all others will now be judged by`, and it's true she brings the character to life so perfectly that even previous voice's for Pixar including Tom Hanks, Billy Crystal, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack can't compare. The audience loved her character.

This is a fantastic movie, Pixars ability to combine their fantastic animation yet tell enchanting stories and get some fantastic vocal performance is second to none. Every time they bring a film out every two years it is one of the best of the year easily. Finding Nemo is no exception, this is movie making magic, an animated film about talking fish actually manages to gather more excitement than many of the big action blockbusters, and they were exciting themselves! *****",10
21 September 2012,3D Version Worth Catching,"This review is specifically for the 3D re-release. There are two things that I observed, one was that the strength of story and surprise is about double the effort compared to recent Pixar releases. ""Brave's"" story felt relatively simplistic, ""Cars 2"" offered no depth. ""Toy Story 3"", while having depth, was still basically a rehash of TS2. ""Finding Nemo"" exceeds expectations every few minutes. Once the story seems set, a new wrinkle is thrown in. I had not watched the movie in a while, and I forgot how fast-paced and action-packed the story is. There are many more moments of genuine humour compared to recent Pixar releases.

Second was the quality of the 3D. Most reviews I heard was that the 3D wasn't all that special. I disagree. There are many moments, albeit brief, where you are tracking along with the fish through an underwaterfall, or animals flying toward the camera, or settings that surround you with 3D depth. The animation is still probably Pixar's best. The vivid recreation of a coral reef is vibrant with colour. The swilling motion of everything from the current, the refraction of the sun through the water, even the aquarium is lovingly depicting with exotic objects. Seeing the film on the big screen also gives you the benefit of feeling the sense of size when a large shark or whale dominates the screen.

Now, not surprisingly, Pixar is making ""Finding Nemo 2"". As much as I applaud this film, Pixar has a better chance to impress with something original instead of churning out sequels. Hopefully they will stuff it full of good story and surprise elements for a change.",7
14 January 2019,Nemo is great,"Excellent underwater depiction lovable characters and nice background music.Enjoy!

2 August 2017,A flipper picture for all ages,"'FINDING NEMO' was directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and stars Martin Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres and Alexander Gould. Due the tragic death of his wife, Marlin(Albert Brooks) tries to protect his son, Nemo(Alexander Gould) with his life. But after an argument, Nemo gets taken by divers and Marlin must venture through the ocean to get his boy back.

The late 90s to Early 00s was a golden age for Pixar. A string of hits from Toy Story 1 & 2, A Bug's Life and Monster's Inc - and then we got this movie. This movie continued Pixar's tradition of milking money out of us but did it in a distinctly unique way. A simple adventure movie at first glance that really shouldn't have held the test of time but it remains one of the most popular and beloved animated features of the 21st century. And after seeing it, I can see why.

As stated prior, it is PART a simple, fun adventure flick. This part is done exceptionally well and is enjoyable whenever they cut to it. The other half of this movie is were it shines, for me. We see Nemo meet a new group of people in a fish tank and attempt to escape from it. Unfortunately, we don't spend much time here at all. Focus is instead put on Marlin and Dory's 'buddy adventure'. Again, I like their adventure a lot and can 100% understand why focus was shifted to them, I just wish we got more focus on Nemo and co. Obviously, this is just personal preference and I can't mark the movie down for that.

I actively dislike the climax of this movie and it was clearly rushed. It is very lazy and I wish more effort was put into it. Time is not an excuse; they should have organised themselves better or pushed release dates back.

Obviously, Ellen DeGeneres's performance in this movie is amazing. I can't say much more about it that hasn't been said so I will just say she's awesome in this movie. Albert Brooks is often overshadowed in this movie by DeGeneres and doesn't get the respect he deserves. DeGeneres is definitely the standout of the film and I wont take that title away from her but I 100% think that Brooks is overlooked with his performance which is unfortunate because he is genuinely great in the film.

One thing I am delighted with about this movie is the fact the directors and writers don't force a romance between Dory and Marlin. You can argue that it may be a bit weird, considering the voice actors of the respective characters but when has that stopped Hollywood before?

Alexander Gould was competent as Nemo but I honestly think Nemo is such a dull and bland character which is very strange considering his name takes up 50% of the title.

Side characters are a huge strength of this movie. From the Fish Tank Gang to Brucie to Crush - all the side characters in this movie are strong, funny and memorable. They are all interesting in their special ways and all keep this movie from slipping into mediocrity.

Finding Nemo was a revolution for CGI animated movies animation wise. Does it hold up? Yeah - it does. The water effects are surprisingly good and the design of the fish is good. Pixar's human creation facilities are also much better in this movie(in anticipation to 2004's 'The Incredibles') which makes them look less my plastic dolls, and more like living, breathing human beings.

The cinematography and editing is also pretty good.

Pixar is a master at making movies funny for both younger and mature audiences. I'll say 40% of jokes in the movie made me elicit a chuckle, which is pretty dang good to be fair. Toilet humour is present and I will NEVER condone subjecting children to it. Thankfully, it is in short supply so it isn't TOO bad.

There is SOME emotion in the film and there is KIND OF an arc but it feels so artificial and computer generated. It doesn't feel genuine at all.

'Finding Nemo' is an enjoyable movie from beginning to end and I can 100% recommend you see it. It is from the golden age of Pixar, so I'll rate this film 7 'Awesome Handshakes' out of 10!",7
15 April 2015,Do I even need to talk about why this movie rocks ?,"Well, apart from possibly, say, the Toy Story films, Finding Nemo has taken the world by storm as Pixar's biggest hit. And to be honest, it deserves that credit.

First of all, this is up there with ""Basil"" as one of the mist f***ed up openings for a kids film. I mean, you open up with a mother all but one of her offspring being eaten by a vicious predator. I like kids films that can do that, not always trying to be family friendly. Apart from that, the film is really awesome.

The strength from the film comes from its characters, there are too many to count and normally that would hurt a film but here, there are all so different and memorable. Albert Brooks is great as Merlin, who, in my opinion, is one of the great film dads. You really end up feeling for this guy and yeah he can be annoying in how introverted and protected he is but its all coming from a place of legitimate pain that the audience is introduced to early on, thus you are put on his journey. Dory is freaking hilarious. You'd think the memory loss story line would get old but it is cleverly worked in so that it is fresh in every situation. The other characters are all so fun and none of them were annoying, you enjoyed watching all of them. The additional voice talents of Willem Dafoe, Geoffry Rush, Eric Bana and many others help the cause as well. My favorite characters where the turtles, that is just how I have always envisioned turtles speaking.

The film is set in modern day Australia, again using modern day settings (and a unique one at that) and there is no feeling of manipulations. You never feel that the film is trying to be ""cool"" no need for catch phrases or pop cultural references, just a new setting that allows for some nice shots. The film still has a timeless feel.

If I had one issue with the film, its that the climax feels a little forced. Without giving away too much, there is an incident that happens at the end where a character tries to prove themselves and it just didn't feel needed.

Overall, Finding Nemo is one of my favorite animated films ever and is fit for kids, teens, adults, hell its just fit for the whole family.",9
24 February 2023,"Yes, it's THAT good !!","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",8
14 May 2004,Hmmm...,"Good but not great. I have finally seen this film after much hype and I have to confess to being a little disappointed; whilst the animation is truly spectacular, the plot is flimsy and the characters (on the whole) lack genuine depth. Of course there are places where you will laugh aloud but the humour is too visual to be truly funny and the schmaltzy sentimentality that seems to pervade 90% of all children's films now made cannot be escaped from here either. To be honest, Dory is a 'one-joke' fish and the surfer-dude gag is lame horse, overdone in comedy to the point of boredom. That said, Albert Brookes is fantastic as Nemo's father and I loved the cameos from Willem Dafoe and Barry Humphries. I was expecting more - 7/10.

8 July 2003,Incredibly disappointing,"This movie was very disappointing. It was boring, not funny, and had bad music. Great for small kids and they're parents, but not for eleven year olds-like me. Although many kids in my grade said it was great. But I did not like it at all. 3/10 (***/**********).

23 January 2004,A really nice movie...,"This film I think is alongside ""Shrek"" the best film in this genre. It includes everything a film like this should include plus a bit more. It is a film that includes stuff for the whole family. The only big problem with this film is one of the main characters Dory, she is not funny! Otherwise I strongly recommend it! 8/10

1 April 2015,Fish lost at sea,"Finding Nemo is the compelling story of a fish taken by divers, and his dad searches the entire ocean looking for his son. This movie it great for all ages. A 4 years old and an 84 year old will be entertained by he touching story of this movie. It is here kids learn it is okay to accept help, the ones who truly love you will never give up on you, and just keep swimming, no matter what never give up. I give this movie two thumbs up and would recommend it to anybody. This movie is a Disney classic. I have nothing bad to say about it. The animation is astounding for the time the movie came out. As a result of this movie kids all over the world go to aquariums looking to find Nemo and Dory. Maybe they will find a 100 year old sea turtle as well. This movie is not only entertaining but education as well. This move is unforgettable.

15 June 2018,"Not my favorite Pixar film, but it was a nice change from toys and insects","I liked how they combined all sorts of marine life into this film. It's nice and funny and cute too. The cast was cool, especially Albert Brooks, whom I first became aware of from The Simpsons as a recurring guest star. And Ellen DeGeneres didn't hurt either. She was quite spunky as Dory. And a lot of the characters seem too minor or supporting to be useful as part of the plot. But don't let that throw you off and just try to enjoy yourself. I know I did!

23 January 2004,Disney's comeback!,"After a string of flicks that weren't able to lure me into the theaters or the movie store, I heard great things about Finding Nemo. They were right! Disney has come back with a great movie. The emotions and adult appeal that were lacking in the recent flicks was very present in Finding Nemo. The special relationship between father and son has been depicted very lovingly. It was hilarious to see how marine biology had been incorporated in this movie to make all the jokes. It was funny how the aquatic life were shown as having a human lifestyle.

14 May 2005,The Age Of Animation Continues,"The Age of Animation continues into the 21st century with such film favorites of Shrek (2001), Ice Age (2002), and Monsters Inc. (2001). In each film we find interesting characters, a funny and colorful setting, and creative ideas. But in all of them, the story is set in a different world or different world with little emphasis on how they would react to our world.

In Finding Nemo we get that sense. Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) is the clown fish father of young Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould) and it is Nemo's first day of school. Marlin is a very over protective father of his son who has a shrunken fin. They are living in the Great Barrier Reef and the coral reefs are safe but beyond is unknown and dangerous.

After being embarrassed in front of his friends, Nemo decides to swim out and touch a boat to challenge his father. Before Marlin can get to him, Nemo is scooped up by a diver and taken off. Marlin is desperate to find his son and sets of on a long journey to find him and rescue him. Along the way Marlin is helped by Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres) A blue tang who suffers short-term memory loss.

Ellen DeGeneres keeps the story of Marlin going with her accidental comedy and their constant confrontations of various sea-dwellers. Albert Brooks does an average job as Marlin - he had the hardest part bearing the full wait of emotion in the film. The animation is top quality and the design of the coral reef, coral reef, and marine fish are excellent.

Some of the funniest scenes I've seen are in this film especially the vegetarian sharks and the surf dude tortoises. Each fish and animal is unique in their own way and are design ed exactly like the actual thing they're based off of. The story is funny, especially Marlin dealing with Dory and her short-term memory loss and Nemo living in a fish tank with Gill (stunning voice of Willem Dafoe) and other exotic fish.

The humor is top quality and the story is truly a fish out of water story!

Finding Nemo. Starring the voices of: Albert Brooks, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, Ellen DeGeneres, and Brad Garrett.

6 June 2003,"Excellent film, especially for fathers and sons...","I have two sons, one six and one nine; we hugged, laughed and cried during this whole film. People that whined that their kids were ""traumatized"" by the action must be smothering their children. Only a very small child (well under two) or a kid in desperate need to loosen the grip from mommy's apron strings could possibly be ""terrorized"" by this film. Movies are about love, loss, fear, laughter, surprise, etc. Asking a film to be some bland thing that every little wimpy baby can see without boo-hooing is absurd. Get a life, and quit raising simps.

The message of the film is very pertinent, especially in today's world, yet it is not bludgeoned over the audience's head. It takes head on the fact that children are increasingly pushing for more freedom at a younger age, and shows that a balance can be reached. It doesn't shy away from the fact that danger exists, and no parent can safeguard against every possible threat. It embraces the fact that each parent must loosen the grip, while maintaining as safe an environment as possible.

Another wonderful aspect concerns little Nemo's ""lucky"" fin. He actually has a damaged, or handicapped right fin, although the movie never portrays Nemo as disabled, in the traditional sense. Instead it is an allegory for a parent's justifiable reluctance to allow their children to pursue their own independence in a dangerous world - and a very subtly powerful one at that.

The voice talents are excellent, with Ellen DeGeneres stealing the show. Even if you don't like her, you'll like her... here. Willem Defoe and Albert Brooks also give performances, which take advantage of their public image, but add delightful twists to deepen the impact.

It is a film that focuses on the father/son relationship throughout, whereas many Disney movies kill off the dad early on. This isn't to say that everything is all roses here either. Caulk a realistic relationship, with the faults and missteps present therein to a Pixar team that increasingly continues to school animation studios on the fact that STORY MATTERS MOST.

This film is a great opportunity for families to feel close to one another without the impression you checked your brain at the door to achieve that. My boys and I hugged for five minutes after this film ended, and then proceeded to crack up during the humorous end credits. Parents who balk at the fear factor, need to put away the pampering powder and concentrate on bringing up kids equipped to deal appropriately with a frightening world, at that age. It's not Alien for crying-out-loud. What it is, is great movie-making and real fun, especially for families with strong, independent kids testing boundaries - as all healthy children do.",10
28 May 2020,I loved this movie when I was very young and I still do.,"A movie that is so beautiful with scenery and story, with a cast that more then delivers it's a must see for any age, and when I said the scenery is beautiful even by today's standards in my opinion it holds up.

9 May 2020,Something We All Know,"This is at the top of the list for best movies of my younger life. Disney was always the best with adding personality to its animated characters.

In ""Finding Nemo"" they gave these fishes all different personality types. It's hilarious to watch their journey to recover Marlin's son Nemo.

A great movie that will live on with its legacy for a long time.

16 July 2021,"As a kid I hated it, I grew up to like it","I was in kindergarten when this movie came out. I never watched it because everyone else was watching it. I have come up with the concept of normie long before it was created. Other than that it was also because I came from a very conservative family. I was not allowed to watch movies in theatre, especially not a Hollywood one. So as all the kids used to talk about it I grew into hating it. And when this movie came on TV I only watched it with a critical point of view. It was only years after when I watched it and truly appreciated it.

Finding Nemo is a very colourful movie filled with many sea creatures. It is an excellent movie that can teach children about the different types of marine life. I have heard about how everyone started hunting for clownfish after this movie came up. Although this is a bit sad and very cruel thing to do it also shows the impact that this movie was able to create and how much people enjoyed watching it. The fishes were shown in a very cute manner, especially the pufferfish.

The only problem I have with this movie is the lack of a story. It's just a fish going from point A to point B. Although this does make for a good story since it helps in character development and world building, but these things should not be done while completely sacrificing a good story. I think I really like this movie and I will watch that once again to truly appreciate it.",7

13 July 2006,what am i missing?,"OK, i might be a bit of a film cynic, but that's because the overwhelming majority of wide release films are really bad. finding nemo is a perfect example of a terrible film, that for some reason everyone loves. what's wrong with me? OK, i'll give it the nice bright colours and beautiful, smooth animations, but what else is there? ""memorable characters,"" ""humour?"" certainly not! i have the distinct feeling that dreamworks puts subliminal messages into their films to make people like them, because its the only explanation! all my friends, cynics, hippies, metal heads, nerds - they all loved it! WHY? when i ask them, they'll say, ""oh it was funny..."", or ""it was colourful..."" are they playing games with me? Please, some one explain how this film is good? It's 2 hours long, for a cartoon, 2 hours is far too long. It has the lamest, schmultziest story and character development. all the ""crazy"" characters are really simple stereotypes that have been done to death a million times before. Hey, i don't mind if your kid liked it, my question is to the parents who claim, fun for kids AND adults. I don't understand. the same thing happened with toy story and shrek. Where were these so called, ""adult"" jokes? why does everyone insist that dreamworks is so great? Argh! someone help me. or at least someone admit they also hated this film to save me from thinking i'm a lunatic. although, i do have an unhealthy fascination for the moon.",1

A very funny and cute movie for all ages about a little fish named Nemo who gets lost and so his dad Marlon (Albert Brooks) is trying to find him and on his away he meets this little blue fish named Dory (Ella DeGeneres) are now together to trying find his son in this wacky adventure!

BOTTOM LINE: JUST KEEP SWIMMING, JUST KEEP SWIMMING, SWIMMING, SWIMMING!",10
23 November 2007,Rotten Fish,"When I first saw this film with my then 5 year old son, I thought it was pretty good. Subsequent viewings have revealed major flaws. Perhaps this is a little heavy considering it's a children's movie but I have seen many children films and there a lots that I can watch over and over again. Alice in Wonderland, the Jungle Book, etc. The biggest flaw,someone else mentioned it earlier,is the non-stop intense action sequences. The film begins with Nemo's mother being eaten by a barracuda, for any kid who understands the context this must be terrifying, it's followed by another excruciating scene when Nemo is scooped up by divers. Anyone with separation anxiety will have trouble with this scene. Accompanying this are an assortment of loud banging noises, intense thuds, and Psycho inspired music. Then there are the characters Nemo's okay, but his Dad is a whining, irritating jerk, Dory is funny for a while but then her stupidity becomes annoying. And the surfer dude turtle Ozzie accent- all wrong. Overall if you are a parent deciding to rent this for the kids reach for the Aristocats instead.

8 October 2003,This is now the 2nd best animated film I have ever seen,"This movie stands in line next to my personal favorite, Lilo and Stitch. But from Pixar, the best is obviously Monsters Inc and both Toy Story's. What drives this film and makes it delightful is not only its animation (which you want in every aspect of your field of vision), but its heartfelt story that kids and adults can relate to. Marlin as the constantly funny Albert Brooks does nothing less than what we know from him, and the short term memory Dory by the wonderful Ellen Degeneres never failed to entertain me and my family. But what parents can take from the film is to believe in your kids, don't constantly watch over them, let them breathe and have fun!!! Maybe great white shark Bruce (as the film's most intimidating character, and the bully all kids recognize) sums up the best words of the film, ""fish are friends, not food."" 10/10

9 July 2003,Best animated film since the original 'Toy Story'.,"This is the best animated feature since the original 'Toy Story' in 1995. Yes, it is better than 'Shrek'. This is a totally original and adventurous story that, like all good animated movies, has appeal to both children and adults. Only this time, adults will feel like kids more than ever and that is a GOOD THING! Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould and Willem Dafoe are all standouts in this tale which has the classic Pixar stamp all over it. I see a possible sequel here and that may be bad because it will be hard to top the touching feelings that this film has at its conclusion and the humour will be equally hard to top.

17 June 2003,gem mint!,"Marlin is an overprotective clown fish, worried about his young son Nemo who has an underdeveloped fin. In an effort for Nemo to prove himself to his father he decides to venture out into the ocean against his dad's wishes away from school. In the end, he is caught by a deep sea diver, and Marlin is determined to resuce and find his son against all impossible odds.

Nemo ends up in a fish tank in a dentists office, where he is made an honorary member, meanwhile the rest of the film plays itself as Marlin travels through the great worlds of the ocean, and meets many characters and unique places in his search for his son.

It seems like somewhat of a similar story that we see in children's animation, even a sidekick is provided. However, the sidekick is a short term 'female' memory fish named Dory (voiced hillariously by Ellen DeGeneres), and the world that Marlin inhabits is filled with numerous funny characters in a giant ocean (in-therapy sharks, surfing California sea turtles, crazy pelicans, a giant whale [which provides the most hillarious dialogue in the film], a school bus driving manta ray, to all the aquarium creatures in the dentist office). Also the film centers on a father son relationship and the overbearing protectivness of the father is explained very quickly and simply in the first 5 minutes of the film. In fact Nemo's dissapearance is a transformation not just for Nemo as he has to learn how to survive and do things on his own, but also for his father who realises he has to venture out of his shell and get out and see the world without being afraid.

But hands down the seagulls in the film, are the most ingenious bit in the entire film, those guys when on screen steal the show and are a riot fest!

It seems Pixar has a formula that just can't be beat and gets better everytime. The animation is superb, the screen is filled with things to look at it in the ocean, and the fish move through it so realisticaly through worlds of colourful coral, wrecked ships and rust, to the cuteness of the aquarium. You could just sit back and watch the screen like a giant fish tank for hours. The characters are also very charming, and the story does not get bogged down in sentimentality.

Great film, and nearly perfect. Plenty of things to see for adults and children alike.

28 June 2003,Pixar And Brooks Make A Great Team,"Pixar assumes the responsibility of gently leading children on the path to adulthood from Disney (itself busy trying to attract adolescents with more mature animated and live-action films) and delivers a beautiful, exciting animated feature about a neurotic clownfish who must rescue his kidnapped son, trapped in an aquarium in a Sydney dentist's office. Albert Brooks is the voice of the phobic father and it's a perfect fit, so much so it seems to have been designed around his persona--he's quite clearly part of the creative process and makes it as personal for him as it does for Andrew Stanton, the director (who also developed the story). It's in perfect harmony with Brooks' body of work as a filmmaker, showcasing his desire for familial overprotection that was at the heart of his `Mother' (but with none of the smug self-righteousness that marred it). His Marlin is joined on his journey by a hilarious Ellen DeGeneres as a short-term memory-challenged bluefish named Dory and she brings the simple verbal vaudeville of Gracie Allen in endearing herself to the audience. We've become quite accustomed to Pixar's dazzling visuals and this film is no exception, with its exquisite painter's palette of sea colors (particularly the shimmering, watery shades of teal and the sharp pastels that comprise the landscape) but the story is the design's equal, a balanced, clear-eyed view of father-son relationships and the recognition of personal growth by one another--it's moving and meaningful at the same time.",10

Indeed, this is among their top 5 best, perhaps, as it not only deals with subjects that interest children but also seeks to teach their parents something very important: to not overprotect their children since the kids need to tackle the world in order to grow, even if they are under some risk, the fact is that the parents need to accept the dangers of the world and that it is impossible to protect their children absolutely.

The main character of the movie is an overprotective father who lost 99% of his unborn children (i.e. eggs, since he is a fish) and his wife due to the attack of a very large and powerful predator fish. Traumatized by the experience he overprotects his only remaining offspring but when he loses his child he embarks on an adventure to find him again, hence the name of the movie.

21 June 2020,Finding Nemo,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",8
18 April 2005,"Review of ""Finding Nemo""","You know in the real events that the real life story that ""Finding Nemo"" was based upon, Nemo was put in the garbage disposal in the sink at the dentists office (after some of the other fish in the aquarium contracted fin rot from him and died) and his father was eaten by the pelican.

Disney always has to give perfectly acceptable stories with a moral to them these ridiculous happy endings which are not healthy for children to watch because they give them false expectations of life.

Let kids get to know the truth for once, Disney!!! Another complaint is that I did not see a Pink Snapper in this hole movie. What a disappointment. Its my favorite dish.

13 June 2003,Classic Pixar,"It is great to see another classic movie from Pixar. Finding Nemo is an outstanding film. It is well animated and colorful. The voices are well cast in their respective roles, especially Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres (who I have not been a fan of in the past). In a summer which has seen dark, moody movies like The Matrix Reloaded, it is great to have fun at the movies

16 November 2003,Boring.,"I didn't like this moive because it was like a big moral pancake from the Disney-corporation. And frankly they can take their ""Culture Of Excellence"" to where the pepper grows. If you want to see a good movie check out the Animatrix. There's no annoying father saying ""Nemo"" more times than Frodo says ""My dear Sam"" in Lord Of The Rings. Suck on that, Walt.

8 July 2018,"Marlin Is Finding Nemo, You Are Finding An Adventure!","For what, unbelievably, is my 100th review*, I am reviewing a movie that is 100 minutes long!I have seen this many times in my life. In theaters, at home, on TV, even in 5th grade, it was my teacher's favorite movie. It came to a point where I was ""see-sick"" of Finding Nemo. But I still viewed it, and somehow it is now in my top 10 favorite Disney movies. Now that I am 19, not 4 going on 5, as I was when this released, there are many things I get now then when I was a kid. Inside jokes, like Nemo being in a school of fish. ""Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own...""-""SHH! "" stuff like that. I have a friend who prefers to mainly watch Christian movies but a friend showed her this and she loves it, too! So, if you lost your chances in the past to see Nemo, find him now-he's waiting for you!

26 June 2003,"I loved it, I loved it, I loved it! What movie are we talking about again?","If you or any children you know have enjoyed a Pixar movie in the slightest, you owe it to yourself and them to go see this amazing movie. It is literally laugh out loud funny. I thought that Ellen DeGeneres was a hoot and her character alone is worth seeing the movie for. Kudos to Pixar on getting such a wonderfully talented actress to play this role, as well as all of the others involved. Each character that is introduced throughout leaves you smiling. There wasn't one scene in this movie where I was bored with what was happening. It is surprisingly intense in some scenes, the shark scene coming to mind as I write this. The beginning of the movie is pretty dark as well but I won't reveal what happens except to say that it is a pretty grim way to start what is widely seen to be a kid's flick. In terms of technical achievements, the sound was awesome with directional effects coming at you from every which direction. The picture is unbelievable and even the most jaded viewer won't be able to help marvelling at how lifelike all of the characters are. The whole time I was watching the movie, I kept thinking to myself, ""DVD? Hell yeah!"" The story is just as good, if not better than any previous Pixar movie. What amazed me the most about this movie was the wealth of ideas that they had going on in it! I remember watching the trailer and thinking to myself, ""How much stuff can they actually do underwater that we haven't already seen in other movies?"" Trust me when I say you will be surprised at the overall creative brilliance of this fine film. It's very obvious that some serious brainstorming was going on during the planning stages. Pixar has one hell of a streak going on right now with Finding Nemo only strengthening their already impressive body of films and I cannot recommend this one enough. (Final note: my favorite scene was Gill (Willem Dafoe) describing his escape plan to the other fish in the aquarium. It had me in tears from laughing so hard!) Rating: ***** out of *****.",
8 June 2003,You know it's going to be an animated classic when,"You found yourself really care and root for the main characters despite you know (A) they are merely animation, and (B) this is Disney so everything is bound to OK. This is a great, entertaining movie for everyone from aged 6 to 106. It may be a little too intense for very young children (under 6). Otherwise, it's a nearly perfect mix of great computer animation (countless eye candies in life-like ocean setting), a refreshing take of an old plot, fun and intense actions, adult humor and homage to old classics like Shinning. At times, it was poignant and inspiring but never preachy. A must see indeed.

4 July 2003,Something new would be nice,"Finding Nemo was supposed to be this wonderful family film that was as hilarious as it was heart-warming. I failed to see any of these qualities in this boring tale. Nothing new was presented, no interesting characters to tie together the predictable plot and don't even get me started on the jokes. I did, however, like the fact that Willem Dafoe was in it. I know everyone has to lighten up and do a fun film. Why Dafoe chose Finding Nemo, search me, brother.

20 June 2017,Underwater version of Bambi,"Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons. The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs. There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun. I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this. The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate. Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.",9

8 April 2010,Episodic Pixar offering with some spectacular animation,"Finding Nemo (Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich, 2003) is an episodic entry from Pixar, inexplicably hailed by many as the studio's best. In a moving prologue, we see the wife and unborn spawn of clownfish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) eaten by a predator. He aside, the sole survivor is an offspring with a weak fin: Nemo (Alexander Gould). The attack - and birth - has a profound attack on the formerly carefree Marlin, who becomes absurdly, embarrassingly protective of his son. When the youngster is captured by a diver, his father must embark on a revelatory quest, braving shark attacks and jungles of jellyfish in a bid for reunion.

The film is exciting, moving and stunningly animated, but has too many incidental characters who aren't sufficiently well-drawn, and a habit of hitting you over the head with its message. ""You can't never let anything happen to (Nemo) - then nothing would ever happen to him,"" says periodically annoying comic relief Dorey (Ellen DeGeneres). That would be pithy had we not already got the point. It's still a good film.

6 July 2003,Absolutely stunning,"How many movies can you think about that:

1) Have you laughing *before* the main feature starts (""The Incredibles"" trailer, the ""Snow Man"" short film).

2) Keep you glued to your seat, just watching the incredible beauty of it all.

3) Make half of the entire theater *stay* during the credits, just to watch the main characters swim back and forth and be generally cute, while being completely quiet.

4) End up with all of the people leaving the movie theatre with a huge, sincere, honest and childish grin in their faces?

Not many, I'm sure. Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" is all that, and more. A true family movie, a true ""buddy"" movie, a true ""kids"" movie; a hugely entertaining and sincere film. Once again, John Lasseter and company play with your emotions, raise up questions to be answered, manage to deliver a deliciously complex, thought-provoking movie, all while entertaining kids from 1 to 12 years old, and making everyone else laugh and *think* throughout it all.

I don't know what or how Pixar manages to deliver such beautiful, enjoyable gems with such regularity. All I know is, the little studio that could will be remembered for a long time for making the only movies that have a heart and soul buried deep within bits and bytes.

Best movie of the year. By far.",9

6 December 2003,The anthropomorphic approach of animal characters is becoming more and more out of date,"This movie is surely an achievement in a technical point if view. No need to argue about that. But there is a great problem : it tries to please adults as well as children in an over-speeded plot full of clichés. Do really children need so much complexity and action scenes ? I am not sure about that. Maybe children need more time to understand what is happening on the screen. Too much speed creates a stressed up and confusing atmosphere.

There is too much violence and the characters are shallow and stereotypical (I found the turtles to be extremely boring). The anthropomorphic approach of animal characters is becoming more and more out of date. Disney did it a thousand times and I still don't know if it is really a pertinent way of exlplaining things to children. Paradoxal ? A shallow movie set in the dephts of the ocean... Far too much hype for another sterotypical plot.

21 December 2006,The future and past of animation,"I think that ""Finding Nemo"" was a good work. Is fun, funny and with a beautiful message to the little ones. And the animation of course is excellent. But... where is the classic animation with we grow up? I mean... i'm not an adult yet, but still in childhood i live in all that beautiful fantasies of ""Snow White"", ""Alice"" or ""That lazy princess"". I remember when ""Toy Story"", that if i'm not wrong was the first Pixar movie. Well, i think ""Toy Story"" is excellent, an unforgettable movie. And i was really happy for the animation style. But now... i say this animation is good (please, don't misinterpret me) but... and the animation of ever? Now, the movies for kids are just with this kind of animation. A little number of movies take the old, beautiful and classic animation of all times.

""Finding Nemo"" talk about a disobedient little fish. His dad tell to the little that cant go to up... he don't pay attention to the advice and... well, you must see it. ""Finding Nemo"" has all that a film for kids must have, funny characters (i love that little fish that forgets everything) and good teachings. I hope the movies do more of that... but the animation... well, this is other thing that the new technology makes... for good or for bad. What do you think?

15 May 2020,Father's love is like a mountain.,"People say that fatherly love is like a mountain, and fatherly love is deep. That 's right.

The father of the clownfish in the movie did things carefully and was laughed at by others as a coward. Fatherly love is great, when the child runs away from home and is captured and sold to the city. His father, who usually seemed timid as a rat, embarked on the path of finding children. On the way, he met a forgetful Dory, avoiding the big sharks on the road, and did not give up in many cases. Yes, in order to save his child, the clownfish father seems to inspire the body's potential, and pursues courage all the way. As the saying goes, raising a child is 100 years old and often worry about 99. The clownfish father is the same. As long as he is still alive and can move, he will find his son. The movie ended in a happy reunion. Although we are older, we can also watch with a childlike innocence and feel the deep blue sea and deep fatherly love

8 October 2003,"There are 3.7 trillion fish in the ocean, they are looking for just one. You will have never seen fish prepared like this before. 'Finding Nemo' is totally wild dude!","People all over the world have been falling in love with a little clownfish called 'Nemo'. I have been waiting to see this film for a while and it has not disappointed me. Pixar have proven once again that they are the best when it comes bringing 'animated feature films'. This film shows of many great things, like what it is like to be a fish, life in the sea, what Australians are really like and the famous landmarks of the harbour city of 'Sydney'. But what I think is most important about 'Finding Nemo', is the warm fuzzy feeling a film such as this will leave you with.

Dive into a whole new world of computer-animated fun, fantasy, and heartfelt emotion by following the epic journeys of two 'clownfish' - the overly cautious Marlin and his curious son, Nemo - who become separated in the Great Barrier Reef when Nemo is taken from his ocean home. Despite his fears of the open sea, Marlin embarks on a dangerous trek to find Nemo. Buoyed by the companionship of a friendly-but-forgetful fish named Dory, Marlin finds himself as the unlikely hero of a thrilling journey to rescue his son.

Firstly, I want to praise the animators that worked on this movie. They did a remarkable job in creating the world that we find all these sea animals swimming around in. The attention to detail is most noticeable, especially the way they have shown the water, which looked 'real'. The Pixar animators certainly put great detail into the film, and used a vast array of colours, which has to be another of the films major highlights.

The script for 'FN' is as classy a script I have ever seen for animated feature film. Not only is it clever, it is very funny and has some strange, but hilarious characters. I believe that the character of Dory was the funniest, one that at least I know I will be able to 'remember'. The movie's underlying themes, which include the importance of family and friends, were also very important. The story for 'FN' was written by Andrew Stanton, while the screen was done by Stanton, Bob Peterson and David Reynolds.

The direction 'FN' took onscreen was another aspect of the film I liked. It must be difficult to direct an 'animated feature film', but the way the directors' did this film, show how it can and should be done. Director Andrew Stanton (with Co-director, lee Unkrich) certainly gave the movie good flow and allowed the audience to enjoy a fine cinematic experience. Stanton's role on the film is truly great, considering he also voiced the totally wild dude, Crush the turtle.

With so many characters, I want to talk about the ones that had the biggest impact on me. The main characters include Nemo, the baby 'clownfish', who goes on an extraordinary adventure, Nemo's dad Marlin and Dory, the blue tang fish, with short term memory loss, who has to be up there as one of the great cartoon characters, ever made for a film. I also loved the impact that the three sharks have on the film. Bruce, the great white shark, Anchor, the hammerhead shark and Chum, the pointer shark, could have been (and would be for some littlies) very scary, but in this film were also hilarious. Out of the characters we meet in the fish tank aquarium at the Dentists, the strange exotic Moorish Idol fish Gill, the very amusing 'Bloat', and Nigel, the clumsy pelican, are all very good. In fact the dentist himself is a very important character for reasons that I will let the movie explain.

However these characters would be nothing without the voiceovers that accompany them. The main voices include Albert Brooks, Alexander Gould and Willem Defoe, who all are very good. But the stand out for me is the performance of Ellen DeGenres, who has proven that she totally suits doing voiceovers. I hope DeGenres is casted again in a role like this one. The voiceovers also have a very Australian flavour as well. People like Barry Humphries, Eric Bana, Bruce Spence, Bill Hunter and Geoffrey Rush are all great additions to be hearing. The additional voiceovers also see a very famous Aussie as well. While the voice of cartoon expert Jack Angel appears, we also have the latest 'Gold Logie' winner Rove McManus, being a part of the ocean too.

There are many wonderful moments in 'FN'. My favourite has to be when Marlin and Dory stumble across the three 'friendly' sharks. This scene has to be the scariest and the funniest of the film. Then when Marlin and Dory play the 'Jellyfish' game, it is also funny and dangerous at the same time. In fact the whole journey that Nemo's father has to find his son in the film is very entertaining to say the least. Then when Marlin and Dory first meet Nigel, the pelican, it is hard not to laugh at the cries of 'Mate....' by the many pidgins that we see. Also the experiences that Nemo has while trapped in the aquarium at the Dentist surgery, are not only frightening, but very fun and exciting as well, helping Nemo to grow up.

'Finding Nemo' was dedicated to the memory of Glenn McQueen, a man that obliviously had an impact on Pixar animations. While I love all the different aspects of 'Finding Nemo', I am still a bigger fan of 'Monsters, Inc.', but believe me, Finding Nemo is not far behind it, and I cannot wait for the DVD release of this movie. I believe that this movie has the perfect opening, thanks to the viewing of the 1989, first-ever Pixar production 'Knick Knack', that undoubtedly inspired 'Finding Nemo'. While this movie has as perfect and funny conclusion you will see (Note: do not get up before the credits!). What a joy it was for me to finally see 'Finding Nemo'!

CMRS gives 'Finding Nemo': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)",
25 October 2019,Heartwarming classic leaves a smile on your face,"Rating

10/10

Heartwarming classic from Pixar deserves its reputation. Animation quality holds up well. The script never talks down to its audience. Degeneres provides great laughs. The emotional conclusion leaves a smile on your face.

2 June 2003,Pixar films keep improving,"I was not much of a fan of ""a Bug's Life"". I kind of enjoyed

Toy Story, and I thought Toy Story2 and Monster's Inc. were both terrific. Nemo though is the best of the bunch. Most critics say that the story in Nemo does not have the same appeal to the adults as Pixar's other films, but I truly disagree. The character of Nemo voiced by Albert Brooks is just like the neurotic characters that Brooks plays in his live action films and every bit as funny. I've never been a big Ellen DeGeneres fan but she also does a terrific job. Kudos to Pixar they just keep getting better and better!

22 December 2003,**you people are insulting a G rated movie**,"I think its very funny that you people who are insulting Finding Nemo are insulting a G rated, kids movie. Finding Nemo is a very sweet movie and its really cute. I have many younger cousins who are 2 all the way to 12 who really enjoyed this movie and talk about it all the time. So I think its hilarious that adults are coming on this board and ragging on the movie about how stupid it is. And yes, I am aware that G means general audience but G usually means its great for kids. But, yes, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Think about how its for younger audiences before you go on about insulting it. Well I'm going to watch it with my 10 year old brother. Bye!

29 July 2004,Disney's best effort since THE JUNGLE BOOK,"I'm a big fan of the classic Disney era(late thirties throughout the forties),I don't really like the modern movies.Movies like FANTASIA and DUMBO are from that time and these two are my favorite Disney movies.Since that period only JUNGLE BOOK really lives up to my expectations.Now finally,Disney created a new animation classic:FINDING NEMO.A lot of this success is thanks to Pixar,the computer animation company that created a new world in animation.

FINDING NEMO leans very much on the old success movie DUMBO.Both have got a troubled parent-child relationship(Dumbo and his mother versus Nemo and Marlin)together with a troubled child-friend relationship(Dumbo and his buddy Timothy Mouse versus Nemo and his girlfriend Dory)and in both movies the leading character has got a physical handicap,Dumbo with his big ears and Nemo with a short fin. Besides that FINDING NEMO is still an original tale in itself.

FINDING NEMO has got several references to old films like JAWS,THE GREAT ESCAPE,PSYCHO and THE BIRDS.It is probably the only movie that has put both PSYCHO and THE BIRDS imitations in the space of 5 minutes. There is also a nice reference to the Disney short TUGBOAT MICKEY.

The characters are very well worked out,Nemo is very sympathetic and so is his dad.I must say that the presence of the shark Bruce is not very big in the movie and that's a bit of a shame.Another pretty annoying part is the ""whale language"" by Dory. The voices are not by the most famous of actors,but it's still very good.Willem Dafoe(PLATOON,MISSISSIPPI BURNING,BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY,CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER,LULU ON THE BRIDGE)is my favorite voice of the movie as he speaks for Gill.Other voices come from Albert Brooks(who had a supporting role in TAXI DRIVER)as Marlin and Ellen DeGeneres as Dory.

The computer animations are superb which makes it a very pleasant experience. 9/10",8
17 April 2004,"Cute, funny, and really cool!","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",
22 June 2003,`Finding Nemo' is a treat for anyone seeking a fresh look at the computer-animated genre of family entertainment.,"Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios have brought us some great computer animated tales over the past years. Beginning with `Toy Story' in 1995, followed by `Toy Story 2,' `A Bug's Life,' `Monsters, Inc. ' and now `Finding Nemo.' `Finding Nemo' is not as original or as creative as `Monsters, Inc.,' however, the film is extremely enjoyable as it is filled with lovable characters that will charm and amuse everyone. Speaking from a computer animated standpoint, it's the greatest achievement visually that the two companies have brought us. `Finding Nemo' tells the story of Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish that has left his coral reef home in search for his lost son, Nemo (Alexander Gould). Along his trek through the ocean, Marlin meets several humorous characters-one in particular, a fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). Dory isn't like other fish. She suffers from short-term memory loss. As such, her flaw brings about some of the film's most comical parts as she consistently forgets her name, who she's with and where she is going.

On the other side of the ocean, Nemo has been captured and is living in a fish tank with several other oceanic fish in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. While there, he meets a fish named Gill (Willem Dafoe) who is the leader of the tank and has a plan of escaping and returning to the ocean. But there's a problem. The dentist's niece has her eye on Nemo. At the same time, word has spread by way of Nigel (Geoffrey Rush), a crane that lives on the sea and visits the fish from time to time, that Nemo's father has been traveling the ocean in search for his son. It's now up to Marlin with the help of Dory, sharks, whales and sea turtles to find Nemo in time before he is taken home with the dentist's niece. One of `Finding Nemo's' strongest points beyond its animation is its humor. Adults will find the film just as entertaining, if not more so than children. Some of the film's funniest points occur when Marlin and Dory happen upon three sharks that have vowed to stop eating fish, under a motto of `fish are friends, not food!' However, when the scent of blood from other fish is in the water, the shark's eyes turn black and they can't fight back the urge to eat fish. It leads to the sharks chasing Marlin and Dory through a sunken battle ship where depth charges are still very much active. When a torpedo is released, it touches a depth charge and a huge underwater explosion takes place. While on the surface, however, two gulls are wading when bubbles hit the surface. One of the gulls looks at the other with disgust and says, `nice.' Another strong point of `Finding Nemo' is how visually striking the image is. The film is filled with every color in the spectrum. What's more, the detail that went into the design of characters and the anemone where Marlin and Nemo live is exquisite. Never before has computer animation been so full of life and dimension as that of `Finding Nemo.' `Finding Nemo' is more than pure fun for the whole family-it's an achievement for Disney and Pixar in their pursuit to entertain at a higher level than usual brand of family entertainment. Incidentally, a great deal of which comes from Disney. It's necessary to point out the score of the film by Thomas Newman, who has composed scores for such films as `The Shawshank Redemption' and last year's wonderful `Road to Perdition.' The music is elegant, filled with emotion and amusement that reaches beyond the usual campy scores of Randy Newman, whose done most of Disney's computer animated films. In the end, `Finding Nemo' is a treat for anyone seeking a fresh look at the computer-animated genre of family entertainment. ***",8
8 January 2004,Very 'cute' movie,"I shied away from this originally, but was finally forced to watch it with my 3 year old cousin. This is a very good movie. Yea its a kiddie film, but it appeals to all ages. Its very funny, Ellen DeGeneres in particular was a riot. The variety of characters all had something to contribute to the overall feel-good adventure vibe of the film. The animation is AMAZING...technology has really come a long way; I found myself in total awe throughout the film at how beautiful and detailed the environment was...wonderful. For what it sets out to do, Finding Nemo does it flawlessly...and you can't ask for much more in a movie. Easily one of the best animated films I've seen.

1 June 2003,Wow! The perfect movie...hats off to Pixar.,"We see over 75 movies a year and have not rated one a perfect 10 for over 3 years. This is the perfect movie. Pixar is amazing. Everything about this movie from the storyline to the characters to the unbelievable graphics are spectacular. Hats off to Pixar may they strike a new deal with Disney and keep them coming. Never expected them to top Toy Story, then Toy Story II and now this is even better. Wow!

20 November 2003,There's no time for clowning around when your son is missing...,"When Marlon loses his son, Nemo, to a diver, all of his fears about the open water prove to be within reason, but he has no time for that, because, throwing all caution aside, it's time to go after his son!

This is probably one of the best movies I have seen all year! It does not matter what age you are! If you are in the mood to watch this kind of film...WATCH IT! It starts out a little slow, at first, but, once the events that set the film in motion take place, I found myself rooting for Nemo just like I know all the kids do when they first watch this film. It's one of those kind that you can sum up by the old saying, ""This is the kind of film for kids of all ages...""

There was a time when I really did not care for these kind of films. And the bad rap that Disney studios has gotten over the past few years makes me sick. Disney stands for family values and those values have stood the test of time. I went out the first day ""The Lion King"" went on sale on DVD (I have 2 copies on VHS also) and it was my favorite animated movie of all time! This one comes in a close second!",9
4 December 2013,Beyond Excellent,"There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.

I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.

The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.

Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.",10
18 September 2003,"Its a good movie, but something was missing","My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****.

Finding Nemo is without a doubt the best movie I have seen all year. Unfortunately, thats not saying much. This year has been incredibly great for movies. But Nevertheless, Finding Nemo is a good movie.

The voicework is relatively good. Ellen Degeneres does some great work here. Albert Brooks does good work for his typical kind of character. The rest of the voicework is good.

There are some brilliant moments in Finding Nemo that have some of the best animation I have ever seen in a Disney movie. There are somy funny and creative scenes, and sometimes the two are combined. It is a visually stunning film, and it is above some of the disney work. But something is missing that I cannot say it is the best Pixar film, which The Toy Story's still hold. But it is the best film of the year and worth a look.",8
19 January 2006,A Wild and Colorful Ride,"It's always a pleasure to see Pixar come out with another movie. Pixar has the power to make you laugh, and make you smile. When you walk out of the theater, you can show off that big grin crowding your face.

Okay. Well enough of the corny-ness. Finding Nemo is a good, fun movie. It is a movie about a fish named Marlin, who is trying to find his little son in a big ocean.

While it is a good movie, I found it to be over-hyped and disappointing. With most of the Pixar and Dreamworks movies working more in the comedy department, we would expect Pixar to go in a more comedic direction. But, Finding Nemo wasn't the laugh-fest I expected it to be. Sorry about my bias, but I was pretty disappointed! I also thought certain lines such as ""That snail was about to charge"" were a bit corny. That upset me a bit too. Besides, the plot is a bit similar to Toy Story. A character gets lost, and somebody goes out to rescue him. But, that's just my opinion.

7/10

Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7
18 June 2003,4 on a scale of 10,"First of all, I'm 49. Need I say more?

Number of ROTFLMAO = ZERO Number of laughs = ZERO Number of chuckles = ZERO Number of smiles = THREE (and one of them was when I saw ""the end""! Number of excruciatingly boring seconds = 8458 (two seconds subtracted for the two smiles). And, believe me it seemed like 20,000!

All I can say is that my kids drug me to this movie after they had already seen it once. What a fool I was. Look, cartoons are for kids. How complicated is that? There is no reason I should like this movie anymore than there is for them to like The Matrix.

It's a great family with young kids film, especially when all we're left with is the new Marvel or DC comic action hero film. It's a nice film accept it for what it is.

Looks like Pixar are becoming one, 5 out of 5 times they have delivered perfectly formed gems, for the kids in all of us. nemo, is witty, touching, educational, knowing (without being smug or clever)and brilliantly realised. the animation keeps getting better and better, they have wisely dropped the musical number. the choice of voices again absolutly inspired. God i wish i had shares in them, they are about the only people who are delivering great commercial Art.

26 February 2005,A good movie for children!!!,"This is very good work. The animation, story and so on. but i miss one thing. cause usually Disney films like this have a lot of humour but i miss that in Finding Nemo. Shrek has a lot of humor. and that kind of humor are made for grown ups i think. Shrek is not a movie made for children but for the older audience. but this one ain't so funny. but we must think on it as a children's movie. i am 15 so i don't think much of the jokes were suitable for me. i like simple jokes with not to much of the good stuff. American comedies exaggerates and destroy the joke. anyway this is a good movie for children and it contains some humor. try not to get tired of the lady fish. cause i did.

7 November 2022,Another fun animated film by Pixar Animation Studios,"A story about a young clownfish who was stolen from his father, who would do anything to get his son back. He journeys across the vast ocean taking on bigger-than-his-size risks, eventually succeeding into finding his one and only kid and at the end, they both learn a valuable lesson. Dory is of course one of the top well-known characters from many people's childhoods (including my own). With the beautiful ""deep ocean blue"" theme of this film, there's really no reason why you wouldn't like/enjoy it. Speaking of which, a big kudos to the animators with this film with the smooth movements of each and every fish as well as everything else. A very good and classic film as a childhood for me and shall always be one along with the rest of the Disney Pixar movie chain.

24 March 2007,One of the best animated films ever to see the grace of a movie screen,"One of the best animated films ever to see the grace of a movie screen, Finding Nemo is a classic piece of cinema that'll probably stick around for decades to come. The classic story of a kid looking for his father looking for his kid finds new life when re-located to the bottom of the ocean. Taking the manifestation of aquatic life, the movie confronts us with one of the most beautiful and miraculous secrets this Earth still has to offer. To balance it all up, Ellen DeGeneres's forgetful-yet-unforgettable Dory brings in the masses with her witty voice over, while the endless variety of colors and vivid imagination rolls in the rest.

Finding Nemo is one of those few films that'll make you want to laugh, to cry, and to embrace your loved ones over and over again.

3 July 2005,An unwatchable film from Pixar!!!,"I could not stand this film it is so stupid and the computer graphics look so cheesy and cheap. Pixar you can do better than this crap the film is completely unwatchable. The voices do not move with the fishes mouths right and the so called story to this film is hard to follow. I really think everybody should take another look and see how wretchedly bad this film is. Although I've seen worse films in my time but this is still pretty bad stuff here. It's popular (for what reason I have no clue) but none the less it is popular. I guess it's just me but the film sucked to my judgment. I recommend this film to Disney fans only. I was stupid to watch but who wouldn't watch it with all the hype.

29 June 2003,Is there anything that Pixar Can't do? Finding Nemo is Spectacular!,"Pixar is my favorite animation company, I think its superior to what Disney is now, but when Walt was in charge, Disney was better. I think the smartest move Disney's made in recent history was teaming up with Pixar because without Toy Story and the others, who knows where Disney would be.

I can't wait for Pixar's next movie- ""The Incredibles"" to come out, because the trailer that is shown at the begining of Finding Nemo is absolutely hilarious. Finding Nemo is brilliant. Everything about it is interesting, Marlin is wonderfully voiced by Albert Brooks and Dory provides funny, but in some times annoying commentary from Ellen Degeneres. I love the look of Finding Nemo, there are some scenes that its hard to believe they aren't real. The Shark's 12 step program is great. Another great highlight of Finding Nemo is the scenes in the fishtank in the Dentist's office. I loved all the unique and funny personalities of all the fish: the fish afraid of germs, the one that had mulitiple personalities, the one that loves bubbles, the dirty one, the crab that loves cleaning, the starfish who's the lookout, etc. I also loved how the fish are really interested in the dentist's work and give commentary about what procedure's he's doing. The fish were great, in fact those animated fish in that little tank have more characterization and personality than the entire mean cast of ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".

Well, I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. I loved Finding Nemo, and I can't wait for ""THE INCREDIBLES""..

please let me know what you thought of my review. Thanks!",
21 June 2016,A Well Made Pixar Classic,"I just watched ""Finding Nemo"" for the first time, in preparation for ""Finding Dory"". Like with most Pixar films, this movie is beautifully made and wonderfully entertaining. I found the story to be neat, and all in all it was just a great film.

One of the things that ""Finding Nemo"" has going for it is it's wonderful story telling. In it you'll find Marlin, a clown fish, seeking out his lost son Nemo. The adventure takes Marlin and his newfound friend, Dory, on a great adventure that spans heights and depths of the oceans, and sees the pair interact with many different forms of sea life.

The film is beautiful to behold, with lots of detail in the fish and their underwater environments. I watched this via streaming on Amazon, and while I paid for the HD version, the quality was awfully grainy at points. I definitely think this would be a great movie to see on Blu Ray, as the animation is just stunning.

All in all I'm giving ""Finding Nemo"" 8/10 stars. It was a delightful movie and one that I can imagine myself watching again--just not in my top tier of 9 or 10 star movies.",8
16 June 2018,Under the Sea,"Pixar's beautifully animated classic shines as one of the greats! Finding Nemo's great animation and colorful characters make for beautiful film experience that will make you feel all kinds of emotion. Stellar direction and story from Andrew Stanton and beautiful performances. (the standout being Ellen DeGenerous) Finding Nemo is and always will be the great film that it deserves to be.

It also won an Oscar for the 'Best Animated Film of the Year' in 2003. So clearly, this is a film worth watching. But if you're still not convinced then perhaps some of these comments will help.

The story is engaging. A fish-father Marlin has only one precious son called Nemo, who happens to be the son of his now deceased fish-wife. But Nemo is taken away from Marlin. Because of Marlin's vow years ago to never let anything bad happen to his son, Marlin goes in search of Nemo. It's a journey which takes Marlin through much of the ocean. Along the way, Marlin encounters plenty of action, characters, terrible situations and is increasingly discouraged that he might never see Nemo again. But along the way he learns a few important lessons about parenting and the value of true friendship. Also, his determination in seeking to find his son is well worth viewers learning from. Family is something that cannot be replaced and should be protected and nurtured even if it costs you everything you have, including your life.

The script and characters are both brilliant. Some of the ideas are wacky, but it's the kind of thing that both adults and children have found really funny. Dory is generally the first character who everybody remembers. She is really good company and she is a classic character in Disney film-making history. Imagine it: Marlin needs help finding his son and of all the fish in the ocean he gets stuck with one who has short term memory loss! The main character Marlin is enjoyable to watch and it's interesting to see his slow, but certain progress as a father who loves his son. Bruce the great-white shark, though he is not a main character, is also very unique and entertaining. Just about every character in this film is memorable: Gill, Nigel, Nemo, and the rest. They are all great and the script-writers have made them interact beautifully and creatively!

The special effects are incredible. You really feel like you are watching a story taking place in the big-wide world called the ocean. It's breath-taking. I remember going to see it in the cinema in 2004 and it blew us all away. It was another step forward for its time.

For some reason, I always love to re-visit this film and it's never disappointing. It's a real feel-good film. It's funny, it's extremely entertaining and it will also make you cry if you're a right sissy like me. Brilliant film and worth buying to enjoy again and again.

26 June 2023,Under The Sea,"When Pixar studio made the world's first totally computer-animated film, Hollywood insiders were flabbergasted. As ""Toy Story"" then turned out to be the highest-grossing movie of the year, everyone else was surprised too. But obviously, the guys behind the picture knew what they were doing. In a short period of time, Pixar released three new computer-animated titles. All of them successful.

Fast forward eight years. With a number of interesting projects in the pipeline, the need for more space forced Pixar to build a bigger studio in California. So, director Andrew Stanton, who had already started toiling on ""Finding Nemo"", was forced to move to the new building. And he wasn't alone. Soon, more than 200 dedicated crew members were working on the upcoming Nemo production.

The film follows a neurotic clown fish who searches the Indian Ocean for his lost son. The boy has disappeared on his way to school. To help him in his quest, the father is aided by a cute, scaly girlfriend. But she, unfortunately, suffers from severe short-time memory loss.

""Saving Nemo"" was not an easy movie to make. As the look of the underwater world is so essential, Andrew Stanton was forced to resort to drastic methods. First, the production crew was sent to Hawaii to learn scuba diving. Second, they were flown to the Great Barrier Reef to study the actual environments they would portray. Ironically, Pixar then had to make the film look more cartoony so the audience wouldn't think they were watching real footage of the ocean.

Fortunately, ""Saving Nemo"" was a huge success internationally. It also became the first animated film from Disney/Pixar to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. And when the DVD came out, the success was complete. With 41 million copies sold worldwide, ""Finding Nemo"" is one of the best-selling DVDs of all time.",7
20 March 2019,Stunning,"One of Disney & Pixar's finest - visually, musically and emotionally stunning. Perfect for the whole family, such a wholesome story and so wonderfully executed. Cannot fault it.

1 May 2020,Pixar is awesome!,"The last time I've seen Finding Nemo was many years ago as a kid. I always thought this was one of the weaker Pixar movies but thats totally not true. It's a beautiful and creativ story with funny and heartbreaking scenes. One of the best animated movies out there.

25 December 2004,Visually stunning and occasionally entertaining,"Pixar threw every dollar they had into the look of this film, it's too bad they didn't hire a writer. Still, it's a good flick to throw on when you want to zombify your children although I suspect anyone over the age of six will end up screaming ""we get the point, already!"" at the television. The cast is good, often doing amazing things with the drek they were given to read. I suspect the writers ran out of material somewhere around the sixty minute mark, after that they just keep repeating the same line over and over and over and over and over and over and over...

If you're over the age of eight then Finding Nemo makes a better screensaver than film.

11 February 2004,"Better than average animated film, but nothing great.","I'm not much of a fan of these computer animated films. I've seen them all, but have only liked ANTZ and MONSTERS INC. But FINDING NEMO is a passable flick, mostly due to its stunningly gorgeous visuals.

Wow, what a beautiful-looking movie. I was especially impressed with the jellyfish scene; there was something dreamy about their look, It's hard to explain, but they felt both real and unreal.

I laughed several times, but I'm bored with praising the movie (Ellen was marvelous, blah, blah), so let me nitpick. Well, not nitpick exactly - these are just thoughts I had while watching it:

*Much of it seemed like a video game, where you survive a challenge and advance to the next world.

*Why did some characters have American accents, and others Australian ones? And how were their voices so clear in the water? (You ever try talking under water?) And how did their voices sometimes echo in the water? And howcum their voices sounded the same both in and out of water?

*Can fish adapt so easily from salt water to fresh and back again?

*Do fish really sleep on their side? Do they sleep at all?

*A little surfer-dude speak goes a long way. How would sea turtles acquire such a patois? Do they spend a lot of time on the beach? Or licking funny frogs?

*Would a doctor give a fish with a visual defect to his daughter as a gift?

*Why would a doctor (or anyone) write his business address on a pair of cheap goggles?

*There was one climax too many. Did we really need one more perilous situation?

*What's with Pixar and bad kids with braces?

I guess that's about all the questions I shouldn't ask. None matter, do they?

14 January 2005,Whoa...,"A beautiful CG movie, what more can I say? Fishy but good, it begins with Marlin a clown fish, and he takes care of his son, but ends being captured, and now he has to find him, with this fish that always and always forgets. Nemo, the son, of course ends up in a Dentist's clinic and gets acquainted with other fish and a bird down under. Overall an excellent animated film with colorful characters, and great CG, heart warming, very funny and well, did I mention great CG? I like especially the part with the sharks who keep getting tempted to eat them, and the one with turtles is cool, and the funniest scene has to be in the Dentist clinic in the middle of the movie, check it out. Recommended to the whole family, and animation fans everywhere, and to those who liked Shrek and Toy Story.

1 June 2003,Funniest Film This Summer,"I don't think I have laughed this hard during an animated film since ""Shrek."" Ellen DeGeneras steals the whole movie as the voice of Dorey, a hyper fish suffering from short term memory loss. This film is filled with many funny scenes especially when Dorey tries to communicate with a whale! I loved it so much, I saw it twice in one day!

2 June 2003,Just about perfect!,"Where to begin? The beautiful ocean special effects? The fantastic vocal performances by Albert Brooks and Ellen Degeneres? The thrilling fast-paced story? The grand musical score? Little touches like a Buzz Lightyear doll on the floor of the dentist's office, or lobsters that talk with a Maine accent? Whew! It's amazing!

30 May 2003,Another great movie from Pixar!,"I have 3 kids, 7, 5, 4 (boy, boy, girl) they all really enjoyed it. Paid attention the whole time, which is how I judge if they like it or not. The movie has a solid story, some great one liners and jokes. My kids and I both laughed, my wife even commented on my laughter, I guess I don't laugh as much as I use too, old age and all. Great picture for the whole family, nothing offensive or scary. Clever inside jokes here and there.. for instance the Shark's name is Bruce, this was the name given the mechanical shark in Jaws by the film crew.

Pixar has delivered another top notch film, imho they are batting 1.000, all 5 movies have been good to great and all of them are still fun to watch again.

31 May 2003,Outstanding Family Film,"Finding Nemo will find its way to the top of the Pixar hierarchy. Funny, visually enthralling, original and scary, it is true Disney formula and completely unique all at once.

Using the ocean around Australia gives the film limitless possibility for colours, creatures and adventures, as well as whacky accents. Our heros fight sharks in a twelve step program, pelicans, a flat out hysterical flock of seagulls, an old submarine, a vicious four-year-old with braces, fish obsessed with dental procedures and a hazardous group of jellyfish. Even though the plot is formula, the film is not.

The film involves Marlin and his son Nemo. Early on, Nemo is abducted by a diver and locked in a fish tank in a dentists office. His cowardly father embarks to find him with the help of Dory, a fish with ""short term memory loss"". In the tank, Nemo encounters a small band of captives who all dream of freedom.

I saw finding Nemo with five children aged 3 to 10, and they all were delighted, scared and thrilled. At the same time, my wife and I had belly laughs at the humour which was sufficiently adult without being inappropriate for the kids.

The true delight of Finding Nemo is in the animation. With every feature, Pixar refines its art and is able to add more to it's films. The colours and visuals are rich and delightful. Note the way the reds, pinks and purples give way to dark blue and grey when the characters are in peril. The small role characters, like the seagulls, crabs, turtles are created with care and depth.

I cannot recommend this movie enough. Like the Little Mermaid, having kids will give you an excuse to see this movie, but you won't need one. **** out of ****.",9
18 October 2003,What's all the fuss?,"am i missing something?, after the toy story 1 and 2 which got better and better then monsters inc which seemed to move it on, then shrek which did the same, well finding nemo looks to me that's it aimed squarely at kids where the others are too but with lots of tilts towards aldults with the jokes the kids won't have a hope of getting, i think i laughed out loud just the once and if we do get to buy it on DVD then i couldn't imagine watching it on my own, which i am more than happy to do on DVD now with all the toher disney stuff, maybe it's more of a merchandising thing now that it is aimed at kids so much that the adults have just become a sideline on the events

not much to fault on the animation, just where is the story?

All the other characters are interesting. The storyline was great, and the acting was amazing. I recommend this to anyone who's willing to give this a try.

5 January 2021,Finding Nemo,"Finding Nemo, directed, written, and originated by Andrew Stanton is one of the most loved Pixar classics! Andrew Stanton had a lot on his plate, being his first solo directing job, and coming off of Pixar's hot streak of both Toy Stories & Monster's Inc. Stanton had his hand all over this film, but had a game crew to back him up. After the end result, Finding Nemo & Andrew Stanton won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.

Stanton did a phenomenal job writing the story, and these favorable characters. Every single character was original, and funny, with enjoyable voice overs. The story was fast paced, but had deep meaning behind it all. Andrew Stanton had some great help with the brilliant, creative & witty script by Bob Peterson & David Reynolds, that withheld so much passion and creativity.

The cinematography and animation blew me away! The picture & animations were very clear & vibrant, with great textural detail.

Overall, there isn't too much bad to say about this film at all, unless you're really nit picking. Very well done, and a nostalgic classic.",10
28 July 2005,A funny family film for 2003,"*** 1/2 Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Willem Dafoe, Stephen Root, Geoffrey Rush, Bob Peterson, Barry Humphries and Andrew Stanton. Directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich.

Following the trail of the past years were animated movies ruled the box office for weeks at a time is Finding Nemo, Pixar's best movie so far. The movie about a paranoid father figure (Brooks) who finally lets his eager son Nemo (Gould) go to school. Nemo later is taken away by Scubadivers,Marlin now headstrong swims out to sea in search of his son, instead he meets up with an amnesia troubled fish Dory (DeGeneres). Together the two set off to find Marlin's lost son before it's to late. To be honest the story is a reminder of Shrek two odd balls meet up and are forced to be friends and go on an adventure. An over used story idea but none the less a good movie. Pixar studios surpass my expectations in an animated movie. My final rating 8/10.

5 February 2004,Pixar is the new Disney,"I will simply add to the well-deserved praise that has been justifiably heaped on this great animated movie. I saw it on its wide-release opening day on May 30, 2003, and I still remember it vividly. All of the voices for the fish and other characters are perfectly cast, especially Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres. Suitable for the whole family, not boring for adults! Really! It never forgets to show the ocean as a dark, dangerous, and forbidding place, and yet within that world a lot of fun stuff happens. Hey, I don't want to over-analyze this film. Just see it because it's fun and exciting!

Pixar doesn't need Disney, it has created it's own genre of 3D animation that is unmatched anywhere in the world! Go Steve Jobs! Go Pixar! And if you haven't seen it, Go See ""Finding Nemo""!

3 June 2004,All About The Reef,"In `Finding Nemo' we have not only a movie designed for adults and children but a tour-de-force in computerized animation. The obvious attention by the filmmakers to real environments is underscored by our constant study of the screen; there is, like on a real reef, frenetic activity in all of our view.

Following the adventures of a father fish (Marlin, voice of Albert Brooks) in pursuit of his kidnapped (by a diver to his aquarium) son (Nemo, voice of Alexander Gould) we meet a bevy of characters along the way. In turn we have fish schools (both of an academic nature and the more easily imagined natural sea configuration), non-traditional sharks, turtles and a host of other ocean creatures anthropomorphically styled. There is nearly no end to the pleasure received from each animated revelation.

The obvious care with which the undersea environment is depicted speaks volumes for the research done by the studio artists. With nearly all contemporary eyes cast heavenwards, it still remains that the vitality of reef life forms serve as a perfect centerpiece for cartoon mayhem.

During one particular chase scene involving sharks we see at its best the dynamic plasticity of animated characters; that quality of animators to stretch the physical reality of any corporeal subject, i.e, the mashing of an impassively expressionless fishes' face as it strikes an object, encouraging empathetic discomfort on the part of the viewer. This is abstraction at its finest, since it imbues the pratfall with fantasy.

There is a scene involving Dory meeting a whale that is for our money the funniest one moment ever recorded in animated film. Combined with the entire body of work Ellen Degeneres offers towards the success of `Nemo' we see her in an entirely new light.

That `Nemo' is one of the best animated films ever made is in little doubt. This is a true four-star effort; there is not one flaw evident. Or to put it another way, what would you have done differently?",
7 December 2003,A Classic for Years to Come,"I may have been one of the last people to see this movie. I would have loved to see it in the theaters, but my dad just does not like animated films. So it was kind of a surprise to hear him say that he really enjoyed this one. And why is that? Because he can relate to it, and I don't think he's the only parent out there that felt the same way about Finding Nemo.

Out of all the Pixar movies, I think this one is the most meaningful. What parent can't relate to letting go of their child and letting them live their own life? And what child can't relate to being overprotected by their parents? This film reaches to people of all ages and backgrounds, that it is purely astonishing. You can bet that this movie will hold a place in the hearts of millions of people for a long time.

Now, what do I think? Well, honestly, it's not my favorite Pixar flick. I found Monsters Inc and Toy Story 2 to be funnier and more enjoyable. That's not to say Finding Nemo doesn't have the comedic chops. I thought the Bruce the Shark scene was absolutely hysterical, and Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks provided excellent voice-work for their characters.

As for the animation, Pixar just keeps getting better and better. I was quite impressed with Sulley in Monsters Inc, but there were so many beautiful things to look at in Finding Nemo, I can't really narrow down one example.

So with all these great things, I still can't say that I absolutely loved this movie. It seems perfect in many ways, but it's just not one of my favorites. But hey, I'm just one person. This movie is going to be a favorite for millions of others out there. Bravo, Pixar!

My IMDb Rating: 9/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)",9
10 April 2004,"Tank you, Pixar!!!","As a scuba diver, few things could make me happier than seeing Jean-Micheal Cousteau appear in a DVD extra that millions of kids are going to watch over and over, communicating the gospel of protecting the underwater environment the easy way...with cartoons and humor. For that alone, the folks at Pixar should take a bow. Ya done Walt proud!!!

""Nemo"", like the equally impressive ""Shrek"", features state of the art animation and a working script with more heart and comedy than most of the live-action bombs currently crowding your local multiplex. When you have Willem DaFoe voicing an animated character, you're obviously arrived on a whole 'nother plateau in cartoonland, Sparky! And Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are no-brainers for this sort of stuff...just plop 'em in front of the mike and let 'em do their thing.

12-stepping sharks?... You just gotta love this film!!!

With all due respect to Leslie Nielsen in ""Airplane""...fish for dinner, anyone?",8
9 February 2022,"""Finding Nemo"", one of my favorite childhood movies.","Rewatching ""Finding Nemo"" once again brought a lot of good memories back to me when I was just a kid. This is just an amazing feeling.

The movie is still more than great. I want to thank everyone who worked on such amazing work.

26 May 2003,How I Found Finding Nemo,"If you can get past the first 15 minutes of Pixar's latest, you'll get a movie that is on par with their four other feature films. Finding Nemo turns out to be a big, adventure film with a lot of laughs and a heart that is barely on the good side of manipulation. Once the adventure starts, the emersion into the film begins and doesn't let you go.

The movie plays up on over-protective parents, kids overcoming their disabilities, friendships conquering obstacles, addicts joining together to be better people (uh, fish), building self-esteem, realizing and accepting strengths and curmudgeons learning to lighten up. All this in an animated, family-oriented, 'G' movie? You bet! Pixar are the masters at the making everyone happy film. They give the parents being dragged into the theater something to enjoy as well.

If only they had done something with that beginning. The films opens in a fish suburbia complete with happy families, beautiful homes and a peaceful way of life all with no hint of sardonic humor. Yes, there are people who think that is heaven, but what about those who make fun it? At least give them something to chuckle about. It's Utopia for the Family Values set and completely out of character for Pixar.

It's at this point I thought they had finally produced their first sub-standard film. That is until a barracuda changes the main characters lives forever and Albert Brooks goes into, well, Albert Brooks mode. Marlin (Albert Brooks) has a son, Nemo, who has an underdeveloped fin and therefore can't swim well. This combined with the catastrophe at the beginning of the film causes Marlin to smother Nemo. Nemo, finally fed up, rebels, ends up being caught by a diver and spirited away. Marlin sets out after Nemo and that's when the film finally picks up with some adventure and some laughs.

And when that laugh level is revved up, it's supplied by the scene-stealing Ellen DeGeneres as a blue tang named Dory. Dory is basically an idiot savant. She has a severe short-term memory loss problem. Now fish are believed to have no short-term memory so the jokes on the surface play on this; however, in a scene where Dory is faced with being alone without friends again, you wonder if it's a form of denial. She says in the scene that she doesn't want to forget anymore and that having Marlin around helps her remember because he is the only one that has stuck by her. Does she really have this problem or is it that she is so disappointed with no one understanding her that she hides everything? The scene is multi-layered and heart wrenching. Ellen plays it surprisingly well as if she identifies with what Dory is going through. That's what makes the scene work so well. Many of us have gone through the same thing and know how she feels.

There are many, many memorable scenes in the film as Marlin attempts to find Nemo who is now in a fish tank in a dentist office. One of the scenes is supplied in a superb performance by William Dafoe as Gill, an angelfish in the tank with Nemo who is from the ocean (not a pet store) and dreams of escaping and taking his new friends with him. He devises a scheme to get them out that is hair-brained and daring, but with one little plot hole that the film plays up to hilarious effect at the end. Another great scene is with a trio of sharks that have sworn off fish in the most unlikely AA meeting imaginable. Their motto: ""Fish are our friends and not food!""

Finding Nemo is grand and exciting adventure that once it gets beyond it's slow opening turns into exactly what you expect from the masterminds at Pixar. A film that is imaginative and visually stunning with big adventures for everyone no matter how old they are on the outside.",9
11 September 2016,Nemo... or omen?,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",8
9 November 2003,A good flick for the whole family,"From the very first scene this movie is great. The movie follows a clown fish by the name of Marlin who travels through the ocean in search of his missing son. Between meeting Doris, 3 ""fish friendly"" sharks, 150 old turtles along with many more, he finally manages to find little Nemo...but how does he get out of the tank??? Watch and find out!

I gave this 9/10 purely for the laughs, animation and story. Definitely worth watching!!!

25 January 2004,Part irritating kids film and part spectacular underwater adventure.,"Okay, so Pixar have to release films under the Disney banner guaranteeing that all of their films will have a happy ending, appeal to kids from toddlers up and have the occasional syrupy, manipulative heart-tugging scene thrown in. But Pixar being Pixar, arguably the finest computer animators in the business, know how to use the freedom of the computer animated world to create previously unseen spectacles and go where no motion picture has gone before. We all know we want to see Pixar films, is there really any reason to be reading reviews when the names ""Pixar"" and ""Disney"" on the cover say it all?

7 July 2003,A good date movie!,"I know most guys my age, when thinking of movies to take a girl to, are probably thinking right now about ""Alex&Emma,"" or maybe if she's hard-core enough you could both enjoy ""T3."" Well, I've been out of the dating game for a little while, and out of the movie game for a film buff. (Last Hollywood film I saw was Bruce Almighty, and that was bad enough to get me to swear off for a little while...) However, somehow things came together that I got to take a beautiful girl to see what was a perfectly fun movie yesterday afternoon, and I was not the only guy taking a date to Finding Nemo! I love animated movies that offer something to both adults and kids, like Monsters, Inc. and Spirited Away. This is another perfect example of that trend. First comment out of my mouth after it was over: I said to Ali, ""These guys know how to deliver a heightened sense of reality."" The colors, the movements, the FEEL that these guys bring to the ocean is incredible, and hopefully based on some great research and photography.

Now if only Winged Migration was making this much money...;>)

13 May 2007,The Biggest F****** Joke Ever,"When I saw a rating of 8.2 I did a double take. How on earth did this farce manage a rating of that? The lot is trash, even if your a kid! I mean i'm not that into animation films but I found Shrek quite enjoyable and other children's films like the lion king and the Jungle Book were vastly superior.

For a start Nemo himself is incredibly annoying and I was hoping throughout the movie that a shark would come along and snap him up (knowing full well this would never actually happen). Secondly the story line reaches new heights of insanity. All movies aimed at young audiences are silly but this one is so much worse and stupider than any of the other ones. It's boring it's sad and it makes me feel embarrassed than something so horrible and ugly in film could be enjoyed by so many people.

Nemo actually means nobody, suggesting that even the guy who came up with the title is laughing at this movie. I can barely understand how children like it but adults as well? What is the world coming to? Please don't watch this movie if you haven't seen it. It's simply disgusting.",1
6 January 2004,Lovely,"In years to come, the period from 1989 onward (starting with ""The Little Mermaid"") will probably be regarded as a golden age of animation. At the end of this offering, you have to ask yourself, where can animation go from here? I don't know, but I bet that someone at Pixar does.

In the meantime, this is a breathtaking job of film-making. The animation is astonishing - the underwater effects are so convincing that, at times, I found myself wishing for a wetsuit. Add to this a clever script, glorious music, and perfect voicing - Ellen DeGeneres, of all people, deserves special mention and I loved Geoffrey Rush's stint as a pelican - and the result is a rather special movie experience.

Is there a flaw? Well, maybe it's a bit on the long side for an animated feature.

Strongly recommended nevertheless. Rating: 9/10.",9

5 July 2003,Eye-popping animation,"Fish aren't cuddly. The scales, the smell and the cold blooded nature of the species make them difficult to hug, let alone curl up with. That perception will likely change with the release of Finding Nemo, a film that will do for fish what Babe did for pigs. That is, make them seem like something more than just an accompaniment for French fries.

Pixar, (in co-operation with Disney) the clever animators behind Toy Story and Monsters Inc, are back with a story about a young clownfish named Nemo (Alexander Gould) who gets separated from Marlin (Albert Brooks), his over protected father. With the help of Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a blue fish with short term memory loss, Marlin desperately searches for his son. In the process he learns about himself and love while risking life and fin to find his son.

The story is typical Disney claptrap, a tale that hits the same emotional buttons that have marked kid's films since Bambi was a fawn. But it's not the story that recommends Finding Nemo and makes it the achievement that it is.

The script is tight and quite funny (although in a more subtle way than previous Pixar creations) but it is the visuals that overwhelm. The computer geeks at Pixar have imbued their undersea world with such feeling and splendour that it is hard to believe it isn't real, that it is, in fact, nothing more than cleverly arranged binary code. The colours and textures of the sea literally come alive on the screen and show a real eye for detail. Particularly eye-popping is the jelly-fish sequence, a beautifully realized scene in which Marlin and Dory must navigate their way through a school of opaque stinging sea creatures.

Albert Brooks heads the cast as Marlin. He's neurotic, not unlike many of the characters Brooks has played before, but is charmingly so. This may be his best role since Broadcast News. When he deadpans that, despite the name, clownfish aren't really all that funny, you know the part was written for him. Ellen DeGeneres brings considerable charm to the scatterbrained Dory, while Willem Dafoe and Geoffrey Rush also contribute voices.

Finding Nemo is more than just a technical marvel; it is a computer animated film that transcends the animation to become a film which will engage the heart as well as the mind.",
4 July 2003,Hilarious and touching,"""Finding Nemo"" is a whale of a tale (to borrow from the Disney song borrowed in this movie) about fathers and sons, friends and trust, and facing your fears.

Beautifully illustrated and voiced, Finding Nemo is a movie that will delight audiences of all ages. Ellen DeGeneres had the adults and kids rocking with laughter in one of the best sequences of the movie, and both DeGeneres and Albert Brooks were able to bring real warmth and emotion to the movie. The storyline, which I will not go into, is written well enough that it never talks down to anyone and does not rely on worn-out clichés.

As far as the animation goes, it is now undeniable that Pixar leads the pack for clarity, realism, and art. If you doubt this, check out the reef sequences, or the fish tank sequences. I could easily have lost myself in the sheer beauty of their animation.

A definite must-see while it's still in the theaters, and it's on my DVD wish list, too.",9
8 July 2003,"More focused than ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""A Bug's Life,"" but less meaningful than ""Toy Story 2"" (very minor spoilers)","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
26 November 2004,"Entertaining, Whimsical Underwater Adventure","Pixar has done it again, lending their spectacular, realistic visual work to a delightful, fruitful, and entertaining setting and story. They always manage to make their characters (whatever species they are) appear less robotic and superficial, and more human and understandable, and in ""Finding Nemo"", the clownfish, bluefish, blowfish, sharks, turtles, seagulls, etc. are very funny, delightful, and somewhat lovable, in this entertaining, if kiddish, underwater adventure. The story involves an overprotective, overanxious clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is on a perilous quest to find his escaped and abducted son, Nemo, and must plight throughout the Pacific Ocean, with the help of many underwater creatures, in order to prove what kind of loving, devoted father he is. Along his way, Marlin befriends a forgetful and peculiar bluefish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who provides most of the signature Disney humor throughout the film, a gang of ""fish deprived"" sharks, a troop of turtles (""Grab shell, Dude!""), some seagulls, a few other fish, and many more, including some unpleasant acquaintances, such as stinging jellyfish, angry lightning-fish, and savage sharks, all in a delightful, thrilling, and entertaining adventure. Meanwhile, Nemo has been placed inside a Dentist's tank somewhere in Australia and makes friends of his own, learning to adapt to confined waters. What I enjoyed the most about this film was the refreshing and realistic look of the water- one really feels they are situated inside an ocean, ""along for the ride"", with the marvelous animation of Pixar, which is always effective. Admittedly, some of the dialog here is somewhat bland and cliché, and oftentimes Dory becomes more of an annoyance than a funny diversion, and there is a prevalence of wanton sentimentality here that is expected of a Disney family film. Yet, the story is delightful and entertaining, the characters are mostly funny and memorable, the visuals are awesome and splendid, and ""Finding Nemo"" is genuinely a step above the usual Disney family fare. Bravo to Pixar for creating yet another wonderful adventure that almost everyone who can swim can enjoy! ***1/2 out of ****",

2 July 2022,Just keep swimming!,"Finding Nemo is known to be one of the best animated films of all time. It won lot's of awards, but does it deserve this kind of recognition? I'd mostly say yes.

The story is a very simple yet still a fascinating one. It's about a worrying father named Marlin who has to swim the entire Pacific ocean to bring his son Nemo back home. Throughout the journey he meets lot's of creatures, both harmless and dangerous, but his fatherly love won't stop him. But he isn't the only fish in the story. Another prominent character here is Dory, who is kind and optimistic, but has memory problems. Both characters were fleshed out and memorable! And each one had a good backstory explaining what happened to them before. There's also a subplot about Nemo himself being stuck in a aquarium with other fish. Which is also interesting, because the whole gang tries to create a plan to escape. Other important characters include vegetarian sharks (don't confuse them with other sharks from the 2004 film Shark tale, also these movies are different in general), sea turtles, jellyfish, pelicans and probably the funniest ones the seagulls. The last one kept shouting mine whenever they see something valuable. As for the threat scenes, they were well executed, you can actually feel the sense of danger like with the anglerfish, where at first the characters see the light, which could represent hope, but it turns out that they are in great danger.

Other elements that I loved about this movie include the animation. It looked so beautiful! It has a huge variety of both sea and even some land animals. Each have a distinguish design that makes each one stand out. Just by looking at fish alone, you can see that the animators putted a lot of effort into each one of them. The ocean looks nearly realistic, including the waves at the surface. In fact, pixar had to reanimate the water, because the first attempt at animating was so well done, that it looked way too realistic. The soundtrack is so wonderful and it captures the feeling of each moment. Especially in the beginning, where Marlin realises that his only son Nemo survived.

Despite it's simplistic plot, Finding Nemo is a must watch for all animatiom fans, regardless of their age. It has heart, humour and adventure. All 3 elements were greatly made. This is a movie that everyone needs to watch. As for myself, well, I really liked it. It was breathtaking.",8
14 July 2003,Boring for adults; too intense for kids,"This film uses stereotype, boring personalities to tell the story of a lost fish and his scared dad who goes to find him. Some of the personalities (like the one played by Ellen DeGeneres) are funny at first, but quickly become over-used. It gets tedious after a while. Pixar makes it look like a kid's film, but the shark scenes are scarier than Jaws. It is probably OK for teens, but not for young children.

6 April 2004,This movie is great,"anybody who doesnt like this movie is a pussy. This movie was more than tolerable for an animation. The concept was solid and the characters were likeable and superbly animated. The voice actors were cast perfectly and gave great performances. The entertainment value is a five out of five. The action sequences were so brilliantly done that it doesnt lose value with each time you view it. The transitions where creatively done and kept the storyline well in pace. I look forward to seeing the next Pixar animated film THE INCREDIBLES although i wonder if it will be much different since its written and directed by Brad Bird. Pixar is where it's at in the world of new high end animation..and like i said ..if you don't like this movie .. then you're just not a true fan of cg animation.

5 February 2004,Painfully good,"The formula works, dammit! This is a story about a fish who goes in search of another fish, and is helped by a third fish. There are some sharks, some turtles and a fish tank full of, yep, fish. Oh, and it contains probably the scariest movie moment I witnessed in 2003  Marlin and Dory becoming surrounded by jellyfish and needing to get out without being stung.

5 July 2003,GO FISH!!!,"Talk about an instant classic! Pixar and Disney have done it again!Thank God! I put this up there with the Toy Story and A Bug's Life as instant animation classics. I loved this movie. IT was very funny and quite well done. The voices for the sea characters were perfect to a tee. Albert Brooks was superb and Ellen DeGeneras was, in a word GREAT! Dorey has to be one of the more memorable cartoon characters in Disney history. She and Willem Dafoe almost stole ths how. There is a plethora of enjoyable characters ranging form the title character and his father to Dorey, the sea turtles, the sharks and their twelve step program to the even the human characters. One of the funniest and probably underappreciated aspects was how the seagulls were portrayed. Anytime they saw food or potential food they said ""Mine"" Having dealt with real seagulls up close that fit those annoying birds personas very well. This movie is great fun for the whole family. I would pay $7.50 to see it again. I can hardly wait to buy it on video. All I can say is go see it and GO FISH!!!

23 July 2003,Entertaining and multi-layered,"The great thing about animation is that the sky is the limit as to

content both literary and visual. There is so much to look at and so

many messages(themes) that once I recovered from the sensory overload, I

had alot to talk about on the drive home from the theater. Like all Disney films, Finding Nemo has a multitutde messages about

love, family relationships, good and evil, helping those who are weaker

than us and courage. I got a little fed up (no pun intended) with the

""fish are friends not food"" message though. I also liked the way that the violence was handled. None of the children

in the theater where I sat had to be carried out screaming (maybe they

were paralyzed with fear). The film's creators seemed to give us just

enough to scare us without rubbing our nose in gore. A g",
15 June 2003,Passafist Reviews Finding Nemo,"In the age-old battle between what's important in film, plot or character? I'm convinced character is king. Nothing makes this idea truer than a film like Pixar's FINDING NEMO. A delightful new animated comedy from those guys that brought you Toy Story.

Sure there's a plot; it's about a father fish searching for his son fish. Many films operate on this premise. In fact even PIXAR's TOY STORY 2, borrows this premise. (For those who don't know TOY STORY 2's main plot is about a toy being stolen by evil toy man, and how his friends try to save him.) But like the above film FINDING NEMO is really about the colorful characters our hero encounters.

Albert Brooks (The Muse) voices and is Marlin. His performance could be compared to Woody Allen, who voiced himself in the film ANTZ. Like Allen this film plays with his film persona, his neurotic tendencies. The minute you see him you buy it. If Albert Brooks were a Clown Fish this is exactly how he'd look and act.

Ellen Degeneres (Mr. Wrong) voices Dory, and for once she's funny. (Yes, Ellen when you drop the gay jokes and just act funny, you actually have a shot at being entertaining.) She has some really great sequences in this film; my favorite was her talking to a blue whale. Dory also has some short-term memory loss. I kept thinking to myself, so if Memento was comedy about fish, this is probably what it would look like.

My favorite performance is William Dafoe (Auto-Focus) as Gill. I liked how the animators used Dafoe's face as the model for Gill's deformity. The details are astounding. His performance is electric. He plays the leader of the fish tank with such power, I wished he was my leader. But Alas, I am not a computer-animated fish. Oh well.

The film looks amazing. Directors Andrew Stanton (A Bug's Life) and Lee Unkrich (Monster's Inc) do an amazing job of creating a world under the sea. If you allow yourself the time to immerse yourself in it, you'll be transformed. It's some of the best digitally rendered computer animation I've ever seen. It exists in realm somewhere between what's real and what's pure fantasy. That's the kind of place all computer-animated worlds should lay.

So here it is a great film. A film that fills a paper-thin plot with characters you laugh with, cry with, and want to be with. There are vegetarian sharks, lobsters with New England accents, and California surfer turtles, if any of this sounds interesting this is the kind of film for you.

So Swim, don't walk to see.FINDING NEMO.",
12 July 2013,Family-friendly movie and fun for all ages.,"This is one of my favorite Pixar movies! I could sit and watch this movie all day. It's one of those movies that will never get old. To this day, I still cry when Nemo's mom dies. I find this movie to be not only family-friendly, but age appropriate. Anybody of any age can sit down and watch this movie. The variety of ocean life that they use is great for young children because it teaches them what animals live in the ocean. It's one of those movies that's perfect for family movie night or just simply at a sleepover. When I was in high school, my government teacher gave us a movie day and this was the movie of choice. Everybody in the class was so excited and nobody complained. I highly recommend this movie, especially with younger children. You're never too old or too young to watch Nemo.

15 November 2021,Just Keep Swimming,"Nemo's dad is protective (sometimes overly), loving, and determined when it comes to finding his son. He makes mistakes, but he learns from them. Nemo is brave (and sometimes defiant) and learns lessons about working together. He doesn't let his disability slow him down. Though not intended as an educational movie, kids will pick up facts about sea creatures and perhaps an interest in learning more about the ocean. Diverse characters get along well, and a disabled character is brave and capable. A father searches tirelessly for his son and learns a lesson in letting go and letting him grow up. Major themes include compassion, gratitude, perseverance, and courage.

Finding Nemo is not the only greatest film it's the greatest Pixar they ever made the characters are great especially sea creatures, the story was phenomenal, the music was incredible. They gave the film a 100% score.

15 November 2003,Maritime Memento,"My favourite character, Dory, has short-term memory loss, so that's why I was reminded of 'Memento'. I saw this film by accident, because my original choice was thwarted because 'the film had broken down'. What good fortune because otherwise I suppose I may never have experienced 'Finding Nemo'. This was definitely the best animation I have ever seen, Disney classics aside. (You know, the 'real' animation.) Forget 'Monsters Inc'. That was good. Even the Toy Story movies aren't as good as this one, in my opinion. There isn't a dull moment in this highly intelligent film, which, on the fish face of it, sounded pretty boring. This is the real 'Ocean's 11'...getting to Nemo at the eleventh hour. When I watch a film like this, I wonder how other script-writers sleep at night. This has got more class than a hundred non-animated films I could mention put together. There is simply nothing bad to say about this movie. My only negative thought is that I was hoping the shipwreck was going to be the 'Titanic'! (but we were in the wrong ocean for that.) I liked the 'other movie jokes' such as 'Terminator' and felt that a mickey-take of 'Titanic' could have been appropriate, especially as some idiots have just voted it the worst film ever made. Well, it gets in my top five, actually -'titanic' that is, because I can't really 'do' cartoon lists. If I did, 'Peter Pan' would be my number one, with 'Finding Nemo' in that top five somewhere. I am almost considering buying this film eventually, it's that good. 8 out of 10. Impossible to dislike this, unless you're born miserable.",
4 August 2003,"Insensitive, ignorant or cruel, which?","The character ""Dory"" was depicted with symptoms of early-stage Alzheimer Disease. That is heartbreaking, not amusing or entertaining. Yet another sign of some deep, sinister perversity in the Disney organisation. Every time I go to a Disney movie, I do so in a state of innocent anticipation, and every time I'm bitten by their warped morality. The Lion King was another case in point. The fact that these things are aimed at children and vetted approvingly by parents who seem oblivious to the underlying theme forces one really to consider to what extent movies like this are a reflection of the values of modern Western society, - or whether they work to bring about those values. Either way, I would be less frightened of the future if they where more frequently subjected to the accusatory criticism they deserve.

23 June 2003,"Decent, but no Monsters, Inc.","Pixar put together a fairly entertaining film with Finding Nemo, especially in light of the crop of terrible Hollywood offerings this summer (Matrix 2 and The Italian Job come to mind). Not as engaging or amusing as Monsters, Inc, but still an enjoyable diversion. I had expected this film to be a lot funnier than it was-- there were far too many times when it seemed the writers sensed they needed more comedy and decided, ""Oh, we'll have the Ellen character forget something. Again."" But there was enough about the movie that was amusing to keep my attention.

The major problem I had with the movie is that Disney and Pixar had a wonderful opportunity to make a fairly strong environmental comment with the potential to reach millions of future consumers (and potential polluters), yet they failed enormously.

I didn't buy a ticket to Finding Nemo expecting to see a ""message movie."" I did, however, expect to see the issue of pollution touched on, even in an antiseptic, stock-holder-friendly Disney kind of way. There were numerous opportunities for this, specifically at the point when Marlin and Dora enter Sidney harbor and are officially in man's domain. Yet Disney repeatedly dropped the ball. After having established a lovable cast of characters that the audience was entirely in love with, Disney easily could have presented at least a hint of the idea that mankind is doing serious and possibly irreparable damage to the environment. And that mankind can do something about it.

But that's alright, because Nemo went on to score the biggest opening weekend of any animated film! And in the end, that's what it's all about, right?",

30 May 2003,The Moose Hole - Review of Finding Nemo,"You can always count on a Pixar film to create loads of family fun as parents and children alike take some time off their busy schedules to enjoy another one of their features. They sure have a great record for it. They began with the surprise hit Toy Story, which started the long-standing trend of computer animated films. They followed with A Bug's Life in 1998, Toy Story 2 in 1999 and Monsters Inc. in 2001. Pixar outperforms each of their previous efforts which is very rare in the modern Hollywood scene. Now, after taking a year off, they take audiences to the ocean in Finding Nemo. But how well will the film do? This is the first time a Pixar film has been placed during the summer time (all previous efforts had been released in November) but this allows for more success with children finishing school. Another problem for the film is lack of voice talent. Monsters Inc. had the advantage of John Goodman and Billy Crystal in the leading roles but the voices for this film are less known. This doesn't matter to children but it can be for some adults. The question is whether Finding Nemo can continue Pixar's trend of success or will be the film be sunk by the competition?

The story goes that Marlin, an orange and white striped clownfish, lives with his son Nemo, who has a ""lucky"" fin that is smaller then his other fin, in the ocean near Australia. Marlin is very cautious after the death of his wife and fears for the safety of his son. He fears so much that follows his son on a field-trip on his first day of school. Nemo, who seems embarrassed by his father's over-protective behavior, swims to a boat as dare to prove that he is not like his father. But this courage gets him in trouble as he is captured by a scuba-diver and taken away to a dentist's office in Australia. Marlin goes on a rapid search for his only son and along the way he meets a variety of colorful characters. Among those are Dory, a blue fish with short-term memory loss, Bruce, a shark who forms a club for vegetarian sharks, and Crush, a surfer talking turtle. Marlin will go to any length to find his son and bring him home even if it means facing his own fears head on. Like all previous films, Finding Nemo's story is far superior to most animated films though, it can be said, it is not totally perfect. Much like A Bug's Life, which was also directed by Andre Stanton, the story tends to drag a bit in parts making it less consistent then Toy Story or Monsters Inc.

As previously stated, the voice cast for Finding Nemo is less well-known then most Pixar films, which gives it another similarity toward A Bug's Life. Albert Brooks gives a perfect timid voice to the character Marlin. Brooks, who is also appearing in the In-Laws currently, deserves more attention for his role in this film then he is currently getting. He presents sarcastic humor at the right time with this characters as well as emotion which makes you feel for him as he struggles to find his son. Ellen DeGeneres is absolutely delightful as the forgetful Dory. The funniest moments in the film come from her characters especially the hilarious scene where she tries to speak whale. Some of the most thought provoking moments come from her character as well, which is ironic coming from a fish with short-term memory loss. William Dafoe is wonderfully cast as Gill, who tries to help Nemo escape from the dentist's office fish-tank. Geoffrey Rush, who stars in Pirates of the Caribbean later this summer, is humorous as the pelican but most of his most funny scenes had been seen in the trailers. And Pixar regular, John Ratzenburg, is great as the school of fish that poke fun at Marlin and teach him to lighten up.

Overall, Finding Nemo is another great film from the folks at Pixar but not their best work. The visuals are the best that have ever been seen in an animated film, that is for sure, but the story is not as hilarious as Monsters Inc. was. The story also tends to drag a bit in parts which makes it quite inconsistent. Finding Nemo also seemed to have a lot more intense scenes then most films aimed toward children, which is better for the older crowd but is sure to frighten some children. But the spectacular visuals, the delightful characters and those Pixar tributes to famous films make this a must-see anyway. The best family film to date and looks to be for quite some time.

13 September 2011,The Best Movie Ever Produced,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",
27 April 2010,Magical and beautiful. One of Pixar's best works.,"It's not necessarily one of Pixar's most funny films, that title certainly goes to Toy Story 2. Yet I think that Finding Nemo has to be one of their most magical. One thing that Pixar does brilliantly apart from the script and the characters is to create new worlds. Toy Story creates a world in which toys come to life. A Bug's Life creates a world in which bugs run a society similar to that of our own, Finding Nemo creates a world in which sea-life interact similarly to humans- a remarkable feat that they pull off extremely well. It's an adventure story in which a dedicated father sets out to find his only relation. the character development is remarkable for a children's film- Pixar never underestimates their audience. The result is a beautifully created, wonderfully written piece, that maybe goes on a bit longer than it needs to, but it is funny in places and certainly will keep kids and adults interested.

4 June 2003,Pretty good,"FINDING NEMO is better than A BUG'S LIFE, but not as good as the TOY STORY movies or MONSTERS, INC. The animation was beautiful and the voice acting was great (especially Albert Brooks). It also had a cute story with something positive to say. I would have liked it as much as the TOY STORY movies if there were more laughs in it. I only laughed out loud once or twice. That PSYCHO girl with the braces was funny.

My Grade:

9 out of 10

P.S. Before the movie begins, they play one of Pixar's shorts from the late 1980s called ""KNICK KNACK."" I saw ""KNICK KNACK"" in its original form before and was sort of angry that Disney censored it this time around. There were two things missing from the beautiful women the snowman is attracted to and it doesn't take much of an imagination to know what those two things are.",9

17 June 2003,Another Pixar triumph!,"This might be my most anticipated new film in ages. After being mightily impressed by Monsters Inc both as a technical exercise and as a piece of outstanding storytelling, I realized that Pixar is on a major roll, and has yet to produce a dud.

In fact, ALL of Pixar's films have raised the bar both in computer animation AND in family movies.

While FINDING NEMO doesn't quite reach the heights that MONSTERS INC. did, it's still a very impressive and entertaining film in its own right, and certainly meets the calibre of Pixar's other movies.

Let's get the one weakness out of the way; after creating a story with a very convincing central relationship in Monsters Inc between Sully and ""Boo"", the characters in FN aren't quite as well-drawn. Not that they're bad, and not that there aren't some great moments, but I don't think we get to care about these guys quite as much as the denizens of Monstropolis.

As for the strengths, they're here in abundance. The first is the dazzling animation. Set almost entirely in the ocean, FN displays incredibly real creatures, backdrops, and aquatic textures. It's lovely, and very easy to ""immerse"" one's self in (pardon the pun). There are also the typical fantastic Pixar characters like Bruce the shark and Gil.

Everything Pixar has done has been an ""instant classic"", to march out that hoary old cliche. The reason they've been able to achieve this so consistantly is because they've never lost sight of how important STORY is; the technology has always existed in Pixar films to support the story, and never the other way around. FINDING NEMO is no exception.",9
1 March 2007,A Masterpiece,"Finding Nemo is a work of art among movies, perhaps in the truest sense of the word. I'm certain that the first time I watched this film my mouth was gaping open the entire time--so in awe was I from the first frame. The art of feature-length animation that Pixar began with Toy Story has now been perfected. Every scene is crammed with breathtaking beauty, and so much eye candy that I see something new every time I watch the film.

But all of this is (spectacular) window dressing for the spectacular story. Not only is the film consistently hilarious, but all the gags merely support a story that is, at its core, deeply moving and heartfelt. And that is what ultimately makes the film such a satisfying experience.

My initial temptation is to state that this film has, indeed, supplanted The Lion King as the greatest animated film of all time. But I think I prefer to think of them, in a sense, as companion pieces. Both films deal, in different ways, with the special bonds between father and son. The Lion King--forever holding a special place in the annals of animation--is still lord of traditional, hand-drawn animation. And Finding Nemo sets a gold standard for computer animation that I can't ever see being beaten any time in the near future.",10

15 January 2006,"""Fish are friends, not food!""","I had heard of this movie over a number of times, but I never got to see it. And finally, last year I did. The film had spectacular graphics of the under water world and the water looked very inviting (in the Austalian Reef). And it had laughs from beginning to end!There were some interesting things I learned from the film: Clown Fishs' instincts and how many eggs they can lay. And of course, what goes on in a fish's mind.

Anyways, the film was about two Clown fish named Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) and Marlin (Albert Brooks). And one day, Coral was attacked by a barracuda and Marlin found one of his eggs a little wounded. And when the egg turned into a fish, it had a pectoral fin that was bigger than the other. Marlin named him Nemo (Alexander Gould).

One day, Nemo was abducted on a field trip by a dentist (Bull Hunter). The dentist thought Nemo needed a safe place to stay. Man! That abduction scene's suspense KILLED me! Marlin went around looking for help in order to find Nemo and he bumped into a fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). Fortunately, Dory suffered from a short term memory loss and she and Marlin went around in circles.

Later, they bumped into an intimidating Great White shark named Bruce (Barry Humphries), a Hammerhead named Anchor (Eric Bana) and a Raggedtooth or a blue shark named Chum (Bruce Spence. They always had meetings about fish are friends, not food. CUTE! They have a little sensitivity. HA!HA!HA! And when Dory and Marlin tried to escape, Bruce and his companions went after them and Bruce got a bomb stuck in his mouth , spat it out, and he and his companions ran! That explosion scene was great. And it was funny when two pelican's were sitting on the water and a bubble came up from behind one of them and the other said ""nice"" and flew away.

Nemo woke up in a tank in the Dentist's room in Sydney. And he made friends with the following in the tank: Peach, a starfish (Allison Janney), Gill, a triangular fish (Willem Dafoe), Bubbles, another triangular fish (Stephen Root), Deb, another triangular fish (Vicki Lewis), Gurgle, a colorful fish (Austin Pendleton)and a Jacques, a shrimp (Joe Ranft).

Back in the ocean, Dory and Marlin bumped into a beautiful light that belonged to a VICIOUS Angler fish! WHOA! And back in the tank, Nemo was known as ""Shark Bate"". Everyone in the tank were planning to escape and Nemo too. And back in the ocean, it was amazing how those Sardines indicated to Marlin and Dory to where Nemo was taken. And amazing to see Dory and Marlin swim through that school of Jelly fish.

When Nemo was told to bust the generator of the tank. My heart pumped when Nemo nearly went into the fan! And again, back in the sea; there was an awesome scene with Dory and Marlin surfing with a turtle who was 150 years old named Crush (Andrew Stanton) with all the other turtles through the Austalian Current. And it was So magnificent to see the baby turtle Squirt (Nicholas Bird) surf! A pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) told Nemo that his father had been looking for him. And back in the water, Dory and Marlin were trapped in a whales body. Awesome GRAPHICS! And they were spat out from the whale's spout.

And finally, Dory and Marlin got the surface and they were carted off by Nigel off to the Dentist's room. It was hysterically funny when those seagulls went after Nigel saying: ""Mine!Mine!Mine!"" And their beaks went through a sail of a yacht and they were still saying it! Now I knew where my Big Brother Chris Isherwood picked that phrase up from.

And back in the Dentist's room, the Dentsit's child Darla (LuLu Ebiling)(also known as ""The Fish Killer"". You should've seen how terrible Darla was to Nemo when he was playing dead. And finally, Nemo escaped through the sewage pipe and back into the ocean. And when Dory bumped into Nemo and he introduced himself to her. Dory forgot everything and said: ""Oh! That's a nice name"". And SUDDENLY, Dory got caught up in a net, Nemo told all the other fish who were stranded in it to keep swimming and so did Marlin say it. And everyone broke out and were FREE to go.

In the end, everything went back to normal... and the fish from the Dentist's room escaped. Another fishtastic film with fishtastic surprises!!!",10

7 August 2004,"A perfect comedy, well-timed, well-written, and a magnificent feast for the eyes.","'Finding Nemo' is a Pixar film that upholds the studio's great tradition: terrorizing the rest of the industry with the quality of their films, leaving others at a loss as to how they can compete. The story is simple and straightforward: an overprotective father clownfish traverses the ocean that petrifies him in search of his son, who has been relocated to a seaside dentist's office by divers and kept in an aquarium. The film may not have succeeded so blatantly as it did if Nemo hadn't been landed amongst a plethora of comical roommates, while Marlin's pleasantly forgetful companion, Dory, miraculously manages to be funnier than any of them.

'Nemo' abounds with characters as colorful as the reef itself, brilliantly realized. The simplicity of the story is countered by the obstacles Marlin faces, from deep-sea anglerfish that gives little kids the heebie-jeebies to titanic but likable sharks, trying to defeat their 'addiction' to seafood. The visual effects are spectacular. Never has water, lighting, color, texture, and photorealism been so convincing, let alone all these milestones being achieved in the 95-minute running time of a single picture. 'Finding Nemo' is truly special in this, and although Pixar's self-produced Marionette software has already won an Academy Award, I think it should win again, as the AMPAS can't possibly have foreseen the heights it would reach. Long live Pixar! (10/10)",10

26 August 2007,Very nice...,"When animations started to get popular in early times, Finding Nemo made remarkable splash with its' interesting subject. Fishes are known as creatures whose memories aren't capable to remember facts that has happened 2-3 seconds ago. So a man tends to forget most things, he is asked to ""are you fish memoried?"". The film based on that idea provide people to live amusing moments while watching it. Also the idea ""Wolves grab the sheeps who leave the herd"" is taught for especially children who watch it.

The adventure of a small clown-fish sometimes make people laugh and s.t. think. The details are also very interesting and worthy to think about it.

Lastly, it deserve eight points due to its' interesting and easy to remember story.

10 June 2022,"One of the best animated films, content is suitable for children too","The film has many bubbly characters and is set upon a simple premise. The amazing animation takes us on an adventurous journey through the ocean in this quest.

I do not think I'm an expert in judging content for children, yet I feel this film might as well be mostly aimed at kids. Given the relatively child-like portrayals of dangerous sea monsters, I am inclined to consider this more of a wholesome entertainer than an epic saga/drama

Overall, the film has a mix of unique characters, a good screenplay to keep us engaged and the voice performances enough to carry the narrative adequately. This is a good watch for comedy/animation lovers.

20 March 2005,My Favorite Animated Film,"An intelligent, humorous, and visually gorgeous film. Some may criticize it's soft center, but I find it refreshingly warm in all respects. Some kids movies are syrup flavored saccharine drops, that can make a more mature viewer choke. But here in Nemo is a gently, loving and observant film that can speak both to a child and an adult. This film gives me a warm fuzzy feeling whenever I think of it. In my opinion it's better than the Incredibles. The characters are better developed and more likable, and the storyline is more cohesive and accessible to children, while not boring adults. There is also a lack of bitter sarcasm and meanness that sometimes rear their ugly heads even in children's films. What makes this movie so great to me is the fact that i believe it to really be not a children's film, but a film for adults that happens to be wonderfully appropriate for children. It doesn't try to talk down to kids and teach them some silly lesson about sharing and caring etc... but simply exists as loving entertainment.

15 October 2003,Let's go swimming!,"Rating: **** (out of *****)

If Pixar can continue to deliver the goods like they have done once more, with Finding Nemo, then we can be assured that the future of computer animation is in safe hands.

Finding Nemo arrives here following massive success stateside, yet its success has, quite possibly, led to nit picking among some. Certain journalists (Toy Story purists, no doubt) have called it such things as ""formulaic"" and ""strictly for kids"". Well, would you call Pixar as original if they approached all their films' storylines in the same way as Toy Story's?

True, it is admittedly hard to expect anything to astound you as much as the film that signalled their arrival in the world of full-length animated motion pictures. But this film sits quite nicely among their other efforts. I'd put it on pretty much the same level as Monsters, Inc. and just ahead of Toy Story 2.

Finding Nemo is more of a straightforward adventure tale than any other Pixar film (the title character's name could be a nod to Captain Nemo, of 20,000 Leagues under the Sea). Our setting is the Pacific Ocean, where Nemo, a young clown fish (voiced by Alexander Gould), is captured by some scuba divers. His father, Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) immediately begins searching for his son, but finding him will take much longer than he thought, as Nemo has ended up in the fish tank of an Australian dentist.

Along the way, Marlin hooks up (no pun intended) with a forgetful tang named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), and they both proceed to meet all kinds of colourful and interesting characters, including three sharks (one of whom is voiced by Barry Humphries) and a surfer turtle (voiced by the film's co-writer/director, Andrew Stanton). All the while, the other fish in the tank (including a butterfly fish named Gill, voiced by Willem Dafoe) are trying to help Nemo get out. From looking at the animation, I could see that Pixar have made some truly innovative strides forward with each of their films, at least on the technical side. Their typical `trademarks' are visible here, such as the main characters' wide eyes and the obviously artificial humans (the makers are obviously aware of how out of place Final Fantasy-style techniques would look here). But everything on view is smoother, more colourful, and significantly more detailed than any of their previous major efforts. This makes Finding Nemo more pleasing to the eye than Pixar's other films.

The film's generally linear storyline prevents it from scaling (again, no pun intended) the heights of the original Toy Story. There aren't too many real surprises as such. But by no means have Pixar gone soft in the story department, despite what some believe. In fact, I could argue that this is probably the most consistently funny script they have come up with. It's not short on background gags either, examples being some product placement satire and a possible reference to Monty Python. You'll even find some nods to Pixar's past efforts (some more subtle than others  I'll let you look for them).

Pixar have always struck gold on their vocal pairings for their leads (Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, John Goodman & Billy Crystal...) and they've found another fine pairing in Albert Brooks & Ellen DeGeneres. Both are natural comedians, and they help to make the film as clever and funny as it is. Even if DeGeneres sometimes becomes irritating, I think that's intentional. Listening to them and to all the other characters, we can see that Pixar are almost as good as casting their voices as animating their films.

Anyway, I have said enough. Go and see Finding Nemo. You will not regret it. (And you'll get to see a wonderfully inventive short film from Pixar's past beforehand...)",
9 November 2018,Pretty good,"I used to find this movie boring as a kid - but as I said in my review of Toy Story, that's because as a kid I had an unusually low bar for boredom.

Nemo is a young clownfish who lost his mother at a young age - and as a result his father, Marlin, is overprotective. Nemo feels rebellious, and tries to disobey and defy his father. The result: he's caught by a Sydney dentist! Marlin - who's afraid of the ocean - must try to find and save his son. On the way, he meets a forgetful blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who helps him and becomes a major character (and got her own sequel).

Good story, great animation, and good voice cast. A winner.

4 December 2005,This is not a movie...IS A MI-RA-CLE!!!!,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",10
26 November 2009,good and bad at same time,"The movie is both good and horrible at same time.

The Good: It has a lot of absolutely hilarious moments and scenes. Many of them of those involve ""Dory"" character, which also has excellent voice acting. There are a lot of places where you will laugh (well, unless you have absolutely no sense of humor).

The Bad: The parts that aren't funny are extremely weak. Plot and characters involve a lot of clichés, characters have nearly no personality (perhaps with exception of ""Dory"" fish), they don't really develop much. All scenes that are supposed to bring any emotional impact(or to be tragic) simply doesn't work and feel unnatural, often they feel ""out of place"". I had to skip certain moments because they were extremely boring to me and I felt like I saw something similar before.

Summary: There is only one truly memorable and interesting character in this movie: the ""Dory"" fish. ""Dory"" certainly looks better than both ""protagonists"" (father and son), mostly because of excellent voice acting. Besides ""Dory"" it is hard to miss certain little girl (because of music theme and associated funny scene) that appears on screen for a short time. There are many funny moments, but outside of them movie offer very little. Overall it is much weaker than ""Up""/""Wall-E"" (which were released several years later) and may be on par with Ratatoille. Graphically movie isn't bad, but isn't impressive either, and I could swear I saw texture filtration artifacts or poor bump-mapping work in two places, although I'm not completely sure about it. Animation is perfect as always, but it doesn't save you from weak parts in the story.

So if you want few laughs and don't mind mediocre story - this is for you. If you want ""deep"" story, you can skip this movie.",5

25 October 2003,ocean epic,"pixar have so far produced a quite astounding streak of great movies. since toy story through to finding nemo, they have not made a fluff piece of cinema yet. and finding nemo only builds on their previous efforts. the animation here is awe inspiring. it's layered and brilliantly colourful. the visuals alone can keep you entertained for the duration. but thankfully there is even more depth do it. the story and narrative are equally as astounding. a simple yarn thrown into the deep of the sea, it tells the story of a father fish trying to find his child fish. thats it. yet it's more exciting and intelligent than 90% of movies released monthly. with finely tuned comedic performances from the voices, and a general knowing in what pushes are emotional buttons, nemo never dulls from start to finish. it's hilarious, moving, intense, wonderous and clever and i dare say that adults would probably enjoy it more than the toddlers they brought to the film. a wise choice for this picture was changing the composer of the score. moving to thomas newman, of american beauty and road to perdition fame, the score touches all the right notes, and never goes cheesy like ole randy newman used to do. i really hope thomas will score future pixar movies.

a delight, difficult to top. but pixar have never dissapointed us yet.",10
30 August 2003,Fin-esse,"FN is a beautiful, touching and highly amusing story that will be enjoyed by millions for decades to come. It's really too different to Toy Story 2 to make a fair apples 4 apples comp, but since TS2 is the benchmark here, I'll give it a go anyway.

FN is better looking. The detail is immense in every scene, and I suspect this alone has generated alot of second viewings from those (like myself) who want to make sure we didnt miss anything first time around.

TS2 is funnier - or rather has a sharper ' more adult' sense of humour. FN has some laugh out loud moments, the seagulls in particular I thought were positively Aardman-esque. But since the main Father/ son characters are actually not very funny at all - TS2 with Woody and Buzz just can't be beat. Plus some of the gags in FN seemed a bit rushed to me, and I sometimes felt I'd missed out on them.

Voice-wise - call it a draw. Special mention to Barry Humphries as a Vegetarian Shark. Perfect, possums.

Story. Hmmmmm this is where the apples for apples thing gets much harder. Everything in TS1 and 2 was under-pinned by the constant fear of discovery by adults. It gave extra dramatic zest to every scene. FN doesn't have the same backdrop - where action centres more often than not around avoiding being eaten. This is often fun and exciting, but lacks the X factor of TS IMHO, and when the action stops, there's nothing there lurking in the background to keep the whole thing sizzling along. This being said, I think that FN had a few nice messages for the younger and adult audience, and got them over without being the usual Disney blunt instrument. Although the story was very linear - the relief of the Dentist's fish tank worked nicely.

Overall - TS2 still the benchmark for this kind of movie - but FN is still an extremely attractive fun addition to the repertoire. You will want to see it again I suspect on the big screen - if nothing else then for the sheer inventive detail of the Ocean environment.

Looking forwards already to the next one in the pixar pipeline.....",8
3 January 2005,Worst Animated Movie of All Time,"This was by far the most boring, lame, and utterly nauseating of all the cartoons I have ever seen. More proof that Pixar has nothing on Dreamworks (With the exception of ""The Incredibles, that was a great cartoon). I only saw this because I missed the showing for Underworld. What a big mistake, I should have saved my money. I was bored stiff as I watched a bunch of unfunny fish swim around mindlessly. What made this pitiful excuse for a movie worse was the multitudes of toddlers and sad girls who paraded around praising this movie. If you want to honestly want to watch a film intended for people under the age of fetus, then this is the movie for you.

5 November 2003,Eye Candy for morons,"Graphics/animation top notch - as one would expect from Pixar. Story and characters puerile, saccharine and thus nauseating - in the post-modern Disneyesque tradition.

That it has reached the IMDB top 250 is inexplicable, and is perhaps as much a reflection on the moronic followers of cuteseyness as it is of those who rate state-of-the-art animation. Great for kids under 12 I suppose.

Otherwise, pass me the sick bag.

11 August 2003,stream of color & lights,"One of the best animation I've seen in a long time. I wouldn't call it a classic but nevertheless was such a delight. Colors, lights, movements, graphics, story, everything. In order to get the best experience one should see it on the theaters otherwise you gonna miss maybe half of the entertainment.

Being separated from each other father fish (Marlin) and son fish (Nemo) are trying to reunite. Marlin finds Dory-to me the most memorable an adorable character with Ellen DeGeneres' voice-and the rest is just train of different adventures with a lot of action (probably too much for a Disney film) and funny jokes (probably not enough for a Disney film).

I would say that is a bit overrated but it's a nice animation after all-good for all ages. Recommended. 7.3 out of 10 stars

29 June 2006,FilmCreature Reviews 'Finding Nemo',"I don't know anyone who didn't enjoy this film to the fullest extent. It was the best film I saw that year. I'm happy to say what many, many critics have said: Pixar's done it again. All of their films have been delightfully imaginative and funny. This is their best film yet. On rottentomatoes.com, 100% of the top critics gave thumbs-up to this movie! 100%! That's Richard Roeper, Roger Ebert, David Ansen... and so on. You WILL love this film. It's so charming and lovable, and the computer graphics of the ocean are stunning and beautiful, your eyes are glued to the screen.

I thought the best voice of the incredibly talented cast was definitely Ellen DeGeneres. DeGeneres voices her perfectly, with lots of humor, wit, and and a pinch of needed stupidity (not Ellen, Dory) for the voice.

This is a gorgeous, enormously enjoyable movie.

As Ebert would say, Thumbs Way Up!!!

10 June 2023,An Endearing and Enchanting Underwater Adventure,"Finding Nemo is a heart-warming and visually stunning animated film that captures the essence of family, friendship, and perseverance. Released in 2003 and directed by Andrew Stanton, this Pixar classic takes audiences on an unforgettable underwater journey filled with captivating characters and emotional depth.

One of the standout elements of Finding Nemo is its impeccable storytelling. The narrative is tightly woven, expertly balancing humour, adventure, and heartfelt moments. The journey to rescue Nemo is filled with obstacles, surprises, and life lessons, leading to personal growth and profound realizations for both Marlin and Dory. The film explores themes of love, loss, letting go, and the strength of familial bonds.

The characters in Finding Nemo are endearing and well-developed. Marlin is a relatable protagonist whose protective instincts and fears make him both sympathetic and relatable. Dory's infectious optimism and unwavering loyalty provide a perfect contrast to Marlin's cautious nature, and her character becomes the emotional anchor of the story. The film also features a host of supporting characters, such as the wise sea turtle named Crush, the surfer-dude seagulls, and the gruff but lovable sharks, all of whom contribute to the film's charm.

Visually, Finding Nemo is a breath-taking masterpiece. The animation is exquisitely detailed, with vibrant colours and mesmerizing underwater landscapes. The attention to detail in recreating the oceanic world is remarkable, from the fluid movements of the fish to the shimmering light filtering through the water. The film takes full advantage of the animation medium, creating a visually immersive experience that transports the audience into the depths of the ocean.

The emotional depth of Finding Nemo is what truly sets it apart. While it is an entertaining and family-friendly film, it doesn't shy away from exploring complex emotions. The story deals with themes of fear, loss, and resilience, teaching valuable lessons about embracing one's individuality and finding strength in adversity. The emotional moments are expertly crafted, tugging at the heartstrings without ever feeling manipulative.

The film's score, composed by Thomas Newman, perfectly complements the story, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene. The music ranges from whimsical and light-hearted melodies to soaring and poignant compositions, accentuating the film's emotional beats and adding depth to the storytelling.

The only minor critique one could have is that some of the comedic moments may not resonate as strongly with adult audiences compared to younger viewers. However, the humour is still cleverly executed and contributes to the overall enjoyment of the film.

In conclusion, Finding Nemo is a delightful and emotionally resonant animated film that captivates audiences of all ages. With its engaging storytelling, lovable characters, breath-taking animation, and heartfelt themes, it's no wonder this film has become a beloved classic. It reminds us of the power of love, the importance of embracing our fears, and the beauty of the underwater world. If you're looking for a film that will make you laugh, cry, and leave you with a sense of wonder, Finding Nemo is an absolute must-watch.",9
9 June 2003,A kids movie,"I am in my mid-thirties and have always enjoyed the Pixar movies. Can't say i didn't like this movie but I was expecting more. I thought Ice Age for example did a better job of entertaining adults. Had more humor and was better executed for adults - and also satisfied children. Both movies also were out of this would visually.

As for Nemo, Visually A+. And I did think it had it's touching moments.

I didn't find Dory all that funny. Okay she has short term memory loss. Didn't amuse me.

After leaving the theater I recalled how my mom wanted my dad to take her to see this movie. My wife and I thought would he enjoy it. And I thought no, I don't think he would. It was too much of a kids movie. And don't get me wrong it was supposed to be. I just wanted to offer a different perspective of this movie. It is not flawless. It's not for everyone as reviews seem to indicate.

Actually I enjoyed listening to all the little kids reacting to the movie. My daughter is too young for this one yet - a baby. One thing I was thinking was that this movie might be a little too scary for some of these kids. I would say there were at least 6 times when 'the fish' almost died. There where some scary predators - including humans. After all these are little fish - little fish make good food for big fish. Which would be fine but the predators were also very scary looking. Geez, when I was a kid the Wicked Witch in Wizard of Oz scared me, that is nothing compared to the creatures in this movie.

Also, when watching this movie I could already see a sequel. I would bet that Dolphins have a very big role in the second one since they were almost ignored here.",6
31 May 2003,"Wonderful, wonderful movie!!","I walked into this movie expecting a lot and it came through big time! I loved the distinct personalities given to each of the animals, the sharks with Australian accents, the lobsters using New England jargon, the ""surfing"" turtles using California surfer lingo. Caricatures, to be sure, but very funny ones.

You really cared about Nemo and the relationship with his Dad (everyone can relate to a little boy and his Dad trying to find each other). Definitely one to get on DVD (you have to watch it several times to get all of the inside jokes, which I'm sure I missed a lot of!)

Go see it with someone you love and have a great time!

17 March 2004,standard,"this one really doesn't deserve the raves it got. yeah its fun and its cute, the animation is amazing, but it just wasnt that spectacular. the plot was straight forward the characters were cute, and with the exception of one or two, werent very memorable, and the jokes were not very memorable.

in comparison to pixar's previous film, monsters inc, this one couldve been spat out by disney during the 80s. yeah its fun, and it cant be faulted for that, but as of writing, it is number 83 on the top 200, and fun and cute should never be mistaken for classic, inovative, stunning cinema.

20 November 2003,Another brilliant Pixar movie,"This has got to be one of the most beautifully made animations ever made. The ocean setting is stunning, the characters wonderful. What I love about Pixar is that despite the amazing graphics, they really care more about the characters and having a strong storyline. Cos of course if they didn't have these two important factors, then their wonderful films wouldn't be as fab as they are.

Finding Nemo is another hit. Funny, moving and exciting, with excellent performances from the cast. 10/10

28 July 2003,Pixar does it again!,"Finding Nemo, like its Pixar generated predecessors, is a joy to watch from start to finish. Full of breath taking underwater vistas, only the talking fish clue you in to the fact that this is not a nature documentary.

The writing is superb. The story is engaging and the humor is of the rare variety that can entertain both adults and children without insulting either group's intelligence. Pixar proves, without resorting to gratuitous depictions of sex and violence (like much of Japanese anime), that cartoons are not just for children. Ellen DeGeneres steals the show as Dory - a fish afflicted with short-term memory loss. While generally a humorous character, her moments of drama are truly heart-breaking. Her performance is Oscar-worthy. Five out of five stars.

11 August 2004,"okay, everybody calm down","After a good year has passed (well, it wasn't really a good year in my life, nor was it a good year in the cinema, but it was undoubtedly a long year, allow us all to the calm down. Finding Nemo is a children's movie. It is not an achingly poetic masterwork of biblical proportions. For all its polished aesthetic splendor, it is one of many recent Pixar cuddle-tear smorgasboards that have smack of the Pixar ""formula."" This is, of course, more multifaceted than you might hope. First, and foremost there is the element of the micro society where one least expects it: the anthropomorphic personification in various aspects of the animal kingdom or underwater or inanimate objects like toys, insects pretty much anything that looks cute. Pixar, which has modeled itself on Disney (for starters...in that, it is trying and succeeding to be the 2nd successful animation studio in the history of the cinema) is taking a page from Herr Walt, but not just simply by making animals...talk. There is the now mandatory wacky assortment of characters in whatever new environment our cutesy little poopy poof protagonist enters: usually an inexplicably dumb character, a hardened, raspy-voiced pessimist who has the seen the outside and yearns for a taste of liberation, a simple character driven mad by the plasticized existence of the microcosm they are confined to, the optimist, completely spiritually and intellectually fulfilled with appeasing the idiotic requests of the master, or overlord or Orwellian gumbent-a-clef, easing into a life of quiet desperation, finding simple pleasures in the banal daily regimen and the emigrant, caught in the middle. Perhaps these scenarios which Pixar seems to be ejaculating in majestic, new colors every few years are truly subversive and anti-American with their One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestesque allegories...or maybe they're just smoking PCP. Still, they're a whole lot better than the CGA DreamWorks is churning out. Don't believe me? Compare the Incredibles (which is going to rock ass even if it sucks because look at Sam Jackson's character, man is HE black!) to Shrek 2. Shrek 2 sucked. For more on Shrek 2, see Shrek 2. Eddie Murphy needs to quit. C",10
26 April 2020,Family and I,"After adulthood, the relationship with my parents is getting weaker and weaker. I have tried my best to fight for myself to live out. I don't think it's a big deal to be far away from my family. The pleasure of freedom diminishes the inner thoughts and attachments. But at the moment when I was in tears, I knew that I still deeply cherish such a warm embrace, still yearning for such a persistent guardian, or jealous of such simple pampering; and I also believe their love for me It 's not inferior to Marin. If one day I 'm going to be lost, they will be looking for salvation so hard. The growing child is like a wanderer walking out of the house, and the parents stand in front of the window and look at our whereabouts. The days have been long and the conflict has been over, and the window is covered with dust. We all forgot to reach out and wipe away the thick dust on the layer of glass, so that we can't see each other's hearts and sorrows more and more, unable to share sorrow and joy, standing in vain, looking at each other in vain Those days of close interdependence.

5 December 2003,Pixar Has Found Excellence,"Really, ""Finding Nemo"" needs no introduction. But, what the heck, I'll give it one anyway. Working at a daycare this summer, I heard about ""Finding Nemo."" And those of you who work in child care know that's an understatement. ""Finding Nemo"" was pretty much everything I heard about and everything I saw. I saw kid's meal toys, clothing, pillowcases, and just about every piece of ""Finding Nemo"" memorabilia in existence. When I had trouble starting a deep {cough} conversation with a little kid, I would introduce myself with a statement like, 'So...have you seen ""Finding Nemo""?' But really at this point I had no idea how good the movie was or what it was about really. Needless to say though, I get a bit skeptical about movies when just about every child in the nation has seen them.

Yet, when I saw ""Finding Nemo,"" I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, I really don't need to say this, but the animation was awesome and visually stimulating. The voice acting was also top notch. And, of course, Randy Newman's score matched the movie perfectly. The story, although unrealistic (but how can it be realistic - talking fish?), is also very well-written and even has some (gasp) character development. And, since I have a little kid's sense of humor, I found the movie hilarious. I hardly went one minute in the whole movie without laughing. I only have one complaint: the opening scene seems a little off-balance. I know, I know. It sets the stage for the rest of the movie and helps you get into what's going on. But something's still missing from it, even if I can't put a finger on it.

Besides one tiny flaw, though, this movie is a masterpiece, kid's movie or not. Skeptics out there, I have a suggestion for you: Give ""Finding Nemo"" a chance.

Final Grade: A.",8
12 August 2019,Before Watching: Finding Nemo (2003),"""Finding Nemo"" (2003) is a fine animation classic for the whole family. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:

There is not too much that needs to be pre-known about Finding Nemo. At the surface, it serves a captivating story that has the power to spellbind its younger audience. A few scenes might be unsettling, those include the opening, Nemo's attempts in the aquarium, and in the introduction of the character Darla.

This movie isn't just for youngsters, however. Older viewers are in for a delight as well, as there are a lot of references and great underlying themes as Pixar usually provides. Be sure to be open for the mature side and enjoy its rich content.

My personal grade: a floating 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",7

28 August 2006,"Ah, c'est magnifique!","This movie was totally amazing. I don't know why I put the headline in french. Well, whatever. This movie was totally memorable and always will be. It's funny, and has a fantastic plot. It's character's were great and Dory was the main star of the laughs.This has the whole package of a key Disney movie,laughs,drama,adventure,imagination,wonder,and originality. This movie is definitely one of my favorites and always will be.

I give this movie 10/10 because I love it and I always will. There is nothing in it that is inappropriate for small children. Everything is suitable for all audiences.

I saw it when I was 8 in theaters with my friend Katherine and her mom. We all loved it. It was powerful and totally hilarious!

3 March 2004,good...,"For an animation. I usually don't care for these types of films because they only go so far before I lose interest. This film was an exception. Pixar did a great job of keeping me interested. They had a very good cast, especially Albert Brooks and Brad Garrett. Hopefully Pixar will continue producing better movies as time goes by. It would be nice to see another animation like this one come out. Now that Pixar has left Disney, maybe they will have even more control over what they will do next. Anybody interested in Finding Nemo 2? If they have the right type of story, it would be fun to see a sequel of this made. Assuming, of course, they use the same cast again.

12 January 2005,Really?,"When given a poll between watching Shrek 2 or Finding Nemo, I decided to choose Finding Nemo after being told of its high-quality laughs and worthy entertainment value. I'm not a big fan of Shrek 2 but *sigh* this was a bad choice.

What many people consider to be witty and original is what I see as imports from early Chaplin films and episodes of the Simpsons. Finding Nemo is the story of the eponymous fish, Nemo. Nemo is the only survivor of his batch after his brothers and sisters (along with his Mother) were eaten by sharks in the egg stage. However Nemo survived (albeit deformed) along with a paranoid Father.

The jokes seem tired and lack any moments of stomach-rumbling chuckling but rather a series of humoured snorts. Although the main character of Nemo is likable, the other two major characters are not. Ellen Degeneres' role as Dory is so irritating that you start hoping the diver comes back and batters Dory then at least somebody will get some use out of the poorly-designed character.

Although there are smart ideas it becomes jumbled up in overly-immature jokes that decrease the entertainment value. For example the sharks that are dedicated to soothing their blood lust is worth some giggles but it gets lost in the sea(pardon the pun) of poor remarks. I should have known that the immaturity and basicness of the jokes would never stop coming. I assumed there would be a 15 minute farting sequence later on.

When Nemo goes to school he breaks away from the pack and is captured by divers causing his Father and an oddball fish to venture after him. Now this seems to be an original plot filled with many creative avenues on which to expand but what turns out to potential ends up as excrement.",1
17 June 2003,loved it!,"what a delightful movie. the animation is very cool, unique and definitely original. i had been wanting to see this for a long time. disney sure can make excellent movies. i haven't seen a pixar movie i didn't like. i think this company is rising. i hope i will see more classics like this in years to come. they're always original, clever, and un-predictable. heck i'm 15 years old and i still would choose this movie over most of the cheesy teen flicks. pixar always manages to put in good comedy in their movies. i laughed a lot during this movie. pixar always manages to make a movie that entertains all audiences. well i've raved enough about pixar so i'll get straight to the point. finding nemo offers a joyful time. a fun and cute little flick. check it out. very adult friendly to. my parents got a kick out of it. me and my friend absolutely adored it and we're a group over 10! 10 stars out of 10.

No teenager's life will be fully complete without having watched this movie. Grab a bag of popcorn, grab your remote, and begin to endure the wonderful journey of beautiful little fishies in the ocean. Believe it or not, this movie has made me cry. And laugh. And sing. And dream. It's beautiful and the graphics are truly amazing. This movie makes me want to go to the beach and find Nemo so I can keep him for the rest of my life in my room and enjoy his pretty little colors. Watch this movie. Bye.

13 November 2010,One of the best from Pixar!,"I think what separates Pixar from any other animation studio is that all of the action, technical effects, and dialog serves to connect the audience with the characters. It is not just thrown in for the sake of itself. And therefore they make razor tight stories heart touching and effortless. Finding Nemo is the first absolute masterpiece from Pixar. While the other films have been excellent, this one set a new standard for them. The color palette in the ocean murkiness is fabulous and makes us feel a part of the world we are in. The characters are wonderful. Whether they are on for a moment or throughout the entire movie, you care for them. Yes, they kind of hit you over the head with a message here and there, but that in no way distracts from the enchantment and thrill of this movie. I should call it a fable, because it plays out that way. The basic overriding theme is getting father and son back together. And this is one story all ages can relate to. Who hasn't in their lifetime gotten ""lost"" for a brief moment from their parents? The theme resonates deep with us. The fact that it plays out with technical mastery, bedazzling scenes, flat out hilarious humor, and thrilling action is just icing on the cake. Pixar landed a good story and told it 100% right! A must see!

A Note: A couple of scenes are very scary for little little kids. Wait till they are maybe 5 or so before they see it.",10
21 June 2003,"Fish are friends, not food!","Finding Nemo is Pixar's best film yet! Funny, cute, and action-packed! Finding Nemo shows a story of how a clownfish father went through hell to find his son, Nemo. With the help of Dory, a fish with short-term memory loss, Marlin is in no worry! Well, that's not what he thinks. Finding Nemo was well-directed and is the best Pixar movie yet! So far my top five list for Pixar:

1) Toy Story 2/ 2) Toy Story 3) Finding Nemo 4) Monsters, Inc. 5) A Bug's Life

21 August 2003,"Dory, a fish ""with a heart of gold""","IMHO, Disney/Pixar has finally come up to the standard of film making of Japanese (especially Ghibli) animation which draws nothing but admiration from the viewer. Finding Nemo got them all: beautiful artwork that makes me feel like watching Spirited Away & Final Fantasy combined, and such a likable character with compassion, kindness, gentleness, and charity as in Kiki Delivery Service.

With that lovely character design alone, I would have like this movie so very much. But Pixar really raise the standards up this time. EXCELLENT JOB! I sure want to know if the Pixar people can say something they think they fail to achieve in Finding Nemo.

On initial watching, I couldn't help but to think with all constant action and excitement, the movie is trying to keep the young audience from getting bored. However, as the movie progress to its end, I realized how wrong I was. The constant action is a genuine part of what makes this movie purely enjoyable: 1.Instead of trying to imitate from Ghibli animation and probably come up with some superficial deep theme, it stays loyal to cinematic style of continuous excitement as in Monster Inc 2.It follows the initial plot hint; ""the ocean is not a safe place""

Having something beautiful thrown (or presented) at me, I started to compare movies. I noticed some potential inspirational scenes from Spirited Away (intro of theme with title shown, same closing scene etc)& other Ghibli films. Also came to think of how one is deeper than the other, although it has so much unfamiliar/weird ideas and so on. However, I finally got to a level of change of attitude. I stopped comparing and/or putting these profound work of art in ranks.

It's futile trying to put those works in ranks. They simply reach deep within, and such is a unique, wonderful, and heart warming experience; Finding Nemo, Majo no Takkyubin, Whisper of the Heart, Only Yesterday, Porco Rosso, Totoro, Spirited Away...the list grows",10
15 December 2003,this film is amazing,"This is a fantastic film no matter how old you are. The storyline is good and the graphics are amazing. I am a big fan of Disney and Pixar, but this film, compared to Toy Story and Shrek, is so much better. It's a great family film that will have you upset, excited but most of all it will have you laughing so much all the way through! The best character has got to be Dory because she is just hilarious!

23 June 2010,Good but no pixars best,"Now, this is what i call an adventure! This movie is fantastic. Animation was good and the voices. I love every time that psycho music goes on it made me laugh real hard. when you see this movie it makes your day stay happy. This movie is filled with sobs and laughs. It is a classic pixar. This movie is filled with exciting adventure. The adventure makes it enjoyable with Dori. She is the funniest character in this movie. I love when she loses her memory like every 5 minutes. This movie is good but not pixar's best. But i recommend this to the people who love Pixar. I'll give this movie a 8/10 Have fun with this movie!!! :)

4 October 2015,Visually stunning with an emotionally resonant story,"Twelve years after its release, Finding Nemo still holds up beautifully in terms of animation. The water effects and the way its variety of colourful marine creatures navigate its bright blue depths is beautiful to behold. Finding Nemo isn't just about style though. As expected with a Pixar entry, there's depth here too (and not just in terms of the ocean). Nemo teaches children about being resourceful and the strength of parental love; while surely holding resonance for parents or anyone in a close mentor role to someone young.

The voice cast is fantastic. Brooks and Gould give powerful, emotional performances while DeGeneres became a fan favourite with her humorous performance as forgetful blue tang Dory (expect a sequel focusing on Dory in 2016). As expected, there's some good jokes and fun performances in Nemo although it's not quite as sophisticated as other Pixar offerings like the Toy Story trilogy (1995, 1999, 2010), Monster's Inc. (2002) or The Incredibles (2004). Respectively, the story is fairly formulaic and the humour gears more towards a younger crowd. Nevertheless, Nemo makes up for its shortcomings with its emotionally resonant storytelling, stunning visuals and dedicated vocal performances.",8
2 June 2003,Ten of ten for this one!,"My daughter and I took my grandsons (2years old and his big brother 13 years old) to see this and it was super. It was a little scary for the 2year old but not unbearable. The story is family oriented and does flashes from where Nemo is to where his father is, which small children will not understand but I don't think they care. The animation was fantastic as Pixar and Disney would be expected to produce and the humor was side splitting in spots. The 12 step shark meetings were funny without insulting real 12 steppers and when Dorie speaks whale everyone laughs. I was a little uncomfortable with the Dentist office at first (who needs to scare kids of dental tools, but that was the only iffy spot I remember. I have to take a little friend to see this now and I can't wait it was that good a film.

31 May 2003,The Pixar streak continues,"Pixar manages to deliver another great film. 'Nemo' is about a father clown fish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) and his journey to find his son, Nemo. Who was taken by a local dentist and brought to live in his fish tank. With the help of Dorry (Ellen DeGeneres) a fish with short term memory, he scowers the ocean meeting all sorts of colorful, funny, and sometimes scary creatures. As well as risking his fins over many a danger. A father's love and the peril he'd go through to find his son, also letting an offspring grow up, is the movie's ultimate point. And it is a beautiful one. The movie also manages to appeal to adult and kid alike. The movie is funny with jokes the whole family can enjoy, and any parent can tell you that that is rare. Its even good for a group of teens or adults to go see by themselves (which is rarer for a kid's film). As long as we have Pixar, we'll always have good family entertainment, or entertainment in general

22 January 2004,Deserving of an Oscar,"Finding Nemo has it all...fantastic animation, great story, hilarious comedy, and wonderful voice acting. Ellen, I wish the Academy would create a Best Voice Acting Category and give you the first award. Your work as Dory stole the show.

This is one of the few movies I can pull out and watch at any time. Pixar has not won Best Animated Feature yet, and of their body of films, this is the perfect picture to give them their first.

27 June 2003,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!","I have seen a ton of movies in my life, but few are better than Finding Nemo. The storyline is excellent. The animation is out of this world. The humor is witty and plays to both children and adults alike (perhaps even more so toward the adults). The cast is great and convincing. If you liked the Toy Stories, then you'll love this. If you have never checked out a Pixar film, you are missing out. This is worth buying before renting. I could have paid $25 at the box office and still felt I got my money's worth. 10 stars.

4 May 2020,Heartwarming parent-child story.,"Nimo's first school day scenes are set in a cheerful and peaceful coral reef village, where we encounter various forms and colors of sea creatures milling around. From the previous tragidy, we know how much Marlin loves his son Nimo, and why he has become so overprotective.

Nimo is, however, as adventurous and curious about the outer world as any other boy is. As a result of a little clash between the two, Nimo happens to be captured by a human diver and lands up to an aquarium tank in a dentist.

Marlin's journey to look for his son begins. In his desparate face, we see every real life parent who worrys about their children. This real protagonist happens to have the most surreal companion, Dory. Her complete lack of ability to fear, worry, or be careful, counteracts Marlin's desparation.

They travel through various environment in water. Sharks' meeting room in a wrecked ship, darkness of deep water illuminated by an anglerfish, teritory of a school of pink jellyfish. Each one is beautiful, especially the lighting is very delicate and impressive.

Meanwhile, Nimo makes friends with those who have been in the tank. They are charming enough to make me intersted in their past background. Then they devise an escape plan. If Marlin's part is an action adventure movie, Nimo's part would be a spy action, which involves some interesting equipment gimmick.

The fish are sometimes frantic, relaxed, joyful, or determined. Thier body languages are maybe more articulate than human's when it comes to expressing human emotions. Through them we see our familiar story of a parent and a child. They clash because they love each other, and they learn to accept and understand each other.",10

17 May 2009,Pixar has done well this underwater sea adventure!,"Finding Nemo is one of the most wonderful films Pixar has made! When Nemo the clown fish gets kidnapped by a dentist scoobadiver his overprotective father Marlin searches for him with the help of the forgetful blue tang Dory! Along the way they meet new friends and Marlin learns a lesson about being a father! My favorite character was Dory Crush and Bruce! They all are funney! My favorite scenes are when the submarine that Bruce and his friends were hanging out in blew up and the two pelicans sitting on top of the surface see the bubbles from the explosion and one of them thinks the other let off gas and says NICE! I also liked it when Nemo, Tad, Pearl, and Sheldon are out looking at the water and Tad pulls Pearl back letting off her ink and she says You guys made me ink! That was hilarious! Filled with wonderful underwater animation, characters, and story Finding Nemo is a true PIXAR classic that'll go on forever! 10 out of 10.

31 January 2004,Star rating: 5 out of 5,"Finding Nemo is, quite simply, brilliant. Computer animation has come on in leaps and bounds since the days of Toy Story (1995) and Finding Nemo stunningly attests to this. From the vibrantly coloured and gently undulating coral on the reef, to the murky depths of Sydney harbour, to the clever use of reflection and refraction off the fish tank, this is a film in which the constantly changing scenery is a large part of its attraction. The original and well-judged score enhances the viewer's sense of wonder and their empathy with the characters.

But computer wizardry alone cannot create a great film. Finding Nemo is also blessed with an action-packed story and lots of laughs (largely courtesy of Dory - a well-meaning blue tang fish with short-term memory loss). Nemo is a young clown fish, eager to test his boundaries, who is caught by a diver and taken to an aquarium in Sydney. Whilst there, he makes friends with a motley collection of aquatic creatures who help him plot his escape. Meanwhile, his over-protective father, Marlin, begins a frantic quest to find his son. Along the way he is helped and hindered by three new-age sharks, some bodacious-dude turtles, a whale, and a monstrous angler fish (amongst others).

And yes, the ending may be a little mushy, but after such an epic adventure, the viewer will find the sentimentality relatively easy to stomach. Indeed, the character development is surprisingly deep for a children's movie, and it's a nice change to have not every character being entirely good or bad. Parents in the audience will certainly identify with Marlin's dilemma of wanting to protect his child, and yet coming to realise that the time comes when one has to let go a little.",9
24 June 2003,disappointing,"Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie. But I expected more. I would call it entertaining and worth a watch, but not up to the level of Monsters Inc. or Dreamworks Shrek. The graphics were awesome, but I left with a feeling that is could have been a better movie. I went with my friend and his 5 year old and there were some parts that were a bit scary for him (the 5 year old, not my friend). He still enjoyed the movie however. The story seems to resonate with the parents I talked to which may explain why it has such a high rating. I just expected a little more.

22 June 2003,Simply ok,"From the previews alone I could tell Finding Nemo would be below par. After watching the movie, I'm sure of it. This movie is long, dull, and overly sentimental. The voices are horribly annoying, mainly Ellen DeGeneres. She's just plain horrible as an actress and a voice actress. Albert Brooks is okay, not great but not bad. I'd say the only really good voices in the movie are Crush played by Andrew Stanton, and Bruce played by Barry Humphries. And they're just extras with only a handful of lines.

The story will bore you to death and you'll feel like Nemo trying to just get away from it to have some fun with the movie. Folks marvel at the graphics, but come on... you really think this is impressive? It's nothing compared to Pixar's past. Let's see... the incredible detail of Monsters Inc, or the ocean where you're lucky to see 20 feet in front of you and a few small fish.

All in all, I say skip this movie. It's much like watching an aquarium on a slow day; If you've got nothing else to do, it can be entertaining to gawk at the fish.",
30 May 2003,Finding DeGeneres,"****Excellent

***Good

**Fair

*Poor

Finding Nemo is a charming tale about an over-protective father named Merlin (Albert Brooks) who's son is kidnapped by divers. And after the lose of his wife years earlier Merlin will do everything it takes to save his only son Nemo.

Along the journey he meets a blue fish named Dory (played wonderfully by Ellen DeGeneres) who has short term memory but joins Merlin in the adventure. The character is the comic foundation of the film and she steals every scene she's in.

Although a fun film for the entire family. Finding Nemo doesn't reach the level of excellence it's predecessors had.

RATING: 3 Stars",8
19 April 2004,a bit cloying at times,"I love my fish. I've kept fish for quite a while and get a lot of pleasure out of just looking at them and watching their behaviour. Finding Nemo has made me think about them slightly differently - and has hugely increased my guilt quotient at being responsible for their little lives!

Pixar have scored again with a beautifully made film. The underwater scenes are absolutely gorgeous, the colours and waves beautifully rendered. However, because of the changes to the creatures - mainly the fact that they've been given human eyes - it doesn't feel as real as Toy Story did. That aside, I really fell in love with Marlin. Nemo was a little bit irritating, but then again, I always find the cute kid irritating.

The plots were rather predictable, then then again, that's we expect from Pixar. They are obviously students of Joseph Campbell, every single step of the hero journey was followed in meticulous detail, right down to the literal representation of the 'belly of the whale' episode.

Overall, I enjoyed this film, but it didn't blow me away. I think my expectations had been raised too far really. It certainly didn't live up to the hype. And Keanu Reeves ought to sue them. Really.",
8 August 2003,Perfect film for all ages!,"Anybody whose anybody would love this movie. If you don't like this movie, there is something wrong with you. It has action, adventure, comedy, romance, drama, and fun! This is the perfect film that if you want to take your kids to, go ahead! PIXAR again has a perfect family film. Let's just hope that PIXAR can create more great films that were as great as Finding Nemo.

29 September 2014,Great for kids of all ages,"This must be the best kids movie of all time.

Funny and heart-warming, it'll leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Beautifully made. Expertly animated. Very well written Superbly acted. I have seen this several times and notice new stuff every time. Ellen DeGeneres is fabulous. Far superior to the likes of Shark Tale. Ten lines is a lot to expect in a review about a film, you don't think that ten lines is an awful lot until you start to write a review for a film and then you actually realise that ten lines is actually a lot of lines to write and repeat yourself. I have tried not to repeat myself but not really very hard. Perhaps if I was to try harder not to repeat myself then the task of not repeating would be easier but as the situation stands at the moment, I fear that I might be repeating myself, perhaps I could go swimming in the sea or in a swimming pool or a lake or loch or a big puddle.

3 June 2003,One of the best movies of the year!,"FINDING NEMO is one of the best-animated movies to hit theaters since Monster's INC. Disney and Pixar have done another astounding job. They produce films that teach a lesson or two, but also squeeze out many laughs along the way. It is a movie about a father trying to find his only son. It turns the sea into a fast paced world of humor and fun. Like Toy Story it turns a simple idea into two hours of fun and laughs. Disney and Pixar should be awarded many awards for there achievement. Nemo is a very superior movie that has an important message. Again the special effects are amazing. Further more everything looks very true to life. It's neat how they do it. Along for the swim are Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, William Dafoe, Brad Garrett, and Ailison Janney. There voice work is very funny. The characters in this film are very good. They turn ordinary fish into extraordinary characters. Ellen Degeneres should be given an Academy Award for her voice work. She is very funny as Dory. She carries many of the scenes with an effortless force of humor and innocence. Finding Nemo is a great family film of everyone. All in all it is one of the best movies to hit theaters this year. 3.89/4",10
15 June 2016,Pixar's Masterpiece,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",10

23 February 2004,Best animated picture of all time.,"Amazing animation, amazing voice acting, amazing dialogues, amazing movie!!!! Every single character in this movie is extraordinary! I just have to say that Dory is the most hilarious movie character in the history of cinema. This is one of the best animated feature films of all time and boy does it deserve the Oscar this year! A father goes in search of his son Nemo after he is taken away by a scuba diver and the fun starts from there! Exciting, thrilling and an entire ocean of laughter from start to finish! Absolutely brilliant! The guys from PIXAR have really outdone themselves this time! 10/10 *****/***** A+++++

10 December 2004,"Visually appealing, but too long for the story","The people who spent years of their lives putting Finding Nemo together did an absolutely wonderful job at their keyboards, and during their on-site investigation of what the ocean looks like.

Also, I found the voice actors did a commendable job, although I'm never sure how much is the actors, and how much is the animators synching and designing the characters who go with those voices.

I did, however, find that this story was dragged out WAY too long for what it was. I imagine that Disney requires most of their animated features to involve everyone looking for a single character, or a character finding him/herself, but there really wasn't much going on in this film that would have been lost had it been condensed into an hour, or even 45 minutes. I may have been drawn in at some point, but had to sit there too long to stay involved.

I think that children will find the characters fun and cute enough to thoroughly enjoy the film, however, although at this point I'm probably the only person who hadn't seen this picture. Now if I would just rent Titanic ...

Take care.",5

18 May 2019,Outstandingly Incredible!,"An absolutely incredible heartwarming film. Pixar is definitely no stranger to hitting us in the heart, but this one takes that strength and doubles it! The amount of love and creativity put into this children's film is so amazing and I love that it goes beyond what normal kids films would do. This story has depth to it, Marlin is determined to find his son, while he is still grieving over his dead wife. This film touches on the stages of grief and it gives a great message to the kids watching. This film never fails to get me emotional and nostalgic no matter how many times I rewatch it. This is a nearly perfect Pixar film, and in my opinion is the 3rd best they have made.

18 August 2003,Only Disney!,"Yes, It's only Disney who is able to make such a cartoon movie a splendid, magnificent, and charming one! Heard that the little son of my wife's colleague was scared and later delighted by the plot. Though being an adult, I was not so moved by the story, but I'm still attracted deeply. My wife said I was so dedicated into watching the movie. I love this one, really. Comparable with 'Lion King', as a sentimental cartoon.

22 September 2013,Finding Nemo is an animation to see.,"Pixar's Finding Nemo is an animation film. It is set mostly in the ocean at Australia's Great Barrier Reef and in Sidney Australia. The main characters are Marlin (voice by Albert Brooks), Nemo (voice by Alexander Gould) and Dory (voice by Ellen DeGenneres). The story is of a father and son and the love they have for each other. In this story father and son are clown fish that live at the Reef. The father is overprotective and son is ready to take on the world even though one of his fins is small. In the film Nemo and his father get separated. The journey begins by Marlin to find his son. Along the journey Marlin faces many obstacles. Marlin also meets news friends that help along the way. This film compares with Toy Story when it comes to friends that are willing to help. One friend that makes the journey with Marlin is Dory a pretty blue fish that has short term memory loss. Sometimes along the journey Marlin is not the most cooperative. He comes to realize you cannot be protected from everything. The background music makes the mood for the coming event. At one point in the ocean Marlin and Dory come upon a shark named Bruce. Bruce takes them through a mine field. The music played is eerie. It keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. Moving among the mines is delicate so as not to set any of them off. The music sets the suspense for the scene. Another scene that using music effectively is after Nemo is added to the fish tank there is a ceremony done by the fish that already reside in the tank. The ceremony starts the music and chanting gradually escalates louder and louder building suspense for Nemo to be an accepted member. The editing in the film has kept the pace of the film moving. The action continues from one obstacle to another for Marlin, Dory and Nemo. There are some conflict scenes and the editing starts the conflict cuts away and re-enters after the conflict with any violence being left out. In the beginning of the movie there is an attack by a barracuda. Marlin tries to protect his family. The barracuda swats him away with his tail. The next scene is Marlin waking up and realizing what has happened. This gives all of the details for the viewer to create what happened in their own minds. At the same time there are no graphic parts for children to endure. I enjoyed the film. The action continues to the end. The overall quality of the film is well done. The color of the many fish in the ocean and the reef itself are worth seeing this film. If you have children Finding Nemo is a must see. As adults the film is still entertaining and worth the time to view. This film can teach a valuable lesson of trust between parents and children.",9
24 January 2004,What is it with Disney's obsession with killing parents?!?,"I mean, HONESTLY! This is supposed to be a kiddie flick, right? So, in classic Disney fashion...five minutes in, two days short of hatching, Mum is devoured by a barracuda -- along with 499 of our title character's siblings. WHY??? This movie made me squirm (pun only gently intended). I can't remember a time I've been more uncomfortable watching a film so blatantly marketed at children.

I'm a playwright, folks, an award-winning one at that. I GET the concept of conflict as a dramatic device...but must we keep our cutesy-poo lead in constant peril (sharks, nets, aquarium filtration systems, etc.) I'm really disappointed in how gratuitously MANIPULATIVE this feature is, and saddened that the filmmakers think so very little of the audience to foist such drivel on us, disguised as a family film. Sure, it was lovely to look at...but I can't say much more in its favor. I would NEVER recommend this unnecessarily violent, surprisingly distressing, unintentionally maudlin, unbearably sentimental movie for a child -- or an adult.

WHY this film continues to rake it in at the box office, and why critics predict this as an Oscar favorite is beyond my abliity to understand. I'm no crochety grump, either (well, at least I wasn't BEFORE I watched this dreadful film). This is just another classic example of Disney lackeys putting FORMULA ahead to STORY and SENSE, all in pursuit of the bucks. Walt must be spinning in his cryogenic chamber at the thought of his name being sullied by association with this horrible film.

Parents: do your kids a favor: If they love the little fishies...take them to a real aquarium instead of subjecting them to even one minute of this bizarre and misguided cash cow with mouse ears.

I want the last two hours of my life back.",3
22 September 2013,Dive into the Ocean,"Finding Nemo is not only a great animation, but also a great lesson for parents. With a humorous cast including Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, Albert Brooks as Marlin, Alexander Gould as Nemo, and Willem Dafoe as Gill; Finding Nemo sends viewers on a heart wrenching, suspenseful, humorous journey for a fishes only son. This movie had me in tears within the first five minutes of the movie, when a drastic loss happens. The journey shows the battles and heartache that parents face when losing a young one. Marlin, the single parent, has a hard time ""letting go"" to his only son Nemo for his first day of school. When he finally does, Nemo gets lost. The movie explores the ocean while Marlin searches for his son. Marlin faces many of his fears in search of his son. As the movie takes you on this journey, a journey similar to Toy Story, where a lost toy brings unity among all toys; Nemo, as the lost fish, brings unity to fish and birds in search of him. The similarities in plot and underlying story messages are similar however Lee Unkrich, Andrew Stanton, the directors of Finding Nemo, do a great deal to engage the viewers right away. Throughout the movie the open sea and other ocean creatures fill the audience with great invisible sound. The movie gives viewers the ocean like feel with the invisible sound of the ocean animals and ocean water, and also the lighting in the scenes gives the realistic ocean depth. Both of these techniques are used greatly throughout the film while Marlin and Dory face adventures in the open sea. While Marlin and Dory lead viewers through the ocean they face many obstacles. The overall story of the film would be to have trust in one another. A good quote from the film, which is reiterated at the end of the film, ""You think you can do these things, Nemo, but you just can't!"" This quote ties the over-all theme together. Marlin had very little trust in his son's abilities, yet had he given him the benefit of the doubt at the beginning of the movie, it may have prevented Nemo from getting lost in the first place. This movie uses very good techniques that allow the viewer to sink into the ocean, and help Marlin to find his son. Dory plays the humorous girly-fish who adds humor to the bad situation, and who also helps Marlin to lighten up. I think all parents can learn a thing or two from this movie, and could use the humorous outlook on life, like Dory's!",9

9 June 2003,Eye candy. Great film that tugs at the heart strings.,"I loved the animation, and not just the pretty reef scenes either. I was particularly impressed with the various atmospheric conditions from the colourful reef, to the pitch black depths, to the world war 2 wreck, the polluted Sydney harbour, etc etc.

Of all the pixar films so far, there was more to tug at the heart strings here. Maybe because I am a parent.

20 June 2007,Everyone Loves Nemo!,"Being a film that titillated female viewers, children, and even some men alike, ""Finding Nemo""'s awe-inspiring animation and wonderful voice work may have caste the illusion that this well-made little film is something of a masterpiece. In reality, Nemo floats well, but there's not much beneath the surface, making it an enjoyable but over-hyped cgi flick.

The film borrows heavily the pacing formula of the brilliant ""Toy Story"", and that's not really a bad thing. What gives the film it's mass appeal is undoubtedly, aside from the stunning graphics, the characters. Although I couldn't really connect with them, I can see why so many enjoy watching them. Dorry is the conventional half-wit (Sid from Ice Age, Donkey from Shrek) who for no real reason other then for conventional cinematic interest, finds herself accompanying Marlin on his journey to locate his missing son out of the vast ocean. Just a small twist, she has short term memory loss. I comment frequently on the use of the suspension of disbelief. I don't usually have a problem with it, depending on the context and how often it's used. Here, the unreality of the film leaps out at me with it's teeth barred. Not everyone who boats lives by the shore, and even though Marlin was lucky enough to have his son's captor live so close to the ocean, just how was he planning on getting up there without the help of a winged sympathetic fish-a-vore? Still, the film has enough whimsy for that not to get too problematic, but it allows the writer a lot of area in creating the story, and I wasn't as impressed with the results as others, aside from the films sporadic strong points.

Dorry is bubbly and fun for many to watch. Just like with the tepid ""Ice Age"", it takes more then a character who's easy on the eyes and ears to become a character worthy of layering. She doesn't really improve or change much over the course of the film, she just occasionally in a very Disney-like fashion unintentionally helps Marlin escape some near fatal situations. Marlin has the task of forming a friendship with her, because she can grow a tad bit annoying. There's Nemo, who's blow up at his father seems rather unwarranted. I'd assume Nemo knows his siblings were killed by the hundreds, and I'd think he'd at least sympathize with his father for being so overprotective. He can still get upset, but to use the word ""hate""? And of course there's the tank gang, another hoot to watch (each having a cartoon personality), and the serious Gil.

Back to the story, it's basically our heroes almost getting eaten, and nemo's attempts at an orthodontist's office to escape his aquatic prison. Some of the sequences succeed better the others. The film also revels in not demeaning animals who happen to be carnivorous, another plus. The film also quite well provides more then shallow entertainment for everyone, and I mean everyone. As long as you're not to young to watch a movie, ""Finding Nemo"" is accessible. That's the film's strongest quality, but aside from that, it really isn't anything much more. Some of the emotion seems trite and ill-proportioned, moving back and forth from believable to not so much. Being a kid's flick, it certainly is better then many other films out there. It just doesn't tackle that much in order to be considered over so many other films, which is usually the case. The story is very linear and it doesn't amaze that well outside of itself. The animation not only delivers, it delivers a natural biome that in itself is one of the most amazing places on earth. The animation on the fish is glorious, capturing the realistic way in which real fish move and partnering it with comedic human movement. The animated reef with it's human makeover, however, is even more brighter and colorful then most actual reefs. The film is like an inviting turquoise pool with a temperature of 85 degrees. And with a riveting score and perspective camera angles, the film launches itself away from other shtick to become noticed, but in my opinion, not really all the praise is worth it.",6

18 July 2003,Good for slightly sensitive kids,"The good news is that the kids liked this movie. My boys are 9 and 12. They aren't particularly macho and they're easily upset by movies. In this way, I suppose they're not very typical. Anyway, they found the level of suspense here very tolerable and they liked the happy ending and positive messages. Curiously, my husband seemed to like it, too.

The bad news, was that I had a hard time with it. Berthold Brecht supposedly once said that the essence of enjoying theater was to suspend one's disbelief so that one could enter into the show. Sigh. I just couldn't do this.

I mean fish eyes face to the side, not forward. They don't have facial expressions. Sharks can't take a vow to stop eating fish. Sharks have to eat other fish to live. And, moreover, fish of one species don't hang out with fish of another species. And, yet, all these belief-streching cute things appear in this movie ... and that's just the start.

OK. I know I need to get past this sort of thing when I watch a cartoon. It's only a cartoon. I guess I'm getting uduly rigid in my old age.

Plus it all seemed kind of trite.

Oh, well. At least my husband and the kids liked it.",

6 June 2003,"It may not be Toy Story, but it's still one of Pixar's best to date!","Let's face it, no movie Pixar is ever going to make will even come close to how perfect the Toy Story movies were. But one thing's for sure, and that's that Pixar will always be king of computer animation. It's the kind of technique that either looks brilliant or hideous, and Pixar just keeps on getting more amazing.

I was looking forward to seeing Finding Nemo ever since I saw the trailer last year, and my high expectations paid off! It's a little bit darker than Pixar's previous movies, but the humor totally makes up for it. One of Pixar's best talents is being able to entertain on so many levels. ANYONE can love a Pixar movie, and Finding Nemo is no exception. Everyone in the theater got a kick out of it (try saying that about a third-rate Disney sequel).

The animation is the best Pixar has ever done, but it's always the story that takes the cake in their movies. It's the SCRIPT that keeps me watching them over and over, not just eye candy. Finding Nemo's story dragged just a little at times, but it wasn't enough to make me annoyed. I'm going to see it again soon, and really want the DVD.

I loved the One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest-inspired gang of fish in the tank. ""MY BUBBLES!!!""",
1 June 2003,Losing Pixar?,"Yes, perhaps you read into the one line summary a little too much, but...Pixar really need to pick it up a little. It's not that 'Finding Nemo' is a BAD movie. Not by any means... - it's just that story-wise it's not as good as 'Monster's Inc' which in turn, wasn't as good as 'A Bug's Life'...

Visually, 'Finding Nemo' is a masterpiece of graphic design. The water looks fabulously real, and when you see the above-water scenes, you have to gape at how lush it all looks.

Ellen DeGeneres gives the best performance as the enigmatic fish suffering from short term memory loss. This gives way to some rather amusing quips and dialoguing between her and Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks, who's trying to find his son Nemo).

Other than DeGeneres, there's absolutely no memorable voices in the movie. Albert Brooks actually grated on my nerves considerably, and at times I wished he's get eaten by a shark or stung to death by jelly-fish. Sure, that wouldn't be typical cutesy Pixar, but heck...there was a small (but unnecessary) 'bloody' scene in this film that wasn't typical Pixar.

Another issue with this latest Pixar blockbuster is the lack of flow in the storyline. It kept cutting from Marlin's part of the movie to Nemo's part of the movie. Yes, the storyline makes that necessary, but it just didn't flow as well, which is a shame. The storyline itself is also incredibly basic. 'A Bug's Life,' for instance, was FAR more interesting, and at times during 'Nemo' I found myself a little bored.

Overall, I'd give this movie a 7/10. It certainly wasn't bad, but Pixar really need to up the ante to keep this up. The box-office takings might disagree with me, but there needs to be a little more substance in future Pixar offerings.",
2 November 2014,"Not just for kids, great movie","Finding Nemo is about a fish named Nemo who gets separated from his dad Marlin. Nemo has one small fin, and it's hard for him to swim as fast as the other fish so his dad is overprotective of him in the ocean. Dying to fit in, Nemo disobeys his father and swims far out, and gets abducted by humans. Marlin gets help along the way from a fish named Dory who is dead set on finding Nemo.

The film focuses on plot, action and adventure. Marlin played by Albert Brooks; attempts to relocate his son Nemo Alexander Gould; in a huge ocean surrounded by trouble. Along the way he encounters jelly fish, getting lost, his sidekick Dory, voice by Ellen DeGeneres getting captured by fisherman, and almost getting eaten by pelicans to name a few. One of the techniques in the film is motif. The motif would be the idea to never give up that is repeated throughout the movie. Some examples of this are when Nemo tries to swim out with the rest of his class and it's harder for him, when Nemo tries to put the pebble in the fish tank filter, when Dory tries her hardest to remember the address on the goggles, and when Marlin tells all the fish caught in the fishermen's net to swim down. The idea was to keep trying until you succeed. The biggest and most evident example is Marlin going to find his son (the entire plot of the movie), regardless of what he encountered he didn't give up. Being that this film is animated the ""lighting"" and angles used aren't those from an actual cinematographer. The movie still used angles in animation to draw the audience's attention to scenes to make a point. As in most movies, sound in this film played a huge role. In one of the scenes where a nice pelican tries to save Marlin and Dory from hungry pelicans; all three characters end up getting chased and the music for that scene was fitting. It was a fast paced beat; even if you closed your eyes you knew what type of scene was taking place just by the music. In the beginning of the movie, when Nemo was going off to school, the music is very upbeat which signified happiness. This movie in relation to others such as Toy Story represents the same motif, bonding, relationships, and determination. Both films grab the viewers' attention by using bright colors, and sound as texture to bring the film to life.",9
10 July 2008,I was bored and insulted.,"In IMDb I really like the option where one can read the reviews in like-hate order. One like, one hate; I think that's one of the best ways to get a real picture of a picture :). But let's not forget, that it is essential to also see what one has written elsewhere, what that person likes or dislikes. If I don't know about a movie I try to find a person who shares my views and choose a movie she/he liked. And do not believe a person, that rates everything down.

Nemo is dull and confusing. Not in the manner, that one can't understand things going on, but I saw this film once and do not want to see it again, ever. I don't like it when cartoons are about shouting and screaming all the way. Something good happens: scream, something bad: scream, if you don't scream, than shout. It's just stupid. One could just ignore the biological and geographical - and all the other illogical - ""mistakes"" this movie has to offer, it was catching in any other sense, but no. This movie is just cheap entertainment for people who don't care what they are looking as far it's drawn well. If you are thinking what to rent for the evening or for a trip I advise you to choose Happy Feet or Anastasia instead... that is, if you don't like cheap thrills. Points go for the fact, that I really saw this movie from the start till the end. 2s and 1s go for movies I couldn't even bare to watch all the way.",3
3 June 2003,Pixar are the masters.,"If you can get past the first 15 minutes of Pixar's latest, you'll get a movie that is on par with their four other feature films. Finding Nemo turns out to be a big, adventure film with a lot of laughs and a heart that is barely on the good side of manipulation. Once the adventure starts, the emersion into the film begins and doesn't let you go.

The movie plays up on over-protective parents, kids overcoming their disabilities, friendships conquering obstacles, addicts joining together to be better people (uh, fish), building self-esteem, realizing and accepting strengths and curmudgeons learning to lighten up. All this in an animated, family-oriented, 'G' movie? You bet! Pixar are the masters at the making everyone happy film. They give the parents being dragged into the theater something to enjoy as well.

If only they had done something with that beginning. The films opens in a fish suburbia complete with happy families, beautiful homes and a peaceful way of life all with no hint of sardonic humor. Yes, there are people who think that is heaven, but what about those who make fun it? At least give them something to chuckle about. It's Utopia for the Family Values set and completely out of character for Pixar.

It's at this point I thought they had finally produced their first sub-standard film. That is until a barracuda changes the main characters lives forever and Albert Brooks goes into, well, Albert Brooks mode. Marlin has a son, Nemo, who has an underdeveloped fin and therefore can't swim well. This combined with the catastrophe at the beginning of the film causes Marlin to smother Nemo. Nemo, finally fed up, rebels, ends up being caught by a diver and spirited away. Marlin sets out after Nemo and that's when the film finally picks up with some adventure and some laughs.

And when that laugh level is revved up, it's supplied by the scene-stealing Ellen DeGeneres as a blue tang named Dory. Dory is basically an idiot savant. She has a severe short-term memory loss problem. Now fish are believed to have no short-term memory so the jokes on the surface play on this; however, in a scene where Dory is faced with being alone without friends again, you wonder if it's a form of denial. She says in the scene that she doesn't want to forget anymore and that having Marlin around helps her remember because he is the only one that has stuck by her. Does she really have this problem or is it that she is so disappointed with no one understanding her that she hides everything? The scene is multi-layered and heart wrenching. Ellen plays it surprisingly well as if she identifies with what Dory is going through. That's what makes the scene work so well. Many of us have gone through the same thing and know how she feels.

There are many, many memorable scenes in the film as Marlin attempts to find Nemo who is now in a fish tank in a dentist office. One of the scenes is supplied in a superb performance by William Dafoe as Gill, an angelfish in the tank with Nemo who is from the ocean (not a pet store) and dreams of escaping and taking his new friends with him. He devises a scheme to get them out that is hair-brained and daring, but with one little plot hole that the film plays up to hilarious effect at the end. Another great scene is with a trio of sharks that have sworn off fish in the most unlikely AA meeting imaginable. Their motto: ""Fish are our friends and not food!""

Finding Nemo is grand and exciting adventure that once it gets beyond it's slow opening turns into exactly what you expect from the masterminds at Pixar. A film that is imaginative and visually stunning with big adventures for everyone no matter how old they are on the outside.",
21 March 2015,A Fun & Excellent Animated Movie... A must see!,"It's so fun and enjoyable and greatly written with an excellent story line. The actors were superb, we felt a mix of emotions through the viewing. Definitely a movie for all ages. We can tell that the producers of this film worked hard to bring to life the under water world in such an engaging and comedic way, and the quality of animation, captivating bright colours and suited cinematography, as expected was fantastic which we felt also aided the entire viewer experience. With each character's unique personality being perfectly distinguished in a clever way highlighted much creativity and places this particular movie at the top of the our list of awesomely produced animated films. If you haven't seen this film we encourage you to do so and be prepared for an experience and be taken into another world. Do watch and thoroughly enjoy! A great ""must see""!

15 June 2003,BEAUTIFUL,"Finding Nemo was...in a word...awesome.

Ellen DeGeneres as Dory was funny, and the characters were deep. And they actually had personalities, unlike some cartoon (yes I know this is a PiXAR film) movies. And the characters...well...you could actually like them. A bit too long...but it was very enjoyable. ~~~8/10~~~

9 September 2022,I Love Underwater Movies,"Personally I Love Underwater Movies. And I Know I Said Open Season Was The Best Animation Comedy I Had Ever Seen But That Was Until I Saw Finding Nemo. I Only Rated Open Season 8/10 Because Of A Disgusting Bits. So Now I Would Say This Is Just The Best Animation I Have Ever Seen. There Is Some Funny Bits That Would Have You Laughing But It Is More A Great Animation. Dory Is Funny. I Hate That It Had To Nearly Be Really Sad Ending To What Is A Great Movie. But Of Course It Provided A Great And Happy Ending To What Was A Brilliant Film. I Recommend This Film For All Ages. Spoiler The Tears Might Start Spilling When You Decide To Watch This Movie.

2 August 2008,One of Pixar's best work ever,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
5 March 2021,Very touching film,"The story drives this more than the special effects.

Love the story!

Once more, the film guys never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue.

And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing.",8
5 February 2021,Good cast,"They have good casts performing the characters, with a particular nod here to Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Barry Humphries and Willem Dafoe (though one wishes Nemo had a bit more dimension to him); they have plenty of effort put into the look of the movie (one of the strongest achievements is that the undersea world of the Pacific is a lot more comforting than the dry land world of Australia, so that you feel alarmed whenever the action cuts to Sydney); and they have the sense to not go overboard with any cultural references.

It has to be said that it's a bit slow going at first, but fears that it'll be Pixar's first real disappointment are soon allayed; with some impressive animation, plenty of fine moments throughout and a wonderful score from Thomas Newman that gives the proceedings a breath of fresh musical air after his cousin Randy's efforts (so when can we expect David Newman to work for Pixar?), this ultimately ends up as another good effort from the bouncing lamp",8
12 January 2011,Watching it with the 3 kids now,"This is my favourite Pixar film and I am actually watching it again now with the kids. The years it took to make this and the fine detail are evident every time you watch this. It is like watching a documentary about the ocean as it is absolutely beautiful. It feels like you are watching a beautiful work of art brought to life. It is also such a great story and has a wealth of different characters that are fabulous. I love Crush the 150 year old turtle, Nigel the Pelican and the hilarious seagulls - Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate Mate. Still makes me giggle. Amazing how these films can turn you in to a 7 year old again. My 3 year old Joe is looking at me as if I am nuts. Willem Defoe is superb as Gill and Ellen DeGeneres is hilarious as Dory. How do Pixar get it so right? Sequel anyone?

17 November 2015,so lovely,"The clown fish Marvin ha a son called Nemo, and is very protective. When he finally gathers enough courage and let him on a school trip, the diver catches Nemo and takes him to the aquarium. There, he will meet with other sea creatures and begin to plan escape. Marvin will cross the entire ocean to return his son home. The palette of characters is amazing and extraordinary animation! Whether it comes to sharks in rehab for fish, cool surfing turtles, depressed starfish trapped in an aquarium or shrimp obsessed with cleanliness! In combination with the extremely witty, intelligent and profound scenario will draw you into this world and put a smile on your face. Pixar factory miracles comes another extremely painted world full of diverse but SC has a balanced colors which represents a real visual treat.

10 March 2004,Fun!,"You should never be worried about going to see a pixar film because not only do they not make bad movies, they dont even make average movies. Everyone of their films have been both a stunning techniqual achivement but great family entertainment as well.

When it comes to the battle between Pixar and Dreamworks, Pixar is the overall winner. Both Shrek and Ice Age were blissfully over-rated as the jokes tried to be too adult and in the end failed misserably.

This newest effort tells the tale of Marlin and Nemo, a father and son that have a great relationship yet Nemo cant help feeling his dad is too overprotective (watch the film and find out why). It is when Nemo is taken away by a group of divers that Marlin searches the ocean for him, with the help of the wonderfully stupid Dory (She suffers from short term memory lose).

Visually this film is great as it looks as if it is actually taking place under the sea. Unlike the rest of their films, this one is ridicuously cute and it works. The animation also helps in the comical value of the movie. Dory is by far the funniest character as she constantly looks confused and blissfully unaware. The surfer sea turtles are a major plus point too ""DUDE!""

The only major downside to this film is that the ending feels rushed. With all of the Pixar films before this there was always a gripping chase that not only showed the hero status of the main characters but the bonding between them. This had the bonding element but a school of fish trying to escape from a net is, frankly, not as exciting as a showdown at an airport (Toy Story 2) or a chase in the rain (A Bugs Life). There are also no outakes to make us chuckle which is missed.

But at the end of the day this is family entertainment at the higher end of the spectrum. Forget trash like The Little Mermaid or Pochontas and watch a film that shows the comical side of family values.

8 November 2003,Cute Movie,"I was wrapped up in the excitement that everyone had over this movie and I decided to buy the DVD. We watched it last night and thought it was a very cute movie. But honestly didn't understand what the big deal was about. There were parts of the movie that were pretty slow and boring, and as someone else commented, this movie had the same story line as Toy Story 2, where they had to go into the human world to get them back to the toy (in this case the ocean) world. I gave it a 7 because it was cute, but this movie is not at all exceptional.

11 June 2003,A lively and beautiful summer treat.,"Fish. How the heck do you make a movie about fish? Fish are good for hooking, cleaning and frying but to make an animated adventure about them? Seems like a long shot to me. Luckily for us Pixar Studios took up the challenge and made the computer animated Finding Nemo. This is an astoundingly beautiful, touching and very funny movie aboutahfish.

The plot of Finding Nemo is simple. In a comparatively tough opening scene (for a children's movie) clownfish Marlin loses his wife and all but one of their thousand-odd eggs. The surviving egg hatches to become the titular Nemo, a feisty little fry suffering under the watchful eye of his overprotective father. One day Nemo feels particularly put upon and swims off into dangerous water. Naturally he is captured by divers and soon finds himself captive in a fish tank. Thus begins Marlin's quest to find and save his son. At first glance, this looks like standard kiddy movie fodder. Dangers are faced. Fears are overcome and (big L) Lessons are Learned. The sort of pabulum parents dread sitting through and kids quickly tire of. For the most part though Pixar successfully navigates the shoals of the mundane. They fill Finding Nemo with enough fascinating details and humorous asides that you forget you've seen essentially the same movie a hundred times on Nickelodeon. From the dental groupie denizens of Nemo's fish tank to the single-minded seagulls the movie will snag even the most adult viewer's attention throughout.

The first thing that hits you in Finding Nemo is how gorgeous the movie is. The undersea environment simply ripples with color, texture and detail, especially in opening scenes set in a crowded coral reef. Traditional cell animation cannot begin to compete with computer animation in this area.

Pixar has always been extraordinarily clever in casting the voices of their features and Finding Nemo is no exception. Albert Brooks, an actor known for his neurotic roles, is perfect as the driven father fish Marlin. Willem Dafoe as Gill, Nemo's fish tank mentor, is every old con that ever led an escape attempt. Barry Humphries, usually heard and seen as Dame Edna Everage, sounds exactly like what you'd expect a talking shark to sound like. The featured voices include Eric Bana, Bruce Spence, Elizabeth Perkins, Austin Pendleton, John Ratzenberger and Geoffrey Rush among other - all perfectly cast and all fitting their animated counterparts perfectly. The standout performance, however, is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory the bluefish. She steals the show as Marlin's enthusiastically helpful companion with an unfortunate memory problem.

Finding Nemo does have its faults. Some sequences are played at such a frenetic pace it becomes hard to sort out what is happening. In particular Marlin and Dory's encounter with a trio of over-friendly sharks suffers from a too frenzied approach. If I hadn't read that they had stumbled into a Meat-a-holic Anonymous meeting I would probably have missed the joke. This, however, is a relatively minor blip in an otherwise consistently delightful film. With its wealth of humor, vibrant color and stunning attention to detail Finding Nemo is well worth a viewing on the big screen.",
13 January 2004,AMAZING!!!,"What can I say about ""Finding Nemo""? it's almost perfect! Animation is astonishing, looking at times even more than real when rendering landscapes and movements. Characters are very well developed, escaping even the stereotypes of classic cartoons (like the sharks or the sea-turtles). The story is sweet but not cheesy, in the perfect ""old Disney"" style, with a bit of sadness in the beginning and a nice happy ending. The animation on its whole was (of course) made for children and ""toon lovers"", but it's also full of small details which can entertain the ""common daddy"" who's taking his child to the movies. This is a masterwork. Absolutely.

6 December 2003,Visually stunning and hugely enjoyable,"Over-protective clownfish Marlin (Albert Brooks) witnesses his only surviving offspring Nemo being captured by a deep-sea diver soon after a moment of rebelliousness from the youngster. Frantic, Marlin endeavours to find his son with the help of an amnesiac fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). On his quest, he also meets sharks which have formed a Fish-Eaters Anonymous group, and a group of surfer turtles' that speak like Bill and Ted.

Meanwhile, Nemo has been released into a fish tank in a dentist's waiting room in Sydney. There, he meets a group of fellow prisoners led by angelfish Gill (Willem Dafoe) who has devised a cunning plot for them all to escape. The challenge that Pixar faces here is to make fish as cute and as loveable as the furry leads of previous animated successes. Anthropomorphism goes far enough to over ride the fact that in the wild, fish lay eggs and then neglect their offspring and to allow Dory to read the handwritten name and address on Nemo's abductor's neglected goggles.

Having enjoyed both Toy Story' and Monsters Inc', I found Finding Nemo' just as good. The success of Pixar features is down to the studio's story-telling skills and their ability to entertain the whole family: familiar quotes such as Hop inside my mouth if you want to live' will be appreciated by adults but lost on kids. However, there is still plenty to entrance the youngsters as well although I do feel that the film is overlong for very young children.

Brilliant characterisation and glorious animation makes Finding Nemo' stunning and charming to watch. This is a visual treat not to be missed. Also, the fun continues to the end of the credits so don't be too eager to leave your seat!",9
13 March 2006,Pixar do it again!!,"This movie will entertain you like no other animation this year.This movie has humour,excitement,great visual effects and a knockout soundtrack.

We meet Marlyn a typical clown fish who has just set up home on the coral reef off Australia with his wife coral who is about to be the mother of 300 or so unhatched baby clown fish.An awful accident happens and Marlyn loses his children and wife all 300 children except one which he decides to call Nemo.

After much deliberation Nemo is allowed to go to school even though his over protective father would rather he waited a couple of years.During his first day Nemo gets caught by divers at the drop-off and brought to Sydney,Austrailia.It is now up to Marlyn and his new friend Dory the slightly vacant fish to help find Nemo.Nemo who is now in a new world to him, a fish tank in a dentists office in Sydney.

This is a great movie for all ages an absolute must see.

5 July 2003,Fish ARE food...not friends...,"I've just finished a nice snack of eel sushi, and a dinner featuring a very nice ahi tuna steak, so I'm now well prepared to begin my review of Pixar's latest creation: `Finding Nemo.' I highly recommend a nice seafood dinner before, or perhaps even after watching this film.

Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a clown fish, and the only survivor of a brood of hundreds. While still an embryo, a mean old fish eating barracuda (are there any other kind?) decides that a nice clown fish caviar is the order of the day, and snorks down all of Nemo's brothers & sisters, not to mention his mother Coral. Nemo's only surviving relative is his father Marlin (Albert Brooks), who, needless to say, is a bit distraught after having lost most of his family in a couple of bites.

Naturally, Marlin becomes a bit overprotective of his last remaining child, and poor Nemo feels a bit put-upon. In a moment of childish rebellion, Nemo swims out to the open ocean to where a boat is anchored. Sadly, the occupants of the boat, who just happened to be scuba diving, decide Nemo would make a great addition to their saltwater aquarium (in a dentist's office, no less). So Nemo is snatched away, and forced to live a life behind glass in Sydney, Australia.

Marlin, with the help of Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the short-term memory-challenged blue tang, seeks to track down little Nemo, and hopefully bring him back to his rightful home amongst the sea anemone.

This is Pixar's fifth feature creation, and one of their most visually interesting. Sadly, one can't say the same for the story line, for it's about as original and captivating as a dinner at McDonald's. Marlin, father of the lost Nemo, is a bit paranoid. It's funny for the first few milliseconds, then becomes just annoying as the paranoia continues unabated until nearly the very end. And Dory's early onset of Alzheimer's isn't funny at all, no matter what. I think the Pixar people meant this stuff to be funny, but I've seen funnier bits in any given 10 minutes of `Sponge Bob Square Pants' than in this entire film.

The best part of the movie is Nemo's adventures in his new saltwater aquarium home in the dentist's office. The cast of fish characters he encounters there, and their fascination with dentistry, is one of the truly enjoyable parts of the show.

Yet what little sparks of joy one encounters is leveraged with some rather negative and strange characterizations that make you wonder if there was some sort of secret agenda at work amongst the animators. As usual with modern-day children's films based in the animal kingdom, carnivores are shown to be mean, cruel, heartless villains. And if one encounters a `nice' carnivore, it's only because they've sworn off eating flesh. There is a cute scene where we encounter three sharks that are members of `Fish Eaters Anonymous,' but we quickly discover that the sharks are having as hard a time being vegetarians as we do thinking that such a thing is even likely.

As for the highly praised CGI visuals, well, the Pixar folks have really outdone themselves. However, as CGI starts looking more and more `real' -one can no longer compare it to animation, but to actual photography. They have succeeded in entering a strange new paradox where CGI must now be compared to acutal underwater films, and in that regard, the visuals in `Finding Nemo' are not that impressive, as compared to a standard-issue Greet Barrier Reef documentary on the Discovery Channel. It's really good animation, but not nearly so good as the real McCoy.

In all the other Pixar films, where there are humans, they are usually shown in a positive light, like Andy from `Toy Story' and Boo from `Monster's Inc.' If there's a human villain, he's usually countered by a human who is kind, like the Andy/Sid dualism of `Toy Story.' But in `Finding Nemo,' we mainly see humans as either captors of poor, harmless fish or as catchers of poor, harmless fish. Casting aquarium hobbyists as villains is troubling, especially for a person like myself who has always enjoyed public and private aquariums, and has learned a great deal about our aquatic friends from such displays. It does not help showing fisherman as depriving fish of their civil rights, as though tuna and cod really are sentient beings. Is the catching, eating and displaying of fish truly a dark, sinister activity that we should avoid? It seems as if that is one of the messages of this particular film, one this reviewer does like at all.

However, I do agree that humans are certainly the greatest enemy to the oceans and to sea life, but it isn't aquarium hobbyists and fisherman who are the greatest threat, but corporate fishing fleets and industrial polluters. But the film has nothing to say or show concerning these two very real problems. Instead, humans in general are shown to be a vegetarian fish's greatest antagonist.

Aside from the `fish are friends, not food' message of the film, there is another, more important and more forthright theme, and that is a father's unconditional love for his son, even though the son deliberately rebelled against his father's overbearing protection. There is also a neat message about overcoming one's fears by plowing right into that which you fear, which sometimes is the best way to handle certain neuroses. But overall, the main messages of the film were diluted by the negative characterizations of humans and carnivores. Any film that causes you to feel guilt and shame for having enjoyed aquariums and seafood does deserve high marks.

Well, at least there was a sushi restaurant in ""Monster's Inc.,"" so perhaps there's some hope for the Pixar folks after all. As for this film, wonderful CGI visuals, mediocre story. Yes, it has heart, but not nearly enough.

My Rating: 4/10",
4 December 2008,It was totally Awesome and Thrilling,"The movie was totally cool and fun. Especially, Nemo was very cute among the fishes. The ocean was very beautiful and colorful. The fishes in the ocean are very beautiful. The fishes in the tank are also colorful. The story was the best story. Even, the plan to escape from the tank is dangerous but, it is awesome.The sharks in the movie were was same like in the real life. When, Marlin and Dory was stucked by an anglerfish. That scene is totally thrilling. Also, the fishes which make impressions is also cool. Even, the whale scene was also fun. In the last scene, when all the fishes are captured by a net, that time nemo tells a technique to escape from the net, that was totally superb. The students in the school are very beautiful. Even, the turtles were also same like in the real life. When, Marlin and Dory are stucked in a group of jellyfish, that scene was totally thrilling. When, Marlin and dory are swallowed by whale, that scene was also thrilling. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Finding Nemo"".

23 November 2003,A return to form for Disney,"While I wouldn't say 'Finding Nemo' outruns The Lion King (which got replaced by Nemo as most successful animated movie), it sure feels like Disney have found the right track of making movies after the lot of annoying movies in mid-90's to now. It's got humor, warmth, scenery, morals, just about what you expect and want from a good children's movie. Go see it with your children and have a good time.

12 June 2003,Piscatorial Panache,"Pixar has served up another platter full of treats in this marineland version of The Incredible Journey. This time it's an overprotective father looking for his fearless but missing son encountering all manner of wonders and wonderful sea creatures perfectly voiced by such top-notch personae as Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Albert Brooks, Willem Dafoe,Dame Edna, Eric Bana and Allison Janney. The underwater imagery is fantastically detailed and amazingly realistic. Pixar seems to do what few studios can, learn from what works and not be afraid to explore new digital territory in a laudible desire to be more realistic. This is the penultimate Pixar, the aquatic acme, the picean peak..dare I go on. In a clamshell, the movie is stunningly beautiful and appeals to all audiences, although I would have liked to see the movie sans-enfants..maybe I can find a 10:30 PM show? go, no RUN to see this film..you won't be sorry.

3 November 2004,"One of the most stunning, amazing animated films of our time!!!","Finding Nemo is one of the all-time animated feature i've ever seen, it should of gotten nominated for Best Picture and it was the best film of 2003!! It's one of the most visually, entertaining & classic animated films in years. Albert Brooks & Ellen Degeneres (especially) did their most & unforgettable performances of their career and had many memorable lines!! Others did excellent, Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) made a memorable Australain pelican and Gill (Willem Dafoe) did well, too. One of greatest animated films ever made and funniest. It's one of Pixar's best. It was like i said, the best film of 2003. Pixar are just unstoppable!!

1 December 2003,Pixar does what Disney can't,"Okay folks, I have seen all of the Pixar movies that have been produced for the Walt Disney Studios and I am confused. I remember the hullabaloo that Disney had created when Pixar wanted prominent billing for it's studios as well as a larger share of the profits from the Pixar animated features it produces for said Disney company. Is Disney nuts for actually getting upset? Pixar has made some of the most financially successful movies for Disney over the last 10 years and Disney is complaining because Pixar wants more visibility and more of the money from the movies they create?

Okay enough of the commentary. Finding Nemo was a visually stunning, well written, well cast movie in which you forget you are watching a fully CGI motion picture. The character movements were completely believable and the color treatment and lighting given to the undersea environments were truly unbelievable. Pixar has truly defined the art of CGI animation and they are on a par with ILM and WETA for their talents in computer animation. I read somewhere in a review for this movie that Pixar didn't take the craft to a new level in the making of this movie. I would disagree completely. The realistic underwater environments created in this motion picture are as good as any underwater adventure ever produced by Cousteau and company during the voayges of the Calypso back in the 60's and 70's. The murkiness of being underwater with these characters is I think Pixars greatest accomplishment. Watching this movie really makes you feel like you are underwater in the ocean. The CGI is so good in this movie that you don't realize it is even there. Anyone that downplays this movie is just looking at a reason to nit pick on Disney.",
5 June 2003,Not Perfect but Surely Entertaining,"Despite its sometimes sappy and cliché plot, this is a fun movie. Many of its jokes fall flat, incomprehensible to the child audience yet too immature for the adults. On the other hand, the many references to other movies (The Shining and Psycho) are hilariously fitting. The animation is often stunning, with all the creatures filled with vitality. What's cooler than the mysteries of the deep, and this film presents them charmingly. I laughed out loud one or two times, but I smiled a lot, and I didn't feel patronized (much) by the film's targetting of a youthful audience. Overall fun and entertaining. [7/10]

17 July 2004,Whats up with the missing or dead parent thing.,"Lets take a look. Finding nemo had no mother because she died. Toy story had no Father. Beauty and the beast had no mother. Simba (Kimba) lost his father. And yet there is no explination or coming to terms with the missing parents (I don't think Simba came to terms with anything). I disliked this movie because it seemed like the same old Disney rant of some one is in trouble and needs help cause they're lost. Guess I just like good animation with an excellent story. Story is a 1/10... animation is a 8/10... Have a good day. Yeah!. Fun! Watch Totoro instead. !

23 September 2003,Fun for the whole family,"The success continues from Toy story 1+2, to Monsters Inc to Finding Nemo, which is sure to be appealing to all ages from toddlers to grandparents!

Before the film started we were shown a 1989 Pixar animation, which was almost as humorous as ""For the birds"", For a 1989 animation I felt it was quite advanced. The Film has a wide range of humor aimed at the different ages of the audience. Young children will love the animation and reactions On the characters faces while adults will Laugh out loud at the more technical jokes.

Anyhow I enjoyed the film And its definitely the next DVD release to look out for. I wish Pixar the best in there Upcoming films. 10/10 Sea it now!!!

26 October 2003,"""I'm having fish tonight!""","Whoa! I couldn't even remembered the last time I laughed so hard like I did watching this film.

I must say, Disney has done its wonders again! Finding Nemo, in my own opinion, surpass every computer-generated animations. Although they are also Disney & Pixar's incredible works, Toy Story and A Bugs Life never gave me so much fun and excitement as Finding Nemo did.

and Dory? The best character ever! I LOVE THAT FISH!! from her short term memory loss to that ""whale talk"" she did, I was basically on the floor with laughter. The sharks, ""Marlin"", the seagulls - ""Mine, mine"", the whole aquarium gang, the ""little crab"", the turtles, ""Nemo"" combined with a terrific plot and incredible computer graphics and effects made this whole film one of the best Disney & Pixar's film. Worth your time and money. Lots of laughter - Guaranteed!

12 April 2004,What is all the fuss about?,"Honestly, I do not understand why so many people love this movie. I can normally watch a disney movie and enjoy myself, but this one simply did not entertain me. First of all, I noticed in Finding Nemo was that there were not any songs. most disney movies have parts where the charectors break into song, not in Finding Nemo. Secondly, I found some of the charectors quite annoying, especially the blue fish. Lastly, the worse thing about Finding Nemo is that so many people talk like it was the best kids movie ever made. Because of this i was expecting another entertaining, fun, and enjoyable kids movie, but instead i wasted an hour and a half of my life.

23 June 2003,"Bland, and somewhat scary","I found this to be the worst Pixar movie. From the first minutes, my 3 year old was terrified of the film, it didnt help that they started it off with a preview of the Pirates of the Carribean movie. The film was filmed with dark imagery and some scary moments, enough that after the first 15 or so minutes, my 3 year old was asking if we could go home now. The clown fish was annoying, not funny. Dory (think that was her name) had some great funny moments, but not enough to save Nemo. The highlight was the turtles and shark moments, but for the most part it is down to a very familiar pattern that is getting old. Pixar needs to bring back Lassiter or they will soon find themselves second-string compared to PDI/Dreamworks.

6 September 2015,"No matter how many times I watch it, I still adore Finding Nemo","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
9 June 2003,My Clothes were wet when I stepped out the theatre!!,"Marvellous, Marvellous. Bravo for our best animation of recent years. Finding Memo was a tough, tough feature film to make in terms of it's character constructions and underwater effects. I found that one of the unique thing about this film is that each fish(species) has a absolute mono personality, which pushed this animation into a higher level, and of course harder to make too. Thanks to our smart and hard working creaters. This film pushes animation industry to a position in which it should be by now, although the whole underwater scenery still look CG so to speak, but if we look back at toy story I, the fish are more real and people like. We have to accept that audiences are much more ""comfortable"" to see such a touching, funny, CG Feature Film. But I have to say that this is not the best a computer can do, this is just a milestone of animation industry, after N years, I'm sure that all the actors and actresses are retired and mousing themselves moving in front of a monitor.

19 June 2003,Another outstanding Pixar film! 10/10,"I'm 34 years old, and have had a fairly wide variety of film tastes over the years, but I am not ashamed to say that I realized recently that the group of Pixar films are among my very favorites. Such entertainment is rare in any film, and they have achieved that every time out so far- Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., and now with Finding Nemo. These are all movies you can see several times and always enjoy and find new things in.

Even moreso than other Pixar films, Nemo is a real visual treat, with the underwater world being beautifully rendered by the animators. But what really sets the Pixar movies apart from many other animated films is the strength of the writing. The visuals of an animated feature can be terrific in any film, but the story and the characters are what will make or break it. Finding Nemo, like the other Pixar films has a wealth of unique and engaging characters, a compelling storyline, and lots of humor and adventure. Andrew Stanton and John Lasseter and the others at Pixar should be given a lot of credit for being among the very best storytellers out there today.

Bravo!",10
14 June 2003,Maybe The Best Movie Ever!!!,"I thought it was better than Toy Story or Toy Story 2, and they were great. The animation was beautiful. The movie was like an emotional roller coaster. About every 10 minutes, the plot would cycle through scary, sad, then hilarious. Repeated over and over. I was scared several times, (this movie is too scary for children 5 or less I think). Then it would be sad, and I would cry a little (or get red-eyed), then while I had tears in my eyes, something hilarious would happen, and I would be laughing through the tears. I loved the happy ending, if only life could be happy endings also! The happy ending made me cry too. I think it was better than Bambi or Beauty and the Beast. Or the Lion King. I would like to see this movie about 10 more times (well, 5 anyway!!) It's philosophy is about Parenting, be sure to love your kids, you never know if something might separate you from them. And be nice to those with short-term memory loss, they are more helpful to have around than you might realize (like me!!) And give those who go to self-help groups (like AA) a chance to redeem themselves, because maybe they can change with your giving them a helping hand (or fin!)",10
24 October 2009,A Pixar Masterpiece,"Of Pixar's ongoing streak of CGI animated classics, I've always admired 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" the most. For a movie a about talking fish, sharks, pelicans, and turtles, it may be the most humane and endearing film of the last decade.

Like ""Up"", it opens with a tragedy: a shark devours Coral, the wife of Clownfish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), and all but one of their 400 eggs, leaving an overprotective Marlin to raise Nemo (Alexander Gould), who is handicapped by a short fin. When Nemo is captured by humans and placed in a fish tank, Marlin teams up with Dory (Ellen Degeneres), a regal tang, to rescue him.

""Finding Nemo"" does to the ocean what ""Up"" does to the air. The water becomes a vibrantly illustrated, fully developed setting. We see schools of fish, sunken ships, and powerful currents. 'Eye-candy' is an understatement, and the setting makes the adventure all the more thrilling.

In the fish tank scenes, ""Finding Nemo"" presents one of the most hilarious scenarios in recent memory as the captive fish, led by Gill (Willem Dafoe), scheme to escape back to the ocean. These scenes are clever, tense, and surprisingly involving. Meanwhile, Dory, suffering from a ""Memento""-like short-term memory condition, is as lovable as she is funny.

Laughs aside, Marlin's single-minded determination and Nemo's wonderful resilience really pull the audience into the story. ""Shark Tale,"" from the very next year, took place in a similar setting but saturated its story with generic characters and ill-conceived pop-culture references (unlike the brief and clever quips in ""Finding Nemo""). The fish looked like the celebrities voicing them, and the effect was vain and artificial. In ""Finding Nemo,"" the vocal performances by Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, and the other actors fit their roles perfectly, and as a result we forget about the actors and accept the characters. Children raised on ""Hannah Montana"" deserve films as straightforward and good-hearted as ""Finding Nemo.""",10
1 June 2003,"Fun but not funny, beautiful done but not memorable","Okay, I'll be the first to cast stones...

What a beautiful-looking piece of work. The animation, the colors, the movement -- it is all so beautifully accomplished. Bravo to Pixar for getting even the tiniest detail perfect.

BUT...it wasn't funny. It was mildly interesting, but dragged towards the middle. Even children around me were squirming and asking parents, ""Is it time to go home?""

There are too many ""false"" endings--when you think all is well and the constant string of perilous encounters are at an end. But, believe me, there is always ONE more.

There are no real laugh out-loud ""bits,"" no really funny lines, and Dorie just plain gets on your nerves after awhile.

And, no, I'm not an old grump. I just wasn't amused. Amazed at the technology of it all, but not amused.

Give me Toy Story or even Monsters Inc. This one fell flat.

Sorry.",7
30 May 2003,"10, TEN, ten!","Pixar continues its winning ways. The graphics are so good, the Ocean comes alive with creatures, undulating debris, bubbles, color and enough wonders to fill three films. And yet again, Pixar's staff remembers what Disney forgets: STORY, STORY, STORY. Cutesy animation is OK but can't make up for inane screenplays (Treasure Planet and Atlantis, the lost empire, for example). Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks and all the other voices do their jobs so well. What an adventure! By the way, this old man (60)who shared the theater with children of all ages. Surprisingly, once Finding Nemo started, no one chattered away and no cell phones rang; the only sounds emanating from the viewers were those of great satisfaction. There is one sad note: I can't buy the DVD yet! Darn. But wait, I can go see Finding Nemo again. AND I WILL!

For some strange reason, she didn't want to see Finding Nemo when it came to the theaters, so i said cool, i'll just buy the dvd when it comes out.....big mistake. I should have listened to my daughter. She hated it along with my 2 nieces, ages 3 & 4, and my nephew, age 5. The animation was beautiful but the story was.....well.....just BORING. About 30 minutes into the movie, they were ready to watch something else and frankly, so was I.

8 August 2015,"Cute, adventurous, and really for ""all ages""!","Finding Nemo is a cute, adventurous movie which not only is great for children but entertaining for the parents as well. Finding Nemo is also, surprisingly, quite educational , teaching the Australian East Coast is a subtle manner. There are many funny jokes put in for both children and adults, and the characters are very connected to their target audience (being families). A huge range of emotional depth is shown throughout the film, and Disney has cleverly written and animated this movie to twist what can be considered frightening scenes to be more appropriate for children. I think Finding Nemo is a must see for everyone!

Ellen was also amazing as a voice artist! She created a very memorable and iconic character.

5 August 2020,Swimming with Sharks is a Whale of a Time,"This is really where Pixar perfected what would become the ""Pixar formula"", and years later it holds up shockingly well. It's a simple story, almost like the Odyssey in reverse, but the characters are all so good and the emotions are all so solid it just stands up. You get a lead who's believably troubled but still likable, one of the best sidekicks in movie history, and a quest you can believe in with a consistently entertaining slew of obstacles that never go on long enough to get boring or stay so short you wish you had more. It's practically perfect. If I have any criticisms it's that the segment with the sharks goes on a bit too long and doesn't really matter in the end, but I'm really stretching their because it's still a good segment that everyone remembers. Other than that, I really can't criticize this movie.

31 May 2003,"Scariest Pixar yet, but way to fun to miss.","Going into this film I had some reservations how this would turn out.

>>How can they make it 5 in a row? >>The trailers were not overly enticing except for the animation.

>>I even thought Ellen DeGeneres would drag it down.

Boy was I wrong on all counts. One thing of note is this is easily the scariest of all their movies. Some scenes were either sad or very scary. But beyond all that, this is beautiful to look at. We all knew it would be of course. But what matters most is the story, and this one delivers. Ellen DeGeneres was hilarious and basically stole almost every scene. Great voices as usual and a warm, funny story yet again. The film was bright and colorful and beautiful visually and emotionally. Another homerun by Pixar. That's 5 for 5!

13 April 2007,Very good,"Film begins in not-so-happy mood. Like the classic ""Bambi"" it begins from a mother's death. A little fish called Nemo in the effect of a barracuda's attack looses his birth-giver (and 399 potential brothers and sisters). After this horrible experience Nemo's father - Marlin, became over-caring towards his son. But he won't be able to save his from the lurking dangers. That's because on the first day of his (underwater) school Nemo swims to the dangerous areas of the ocean and he gets caught by a diver and places in an aquarium. Desperate Marlin goes out on the search for his son...

His story about the double search of father and son, when you omit the naiveness, makes its character ""human-like"". Even the smallest fish under its paddles has its own soul.

23 August 2003,AWFUL!!! EVIL!!! and DUMB!!! (good for 3 month olds tho lol),"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not think it's ""cute"" or ""funny"". I think the humor is so incredibly lame it would be better if it was non-existant, the sidelines were unnecessary and completely dumb, and I am quite sure that this is the worst movie Disney has ever created (Pirates of the Caribbean being the best!!! I & 3 POTC!!!). Vegetarian sharks?!?!??? I'm a vegetarian, and I didn't even find that funny. Some ppl would get all offended, I don't care, I just think it's stupid & not funny. You are supposed to feel empathy for story characters, but I was kind of hoping to see Nemo become somebody's lunch. OK, joking about that, but there was only like one point in this movie that I actually found funny. I just highly recommend NEVER seeing this awful movie.

4 July 2003,Better Than It Had To Be,"Face it, they're Disney. They can turn out a completely unwatchable piece of tripe and it will still make money. And Pixar has completely earned the right to rest on its laurels. In these days where half-assed efforts are more the norm for studio pictures, it is refreshing to see that they actually got their backs into this one. It is funny, touching, visually stunning, and completely entertaining at every level. The voice talent is uniformly stunning, though it is Ellen DeGeneres who steps up a few classes and all but steals the movie as Dori, the fish with no short-term memory. Albert Brooks, it is to be hoped, will finally gain a small portion of the respect due him for this popular but uncompromised role. A must-see.

19 October 2003,Truly magic,"Let me begin by saying I don't buy into the idea that modern films can't compete with ""old classics"". People harking on like every film made 50 years ago was a classic. I beg to differ. This is the best animated film of all time. Better than all the old Disney ""classics"" people fawn over. Better than Toy Story. Better than The Lion King. This is the one animated film to rule them all.

""What do you want to watch tonight sweetheart? A scratchy old ""classic"" with poor animation and dodgy voice overs or a stunningly colourful array of top drawer animation complete with ace voice overs and a great soundtrack??""

3 November 2003,You won't mind taking the kids to see this.,"I will come right out and say that I absolutely loved this movie from the very beginning right to the last credit.

Finding Nemo is the story of a young clown fish called Nemo (Gould) who is stuggling for some independence from his over protective father Marlin (Brooks). When humans capture Nemo, Marlin begins his search of the Pacific Ocean accompanied by Dory (DeGeneres) to rescue his son.

The film's visuals are pretty much spectacular and what you would expect from the people who brought us Toy Story and Monsters Inc. The characters are engaging; capturing the idiosyncrasies of the creatures they are based on extremely well and is added too by the stellar work of the voice cast. Particularly Ellen DeGeneres, who brings to life the quirky Dory making her one of the most memorable Disney characters of all time.

The story is not over complex and for adults can be a bit predictable, there are a few lulls along the way, however these are normally the most emotive parts of the film. The script is fairly fast paced with some brilliantly sharp and witty humour that leads to some truly hilarious moments that scored several belly laughs from the adults in the audience.

All in all, Finding Nemo truly does build on the success of Disney/Pixar's previous films and once more establishes them in my mind as one of the best producers of family entertainment in recent years, managing so deftly to give their younger audience a bit more credit than other animators and making taking the kids to the cinema more than just an excuse for Dad to take a nap.

This is a delightfully sweet, moving and funny film that should appeal to children and adults in equal measure. Top marks!!",
8 May 2006,the BEST animated work by pixar as of yet!!!!,"this animated movie is a masterpiece and i have yet to find one person to say otherwise. i saw this movie twice: the first time was when it was one of the on flight movies on my virgin Atlantic flight to europe and then i saw again recently on the Disney channel. unfortunately, i don't have the DVD yet but as soon as i get the chance, i'm buying it.

marlin, a clown fish, loses his entire family to an attack by a predator. sadly, this includes a couple of hundred unhatched eggs. only one survives, which he names nemo. as a result to this incident, marlin starts to have a fear for the ocean and on his first day of school, nemo goes off alone and his caught by some fishermen and ends up in a fish tank in a dentist's office in sydney, Australia. despite his fear, marlin travels the ocean in search for his son. throughout his journey, he meets several unusual creatures and is confronted by many obstacles. close to the beginning, he meets with three sharks who want to quit eating fish and have the motto ""fish are friends not food."" he also meets another absent-minded fish named dory (voice of the always funny ellen degeneres). dory accompanies marlin throughout his entire journey creating a hilarious pair and many laughs. out of the many animated works by pixar this one is definitely the one to watch!",10
8 January 2019,Beautiful,"Finding Nemo is probably the best Pixar movie there is. The story is so beautiful and humorous, although some scenes may seem very frightening to children (or adults ;) The animation is brillant but in some moments you can clearly see that it was one of the earlier trys on that technology.

All in all you can say that the film is not only for kids, also for adults (like every Disney or Pixar production). Simply a beautiful Movie

9 August 2018,One of the best Pixar offerings,"Finding Nemo is a good movie and the fact that it takes place underwater which means a new color pallet for Pixar makes it even better. Seriously this film is gorgeous and just for the visuals alone it deserves a pat on the back but the story is equally heartening and the characters very relatable even though they are clownfish. This soaring and deeply moving sea adventure is unlike very few films out there. Check it out if you haven't yet.

15 June 2003,Finding More,"What can I say? It's much better than Toys Story (ok, ok, Toys Story's still nice, but sometimes I think they've pushed it too hard) It's much more heartwarming than Monster, Inc.

From the animation, the visual, the story and the humor, this one exceed them all. I think we indeed got a winner here. I sadly said that Ice Age also get beaten by this one.

Infact, you can find lots more than just a comedy or animated movie, but also the hidden message of love and friendship in not a cheesy style.

Finding Nemo is more than what a family movie suppose to be. It is indeed a treat! All time favorites show for all occasion. Kudos!

13 July 2004,"If I were a fish, I'd want to know Nemo.","I loved this guy and this movie. I think movies for kids are really aimed at adults, just like the old Porky Pig and Bugs Bunny cartoons weren't for the kids, but the adults. I wonder why that is, when most adults don't sit through half of them unless they have a toddler pulling on their pinky finger.

The thing I loved the most about this movie was the lessons it taught you about accepting people the way they are - they don't have to be all a like to be cool - and try your hardest even when you think there's not much chance of success. Against all odds, Nemo found his way back home and everyone lived happily after, and it was so much fun along the way seeing the different fish-people he met and got to love. He was so loveably naive and that made it give you heart pains that much more.

A great movie to see with your kids and talk about afterward. Lots of kids may not get the deeper lessons in it, but it'll still be great fun. I bought this one, and the kids have almost worn it out.",9
15 July 2022,Nemo,"It's really nice to make such quality films in those years. Nowadays, they can't make movies like this. It was a successful animated movie for me. A very good animated movie for 2003.

23 October 2003,Beautiful.,"I'm not going to say that this film is amazing in every way simply because it's not. But there is no denying that this film is beautiful. People have said that the underwater scenes are dull. Well the ocean is bound to be in some places. And those same people obviously have no clue how difficult and time consuming this kind of animation is. To get the light shimmering through the water and bouncing off the beautiful colours below is pure genius with God knows how many hours of work gone into it.

The film itself was brilliant. A fantastic mix of all humours with some very colourful characters. Yes it's for children but I find it a bit unreasonable to think that just because Pixar have included more adult material before, they shouldn't be allowed to go and do a straight forward kids movie. To be honest i found Marlon's incessant whining a bit hard to handle sometimes but when the audience is introduced to all the other characters then little things are easy to forget. I laughed constantly through any bit with the sea turtles, the fish tank crew were brilliantly characterised and the Fish Eaters Anonomous Sharks were very cleverly done, if underused. Overall another startling feather in Pixars ever growing cap.

And one last thing. If I read one more person saying that Shrek was a bold/daring/clever step for Pixar/Disney I'll scream. Yes it would have been bold/clever/daring of they had done it! Shrek is excellent but it was Dreamworks who did it! Not DISNEY!

Thankyou 10/10",10
20 October 2022,Still a great classic.,"If you've saw Monster Inc., or any Pixar's works that came before this, you got everything you did expect from those in this one. It is not as deep or incredibly thought-provoking, but it is still an entertaining addition to Pixar catalogue. The plot is good, the characters are charming, and it has fair amount of emotional moments that hits you in the feels. The chemistry between Marlin and Dory is fun to watch. However, the animation and the score are obviously the biggest point overall, especially in the underwater segment where the score slaps HARD and it gives that euphoric feel. Overall, there is nothing to nitpick here, it just has almost everything you want in a Pixar movie. Well, maybe aside from the sideplot that kinda felt weaker than the main one, or that just me.

28 January 2007,A very colorful film.SPOILERS,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",8
13 June 2003,Pixar's Best,"I've enjoyed all of Pixar's movies, but ""Finding Nemo"" was my favorite so far. Good story, with great dialouge, characters, vocal work and jokes. Among my favorites: the sharks (the twelve-step program was hilarious), Dory's ""whale talk"", the seagulls, the sea turtles (particularly Crush), the escape from the Angler Fish, and the final escape attempt by the aquarium fish (I'd love to know how they got out of those plastic bags). There were so many classic characters and moments in this picture... Personally, I think most adults will enjoy it as much (or more) as their kids.

6 February 2004,I can speak whale! Wwwwwwaaaaaaa,"I took this hot little viet girl to see this flick. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The story left none of the strings untied. They dotted all their I's, and crossed all their T's. It was a bite size story, and fun to watch. The animation was AMAZING. I mean that. AMAZING. This is one the kids will LOVE. See it in the theater, or buy it for home... but beware... BRUCE is a SCARY SHARK! He'll make you jump in your seat at least once.

1 September 2004,Finding Oneself,"I watched this movie because a friend of mine, whose taste in movies is good, recommended it to me. And she was right!

I consider this beautiful movie more of family genre, rather than a children movie. It's something enjoyable for the whole family -- with a simple yet nice story of the search of a father for his ""lost"" son, adorable characters (for example, the vegetarian Shark, whose ""na(i)me is Bruce"") and beautiful animation. Then there is the adorable Dory, whose efforts at helping Nemo's father to locate him is often jeopardized by her short-term memory loss. Also is there the smart surfer ""dude"" turtles, an exchange program that allows the young turtle to study with Nemo in his school, and the helpful pelican.

As someone living in a place where seagulls often fly overhead, and thrilled by their beauty and grace, I'm now forced to remember the sail and the ""mine"" ""mine"" scene, each time I see seagulls.

I love Dory (as everyone else does) when she forgets things, but I love her more when she pleads to be allowed to stay with Marlin, because she says, she feels as home when she's with him.

This movie is about love, affection, family values, and all things positive about us, and not just about a handful of fish.",
22 June 2003,A bit overrated,"Everyone has been raving about this movie and how I just have to take the kids. I should have followed my instincts & waited for video. It was too long & drawn out. It could have ended at least 20 minutes earlier than it did. Too many life & death chases. I almost fell asleep a few times, and I never fall asleep at the theater. Skip it.

2 September 2003,Beautiful and fun 9/10,"Yeah, I waited till the last minute to weigh in: everyone on earth has seen this already ;)

There are very few things not to like in Pixar's 4th movie. The undersea environment was spectacular. The fishy critters were all diverse and interesting and the humor was on par with the Toy Story line. Yeah, there was the whole Di$ney-parent curse where no main character can ever seem to have BOTH parents live to see credits, and I find the forced sympathy of a lost parent to be not only overused but a lame crutch for uncreative writers... but it really was fairly well played and I'll forgive it given the overwhelming number of good things that the movie offered.

The kids managed to sit through the whole thing (which is rare even for a Pixar movie) and laughed. I enjoyed every moment of it and rarely gave a second thought about it being animated except to admire the beauty of the scenes and to pick out occational Toy Story references. All the characters were interesting and well done.

I would have given the story a 10 but it fell just short of perfect in enough places for me to note. Several cliche-ish story twists, a bit of plot stumbling and a few scenes really sort of dragged on. Call it personal preferences or whatever, but hey: a 9 is a rare gem in this summer's wasteland of lackluster blockbusters.",9
4 July 2003,Good Fun!!,"To say this was a cool film would be an understatement. Everyone I have talked to likes SOMETHING in this film. My personal favorites are Crush and Dori. Both of these characters really made this a fun movie. It was so fun that I went TO THE THEATER 3 times to see it...in the first week!! That is something I just do not do on any kind of basis.

Tons of cool effects and, after seeing some of the fish these are based on, very accurate!! Some friends and I went to Rainforest Cafe and saw some of the fish that these characters are based on and WOW did they get them right!

Go see this!!

It's one of those movies you can just sit back and enjoy...and kinda shut your mind off and laugh at. Have fun with it...go with the waves...(pun fully intended)!

I just really liked it. I forgot it was computer animation midway thru the first half hour! Pixar really had fun with this one, and it shows...big time!

Go see it...I did!! :-)

4 June 2003,Great Animation! See it in Digital Projection!,"This was a great movie with beautiful scenery, incredible animation, and Pixar's unique brand of humor. I understand two of the writers of this movie were once writers for Conan O'Brien. The comedic exploitation of the characteristics of different fish species was brilliant. I'm a saltwater aquarium hobbyist myself, and found all the different fish traits in the movie quite funny. I especially liked the bit about the flounder not being able find the kids hiding from him on his other side (as flatfish have eyes on one side only). Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres fit their characters PERFECTLY. I can not picture anyone other than Brooks doing Marlon. The funniest thing in this movie has to be the seagulls. All they ever say is ""MINE!"".

The computer-generated scenery in Finding Nemo is breathtaking. Every shot is milked for all the visual splendor it is worth. The jellyfish scene was awesome. My only complaint is that Pixar, being on the leading edge of CGI animation, should try to make PEOPLE more realistic. It doesn't matter so much with cartoon fish, but if a small independent firm in New Zealand is capable of creating Gollum, then Pixar should be able to make some seriously photo-realistic people.

This is not exclusively a movie for kids only. It caters to all audiences, which I think every movie should do. There are even some references to other movies that only film buffs will pick up. My favorite was the ""Psycho"" reference whenever the Dentist's HORRIFYING niece showed up. And then there's Bruce the Shark (a Jaws reference) smashing through a wall yelling ""Here's Brucey"" with the splintered wood framing him exactly as it did Jack Nicholson in The Shining.

Finding Nemo is the best animation I've seen in a long time. You HAVE to see this on a DLP projector, it's worth going a few minutes out of your way to see it at a theater that has one. The colors are strikingly brilliant and the picture is crystal-clear. Finding Nemo was created digitally, and should thus be seen in it's native digital format.

I give Finding Nemo a 9 out of 10.",
23 December 2003,Impossible not to love it!!,"The story itself is rather simple, but both the humor and the graphical presentation of ""Finding Nemo"" make it implossible not to simply love it!

From a ""nerd"" kind of perspective I'm really amazed about the way they captured the fluid dynamics in this film: trying to model flowing and streaming water is virtually impossible and yet the waves and the flow of the ocean, streams etc. etc. are represented life-like!

A different angle of reviewing the movie is not looking at the technical highlights, but at the way the different characters are developed. Whether it be fish, whales, shrimp, sea-gulls and turtles (""You've got a serious thrill issue, dude!"") they are all depicted in a unique way. But also in a way that allows us to related to them: they've been brought down to the stereo-types we are inclined to see them as.

Ofcourse, if a movie wants to appeal to a large audience, it cannot be focussed only on graphical superbness, or only on the funniest characters you've ever seen. But to combine all these qualities in a film, without selling any of them short in the way that is done in Finding Nemo, will be hard to beat in the year(s) to come!",9

22 July 2003,Good Family Movie,"Nemo is the only child of an overprotective father clownfish Marlin. Nemo has a disability with one of his fins, but doesn't let that hold him back from trying to be brave (which ends up getting him captured). However the real story is with Marlin and a comical, forgetful fish, named Dory. Their adventure together helps bond two very different types of people and they meet many different creatures along the way. It shows the love a father and son can have for each other despite arguements. It also goes to show the lives of fish in a dentist's office... they don't like being in the tank.

9 June 2003,"Very cute movie, great even for adults","Well, this is another hit from Pixar. I did not think anything could top Monsters, Inc. but this movie certainly did. The thing that really made this movie great was the incredible animation and beautiful scenery in which it is set. Some of the other Pixar movies did not have this advantage.

The plot is mature enough for adults with humor that only they would get. But it is cute enough to hold the attention of youngsters also. Although, I would say that very young children would probably not be best suited for this movie. It is very fast paced and deals with a subject that could be scary to a kid. Just image being 3 and seeing a movie in which a kid has no mother and is taken away from his father. Then the father is chased by sharks, and while the sharks were cute and rather humorous, they could still scare little kids. Many of the very young children in the theater were crying and screaming at various parts. Maybe children under 5 or 6 should wait till video to see this so it isn't so loud and overwhelming.

Other than that, I loved it! I am 22 and saw it with my 46 year mom and we thought it was wonderful. You are never too old for these movies!",10
11 August 2016,My review for Finding Nemo,"Well, for starters, I did see some of it when I was little but never fully watched the movie before now. I finally watched it to get prepared for the new movie. So what did I think of the first one? It was fun watching the father trying to save his son with the help of Dory and seeing the son trying to escape his situation with other fishes.

The funniest character is Dory, with her short term memory loss.

As for the animation, it still holds up pretty well, but I can still notice a few things about it due to its age. It still looks good, though.

What else is there to say? It was a great, fun movie; definitely something everyone should watch.

29 November 2003,Beautiful made and entertaining,"As animation films mostly are entertaining, this movie is nothing more or nothing less. First of all I wanna say that I didn't watch an animation film in 10 years... I didn't go to the theatre with much expectations, but I was kinda surprised, the movie made me laugh, and it kept me watching until the end. I can't say this movie was great though, I was satisfied when I left, because it gave me a happy feeling. I rate it 8/10 because it entertained me the whole time. It certainly has some messages, but the movie is too cute to be marked in your mind forever, highly entertaining but it's far from a ""strong"" movie.

13 July 2003,Never thought I'd recommend a Disney movie...,"but here I am so grab shell, dude, 'cause I'm giving this film 9 out of 10.

This was one of the best movies I've seen in several years (even glossing over the fact that 90% of the most recent movies have been schlock, that's still saying something)! This movie was terrific! Take your sweetie. Take the kids. Heck, go alone! See this movie! It is hysterical. There are one-liners you'll find yourself quoting afterwards. ""What is it with men and asking directions?"" Christopher Columbus didn't need directions and neither do I! That's what GPS is for. (-;

It's got a cute story (see the plot summaries), good characterization, good acting, good writing... the only minor deficiency was that Marlin and Dory tended to get a little annoying after a while. It was in-character, it was just an annoying aspect of their characters.

Whatever. See this movie. Rent it. Heck, BUY it! I plan to. And no hurling on the shell, OK... I just waxed it.",9
13 October 2003,Not as good as Monsters Inc.,"Very good film, great animation blah blah blah, just missing the great comedy and imagination that was found in Monsters Inc/toy story et al.

The film fell into cliche's. Ellen was great as Dory and I loved the seagulls and there are a few great comedy moments. Story is basic but effective... I guess i was just spoilt by monsters and wanted more of the same, but without greats such as John Goodman and Billy Crystal, I just felt this was a little bit flat.

9 August 2003,"Good movie, great laughs, but formulatic.","There is no doubt in my mind that Pixar is a great movie-making company. There is no doubt that it's newest installment is technically brilliant. There is no doubt that Dory represents one of the funniest characters in Pixar's very assorted collection. But there is some worry, on my part, that Pixar has been hammering home the same basic plot into us for the past eight years. In Toy Story, it's about Buzz being lost and meeting new friends. In the seccond Toy Story, It's about Woody being lost and meeting new friends. In A Bug's life, it's about Flick being lost and meeting new friends. In Monsters, Inc...well, you get the picture. All of them, all of them are good films. Very funny, and very enjoyable.

This film is no exception. Go whether you have kids or not. Rent the DVD whether you have kids or not. If you have kids, buy the DVD as a Christmas present. It will be a real treat. But I hope I am not the only person who will be relieved when there is a change of pace. Perhaps the Incredibles will be what I am looking for, and will convince me that Pixar's success is not merely due to the same basic plot.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",5
20 February 2018,There's No Surprise This Won an Oscar,"This movie is an absolute joy to watch. You'll have difficulty deciding which character you liked the most because they're all so relatable in their own way. Pixar is the best and this movie proves it. Felt very original and was a wicked adventure story with a lot of laughs and insightful moments along the way.

18 November 2003,Well animated pablum,"I watched the DVD and finished the film with a very flat feeling. Pieces of the film were amusing, the animation was very good, but, in the end, there was nothing to really like.

DeGeneres's character (Blue?), was a staple sidekick character whose only noticeable character trait was a poor short (and occasionally long term, as the plot required) memory, which did absolutely nothing for the story and was about as uninteresting as Nemo's stunted ""lucky fin"".

Not an awful film and I am sure that young children will be amused by it as they will be by almost anything animated) but anyone over the age of about 7 or 8 should leave it alone.

Great story, great script, great animation, just simply amazing! You will feel happy, sad, excited, scared, ---isnt this what a movie supposed to do? Thanks pixar for showing hollywood and all other garbage directors (see movies i just mentioned) how to make a flick!

15 July 2003,Disappointing,"While the animation was still great and there were some funny scenes, the whole premise of the movie was disappointing. The movie was very sad and too scary for children in my honest opinion. The father was too overprotective and paranoid. While he had good reason to be I thought it was sad the extreme lengths he had to go to in order to live a little and let Nemo do so as well. If you go to this movie do not go expecting a fun children's movie, but rather a sad tale that is not likely to put a smile on your face.

24 July 2010,Pixar does it again!,"Without a doubt Pixar has become a brand for quality. Every single time you pay your way into a Pixar film you know you're getting your money's worth and Finding Nemo is no exception. She wasn't as good as Toy Story 2 but that doesn't mean it wasn't loads of fun which it was and more but you can say with no doubt that it's the most coolest and most amazing of the Pixar masterpieces.

The look of the movie is breathtaking and i found myself just sitting there staring with my mouth open when i Say all the little things that were so perfectly done and it's just amazing to see a movie that was really worked on until they had a near perfect product. I mean every aspect of the sea is in there the details are fantastic. She is also packed with Hilarious excitement, Characters and intelligent humor. That's Pixar for you! The story is the only thing that isn't perfect and is the movies only flaw. It's the typical Disney-story were family plays a part and a obvious message is being sent to children and maybe to some adults also i felt it needed more fun extra characters to fill in because I felt some of the scenes were quickly forgotten. But even with some obvious flaws it doesn't stop you to have a lot of fun. She's warm, funny, exiting at times and full of entertainment. Only if the Disney films would be this good.

24 April 2011,"Clever, Funny, A Stroke Of Genius From Pixar!!","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia.

23 August 2003,computer animation at it's best!,"Why does it seem like everything Pixar touches turns to gold?

The animation is incredible. With the exception of every fish having ""human"" eyes, I'd swear I was watching the Discovery Channel.

This movie is nothing but fun. I do agree that very young children may be frightened by some of the more menacing fish (and there are some very menacing fish) but this movie has something for everyone.

Mainly it's the heartwarming story of family and how parents and children learn to see things from each other's perspective.

There is also alot of humor in this flick. I walked out with my stomach aching from laughing so much.

The best looking scene would have to be the school of Jellyfish. The animation is dead-on realistic.

One of the best family films i've seen in years.",
26 January 2004,Cute and will sell toys,"A cute movie, but I'm surprised at some of the compliments lavished on it. It didn't seem very original and was inferior to ""Shrek"" for example, which was a very enjoyable (sort of an ice-breaker) animated film. Not to mention more honestly fantasical stirring stuff like ""Spirited Away"" for that matter.

""Finding Nemo"" also wasn't particularly funny since it's main joke of making fun of someone with short term memory loss grew tired quickly.

I'll admit I was touched when the cute Nemo got reunited with his Dad (of course!), but some aspect of the movie had an overly (to me) manufactured sense to it. But this is just imo of course, and I'm probably a bit biased since (before watching the movie) I saw the enormous amount and variation of nifty Nemo merchandise with the necessary huge cast of marine creatures. The sea's the limit.

16 June 2005,One heck of a movie,"This movie is great for the whole family. I first watched it when I was 15, and my parents watched it, and we all thought it was great. The little 6 and 3 year old I babysit also loved it.

The movie has several funny parts even in just the first 5 minutes of the movie. Of course, the movie only gets funnier when Dory arrives. If you have a ""thing"" against Ellen DeGeneres, you might as well not watch this movie, because her character (Dory) really ties the movie together, and definitely adds the most humorous parts, including my favorite: ""I shall call him squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my squishy"".

The movie goes from Happy to Sad, back to Happy, and of course in between everything, Outrageously Funny.

Overall, I never would have thought a movie whose star character is a deformed fish, with supporting roles from an ""obnoxious"" fish, an H2O intolerant Sea Horse, and a fish who can hardly remember her own name, could be so good, but it certainly was! =)",8
21 June 2003,If it weren't for the animation this would be a bomb!,"The charmless aquatic remake of Bambie is nowhere near the previous Pixar productions (Monsters Inc. and the Toy Story movies) and completely void of humor. How appealing to children (or adults for that matter) is the following plot line: Mother and children die leaving father to raise a handicapped son alone against the dangerous (sea)world. Handicapped son get taken by evil human who is going to give him to his spoiled & irresponsible niece (think Sid in Toy Story) to which he will surely be dead in a matter of hours. Father and amnesic new friend fight off villain after villain to retrieve handicapped son from his impending demise.

Ridiculously overly suspenseful for a child below 10. Repetitive and unfunny for adults. What does that leave? A major disappointment. BOO!

5 April 2020,Memory of a Goldfish never been so accurate,"Finding Nemo is truly a brilliant film. And it is so for many reasons.

The story of Finding Nemo is Pixar's simplest by this point. A fish, Nemo, goes missing and his father, Marlin, has to cross the ocean looking for him. It isn't this concept that makes Finding Nemo great, it is how they tell the story. Fish are honestly not something I have ever sympathised with. This film made me feel genuine disappointment and upset for Marlin, which was a surprising feeling.

The characters we meet on this journey are really fun. They have fully realised, complex personalities. They are not just a set of one-note character traits. Humour in children's movies was usually traditional with slapstick and very blunt gimmicks. And Finding Nemo has moments of this. However, large sections of comedic portions in this movie is funny due to actual situational jokes the characters make. Comedic timing is as close to perfection as I've ever seen in an animated movie. And Finding Nemo should be applauded for that.

The ending of Finding Nemo actually made me kind of emotional. Sounds crazy I know. We are watching the struggles of animated fish. But yeah it is what it is.

Brilliant movie. Loved all of it. Would watch it over and over.",9
12 October 2003,Four out of four,"Not my mark but its position among Pixar films. Lacking the invention of

Monsters Inc and the strong characterisation of the Toy Story films, I found

Finding Nemo slightly disappointing.

I'm sure children will love it, but despite some visually beautiful scenes

(especially the jelly fish) I don't think there's much here for the older viewer.

Not a bad film exactly (I gave it 7) but not up to the standard of the other three.

27 September 2005,This is amazing!!!,"Now here's a movie that is simply fantastic to watch. The underwater animation is amazing, the story warm and definitely human. You'd love to be in this world for ever!!! The characters are well defined and are very recognizable. The 'family' concepts of upbringing, love and devotion are definitely the strong points of this movie. Though my daughter (she's only 2!) does not understand a word, she loves each and every scene in this movie!! The only thing my daughter did not like about this movie was perhaps the fact that Nemo did not have a mother. We made her think Dori and Marlyn are Nemo's father and mother! My wife, though she hates animation was speechless when she saw this!! Amazing movie...I'd say this is the best animated movie ever made!!!

13 June 2003,Pixar does it again !,"I have seen every Pixar film up to now, and I am 46 years old and a grand-father. Finding Nemo is just another fine family film, that had more adults laughing than children. Thats what is really so special about this film is that is has the great computer animation, and vivid colors, and cute voices thar are so appealing to the little ones. But it also has comedy and one-liners that maybe, just the adults or older kids pick up on. The comments of a blue fish, with short term memory loss are hilarious. Every Pixar film seems to be better than the previous, but each one of them endears itself to you in a way that you can't say one of them is your favorite. This film, if not my favorite would rank in the top 3.

2 June 2003,"Not Monsters, Inc., but still enjoyable","I took my 2 kids to see Finding Nemo this morning. As Bruce Almighty would say, it looked B-E-A-utiful. Unfortunately, the storyline was not up to par with Pixar's previous efforts, and I thought the funny was few and far between (that's right, I said 'the funny'). I enjoyed Albert Brooks, who always gives a stellar performance, as well as Ellen DeGeneres. Brad Garrett using his Robert Barone voice as the blowfish was a great choice, but unfortunately there was too little of the witty action that you normally see in Pixar movies, and instead there's quite a bit of the tense action that you usually see in a Jurassic Park movie instead of a Pixar animation. I would rate this movie as being better than A Bug's Life, which I didn't care for, but not as good as either Toy Story 1/2 or Monsters, Inc. The teaser for Pixar's next movie and the animated short before the main feature were both great tho, and when all was said and done, I'm still not sorry that I went to see it. My 9 year old daughter didn't care much for it, but my almost 3-year old son liked it quite a bit. In the end, I would say to see it, if nothing else but for the incredible animation that is definitely a benchmark for pure CG movies (excepting Final Fantasy, but I don't hold that in the same category with Pixar or Dreamworks films). Enjoy it for what it is and you'll be fine.",7
3 June 2003,Not as good as it should have been,"This is not Monsters Inc. and, of course, not Shrek (by DreamWorks). Animation is excellent and leaves nothing to complain about, but the story is not that good. It feels very disjointed and fragmentary, you don't really feel the flow (despite it being set in the ocean). Often it is too predictable (I know, it's not a thriller, but still you can make it somewhat original and surprising sometimes) and during some moments even boring. There is not really much for adults in this film (like there was in Shrek), except for quite funny Memento-like Dora with her short-term memory loss, a couple forced semi-funny jokes, like ""what's with men asking for direction"" and supposedly funny ""totally cool"" turtle ""dude"".

I recommend renting it on DVD or cassette just to see the eye-candy (even a cam version would be enough) and that's all. It's not that special.

15 October 2003,More of an adventure than a comedy,"Took my nine-year-old son to this. I nearly fell asleep during it, so I was curious as to his opinion. Grudgingly, he said it was ""OK"".

The animation was, as ever, fantastic - more so the backgrounds than the main characters (fish are not that expressive) - but the story lacked the lightness of touch and invention of other Pixar titles; some of the jokes were, I felt, a bit laboured (vegetarian sharks?)

Quite tense and exciting in places but I only laughed once and my son not at all.

25 November 2012,Amazing after 9 years,"It's 2012 now and I just saw this movie for the first time. The 3D release caught my attention and reminded me of this little gem I'd heard so much about.

I did NOT see the 3D version, just the usual one. I was expecting it to be relatively poorly animated compared to today's standards but boy was I mistaken! This is the most beautiful animation movie I have seen so far. Each scene is colorful and breathtaking, which completely blew me away. Animation is excellent to the smallest detail and now I very much doubt that having been made today it would be more beautiful.

As far as the plot goes, I can't help but compare it to the last few animation movies seen: Brave, which I truly disliked; and Madagascar 3, which was better and funnier than expected. But Finding Nemo is way better than any of these and I daresay it's my favorite animation film.

I especially admire the ingenious solutions found for different parts of the movie ingenious, since as a viewer you might see some difficulties as impossible to overcome by some little fishies.

I like how the characters have unique personalities and all are essentially good. The 'bad' guys are mostly voiceless (mindless) but this does not stop the movie from keeping you on your toes.

All in all, a beautiful experience, a smart plot and nice individual characters you'll find yourself rooting for. A high quality animation that still looks amazing today. Go (re)watch it.",10
25 October 2006,BEST Disney MOVIE!,"I believe this an amazing movie. Not only did this movie have a long process, it was worth it. There are many animated films, but I believe this one to be the best.

The animated graphics of this movie are so good. This movie had 4 different layers of animation. The quality of the graphics is so admirable that it was being produced for six years! When you are watching this movie, you don't even notice that the graphics are marvelous because your mind is set on the wonderful plot.

If you are looking for a movie with a great plot and tremendous graphics, then this is the family movie you are looking for. This movie is excellent for all ages.

Never has been the diverse marine life rendered so perfectly in an animation picture that it is a marvel just to watch, despite its formulaic and predictable plot. It is interesting seeing how Pixar has blurred the line of animation and live action but still cannot upgrade from its pedestrian storytelling. Regardless, good children's entertainment are hard to find and this one stands out well above the rest. 8/10.

22 June 2003,This is the only movie that you should find.,"FINDING NEMO-**** Well we arent suprised to find another animated hit from the movie genuises over at Pixar Studies who brought us other movie such as a ""Bugs Life"" and the ""Monsters INC"". Nemo(Alexander Gould) is a clown fish who wants his dad Marlin ( Albert Brooks) to finally trust him. Nemo goes to school for the first time and is embrassed by his father and is captured by an Austrialian dentist. Marlin comes across another fish named Dory( Ellen DeGeneres) who has a short-term memory loss. The two of them come across very adventrous and humorous characters such as surfing turtles, a shark named Bruce who is on a twelve step program to stop eating fish, and other fish that have the need to express themselves through a games of shraides. Meanwhile, Nemo is being held in a dentist office in Sdyney, Austrialia. He mates with other fish who are very desperate for an escape from the office back into the ocean. I liked this movie because of the jokes which always seem to be deliver to make me breakout laughing and also the vivid characters and how they seemed to design the ocean beyond our eyes.

12 June 2019,What A Wonderful Movie,"This movie is great for kids and adults alike, and I really enjoyed it as much as Cars. It is a perfect example of combining humor and drama, while also enjoying the voice acting, especially from Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks, and Ellen DeGeneres, and the movie's animation is spectacular!

Kids can relate to Nemo, with adults having the ability to relate to Marlin. I love the soundtrack, the side characters, and hilarity from Dory and the sea turtles. However, I despise Darla for trying to hurt Nemo, and the barracuda for ruining Marlin's life as a happy father! Aside from that, the whale talk scene is funny, and it's amazing how much money it got in theaters. The humor overall is also hilarious, and I like the idea of a movie set underwater in Australia. The morals prove that even family movies don't have to just have morals for kids, who get invested to the interesting plot. I love how lifelike the water looks, and the fish impressions are always humorous, and it plays like a big adventure. For those of you who want to check out the sequel, you guys should really have to give it a try.

The paranoid voice of fatherly Albert Brooks and his son's Nemo got on my nerves after a while. The actor's voices of 2nd'ary characters were hard to recognise; too bad. Not as good as ICE AGE or Lilo & Stitch due to too much yaking and not enough caring for the characters.

8 February 2004,It's OK,"Being a big fan of Pixar, I was slightly disappointed by the quality of Finding Nemo. It doesn't come near to the knowing humour of the Toy Story movies, opting rather for the more 'seen it all before' Shining jokes and others. Those sea turtles seemed so funny in the trailer, yet in the film, they get very annoying very easily.

Thats not to say there isn't anything good in this film. The man-ray teacher was definitely my favourite character, there was just something funny about the way he sang. The Ocean's 11 style escape plan was great, as were the seagulls, who reminded me a lot of the dodo's in Ice Age.

The problem Finding Nemo suffers from is that it's just too Disneyfied, a trap A Bug's Life fell into. So while it is better than the insect take on Pixar, it doesn't match the fun of Monster's Inc or the Toy Story masterpieces.

Roll on The Incredibles.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
9 October 2003,Pixar plumbs new depths of excellence !,"Ofen reality never lives up to hype and expectation but Finding Nemo delivers in every respect. After Bugs Life, I doubted that animation could improve much and while Monsters Inc made hairs seem interesting, Nemo seems to move the goal posts so far away, I think it will be a long time before it is matched. The story is strong, the voice characterisations are just perfect with Ellen DeGeneres standing out as the Oscar winning performance and the underwater animation is simply breathtaking. I would defy anyone not to get something from this film and if ever computers needed justification for their existence, this one film provides just that. I guess one day, Pixar may produce a lemon, but on the basis of their track record so far, even a Pixar lemon will by sharper than anything else out there.

22 October 2006,Highly overrated,"Okay, I admit, this wasn't really a god-awful film - on the contrary - it's passable and somewhat good entertainment - for _young_ children that is. To a person who really loves animation, such as me, this was a huge disappointment.

I can't understand what happened at Pixar. Films like ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bug's Life"" were truly original and delightful movies to enjoy. But Finding Nemo?! Let's see. ""How about we make a adventurous comedy about sea-creatures - I bet nobody has done that previously!"" Yeah, riiight. And the so called ""comedy"".. It suffocated to death like a fish on dry land (ehhheheheheheh) when they desperately tried to force laughs out of the audience with idiotic and worn-out jokes we've heard countless of times before. I think that I managed to smile during the film - or the 100 minutes ordeal - not even once. I guess they saved all their fireworks for ""The Incredibles"" which really WAS an incredible movie (I apologize for my poor pun).

Finding Nemo is not the worst animation movie at all, but for a Pixar movie, it's an embarrassment. But it is, if nothing else, joy for the eyes, although not to be recommended to anyone over the age of six.",3
30 December 2003,Splendid animation,"but, a storyline that is a little bit too thin to carry the movie all the way. Yeah, it's a movie for children and they certainly don't care, but since it's computer animated, it also appeals to the ""older"" moviegoer. There are some nice, clever jokes in the movie. An australian shark named ""Bruce"" - Jehova, I say!

However, let it be said that this movie - however successful it is and will surely get it's academy award - is not really worthy to be amongst the 250 top movies of all time. Not bad, but really not great either...

19 June 2003,Good Family Entertainment,"ever since I was a kid, I have loved fish. When i first saw the previews, I hasn't thrilled about seeing it, but when I saw it, I was glad that I did. Dory was hilarious and the charecters where very creative as well. And the underwater shots were beautiful. Really good film that the entire family can enjoy.

Although I did think it should have been PG for scary situations and maybe mild thematic elements.

Awesome!! 8.5/10 stars

5 December 2003,One of the Most Quotable Movies Ever,"-Mine? -Mine? -Mine?

Honestly, who hasn't heard around quotes from this movie. It's cute, it's visually impressing, and it has a plot that, in its basics, has been done dozens of times before. So why is this now one of my ""Top 10"" movies ever? I myself find it hard to explain it.

I'm not much of a Disney fan. I loved ""Dumbo"" as a child. I found ""Beauty and the Beast"" endearing and smart. I enjoyed Pixar's ""Toy Story"" and even more ""Toy Story 2"". And that was it. But ""Finding Nemo"" is more.

Finding Nemo is, to put it in simple terms, a beautiful movie.

Everything works to perfection: the scenes, the music, the colours, the voices, the relationships between characters, and oh those quotes! Who could beat ""I'll call him Squishy, and he shall be mine, and he shall be my Squishy""? It's funny and at the same time tender.

I found myself caring more about Marlin, Dory, Gill, Nemo and Nigel than I've done by almost any other character -real or animated- this year. The script is flawless: ""It's there, I know it is, because when I look at you, I can feel it. And... and I look at you, and I... and I am home! Please... I don't want that to go away."" Honestly, what movie this year has had something like that?

Disney has a reputation for pushing the ""easy"" sentimentality buttons of people back in the 50s and 60s. It did work. We have become a lot more cynical as a people in the 90s and now. But Nemo manages to push our ""hard"" sentimentality buttons. I love it not just because it's funny and pretty to look at, but because it made me care. It created a world far, far away from our cynicism and for some minutes that magic I felt as a child came back.

Yes, Nemo deserves to be in my Top 10 ever. Thank you, Pixar.",10
22 June 2003,Not Pixar's best,"For once I find myself in a minority. For once, I was expecting

more. For once, I am undecided about getting the DVD of a Pixar

film.

Description of characters and plot points are plentiful in other

reviews, so I'll cut to the chase:

The general idea was good, execution was decent, but too much

went wrong. Dory and her lack of short-term memory (how does

she remember she has that problem?) were more annoying than

endearing. Jar-Jar Binks provided more comic relief. I had more

fun with the tank residents speaking dentistry-ese with the pelican.

I never quite ""got"" Nemo's disability (if indeed there was

something to ""get""). The only purpose I saw in it was to give Marlin

an extra excuse for being overprotective - what, having your wife

and all your other children killed isn't enough? - and to give Nemo

a kinship with Gill. I am not acquainted with Albert Brooks enough

to compare his fish character with humans he played. But to be the

character that Marlin is, given that they are very small fish and there

are very big things out there with very pointy teeth I can't blame him

too much. (Then again, overprotective parents have been around

forever as movie devices.) Willem Dafoe did an excellent job as

Gill.

I expected to see more of the sharks, especially given the line a

shark says in the trailer that he doesn't in the movie. I wanted to

see more of the sharks, lots more. But I did like that whole chase

sequence sparked by the whiff of blood.

And after all those scenes with the turtles, sounding like they were

straight out of the late '80s/early '90s, I was extremely disappointed

to not hear a ""Cowabunga!"" or even a slight ""Teenage Mutant Ninja

Turtles"" reference. (Four young turtles could've had eyes in the

four TMNT colors, for example.) Pixar never seems to miss a shot

at a movie reference, this one fell in their lap, and the pun was

ignored. The other movie references that were included,

especially ""Psycho"" and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" were

great, and I did get a kick out of the shark being named ""Bruce"" (cf.

""Jaws"").

Finally, the seagulls were absolutely hilarious. I wish there had

been a way to give them more screen time, because those scenes

were of the Pixar we know and love.

The animation and supporting characters carry this movie more

than the plot, and I'm disappointed that Pixar spent so much time

on the former while seeming to have problems with the latter.

6/10: It's not necessarily ""Swim away! Swim away!"" but not ""I've got

to find Nemo!"" either.

PS: I recently read a newspaper article that was half-devoted to

pointing out that ""Nemo"" was the name of the captain in ""20,000

Leagues Under the Sea."" If this needs to be pointedly discussed,

something's not quite right with the world.",
26 June 2003,Where's the music?,"Being a fan of Pixar, I saw Finding Nemo on opening day, surrounded by a host of individuals whose years are mere fractions of my age. Regardless, I was memorized by the film visually, I thought the emotional depth was well beyond what many past animation films have gone for, and I thought that it was one of the most entertaining films of any kind produced in recent years. My only problem? The music. It is not the score was particularly bad. In fact, it was quite engrossing, but what I have come to expect from animation films is a type of sing-along, the modern American musical, and I thought that that was sorely missed. Many will scoff at my request for this type of music in Nemo, believing that it would demeaning for such a good film. But music does not lower the artistic level of such a film, indeed, for a film with this specific audience, songs can be the best way to bring individuals into the story and raise audience involvement. I believe that a more traditonal animation soundtrack would have greatly increased the effectiveness and longevity of Finding Nemo.

2 July 2007,"Slightly Overrated, but Still Delightful","When Finding Nemo came out in theaters, I was nine years old and I instantly fell in love with it, alongside my friends and family.

Four years later, I've either become cynical, or I've sobered up slightly. Looking back, I find some strong and weak points in Nemo, but I'll start with the dominant good points.

1)Humor. This is undoubtedly the funniest movie Disney has created ( with the exception of maybe Toy Story). Dory's character is ingenious and draws viewers in with her innocent humor, never coming off as cheesy,awkward or inappropriate. Even characters who are not meant to provide comic relief have their own uproarious moments.

2) Animation. While I'm slightly bitter over Disney's switch to computer animation, this movie defied my mind. The under sea landscaping was gorgeous. The characters had beautifully done figures that still retained a cartoony quality.

3)Characters. All characters have nice forms, and are relevant to the plot. Their personalities are 3 dimensional and make them seem lifelike.

4) Script. It perfectly blends humor, drama and action to make the movie deeper.

Now here's for my down factors.

5)Music!Music!Music! My biggest grudge over Pixar is their neglect of the songs that made Disney so timeless!If the movie had a few decent songs, perhaps I would believe it deserves all its awards and praise.

But, evidently, the good outweighs the bad. So I decide the movie is fun and entertaining but needs just another sprinkle of Disney's magic dust.",6
30 May 2003,Fabulous!,"I saw Finding Nemo, expecting a mediocre ""cute"" film. But it was anything but that. It was remarkable. The beginning scenes made me cry. There were some really funny scenes too, like when Dori spoke Whale. But anyways, go see it, it is SO worth it.

31 May 2003,How Sweet Is This Film?,"""Finding Nemo"" is beyond charming and incredibly sweet. So sweet, in fact, that the worst I can say about it is that parts left me with a toothache.

The film begins in melodramatic, ""Bambi"" style with the tragic deaths of Coral and 399 of her eggs, leaving only her husband, Marlin, and their sole surviving son, Nemo (FYI: Nemo is Latin for 'no one'). As a result, Marlin is very over-protective of Nemo; driving him (Nemo) to disobey his father, swimming out into open water, where he is captured by divers (""Do they think they own the ocean?"" ""They must be American!""). From there, the story diverges, following Nemo's life in a dentist office tank and Marlin's frantic search for his son. The ensuing adventures are tender, funny, entertaining, and occasionally frightening. Although predictable, the story's resolution is the cherry on top of this delightful sundae.

Worth special mention is the film's amazing animation. No other animated film has yet captured water's beauty in the way this film does. The colors are so realistic; but also worth stressing, is the wonderful ways in which all of the characters physically display personalities. Who knew that fish could be so expressive?

As I mentioned at the beginning, the sweetness is the film's main weakness. Parts actually elicited an audibly ""ahhhh"" from the audience, which may be a bit over the top. These same parts almost seemed to beg that response, which I think is the problem: not that the film is sweet, but that it wants to you think that its sweet.

Another pet peeve of mine is the almost exclusively supporting role female characters play. Women in Pixar films, with the possible exception of Boo in ""Monsters, Inc."", are always sidekicks, never the focus of the narrative. Ellen DeGeneres (`Dory') is certainly fantastic, but her role really only exists to cause change in Marlin (Albert Brooks).

That being said, I really, really, enjoy this movie: 8/10 (which is high for me).",8
6 June 2003,The best kids' (and adult-pleasing) movie since the Lion King,"This movie is visually interesting, exciting, funny and heart-warming. A total treat for both kids and adults!

7 September 2005,best film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Without a doubt the best thing Pixar have done yet - The Incredibles was excellent but not quite funny enough and Toy Story I found unwatchable simply because it stars Tom Hanks.

The animation is just incredible, from the charming characters to the light constantly shifting through the water everything is just perfect. Also the scripting that makes us really care about a bunch of fish is great too.

The best thing about this film is the voice casting. Willem Dafoe as Gill and the excellent Alison Janney as Peach shine in the tank scenes along with Geoffrey Rush as Nigel (a credit to the film with such talent taking small roles) and Barry Humphries as Bruce and director Andrew Stanton as crush provide great comedy in their role. One fault is Albert Brookes as lead fish Marlin, while sympathetic he is not quite endearing enough to carry the film.

Ellen Degeneres as Dory (alone she is worth the price of the DVD) just has to be the funniest character ever, showing a rare pizazz and no shame for the forgetful but lovable blue fish. Too many moments to mention but highlights include:- forgetting she is showing Marlin which way the boat went, I'm a natural blue, 'no eating here tonight! You on a diet' and of course the whale speak scenes, 'I didn't know you could speak whale' being the funniest line for years. She is also very moving towards the end a feat not achieved by Robin Williams as the genie in Aladdin or Eddie Murphy as the dragon in whatever that film about a Chinese girl was called.

To sum up I urge everyone to see this film - hilarious, beautiful to look at and surprisingly touching without being overly sentimental like most Disney films. Unmissable",10
1 June 2003,"Great for kids, parents will like it too.","Although it's probably not quite as entertaining for the adults as Pixar's Toy Story or Bug's Life, your kids will absolutely love it. Visually, it's quite stunning, with lots of great color and very realistic ""underwater"" animation, and there's enough humor in it to keep parents entertained while the kids are watching.

16 December 2003,What were Pixar thinking???,"Gorgeous animation- can't fault it. The rest- why? Finding Nemo has a boring plot that darts around so sharply I was lost. The characters are unlikeable and thin, the whole thing is just blah. Watching this, I got the feeling it was just all the animators at Pixar experimenting- seeing what they could do. Frankly, Pixar people- Monsters Inc. was better. And funnier.

11 February 2011,"Finding Nemo struggled to find Nemo, but did not have any trouble finding his way to our hearts.","Finding Nemo has gone down in cartoon memory books.

A film that will not only keep children entertained for years to come but will delight adults world wide with it's delightful plot that will bring the toughest 'fish in the sea' to tears.

The film tells a poignant story of hope and the unconditional love a father has for his son.

Which just the right balance between joyful storytelling, great humour that will keep you laughing even after the fortieth time of seeing the picture and the exploration of a delicate relationship that is ripped at the seems and the determination of the ever loving father to get back what he once loved.

Definitely reserve a space on the DVD rack for what I deem to be an 'all-time great'.",9
17 October 2003,Another great film from the boys at Pixar,"In so many different and fabulous ways, Finding Nemo is a wonderful film. As a children's film, it enchants and creates a wonderfully exciting world. Like its predecessors (Toy Story, A Bugs Life, Monsters, Inc.), Finding Nemo provides a fantasy world based in reality  something that, as children, we all dreamed could be true. As an animation, Pixar once again provide stunning visuals; each film made, somehow manages to look better than the last. The computers are getting better and the animators are getting more and more ambitious. Bright colours swirl around the ocean depths and it's one of those films you could watch without the sound on and just enjoy the marvelous imagery. And, last but not least, the writers have included much for us adults to be able to laugh at. Much of the writing is subtle, witty and brilliantly constructed (with at least one fart joke  to keep us all happy).

Every character in this film was a joy to watch  one of the rare films where I wouldn't have minded seeing more of any of the characters. This is where you have to give credit not only to the writers but also to the voice actors. Ellen DeGeneres was my favourite, as the slightly dippy and lovable Dory. Brooks does a good job in a difficult role (he mostly has to play his role serious).

This is one of the rare animations which has a wonderful narrative structure. The scenes are constructed in such a way that each set piece is intimately woven within the story, each providing their own integral part to plot development and character study. This is Pixars best film to date, and - considering Pixar have produced some of the best films (not just animations) of the past 8 years - this is indeed high accolade. Let's hope Pixar keep creating films this delightfully exuberant.

Amongst all the humour and breathtaking visuals, there are true emotions running through the crux of this film, from the surprising opening five minutes, to the heartfelt last five. This really is a film for everyone. And what a glorious film it is.

For those that care, I gave this 10/10.",10
23 May 2004,MINE!,"I loved this movie! This movie was loving, warm-hearted, tender and fun all wrapped into one great movie. There are too many characters to choose from to be my favorite but here they are:

Dory is the cutest, sweetest, enchanting character. You love her from the word hello!

Who doesn't love Crush? Whoooaaa Dude! Brings back memories of Keanu's early days ;-)

Oh and the fish tank crew, they are the best friends any clown fish could have... Brad Garrett has got to be the best ""worry wart"" in the bunch - you gotta love 'em! Last but not least, MINE!, MINE!, MINE!, MINE!, MINE!, MINE!, MINE!, MINE!, MINE!, MINE! They steal the scenes - I LOVE THOSE BIRDS!!!!

3 June 2003,Nemo Found in My Heart,"Finding Nemo is absolutely amazing. First thing to be said is that the animation is the best to date, as should be expected from the wonderful Pixar team. The plot of this film is wonderful. It has many ups and downs, and it handles the back and forth look between the adventures of the father and the son. The script is excellent. There are many wonderful lines in the film, and never once did I feel this movie was attempting to make children's jokes. The script is very mature. The acting (animation) is wonderful. Lots of emotion visually was conveyed through the characters. The acting (voicing) is great too. All voices matched characters well and I really enjoyed the variety of stereotype voices. Voicing scene-stealer: William DeFoe's, ""That never stopped me,"" as he displays his mutilated side. The cinematography was outstanding. Great camera angles, shots using color were beautiful, while shots that incorporated the suspense of the difficult-to-see-through water were -- well, suspenseful. Finding Nemo is funny, scary, suspenseful, thrilling, moving, and definitely entertaining. This is one of those films that people will have on their DVD rack. See it. Enjoy.

3 June 2003,Water World,"Having no difficulty whatsoever getting in touch with my inner child, I took a deep breath and dove underwater for Pixar's latest film. ""Finding Nemo"" is no mere cartoon. I don't think I could like any animated character better than I do those ""Toy Story"" costars, Woody and Buzz, (actually I like Woody and Buzz more than most ""real"" actors) but Marlin (the ever-neurotic Albert Brooks) and Dory (a hilarious Ellen DeGeneres) are a close second to those screen buddies. Pixar has outdone itself, creating a water world of such splendor that you forget it's drawn with a pen (or a computer). Halfway through the film, when Nemo is captured in the dentist's aquarium, and Marlin and Dorie are two small fish in the vast blue sea, I gasped at the impossibility of them ever seeing each other again. How in the world will they find Nemo? It's a marvel that director Andrew Stanton makes us care enough to help plot escape strategies. The menacing and misunderstood Bruce (named after Speilberg's mechanical fish?), played by Dame Edna, is just too funny, and Stanton himself also does a mean surfer dude as the voice of Crush the seaturtle. Willem Dafoe is sadly perfect as Gil and that underwater sea creature, the one that lives in the very deepest depths of the ocean looks like it's right out of the ""Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau. Pixar certainly put to rest the argument ""do fish feel?"" Of course they do. And they have a pretty good sense of humor too. Don your water wings and fly to see this one.",
24 September 2008,Disney magic at its best,"Finding Nemo is probably one of the best movies ever produced by Pixar and Walt Disney. It was a hit at the theaters, and also a hit on the DVD release. This two-disc set features the same movie as the original theatrical release, plus lots of extra features. There are extra scenes and deleted scenes, but these are mainly sketches and hence are not included as part of the regular movie. The movie itself is worth buying this set; its bright and flashy with cool visuals and special effects that make it attractive for kids. The soundtrack is considerably different from the traditional classical fair found in Disney's motion length pictures. This movie's soundtrack is laid back and different, but paces well with the action. The voice-overs are great, and the comedy is unique and hilarious. Vegetarian sharks! Fish without memory! Disney takes family entertainment to new heights with this great movie, and I highly recommend it.

10 June 2003,"It was a pretty good story, but the jokes were LAME","I was prepared to love this movie like Monsters Inc, but all things considered, FN really let me down. The story and pixar graphics make this a great rental, but barely worth the price of admission. Some of the characters were likable, the angelfish, Dory, who suffered from short term memory loss was easily the best character, and Nemo was ok but the broken fin thing was retarted. The word 'retarted' also speaks for just about all of the jokes. ""Lookie, it's a turtle speedway, but turtles are slow""...ha ha ha-no, not funny. If you want a decent kids movie, check it out, cuz it's a movie you won't fall asleep over,m and your kids will enjoy it. 6/10

8 July 2003,A Fish Story Well Worth The Dip,"I was more or less turned off by Toy Story and Antz. Shrek didn't do much for me, so ever since I've been avoiding most computerized animated cartoon feature motion pictures. But I'm happy to report that Finding Nemo is absolutely brilliant! Awesome colors, breathtaking underwater seascapes and oceanographic detail, plus plain damned funny and entertaining characterizations, dialogue and story! Actually dare I use the word genius? I'm 47 years old, hold several degrees, including one in marine biology, and I can honestly say that the folks at Pixel and Disney certainly did their zoological homework on this one. Easily the best animated feature I have seen in decades. I've also surf, have been to Sydney and have many Australian friends, so this made the surf-talking `dude' sea turtles and Australian inside-jokes even that much more funny. But at least for me it was those blasted seagulls that won the laugh award for me. I couldn't help busting up completely in the theatre every time they made an appearance, `mate'! A 9 out of 10 in my books, and I forgot to mention, I'm a film buff as well. Anyone of any age who still has half a heart left in their body owes it to themselves to go see `Finding Nemo'.",9
24 February 2005,"Finding Nemo is Finding Family, Fish or Human","God is in the details in this so endearing film. The beauty of the undersea terrain is unparalleled, in real life or art. The faces of the creatures are so expressive and dear that one cannot help but connect emotionally. Brooks is exemplary, he is the worried, unselfish, loving father. Everyone was exemplary in voice and emotion. I heard a TV critic say that Ellen DeGeneris deserved a prize, and if you knew how these complex characters are created by voice and then drawn, you would have to agree. Through emotions of both sadness and joy we felt love for the family. The humor was agreeable to my age (over 50) and it must have been agreeable to children too, considering the high box office. The young kindergarten characters were so joyfully portrayed that I can still see them in my mind. I have seen this movie four times and every time I run across it on Cable I can't help but stop for a minute or often two hours and watch it again. Always fresh, and enchanting. I wish we had more family movies with this loving quality.

17 July 2003,My 3-year old enjoyed it,"(We watched the Chinese-dubbed version of it.)

Taking a 3-year old to watch a movie is daunting, and this is the 2nd time I've done this. (The 1st time was a disaster, we only stayed 30 minutes, but I digress.)

I believe she enjoyed Nemo very much, as she stayed to watch the whole 100+ minutes of it WITHOUT going to the bathroom !!! Of course she fidgeted many times during the movie, not owing to the show, but because of where we sat. Doubtless I had to explain some points to her (why Nemo's mother is missing etc) but she was able to follow the story most the time. The silliness of Dory was lost on her, but then she may be a bit too young to understand fully the memory lost / forgetfulness of adults.

She wasn't scared of the shark nor of the whale, but was afraid of the sudden darkness in the depths of the sea, and had to hold my hand. The pictures were very clear (and seemed real to her), I could even see the fish scales.

Other than that, all in all, the story has a happy ending (of course :), and if she could give points, I think she'll give this a 9 or 10. I'll give this a 7 or 8, and recommend this for kids of all ages.",7
15 November 2003,I'll be the cinematic grinch here....,"My wife and I both got tired of this after about half an hour. By now, this kind of story has become formulaic and cliched. The adult in-jokes; the anthropomorphic sentimentality; the perils and chases--much too cutesy and much too contrived, even for a Disney film. This is totally lacking in the inventiveness, humor, and appeal--or creative animation--of Monsters Inc., Shrek, or A Bug's Life, all of which I loved. It's probably easy to become overwhelmed by the nice colors on the big screen; in this case, seeing it on DVD is to see the film more clearly and to realize it doesn't live up to the hype.

13 August 2015,Sad to say,"As a child, I absolutely adored this movie! It was full of bright colors and talking fish! Who doesn't like talking animals? The issue came about when I turned 16, one of my friends brought her's over on VHS and we sat up and watched it together. From the very beginning we were discussing how different the movie would have been if something hadn't have happened. We did this throughout the entire movie!!!! It's sad to say, but I think I'm too old for Finding Nemo... now Finding Dory, I still plan on watching. Dory had to have been my favorite fish! I won't tell you why even though everyone has basically seen this movie, I don't want to have to claim spoilers. I wish I could claim that I still love this movie as much as I did as a kid, but once I find every small detail that could change the entire story, the movie is no longer as good. Granted, it does make for some interesting conversations as to how the movie would end.

12 October 2018,Awes you as only a Pixar film can,"Finding Nemo is a stunningly gorgeous film and the fact that it takes place underwater which means a new color pallet for Pixar makes it even better. Seriously this film is gorgeous and just for the visuals alone it deserves a pat on the back but the story is equally heartening and the characters very relatable even though they are clownfish. This soaring and deeply moving sea adventure is unlike very few films out there. Check it out if you haven't yet.

20 October 2003,oscar-bound masterpiece,"This is Pixar and Disney's most successful film to date. And it should be, because the story does justice to the visuals and the visuals do justice to the story. ""Finding Nemo"" has such a simple story but it so well told, well emphasized, and well-meant. The characterizations are excellent, the personalities fit well together into the colorful theme. The editing is flawless. The music is just right - not too dramatic, not too perky and childish. And the animation is, what can we say, a masterpiece. It is funny and touching at the right places, possibly one of the best animated films ever made. This film should be Oscar-bound.

12 June 2003,"Absolutley Fantastic, Best Pixar movie yet","Despite what many would say as the worst Pixar movie, I believe Finding Nemo to be the best of their 5 movies. The other ones were great too but i really thought that you got to know the characters much more in Finding Nemo then the others. It had more of a point than the others did, yet still was just as hilarious as the others. Pixar has not lost its touch yet. A+.

21 October 2003,Fishy goings on.,"This film tells the unlikely story of Marlin, a Clown fish, losing his son 'Nemo' and the journey he embarks on to be re-united with him.

The computer animation of the fish in this film is superb. The human animation is less amazing. I took my 8 and 13 year old daughters to see this film and they both enjoyed it. Personally I object to films where animals are given human characteristics or behaviour. The story is quite simply weak and lacks any of the adult humour found in Shrek and Toy Story. In fact some of the very young children in the cinema started to get restless during some of the 'slower' points of the film.

18 September 2012,Sweet And Sad Movie!,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
2 June 2003,Is Dad a Hero or a Clown?,"As usual, the animation was leading-edge. I loved the colors and perfect blend of underwater softness with up-close crispness. Sadly, the people are always the hardest to make CG realistic and again the humans in FN are rather unconvincing.

What troubled me the most was Marlin. This dad was protective of his only remaining son... but was he over-protective? I'm a dad and trust me, fun becomes danger in the blink of an eye. I found that most of Marlin's perceived fears were completely justified! Marlin was not imagining monsters around every corner but only in places where there was a legitimate possibility. The fact that Marlin had experienced a horrifying tragedy and that perhaps this memory and painful loss was the cause of his protectiveness was never put on the witness stand. No supporting character ever pitied him and used this as a starting place for their advice- they all started in on him like he was the big bad guy, treating him like he needed therapy. The school teacher promised that little Nemo would be carefully supervised, but it took only 2 seconds and that kid was gone and in another 10 seconds and he was ""shark-bait"".

Likewise, Nemo was always portrayed as a normal kid with normal interests and curiosity. This kid was normal all right- normally undiscerning, normally foolish, normally empty-headed and normally disrespectful. Sure, all kids have feelings and are sensitive and need understanding, but the story never developed this line realistically.

It was so unfortunate that Nemo was continually being taught the street-wisdom he desperately lacked by someone other than his Dad-- a theme that made Dad even look worse than over-protective, perhaps even abusive in a passive sense for his negligence in properly educating Nemo.

The ""gang"" style initiation and misfit/outcast bonding that takes place among the tank prisoners almost seems to favor psudo-family relationships above true-blood family ties.

I loved the heroic adventure and human, male/female foibles and weaknesses highlighted in each danger situation.

Dory's need/love/longings explosion against Marlin in the final give-up scene didn't play well since her dependence on Marlin wasn't even a sub-plot at any earlier point in the movie. This outburst didn't even get another frame later to help tie it up better.

I liked Dory's character and the way here marble-challenged personality was used in the humor, but the ""life is smoother for the low of IQ"" theme was stretched too thin. Brains are standard equipment on all models.

Don't get me wrong, tho... I didn't miss the point. I just wanted to weigh-in on the Dad side. The final family resolution does finally paint the family as it should have been all along without the crisis. My only beef is that Dad was more justified for his paranoia than he was ever given credit for and the child had more attitude, ignorance and disobedience than was portrayed.",8

7 June 2003,The end is near.....,"There is nothing I can add to anyone's opinion about Nemo that hasn't already been said. What I find sad is the fact that a near perfect marriage between Pixar and Disney will soon come to an end due to Micheal Eisner's seemingly eternal greed. Pixar's contract with Disney will end with their next film,and I'm certain that they will not renew,especially with companies like Dreamworks out there.To make a long story short,Eisner claims that sequels don't count with the original agreement between Pixar and Disney. This seems to have been a huge surprise to Pixar after the release of Toy Story 2. It's the reason that we will never see a Toy Story 3,or a sequel to A Bug's Life,etc. I'm sure that legally,Lord Farrquaad has taken steps to assure that Pixar will never be able to use these characters without involving the Disney Co.,but it will be interesting to see what Pixar will create post Disney while Eisner basks in the glory of such classic film releases of Country Bears,or Brother Bear....you get the idea. If there is anyone from Walt's family that has any control over this beast,PLEASE get rid of him before he turns one of the greatest companies on the planet into entertainment's ENRON.

17 June 2003,One of the best Disney movies of all time!,"This was a wonderful movie. I loved it. I'm a 14 year old, and I don't enjoy Disney movies often, but I'd deffiently come back and see this one again.

To start off, the acting is superb. I loved Ellen Degeneris as Dorie, the forgetful fish. She was extremely funny. Nemo and Marlin were also voiced well, just like Brad Garret and the blowfish.

The plot was great, and the story ended beautifully. I give it **** out of **** stars!!!

3 June 2003,Pixar rebounds and scores.,"As a movie studio, Pixar has a nearly perfect track record. In my opinion, they slipped a little with Monsters Inc. While the movie was certainly fun and technically the graphics were brilliant, the story was weakly assembled and felt rushed. It almost felt like a movie put together by a studio that took its excellent reputation for granted. I was nervous about seeing Finding Nemo, only because I feared that this studio had run out of real magic, and would continue to coast along on brilliant graphics alone.

I have to believe that Dreamworks' recent success with Shrek was a wake-up call to Pixar. Shrek widened the market of animated films, proving that a well-mixed dose of tongue-in-cheek adult humor was long overdue. Pixar's routine was getting stale, and Monsters Inc. was the result.

Finding Nemo brings back the magic. It succeeds in every way that Monsters Inc. failed, and surpasses all their previous efforts in technical brilliance. Taken as a whole, it surpasses every Pixar movie except for Toy Story 2, which remains the most emotionally charged of all their movies.

True to form, Pixar gives us a simple story with complex emotions running throughout. No time is wasted on the setup here - we have a father (Marlin) who loses everything but one son (Nemo). Marlin becomes understandably overprotective, but the excesses of this lead to frustration in Nemo. Nemo rebels in a scene that plays out so well that you completely forget you are watching fish. The tension is unbelievably real.

From there we are taken on a journey that introduces us to a wide variety of characters and fantastic adventures. To go into detail would spoil the wonder of it all.

Possibly the most amazing feat of this movie is that I actually enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres in a major role. I didn't think that was possible, as I normally find her brand of humor annoying. Perhaps this comedian has finally found her niche in voice acting, or just her perfect role. Either way, her part demanded a surprising amount of range for a comic relief sidekick, and she delivers.

Congratulations Pixar, you've still got it.

22 February 2006,Come On People! Pixar Doesn't Always Equal Pure Genius,"Aww gee golly gosh kids pile into the mini-van cuz we're gonna go see that cute lookin' new Pixar film, you know the one where that adorable little fish is lookin' for that other fish, you know little Nemo, gosh darn is that Nemo ever cute. And you know it's a Pixar movie so it'll be fun for us grownups and you kids too. Aww look at little Nemo, he's got a disablility kids, but that missin' fin doesn't stop him from doin' the things that those baby fish just hafta do you know. What a powerful message for my young children. Oh Ellen Degeneres is the voice of a fish in it, ya know you could do a lot worse than Ellen Degeneres. Surfs up dudes, those surfer turtles were sure some kinda fun for me and my kids. What a happy ending, that was pleasing. Admit it people this movie treks on some heavily traveled ground. It wasn't original at all, and not to mention would only be funny if the only thing you've ever seen were a few old Full House episodes. Sure kids may enjoy it, but it seems like very little effort was put into making this movie besides the top notch animation. Too many people seem to blindly give high ratings to animated features just because they were made by Pixar. Bottom line is this movie is for kids and humorless adults.",5
19 October 2003,"A visual delight, great characters","Short review this time - bright and colorful - Finding Nemo is yet another delicious piece from the good people at Pixar. The characters and designs are fun and neat, the voice casting and characterizations are perfect (many Pixar regulars, John Ratzenberger stands out as the Fish School science teacher). The visuals are amazing : the wholly fluid environment is beautifully designed and rendered. 9 of 10

13 July 2022,Such an endearing classic.,"If I were to explain Finding Nemo in one sentence, I would say, ""Its about overcoming every obsticle life throws at you."" Whats incredible about it however is that its an animated movie for children. It deserves so much more credit than just that.

The visuals of the ocean and it's creatures, Wow. It holds up 19 years later. What a beautiful, vibrant movie to watch. Every single character looks so distinct and unique they all stand out from each other. For the most part the movie is set in the ocean where it actually feels like the ocean, unlike some other animated fish ocean movie.

To elaborare more into my one sentence review, every character has something to overcome internally and in a way, find themselves. Marlin has to overcome his fear of the ocean, Nemo has to overcome his self doubt, Gil has to contemplate the extreme lengths to escape his perdicament, Dory proves shes just as capable as any other fish. The themes go hard for being just a movie for children, which is why I think anybody of any age can find something to latch onto here.

Also, the movie is very funny. I found myself laughing alot when I watched it now as an adult, and I've seen this movie often when I was a child.

Regarding the score composition, I especially love the theme ""Nemo Egg (Main Title"" ""Gill"" and ""News Travels""",9
7 June 2019,Best movie I've ever seen,"It's kind of like SpongeBob with Toy Story's animation.

14 July 2023,"""Fish Are Friends. Not Food.""","Where do I even start with this...? This to me is the definitive of Pixar at their prime, and for just that reason alone I love everything about this movie! This is one of those Pixar movies that I will go back on every once in a while, and it's not just for nostalgia memories I have with it as a toddler, but also for a filmmaking perspective. Cause I always try to look back on some of the films I used to watch when I was kid thinking they'd still hold up as an adult, and in many ways, they do... for the most part. And thankfully I'm glad to say that this is one of those movies that still holds a special place in my heart as both a kid and an adult. I still remember seeing this for the first time as a kid after getting a surgery on my arm and not trying to have to worry about anything that's surrounding me besides watching this amazing film on the small screen of my DVD player. So getting the chance to revisit this experience again as an adult all these years later significantly approved my love and appreciation. Andrew Stanton has been a household name in the Pixar industry since he helped write and produce Toy Story back in 1995, and seeing his first directorial debut is a welcoming sight for him. Cause everything that he does with the story in this movie makes you understand more on the world he invites you into. Every character in this movie brings life towards their character arcs and backgrounds, giving us an understanding on who they are and why we should care for them on this journey. Marlin (Albert Brooks ""voice"") is an overprotecting father figure who's trying to do what's best for his son Nemo's safety, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres ""voice"") is a fish suffering from short term memory loss who feels like her memory grows stronger the more she stays with Marlin on his quest to find his son, Gill (Willem Dafoe ""voice"") is the leader of a group of fish who're stuck in a fish tank at a local dentist office in Sydney, Australia who's doing what's best for the rest of the fish to escape this fish tank, the list goes on. One of the biggest accomplishments this movie had to offer was how they constructed the underwater environment, which by the way feels very realistic and beautiful. If you look back on some of the DVD bonus features, the writers and animators explained carefully on how they created the ocean with a special technique they used to make it look very real, and that of course is how special this movie is to me because of the amount of hard work and dedication these animators put forth with their craft.

Overall, Finding Nemo is one of those special Pixar movies that I will go back and rewatch over and over again for years to come. It has given me a lot of joy and comfort in my life that I deserve, and will continue to have those feelings with no regrets.",10
31 May 2003,great~charming~fishy & fun~,"Finding Nemo was a very sweet with a somewhat realistic plot! (okay, okay I am aware that they are fish not people~) With the voices of some very familiar actors, they came together to create Finding Nemo. it is a great movie for children and although kids might not understand all of the jokes( which are surprisinly refreshing, it doesn't mean that they are missing a part of the story. I think this is one of the great films that people will line up to see and come out feeling that they spent their money well.

14 June 2003,A remarkable animated road film without a road,"Finding Nemo is wonderful. Gorgeous to look at with animation that wouldn't be possible even five years ago and written with deft, fun, and heart. The film may suffer from being directed solely at kids and there requisite guardians (me and my brother were likely the only 15 to 25 year-olds in the whole cineplex) which makes the plot structure of the titular youngen Nemo swimming off on his own to do some much needed growing up while simultaneously forcing his father Marlin to challenge himself and grow no small amount himself so delightfully subversive. Defoe, Brooks and Rush's voicework is quite brilliant but believe me when I say this, DeGeneres improbably steals the show. After the first word her character Dory said I shuddered and thought I'd be in for a long two hours. But with significant screen time she never once got tiresome or annoying. I caught myself laughing at her jokes and thought to myself, 'this is Ellen DeGeneres, right?' Y'all may not have my inborn mistrust of DeGeneres, but those who do, don't miss out on a truly surprising road film without a road.

30 May 2003,great film!,"I just got back from seeing Finding Nemo and Loved it!! The Pixar team has done it again and the story had very funny moments, the theater on more than one occasion was laughing hysterically and clapping. I went with my 3yr and she loved it, laughing and following the story. The only 'bad' thing was it went a little long, the ending could have come a little sooner, and some of the chase action scenes are a little intense, but overall a great movie!!

21 September 2004,Fun Film,"This movie gives you everything. Humor, Drama, and memory loss. This movie had the best story to it. What makes this movie so great is the characters it has. marlin a troubled father who is incapble of letting his son grow up. Nemo, a kid who think who can do anything. And Dory the best character of them all. her memory loss is the one thing that keeps you laughing the whole way thru. Also the situations that there put into. Such as jellyfish and whale's mouths. many people will agree with me when i say that Dory was the FISH. her memory problems where the best. the one thing that i learned that from is to "" just keep swimming, just keep swimming. What do we do we swim swim.""

8 September 2004,plot,"One of Pixars better films! This is defiantly a great film!

Plot outline: Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a clown fish whose son Nemo, was taken by divers! So Marlin decides to go out in search of his son on the way he meets many odd fish such as Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) a short-term memory plagued fish and Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) a very helpful, but slightly absent mined pelican.

The animation and lighting is terrific; do you know how hard it is to animate a fish? Or an anemone? Pretty tough stuff! To wrap it up I would have to say this is one of Pixars finer films for young and old alike! 7and1/2

14 December 2004,A good film...,"...for kids.

Lacked the humour and slick dialogue of Shrek to make it appeal to adults.

The animation was pretty good, although I'm not sure these new films are that much better than the Disney films that came out decades ago. I watched The Jungle Book the other day and the animation was superb.

I guess where modern animation is superior is when it comes to detailed scenic or panoramic shots. But when it comes to the facial expressions of the characters, and the way they move, the old Disney classics can hold their own against any of the new generation of animated films.

9 June 2003,Further raising the bar...,"It seems that while watching this movie, it was even harder to suspend the belief that this was a fully computer generated movie. Harder, compared to any previous Pixar work. The fish portrayed seemed so amazingly fluid, so lifelike, so believable (well, other than the talking, but of course, they were talking amongst themselves).

I thoroughly was surprised by this movie. It was much better than I had initially expected. The previews that I had been seeing for perhaps the last six months or so seemed so empty, like you had no idea what the movie was going to be about. Advertising consisted of little clips of the fish that were completely taken out of context. You knew that there'd be something different, based on new levels of animation that were evident... but you didn't have any idea what the movie would be even about. Even to the ads most recently, you'd have no idea. I have no idea why they'd approach it this way. I think that this film is clearly being driven by word of mouth, more than anything. Now that I've seen it, I'm glad it is doing well in the cinema, and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.

Adding the little feature clip at the beginning (the 1989 short ""Knick Knack"") was delightful to see. Most people haven't seen this one, and I think it's a good example of where Pixar was, and how they still have the creative knack (no pun intended) after all these years.

Overall, a great way to spend about 100 minutes. Don't forget to stay until the very very end, the credits and accompanying animation are rather interesting.",9

25 July 2008,boring,"when compared to the great Disney movies this film is really pathetic. i couldn't wait for it to be over.

the script is a long set of clichés. the comedy is so juvenile and stale that if i had seen this at age 10, it's safe to say i wouldn't have laughed at a single part.

the animation is ugly. there is something very commercial and impersonal about computer animation. if you want to see beautiful animation, look at the hand-made watercolor backgrounds in the ""Jungle Book"".

if you want to watch a movie with a kid, pick one from when Walt Disney was still alive. they are funny even to adults, if sometimes politically incorrect.

16 June 2003,"Fell for this film hook, line, and sinker!","This was my son's first movie. From the moment the film started to the minute the closing credits rolled, he was transfixed. I put my arm around him during the scary parts, it didn't faze him at all (and this is a kid who has NEVER seen anything but PBS).

Maybe it's just a different time. I remember my first movie was 101 Dalmations, and I had nightmares for weeks about the mean lady who was going to kill puppies to make a fur coat!

I found this movie to be entertaining on all levels, and recommend it highly.

want to say that. He lives with his overprotective father. On the first

day of school his dad catches him not being with the group and he

and his friends are having a contest to see who can get closer to

""the butt"" (a boat). Nemo's dad gets mad so, to prove that he's

brave, Nemo swims up and touches ""the butt"". He gets captured

by scuba divers and put in a tank in a dentist's office. He meets

many crazy fish and it's a fun movie once you get into it. But it's a

little slow and I really wanted to smack Dory, a fish who teams up

with Nemo's dad, Marlin, to go and find Nemo. I also wanted to

smack Marlin. Of course, there are corny parts at the end but, it's

Disney. What can you expect? I'd probably give this film 6 out of 10

stars because it's funny and sort of original, but it's slow and

annoying.",6
30 October 2007,Finding Nemo,"The Incredibles is a far better movie on all points. Finding Nemo pales in comparison, in fact I found the movie somewhat ho-hum, despite the plot's best efforts. Too formulaic. I am surprised to see this on the top 250, and surprised at the 8.3 rating. I think it's popular the way Olive Gardens are popular. It wasn't awful at all, just mediocre. Perhaps Pixar wanted a follow-up to its previous successes. Monsters, Inc. also was a much better project...imaginative and great little subtle humor jabs...Monsters, Inc. in fact might be Pixar's best yet...the ticklish fun of Monsters, Inc. is enhanced by wonderful performances by the voice actors. The play on the monster-under-the-bed fear with suggesting real monsters, and that fear being harnessed as power is a great example of universalism. The ending of Monsters, Inc., replete with scenes from ""Put That Thing Back Where It Came From Or So Help Me"" utilizes the running joke form of comedy well, along with other little gems, such as the repeating of Mike Wyzowski's name. The effort of Nemo suggests a tiredness....

25 December 2005,This is boring,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",1
1 June 2003,"One of the most touching, heartwarming films I've ever seen. An absolute must-see.","To start this review, let me just say that there is a difference between a feel-good movie and a feel-warm movie. Toy Story 2 was built to be a feel-good movie, and it succeeded in spades. Finding Nemo was built to be a feel-warm movie, and wow, wow, wow, does it ever succeed in spades. If I wasn't so freakishly mature, I would have been sobbing like a baby during this movie, but rest assured I was choked up good. When the movie ended, the audience applauded (including me) and I left the theater with an involuntary dazzling smile on my face and a heart filled up like a water balloon. I'm going to say this right off the batthis is Pixar's second best movie and so far one of the best movies of the year. It falls short of Toy Story 2 but only by a hair. This is one of the bravest movies Pixar has done. You see, Pixar has mastered the classic CGI comedy-adventure movie with a hint of drama. That's what made the Toy Story flicks and A Bug's Life so good. And Pixar could have easily used this winning formula for Finding Nemo, but it didn't. It instead tried to achieve a classic CGI drama-adventure with a hint of comedy. It was a daring risk that could have failed, but instead it succeeded beyond what I could have ever imagined. It was only touching, never mushy. Even though this is a wild under-sea adventure complete with a fish with bad memory and a surfer-dude turtle, it's a movie many people can relate to. You see, this movie is about Marlin, a fish who loses his son, the only one left from a shark attack that kills the rest of his children and his wife. And Marlin dedicates the rest of his life to raising and protecting his son, whom he names Nemo. But when Nemo is kidnapped by a diver, the only thing that meant anything to Marlin, the only big thing in his life he had left, is gone. Everyone knows what it's like to have something very, very important to them, be it a trinket or a son, and when it gets lost, many people will weep and not do anything. But it's a rare breed of people who try to search for that thing at any cost. And Marlin is part of that breed. He never gives up trying to find his son the entire movie, and that is the most heartwarming aspect of this movie. But that's not the only good thing about this movie. The score, the voicework, the animation, and the comedy also deserve major kudos. And while the movie is a little less satisfying than Toy Story 2 (emphasis on little), this is still Pixar's runner-up best movie and one of the best movies of the year. Highly recommended. Bring yourself, bring the kids, and bring the Kleenex.

I give this movie a perfect, well-deserved 10/10.",10
21 June 2003,Finding Gold,"Pixar has a perfect track record, with such brilliant films as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. in its catalog. Upping the visuals effects and providing an awesome, humourous, inspiring story made Finding Nemo possibly their best film yet. The movie follows the journey of Marlin, a frightened clownfish who is trying to find and save his lost son Nemo. Along the way he befriends Dory, who is voiced confidently and perfectly by Ellen DeGeneres. The 2 make their way through the dangerous ocean, braving sharks, whales, and jellyfish. Meanwhile, Nemo tries to escape the dentist office fish tank where he wound up. It's a touching story that's full of action and is ultimately very inspiring. Finding Nemo is a work of art, that nobody should miss, regardless of age. A must-see in every sense.

25 August 2003,Finding nemo. A little kid movie?..........NO WAY!,"Now, some people say that finding nemo is for little kids. But I say that this movie can be for all ages, im 13 and I still liked it. Nemo runs away and he is captured by some divers. So his dad goes out to find him and meets up with this fish with a very short term memory named Dory. So both of them go out to find nemo and it is a funny and very exiting adventure. I would say if you liked Toy story you will like this one even more.

27 October 2003,Fun for all ages,"""Finding Nemo"" is a definite must see. The writers were awesome in that they captured the right kind of humor (and cast members) that would be lost on any particular age group. Whereas I gave this movie a 9 (out of 10) and I see that it is number 101 on the top 250 list, I do not believe ""Finding Nemo"" is better than ""Lilo & Stitch"".

28 November 2004,9/10 [with explanation],"My rating: 9/10

Why?

A simple plot line complicated by setbacks, various and sundry meetings, and other assorted stops that make for a thrilling adventure. Blatant and subtle humor and sarcasm abound, creating many memorable scenes and one-liners. The characters are fun and diverse, with many personalities, accenting one another. The fish and other aquatic life have human personalities and intelligence, making them even more lovable.

Being an ocean-lover, I was immediately captivated by the astounding animation. The fish [excepting those done purposely charicaturish] were wonderfully real and colorful, and the entire ocean environment pulled you under, with swaying anemones and beautiful coral. It makes the entire film seem more believable, if that can be achieved at all in a film with talking fish...

'Fish are friends, NOT FOOD'--a memorable quote from the sharks, but a small running theme that seems to be present in many 'talking animal' movies. Kinda like 'Hey, animals have feelings, too.' A parody of human life is portrayed through the fish, with traffic, bullying, school, and even attitudes common among kids. It brings the movie that much closer to home.

Wonderful film for the whole family to enjoy...so grab shell, dude!

23 August 2018,One of the most emotional animated films,"Finding Nemo is a good movie and the fact that it takes place underwater which means a new color pallet for Pixar makes it even better. Seriously this film is gorgeous and just for the visuals alone it deserves a pat on the back but the story is equally heartening and the characters very relatable even though they are clownfish. This soaring and deeply moving sea adventure is unlike very few films out there. Check it out if you haven't yet.

17 November 2006,"Parents, you can watch this one over and over with your kids without getting bored!","Well, I didn't grow up with Disney or Pixar movies, and typically don't go out to see them, but lately baby-sitting my 2 year old niece, I got a chance to watch some kids movies (whether I wanted to or not). This one was different though. It kept me entertained, I've seen it at least 15 times now, and I'm still entertained by it. And the little girl, well, a 2 year old's attention span isn't exactly the best, and typically she doesn't pay attention to a whole movie played through. Not Nemo though, she'll stand (literally stand) in front of the TV and stare mesmerized at what she's seeing, from start to finish, over and over again. Hopefully it doesn't have any adverse effects on her development, lol. Enough pretty lights and soothing sounds to keep a newborn entertained, and enough adult humor and plot development to keep an adult awake! Seriously though, great movie for the whole family, no matter how old or how young.

11 December 2005,10 Starfish! 2 Fins Way Up!,"i LOVE this movie. i have seen it nearly 100 times since i have kids. even though i have seen it time & time again, i find myself electing to watch this movie even when the kids are away. (shhhh! don't tell anyone!) it's every emotion rolled up in one film & you finish the movie with a great big smile through tears. you will never get bored with it as you will continue to find things you missed along the way... little details, like in the ""ring of fire"" scene when deb covers her eye with her fin & notices her 'sister' flo can still see what's going on... she then covers her 'sisters' eye with a plastic leaf so she can't see what's happening either. it's a very wonderful film that teaches valuable life lessons for parents & children alike. it's a MUST OWN!

28 July 2003,Fun for all ages,"Finding Nemo was one of the best animated films since the Toy Story films. Pixar has once again outdone themselves with the terrific drawing and animation. The plot is very well written as well. This film is a must see and is one of the best movies of 2003. I hope that we see a sequel for this film in the future. Four stars for this film or 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!

2 June 2003,Way Cool!,"There wasn't much wrong with this movie, I can tell you that for sure. There were a lot of funny parts and Ellen was a blast as Dory. I liked the fact that the fish were a lot like the actors and actresses that played them, and it was almost like you got to see a new side of everybody. (I heard Willem Dafoe say something comical for once! O.o)

I would SO recommend this movie to anyone (I've been making sure everyone at school has seen it). It's not too cartoonish and it's not just for kids. Even under it's ""G"" rating, ""Finding Nemo"" is a lot of fun for the whole family. I can't say much more without spoiling the whole thing. So: GO SEE ""FINDING NEMO"" ASAP!

29 December 2020,Good family fun,"I laughed out loud frequently and heartily throughout the film, but at the end, I looked back and wondered how those moments of amusement added to the story. Many people have commented that they loved the 12-step program for sharks (""Fish are our friends, not food!"") but in the final analysis, it added very little to the arc and seemed out of character (I realize I'm stating the obvious). The frequently-dropped comedic digressions were the weak point in this picture, especially compared to ""A Bug's Life"", where the funniest moments of the film are all critical to the progress of the protagonist and impact the end of the story.

My 2 and a half year old son was frequently frightened to the point of crying out and grabbing on to me during the movie, and he followed the primary issues easily. At a particular moment in the film when things seemed hopeless, I heard dozens of young children beginning to cry. If your child is very affected by scary or dramatic moments in movies, you may want to talk with them about ""pretend"" versus ""real"" and prepare them for the eventuality that everything will turn out all right well before you go into the theater. His final analysis was that ""the fish movie was good!"" - so take it under advisement if you have kids of similar age.

I give ""Finding Nemo"" an 8 out of 10 on the strength of its visual lushness, its enjoyable voice work, and its moments of perfectly timed humor. It does not, in my opinion, match the strength as a *film* of earlier Pixar offerings, but even in its innocuous state, it's higher quality than most of the family films I've seen in the past 3 years.",8

11 June 2003,Funniest children's movie!,"I truly enjoyed this movie! I love cartoons anyway, but this one is much better than all the other children's movies I have ever seen. I particularly enjoy Pixar movies for the realistic sceneries. I am not an Ellen DeGeneres fan, but she made the movie! The best part was when her character, Dory, was speaking ""whale""! ""Finding Nemo"" gives children an idea of the life of a fish. It also teaches disappointment, loss, perseverance and making friends from a child's perspective. This is definitely a movie you will want in your permanent library.

30 May 2003,The Midas Fish Factory,"Pixar continues its string of brilliance, their dedication above all to story has paid off again. There second dedication to animation has doubled the pot. The film is poignant and comic, when its all over you can't remember how many times you were close to crying, and how many times you were laughing.

The film takes chances and puts itself out on a limb, it creates provocative visuals, it is not the bland production value that most animation is under today, instead it is a work of art.

11 June 2003,Masterful animation,"Pixar are my favourite studio and they do not disappoint with ""Finding Nemo"". However, it was, for me, not quite as entertaining as their previous four feature masterpieces. Maybe the formula is starting to show through (there were some blatent reuse of comedic style from previous movies in the dialogue) or maybe it was because it was aimed more directly at a young child audience more than the others, but the entertainment didn't feel as rich, the humour not quite so funny.

That said, what was lacking slightly in the originality of story and script, is more than made up for in the quality of the animation. The animation is rich and fluid and, well, just wonderful. I can't wait to scrutinize it more in November when the DVD is released.

I don't know how many of you know Dame Edna, but it shows that Pixar know their comedians when they chose her alter-ego Barry Humphries to voice the Shark. I'm not, however a fan of Ellen and this spoilt my enjoyment of the sidekick fish a little - but I also think her character in the film bordered on annoying more than funny in some scenes.

I'm being brutally critical here. The film's definitely worth watching and confirms my opinion that Pixar are at the top of their craft and are showing up in-house Disney productions of late.",8
10 June 2003,Find your way to the theaters,"Plain and simple, go see this movie. Unless you hate Disney or animated features, this is definitely a fish tale you'll want to check out. I would say this is the best animated feature since Shrek. It's got everything you could want - excitement, adventure, and of course, lots of humor. The characters are all fun, my personal favorites being Dory, and the turtles, Crush and Squirt.

And as an added bonus of seeing it in the theater, before the show there's a Pixar short that's really good. So if you've got little kids, or just enjoy family movies, go see this one; you won't be disappointed.

4 June 2003,"Beautiful animation, terrific story","A terrific movie. Beautifully animated - and a great story. The movie was frightening at times(small children may be terrified by the Great White Shark) but mostly it was hilarious. The next time I hear whale sounds I know I've going to burst out laughing.

15 August 2003,A great Disney movie!,"A ""must-sea"" effort for all who have loved the previous Pixar fare, Andrew Stanton directs this lovable adventure that stars himself and such well-known names as Albert Brooks, Barry Humphries, Ellen DeGeneres and Christopher Gould (who voices the title character).

With its well-paced action and stunning visuals, this is a truly brilliantly-told story set deep in the Australian ocean that tells of Nemo, the young clownfish who is captured and sent to live in the fishtank of a Sydney dentist. There, his adventure starts, and as his father, Marlin, begins a quest to find his only son, Nemo tries to escape from his new home, thanks to the friendly group of fish who live there.

While this movie marks the comeback of the good storytelling traits of the older Disney animated films, ""Finding Nemo"" is truly the most complete Disney film of any kind (and more complete than this, the MPAA rating information appears at the end of the theatrical version). In addition, be on the look-out for the 1989 short ""Knick Knack"" before the feature.

This is a highly recommended Disney film that is better than all of last year's box office fare combined. I give it a solid 10\10--the best effort so far from the Disney\Pixar collaboration.

(NB Watch out for a few hidden surprises from the last few Pixar films while watching!)",10
31 May 2003,"Finding Nemo is fun, but a bit over kids' heads","My sister and I took my three year old twin boys to see the movie and while she and I thoroughly enjoyed the film, my little ones didn't quite grasp the humor of it. I know three is a young age, but Pixar tends to aim the jokes toward the adults in hopes that we don't get bored and a) fall asleep or b) drag our kids out of the theater before the movie ends. The adults in the theater loved the humor, but the kids were all asking, ""Mama, what's funny?"" or ""Daddy, why are you laughing?"" The kids enjoyed the scenes, but most cried or begged to sit in their parents' laps when the three sharks, a barracuda, and an evil looking fish with a light on it's head and long, sharp teeth came on the screen. While the sharks proved comical, the other two scenes scared the little ones to death. My own boys would not leave our laps even after the scenes were over. If you have real little ones and are thinking of seeing this movie, skip the snacks for yourself because most likely, the kids will be occupying your lap through most of the movie. I thought the movie was great, but the humor and dramatic scenes are a bit too much for the kids. I also think that Dads should take their kids to see this, it is a really sweet movie about how far a father will go to find and bring his only son back home. Ellen DeGeneres voices the part of Dory, a goofy, if somewhat annoying, blue fish with a very short term memory, but she adds even more color to the movie. Hope you enjoy it!",
30 May 2003,Simply Pleasent...,"Going in, I didnt really think too much about the film except that it was done by Pixar and they have done an outstanding job with other computer animated films in the past...

When I left the theatre tonight, I was simply overjoyed with what I had seen over the 2 hour span...

The film is heartwarming and touching with a great array of characters that simply capture and encapsulate the viewer...From the first segment, you are taken away in an underwater environment and you just cant help but feel happy or sad throughout the movie...It plays with your emotions perfectly...

Another great Pixar film....10/10

28 May 2003,Pixar Has Done It Again!,"I saw this preview with my children and adult friends as well. Not one of us left the cinema without a smile on our face. What a pleasure! The animation was magic; the story line hooked young and old, alike; the characterizations were stellar. A ""must-see."" Don't miss it! My personal fave: Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. Phenomenal!

9 April 2010,"******** kid flick, with fish, amazing animation, lots of laughs","All children and families will want to watch this beautifully-animated film. It's all colorful 3-d graphics and a joy to watch. There are a few opportunities to learn things about fishes, but it's mostly about the journey to reunite father and son and about the laughs. There are lots of funny lines delivered by comedic geniuses Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres. Some small children will be frightened in two parts: The scenes with the sharks from about 19:15 to 24:30, and the part with the deep-sea angler fish from 33:00 to 35:15. The bit in the beginning with the barracuda would be scary but it's over very quickly.

Like nearly all popular children's movies, this one follows the formula where the child is separated from the parents early in the film. In this one the mother dies and the child (OK, a clown fish, not a child) is separated from his father. Reunion would seem impossible if not for the interventions of a series of colorful characters with remarkable abilities and unimaginable good luck.",8
29 December 2003,Another reason not to go fishing.,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",
14 June 2003,Great movie for everyone!,"Take your family! Go alone! Either way, you'll laugh at this film's clever humor and cute scenes. I almost guarantee it. I loved this movie. I'll even go out on a limb and say it was better than Toy Story. However, without Ellen Degeneres as Dory, I don't think I would have loved it as much. Ellen owned this film and kept me laughing from the first time she appeared on frame to the credits. Go watch this movie!

10 September 2003,"New move is a ""good one"" !","The Disney's produce films like they are making hamburgers (Disney works with McDonald's I believe). The cartoon work is being Industrialized and the old ""soul"" of the handwork is gone. In the past it took them at almost 1 1/2 year to make a movie with a lot of employees involved. Now the ""Managers"" have taken over the business, which is a threat to world peace anyway. The new move they make is a ""good one "". Computer animated "" 3D models which maybe gives a little bit back from what the have lost, their ""soul"" and in reality this means hopefully, less unbearable flat computer cartoon work in the future.

14 November 2003,Amazing Animation Movie,"What a good animation movie that Pixar and Disney has made. I have attracted since the first scene until the last credit (the credit itself is still attractive). I saw this movie in theater on my city late, and i think it wouldn't be crowded, but it still. This animation would be loved from all ages.

11 November 2003,Phenomenal,"I bought Finding Nemo over the weekend, and I have already watched it about a dozen times (my kids are hooked on the movie heh).

I adore the animation and the entire story. There are times when the movie drags, but most movies do in certain parts. I just love the idea of how realistic the movie is when it comes to learning about sealife. My kids have learned a ton of fun stuff from the movie *my daughter still can't get over how sea turtles can live to be up to 150 years old*.

The voice acting was absolutely marvelous . I don't believe they could have found a better cast.

24 November 2003,This is What Animation is All About,"Take cutting edge computer animation, add a stellar vocal cast, mix liberally with spectacular visual effects and a laugh-out-loud funny script, and you get something approaching ""Finding Nemo"". Trying to describe the movie would be as unsatisfactory as trying to describe what chocolate tastes like to a person who has never tasted it.

Pixar has created a movie that is aimed at all audiences, and finds the mark in each case. This is a rare movie that is well-suited to every age group (with the possible exception of the youngest children... there are some moments which might be a bit intense for toddlers). I admit I'm very glad I'm an adult so I could catch some of the jokes which might go over a younger audience's head, but that takes nothing away from this wonderful movie as a whole.

While the animation is utterly breathtaking, it's the vocal talents of Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, and a host of other perfectly chosen performers who make this movie such a constant delight.

Seeing this in the theatre first and later on DVD, I actually appreciate this gem of a feature more than when I first saw it on the big screen. It works incredibly in a theatre, but the DVD features were perfectly suited to digital media.

Just one final note... I wish that Pixar had run the ""Exploring the Reef"" featurette as an epilog to the movie. It's a ""mocumentary"" starring Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacque's son), and while it has a serious message, it's wonderfully funny and worth the price of the DVD set all by itself.",10
11 August 2004,Good fun,"This film was probably one of the best animated films that I have seen. Animated films these days entertain a wide range of audience, adults as well as young children. Finding Nemo is a great story of the father's search for his son in the big ocean. It shows young children how much their parents really do love them and care for them, as well as ntertaining the children at the same time. I ver much enjoyed this movie and now theres a lot of stuff like bags and t sirts mugs etc out with finding nemo on them, showing me that Finding Nemo has been a big seller and shall continue to entertain people whilst it is being seen. I give this film 10/10 for its wonderful entertainment!

21 May 2020,A movie that everybody can enjoy and learn from.,"""Fish are friend, not food."" Finding Nemo is a story about an overprotective father Marlin that has to travel across the sea to find his son Nemo that was captured by divers. On his journey to rescue his son he meets the forgetful but lovely Dory who has short term memory loss. As we join Marlin and Dory on their rescue mission, we also meet a variety of fishes from sharks to anglerfish. ""Finding Nemo"" is a joy to watch from the animations aspect to the story and characters. Every frame of the story is to further advance the plot at a nice and steady pace. This film also has a message that adults and children can learn from. Adults can learn how to let go and take chances and the lesson children could learn is that no matter how strong you think you are you'll always need parent figures in your life. All the characters are amazing and their voice actors, but Dory takes the spotlight in this movie. Between her forgetting everything and being such a cute and lovable fish, you just have to like her. We can't forget about the person who gave life to Dory, Ellen DeGeneres was absolutely amazing in this movie. This is another classic Pixar movie that stands the test of time and proves why Pixar is one of the best animation studios. This is a must-watch film for everyone.

31 May 2003,"Very good, engaging family movie","I took my three children, ages 2, 4 and 8 to see this film. They really enjoyed it - there was enough humor to keep them engaged and the bright colors and fun characters kept them watching instead of fidgeting as they do at lesser family fare. What I really liked were the little bits of adult humor sprinkled throughout. The kids found it funny, but the adults actually found it funnier. Disney and Pixar have once again created a fun family film that we won't mind watching over again in the years to come.

19 November 2003,"Good film, typical Disney though","Finding Nemo was really a great film for the family but I see Pixar is falling into Disney's dysfunctional family world though- they killed off Nemo's mother right away! What is it with Disney films and their world of single parents? Look at the past films, in Toy Story their was no mention of Andy's father at all, Bambi's mother gets shot, Cinderella's left to her wicked step-family after her parents die, Aladdin had no parents, Jasmine had only her father, the Little Mermaid, where was her mother? the legend of Tarzan was made for Disney with his parents being killed, and the list goes on and on! I would think that parents groups would be screaming their lungs out by now over these films still having the same plot. Me, I think it's funny because it's gotten to where I bet with others on whether the next Disney film will have 1 parent or no parents in it!

Besides this the film was great with Ellen DeGeneres obviously being the best part of the whole cast. I've never been much of an Ellen fan but she made me laugh pretty good with her character, Dory the short term memory fish. Great casting with her! In addition I got a kick out of the end credits with the ""swim byes"" and the interaction of the characters with the end credits rolling.

Pixar is on their way to becoming the best family entertainment on the big screen if they keep doing what they've been, but I think that they should separate themselves from Disney's orphan ideology!",

10 August 2003,Good animation makes not a good movie,"Allright - the animation and the bgs are cool. Really great pictures of reefs and the marine life. Well, but this is just all. I do not know what film other people have seen, but it must have been a Finding Nemo with a good story and strong characters. The constant action was to much. The beginning of the movie was just horrible - okay, it was not the first time, that characters in Disney-Movies died, but what was good circumnavigated in ""Tarzan"" when the gorilla baby was killed, in Finding Nemo it was a terrible solution to introduce Coral first with a speaking part and kill her instantly after a talk about the Clown-fish-family, the babies and so on. After this it was not a problem to me that Marlin was overprotective and always wanted the best for his disabled son (why did he need a stunted fin at all?). The biggest probem was Dori - If you ever knew someone who sufferd on Alzheimers disease, you will not find this fish funny - shame on you Pixar, this was not so nice, why couldn´t she just be silly? Bruce and his group was funny, but this did not save it. Most scenes where too tough and nothing for younger Kids - nevertheless it was also boring for adults most of the time. Fish are Friends - not Food - well, but what are the human characters in this movie - Monsters? I did not like this. Overfishing of the seas is one thing, caring for an aquarium another.

After this great trailer I expected more from it, better watch good old 2 D Animation next time - there is enough assortment from Studio Ghibli and a lot of Disney Classics to watch.",
27 February 2023,I love PIXAR,"I like it because it is Australian mate. I like the seagulls because they go like MOIT MOIT. My mum likes the pelican because he smashes into the window all the time. I like Eric Bana in it and the other guy. My mums favourite characters in it are probably Dory, the pelican, Nemo and the fish that's like BUBBLES! BUBBLES! It has a really good storyline. It is insanely funny, well maybe not insanely funny like very funny. My brother also really likes it. He likes the seagulls like me. Finally my dad thinks it is pretty good. I think dory is pretty funny as well. It is funny when she runs into marlin, Nemo's dad.

31 December 2003,"One of the year's best movies, animated or otherwise","Ignore the reviews claiming that ""Finding Nemo"" is great, but not Pixar Studios' best film. Ignore any comments on this page that point out flaws in the theme, humor, or sentimental plot. In fact, ignore everything you may have read about ""Finding Nemo"" and just see it for yourself. ""Nemo"" is Pixar's crowning achievement, and it's as close to perfect as any movie I've ever seen. EVERYTHING works in this film: the vocal performances are top-notch (particularly by Albert Brooks' Marlin and Ellen DeGeneres' Dory), the animation is nothing short of breathtaking, the dialogue is superbly written and genuinely hilarious at times, and the story is wonderfully simple, almost Zen-like. Disney's tendency to go overboard with the sentiment has been thankfully held back, so when an emotional moment comes along, you really feel it. No part of the movie drags, no scene seems out of place, and the entire thing will leave you captivated, whether you're 8 or 80. It's been so long since I've seen an honest-to-God masterpiece come out of the theatre, it might seem like I'm exaggerating, but rest assured: ""Finding Nemo"" deserves any and all praise it receives. This one's a keeper, folks.

28 December 2003,"Duuuudes, go see it!..","For a long time, I was (and still am) skeptical about Disney movies, whichever size and shape they come in. About 7 minutes into this one I was saying to myself, ""The artwork is amazing, CG (*I'm a computer person, so I yearn for really cool, CPU-intensive CG*) is totally unrivaled, but the story line sucks so bad, why I am watching another Disney tear-squeezer??""

Well, looks like after 15 minutes of run time Pixar guys had a brief meeting and said, ""Screw you, Disney, we are not letting you ruin another one!""

Please -- bear for exactly 15 minutes of the most syrupy kindergarten stuff (stunning visuals will help you, though you might feel guilty about watching this while wide awake, instead, say, shoveling the snow), and watch the 199% predictable slop explode into one of the most ironic, witty, and -- did I mention that? -- beautifully constructed CG cartoons of all time.

Did you like ""Shrek""? Well, this is not exactly ""Shrek"" material, but still IMDB 10 grade. Just because IMDB gives you only 10 points to choose from. On a scale of 100, ""Shrek"" would be 100, and ""Nemo"" would pull about 92.

Just sit back, settle yourselves; I repeat, you'll need to watch the first 15 minutes to grasp the plot (though not necessarily, there's enough redundancy in the dialogs for the late-comers (or the denser crowd)), and enjoy -- really enjoy! -- the rest.

You will see a couple of scenes where the Disney managers came back and tried to ruin (sorry, save! of course, save from the hand of perverted Pixarians!) the movie, but these episodes were only mildly irritating and quickly dissolved themselves without overall damage to the spectacular, weird and funny world of talking, blinking, breathing, flirting fish.

Worth to watch. Most probably worth to own, if anything, just to watch your favorite little charming scenes again and again.

Enjoy, /D",10
6 July 2003,Excellent!,"A must-see movie for kids of all ages.

Disney/Pixar Studios outdid themselves once again. The animation is flawless and the special effects are astonishing (notice the water, close to the surface). The humor is sharper as ever, similar to the one you saw in Monsters, Inc.

The character's voices, specially in the case of Ellen DeGeneres', couldn't be better.

Even the soundtrack, composed by Randy Newman's cousin, Tom, is amazing. Robbie Williams' version of Bobby Darin's classic ""Beyond the Sea"" gives the soundtrack a final touch.

10 stars for this one, no doubt about it. If you have kids, take them to the theater to watch it. If you don't, go anyway. You won't regret it.",7
1 May 2004,"Great fun, always entertaining","Finding Nemo is a modern animated masterpiece

I found this film thoroughly entertaining from start to finish! First of all the animation was fantastic, truly admirable. When the movie first came out, I immediately began to compare Finding Nemo to other recent animated classics (a la Shrek, Monster's Inc.) and found that it was surely a worthy adversary. Its plot, dialogue, and animation are all very original and Pixar seems to be always striving for a higher goal. Animators didn't simply do what had been done over and over again many times, but came up with something new and fresh to give audiences. And boy does it pay off.

Not to mention Finding Nemo's enormous success in the box office, I have yet to hear someone nay-saying about this movie. This film can be enjoyed by anyone, any age. Animated movies are beginning to evolve to appeal to a variety of audiences, and Finding Nemo is a very good example. The comedic dialogue is hilarious on many levels, for kids and parents alike, which gives it added appeal and all the more fun. I also found the sloo of characters all unique and funny in their own simple way. Dory, Nemo, Marlin, Bruce (the shark), Nigel (the pelican), and Crush (the turtle) are all very different, original, and hilarious characters that bring something differnt to the table. Also, the fact that the writers present several ironies and stereotypes to this characters adds to their hilarity; vegetarian sharks, surfer turtles, clownfish that aren't funny, mindless hungry seagulls, the list can go on and on.

In conclusion I found Finding Nemo original, hilarious, and fun for everybody; truly everybody. 4 out of 5.",9

5 June 2003,Amazing,"Absolutely amazing movie. Disney/Pixar have definitely out-done themselves. The animation must get an A++ as well as everything else. The plot line was great, and they couldn't have picked better actors/actress' for the voices. A must see. I assure you that you will not be disappointed. I'll be seeing it again for sure. 2 thumbs up! 10 stars!

10 December 2003,Nothing fishy about it: 'Finding Nemo' is an animated classic,"The 21st century has had its share of high-tech enhanced flicks, but the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" have proven that it is the inclusion of compelling characters and wonderful stories that makes for a great movie.

""Finding Nemo"" has everything a discerning moviegoer could hope for. Ellen DeGeneres's Dory and Albert Brooks' Marlin are perfect casting and this movie will lure in audiences of all ages. Hook, line and sinker.

1 June 2003,"Not Bad, But It's no Toy Story","Finding Nemo was clever, cute, well written and definitely a technical advance in animated story telling. It doesn't compare, however, to the first Pixar film I viewed - Toy Story.

My main complaint is that the story moves through so many locations (if I can use that term for an animated movie), that by the end, everything seems rushed. While I understand that the whole premise of the story is a journey, the writers might have been better off spending more time in three or four locales, than hurrying through 10+. That said, my daughter loved it!

6/10 (my daughter, 10/10)

30 May 2003,Pixar's Best...,"I have just returned from the most exciting movie I've seen in a long time! Finding Nemo is Pixar's BEST movie, replacing Toy Story (I know, I know, but its true) as the most visually imaginative animated movie. Its funny, DeGeneres is hilarious - her fish is perfectly animated, Brooks is sooooo much better than in the In-Laws, back to his true form - I loved every minute of this film. The celebrity voices are great; Allison Janney from West Wing is a wonderful starfish, Willem DeFoe, always a seductive voice, is a scar worn Tang, even the movie's creator, Andrew Stanton was greatness as the sea turtle Crush. This is one G rated film that is definitely for everyone, any age, any circumstances - see this alone, on a date, with your family - just go...I was swept away with not knowing what was going to happen next, the colors and visuals and the realisation of the sea - the humour, the storyline (a Dad prevails!) all add up to an A+, #1, Best Picture of the Year achievement. Applause, applause, applause to Pixar once again!

14 June 2003,One of the best children's movie in a long time...,"Finding Nemo has some of the best lessons to be learned. It was maybe a little more personal to me because I have a close relative (child) with a handicap similar to Nemo's. It has the tragedy (almost as heartwrenching as The Lion King), but it is a sweet, wonderful story about learning how to let go and how to understand and accept other people for who they are.

22 July 2003,Great Adventure- Unfunny,"I saw Finding Nemo today- I've been meaning to see it. I expected a great comedy. I was disappointed.

In case you've been living under a rock (or don't have TV) you've probably seen commercials for this. You also probably know that Marlin, a clownfish, has lost his son. With the help of Dory, he is determined to find Nemo, his son.

It has lots of colorful characters that I enjoyed watching. Each of the tank fish are equally unique. My favorite is Peach, probably.

The settings are very creative. The EAC is hilarious and imaginative, as well as the Jellyfish Forest.

The only problem I had is that is it's only mildly funny. It's awfully sad.

The Bottom Line: A wildly creative, mildly funny adventure! Two out of Four Chili Peppers!",
22 September 2003,A worth while animation,"The underwater sequences where spectacular, enriched with bright colors and fantastic effects. The story line was a little to simple for me and yet is probaly the best family adventure of the year with a light humour that gets all of the little kids laughing at every bump of a fish which can get a little irritating at the cinemas.

I take pride in being an Australian and it was good to see pixar getting real Australian's to do the voice's instead of some American impersonator's that give Australia a far from reality accent. Even with the Aussie actors the aussie slang was used far to often than what it is in reality. Really, why would a well educated dentist be calling people ""sheila"" and saying ""crikey"" and ""mate"" in every sentence. Anyway sheila is an old school word that only the middle aged bogens use these days. And crikey is Steve Irwins word. Not the best movie ive every seen id say it rate about 7/10

5 January 2004,Mine!,"Excellent movie! I'm not a big fan of animation, specially Disney movies, but this one was great! Funny characters (except Marlin, ""for a clownfish. he's not that funny""), topped by Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. She has the perfect voice for the part.

The story isn't that original (man looking for his son after losing him because of a fight) and parents with really young children might have a problem explaining what happens to Coral at the start of the movie, but the characters that Marlin meets are just hilarious. Sharks, jellyfish turtles, pelicans and seagulls (My favorites: Mine!) all help him out with his quest, or form some obstacle on the way. Must see movie!

Yes, but some truly *amazing* visuals, as always - there must be *something* there to make you part with your hard-earned. (and some parts of that something, for some reason, look very much like a screensaver common in Win98 days that I saw here and there... ??!!!! Maybe Pixar look for their inspiration in more mundane (and obvious!) places than I thought?.... :) )

9 July 2003,Best In a Long Time,"Okay, I admit it, I am a Disney fan, so deal with it.

That being said, ""Finding Nemo"" was one of the most enjoyable shows I have seen in a long time. I found the story line to be very well written, and extremely tight, with very little dead time on the screen.

There characters were superb, the graphics stunning and the ending so very typically Disney (not a bad thing.) I found myself smiling and laughing throughout the show.

This one is great for the kids, yet still entertaining for the adults!

13 November 2003,Eh...,"There's no way this movie is better than ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Notorious,"" or any of the other movies that have recently been edged out of the top 100 list. It was a nice movie, the animation was very fluid, and I wasn't bored, and that's about all I can say in favor of it. If you want even the slightest intellectual stimulation, search elsewhere, but if you're interested in having a basic message pounded into your head throughout the course of the an hour and a half, then by all means give it a try.

1 June 2003,Make that 5 for 5 for Pixar in 8 years!,"Outstanding! Disney and Pixar are a perfect match now for the 5th time straight!!

This movie has everything. The best digital animations to date, the story is classic yet intropective with a grand parental charm and wit coupled with brave and ingenious relationships, genuine heart-felt characters and a clean sweeping pace to the story.

It was a tremendous 2 hours of movie magic at its very best. I highly recommend this film. I can't wait for the dvd we will buy it and cherish it for years just as we do with Bugs life, the Toys Story's and Monsters Inc. have entertained us as well. This is a new level though, the water surface is incredible and real looking. New fresh look and feel for Pixar and Disney. My three year old and my 11 year old as my wife and I loved this film!!!

This is by far the best yet from Pixar/Disney. Thanks for raising the bar guys! A definate 10 out of 10!!!

-can I see it again, -please?!",
3 June 2003,Go Dory,"Ellen Degeneres is FANTASTIC as the voice of Dory in this movie, she totally makes the movie. Her character keeps you laughing from beginning to end, even during the parts where you feel like crying! She has a lot of talent, and the role was perfect for her sense of humor. The rest of that case also does an excellent job, I felt as if Disney made a quality effort to make this just as enjoyable for adults as for children, except for the poor little boy that sat behind me in the theater, ""It's too scary Mommy, I wanna go home!"" All of the other children really seemed to be having a good time.

Besides the animation, Ellen DeGeneres' work was the only real redeeming quality - she was wonderful. It is surely for kids and their parents.

31 May 2003,Heart-warming journey of Rescue,"The undersea adventure that Pixar presents is undoubtedly more fleshed out than Disney's ""Little Mermaid"". The characters are 'human', not just the bland sidekicks found in Disney movies, and the society of ""Fish Predators Anonymous"" was hilarious. Willem Dafoe is brilliant as the morose Gill.

I appreciate the factual detail in the movie. It is set in the Great Barrier Reef - *it* is the largest structure in the world built by living creatures, not New York - the East Australian Current does lead to New South Wales, clown fish are abundant near the Reef, and there are toxic jellyfish off the Northern coast of Australia. It was nice to listen to the marine life speaking with aussie accents.

But for the fifth time running, a Pixar movie is about a journey of rescue. The formula seems to be wearing out. There are obvious comparisons to be made with Miyazaki, who manages to come up with highly original themes each time a movie is made, making each of them a success. Why do Disney and Pixar not follow the lead? [And, how is a fart joke, good humour?]",10

1 June 2003,"Two thumbs way, way up! Pixar shines again!","I confess, I wasn't sure about Finding Nemo from the trailers. I was a little worried that this was a classic case of all the laugh lines being packed into a 2 minute version of the film.

Let me reassure you, it's not the case. The film is very funny - a laugh a minute - and over way, way too soon. The visuals are beautiful, the undersea depiction is for the most part true-to-life, the story is good, and the message is worthwhile.

In short, I loved it. Keep 'em coming, Pixar, while you've still got the magic in you!

1 August 2003,"Following in the footsteps of Shrek, NEMO exceeds in humor","Well, I can honestly say... I'm 23 and a guy, yet for one reason or another I find myself put in these situations to watch Children's movies. I've seen Shrek, which I loved. Now, I've seen Finding Nemo, which I love MORE. Ellen Degeneres had me, as well as other adults there with their children, cracking up throughout the movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. While I hate Albert Brooks with a passion, he was perfect for the role of Nemo's father (voice wise). He, however, was the only character I hated. But I loved all the Tank Fish, and Dory, and the Sharks, & others were all wonderful. I think any open minded person who can enjoy a laugh, or who can remember their youth, would enjoy this movie. For Children it is a fun cartoon full of adventure and surprise. For Adults it is a great movie that makes you reflect on your youth, and if you are a parent, yourself as a parent. It also gives you laughs you'd never expect to have in a movie like this. While Shrek was meaningful and romantic, Finding Nemo was hilarious and really got you into it and has another message to get to everyone and I HIGHLY Recommend you see this before it leaves theatres, and if it's too late.. Go out and get it on DVD ASAP, for yourself OR your Children.",10
13 September 2003,Realistic Animation,"Pixar has done an outstanding job on this one. For the last few years I have found out that every time I go to see an animated movie, it seems more realistic. The computer graphics are extremely fine tuned to match the character's personality and voice. The movie is inspiring on various levels. Firstly, the strong bonding between a father and son is depicted with exceptional clarity. The first school-going experience is so close to human experience that kids can immediately relate to it. It makes one wish , every kid had a affectionate and daring father like Marlin. For those kids (or adults) who have'nt known a father's love, the father-son scenes could be quite emotional. Secondly, the general underlying message of preserving marine life in its pristine form is well conveyed. The current commercial fishing practice of trawling the ocean floor clean with utter disregard to any life is shocking to say the least. I hope people and governments take notice and do something to prevent the destruction of the last frontier on this planet. Overall the movie is thoroughly enjoyable whether you are kid or an adult.

25 April 2004,Up there with The Nightmare Before Christmas and Toy Story.,"When I originally saw the poster for this film (big empty space with a single fish), I instantly wanted to watch it, as I thought it was just beautiful. However, then I saw the trailers, and thought it just looked like a typical cutesy disney kids film.

Today I watched it on VHS, and realised that my original ideas of what it would be like were indeed accurate. Within five minutes of the film starting, we given one of the most emotive scenes I've ever seen in a children's film, and it actually makes you feel stupid for getting so worked up over a film which is meant for children!

The story is predictable, which is understandable as I doubt Pixar wanted to bewilder the children. However, this is made up for as the character development is great, as we see the isolated culture of the fish tank, and the class system between the different sea creatures (crabs being simple tramps, turtles being richer 'californian' thrillseekers etc.)

The way the film has been made is also great, with the amazing endless underwater landscapes, and the brilliant musical score from Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Six Feet Under). The film has the poetry of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, with the tongue-in-cheek humour of Toy Story, and the emotion of Watership Down, making it one of the best children's films I have ever been fortunate enough to see.",10
14 June 2003,"A fantastic movie, about a little fish called Nemo who is swept into adventures above and under the sea!","A fantastic movie, about a little fish called Nemo who is swept into adventures above and under the sea! Nemo is the only remaining fish after his brothers, sisters, and mother have a dreadful experience with a shark. His father becomes overprotective of Nemo especially after Nemo is taken by a scubadiver and placed in a fish tank at a dentist's office. While wildly searching for Nemo, his father meets a comedic fish who suffers from short term memory loss. The two have adventures under the sea and meet an oceanful of fun!

5 June 2003,"Amazing Animation, Colorful Characters, Terrific Tale!","I have always been a Big fan of animated films, ex. Alladin, Beauty and The Beast, Toy Story, etc. Yet, I have felt of late the animated pictures have been lacking the depth in story and the beauty in animation that they once held. Finding Nemo has truly, in my opinion, found those elements again. I was greatly entertained with the films intriguing characters and profound plot. True it is just a cartoon but it was better than your average cartoon: It relayed the message of letting go. Many people know from experience what it is like to loose a loved one and how that loss effects how a person lives his or her life. Finding Nemo relayed this concept in a very gentle and truthful way. A+ Well done Pixar and Disney. Thanks for going back to the good Days.

3 June 2003,You'll like it,"I think that this film was beautifully done. The voice talents were perfect for their characters. I think that Helen DeGeneres deserves special mention for her zany character. I'd like to know how much of what she said she made up and how much was scripted. If it was all scripted, she's a genius because her lines sound absolutely spontaneous. The animation was poignant and extremely accurate. It shows that these guys did their marine life homework before making this film. The story is (as most are) an old one of growing up and letting go but I am particularly grateful to the writers for not putting too many fight/nagging scenes as most movies/TV programs do when they use this type of plot. Why they decided for the story to take place in Australia I have no idea but hey, why not? This is truly a universally appealing movie that would be good for anyone to see.

19 July 2004,Not up to Pixar's usual standard?,"I finally got around to seeing this on DVD. I was looking forward to it, but I was rather disappointed - compared to Pixar's other work. I don't know how it could be rated higher than either of the Toy story's.

Sure it's technically fantastic, and there are some good moments (Bruce the Shark for example) - but it left me cold. For me there are couple of reasons.

I would say it's the most ""Disney like"" of all the Pixar films so far (and for me that's a bad thing!) - all rather preachy and predicable. Although at least there was no bursting into song!

I think it could have done with some trims at the editing stage - the film is 20+ mins longer than Toy Story, and you notice it. The Turtle & Jellyfish scenes dragged on, and seemed unnecessary to me.

Let's hope The Incredibles is a return to form for 'older' viewers.",6
5 June 2003,A Find,"The best so far to come out of Pixar-Disney. True to form, the computer-digital effects are fantastic.

Ellen Degeneres is the most talented of the voices we hear in this delightful underwater tale. Her performance allows for her blue tane character, Dory, to come alive in so many beautiful and hilariously entertaining ways.

""Finding Nemo"" features numerous sea mines, possessively-hungry seagulls (""Mine, Mine, Mine!"") and aquatic acquaintances that reinforce the importance of friendship.

The plot is a rehash of other more familiar Disney films. You won't have trouble listing them. And you won't have to bring the kids with you to watch it. Most of the audience I saw this film with were well over 18yrs of age. Slightly irritating is the fact that the narrative continuously bounces back and forth between the two separated clown fish (Marlin and his son Nemo), and the film appears to run 15 minutes too long for my otherwise liberal attention span.",

14 June 2003,A very funny movie,"Rarely have I actually laughed out loud in a movie theater 6 times. Probably the best comedy since, Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The jokes were good for both adults and kids. The second best thing may be that the plot was not just a pretense it actually was nice.

16 July 2003,Awe-inspiring animation does not a watchable movie make,"First things first. Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks aren't funny. They never have been. So when Disney slots this bungling pair as the voices of the two lead characters in FINDING NEMO, then we haven't got much to look forward to. Or have we? After all, the animation is stunning. And once we get past the fact that Degeneres' voice comes from a fish actually modeled to look like her, then it is momentarily possible to get lost in the pixelated splendor of Disney's greatest animating achievement to date. The sea sparkles with the magical touches of what must have been countless talented, tireless animators. But is this enough? The plot stinks like a rancid Freudian family drama. And the missing sexual tension between the two lead characters (both single) is a glaring mistake. But it does have something going for it. Almost every scene on land is fantastic. The comedy is spot on, and the noticeable disparity between good jokes and great timing (on land) and dull, tiresome jokes in the sea (where most of the movie is spent, and where Brooks and Degeneres flounder along, oblivious to their own inanity) make the humor on land seem that much better. Overall, however, the movie is unbearable. It's one thing for it to be unswervingly predictable. Sure, every Disney movie is. But getting from beginning to end doesn't have to seem like a chore, a penance for some wrong that i didn't realize i committed. Or maybe the wrong was simply buying the movie tickets and supporting Disney. And i sure got punished for that.",
20 July 2003,Pixar have done it again,"After seeing a brief trailer for this on the Monsters Inc dvd,I couldnt wait to see this movie.But I was shocked to find out we wouldnt be getting a release in the UK until October.Luckily for me I had a trip to New York planned so I made sure a visit to the movies was planned.All I could say is wow,it lives up to Pixars high standards and it got a big thumbs up from my eight year old son.Everything from the characters to the animation is nothing short of spectacular,I will certainly be paying another visit to the movies again in October when it is released here.It is just a shame they couldnt have released it here for the summer.But as the saying goes all good things come to those who wait.UNMISSABLE

16 December 2003,Ow yeah incredibly!!!,"Well my favorite Disney film still is Lilo & Stitch but this one is truly going second!

I know I know most of you won't agree with me but I'm a Disney lover of the new generation and the old. And movies like Atlantis the lost Empire, Treasure Planet and especially Lilo & Stitch entertain me just as well as Alladin and the Lion King did for me while I was little!

Finding Nemo is truly great on itself and profits from truly beatifull animation work! The story is adorable and the characters are perfect for young and old! I liked Dory the little female fishy suffering from a short-term memory loss. D0h I also liked Memento would it be because of that?

Well not much to say further, excellent animation, voice acting and a perfect story about a dad who has to look for his sun in the ocean(it's much better as it sounds.)

Disney (Pixar actually) still rules and as long as they keep up the good work I will be watching this movies till I am dead!

9 January 2004,Another Disney Classic,"I liked everything about this film. To me it has the important message that a parent would do anything for their child,which is important considering there's so much turmoil going on in the world today. Finding Nemo is a very entertaining film for all ages......looks like Disney and Pixtar did it once again!

1 May 2004,Giggle,"I thought this was precious. Even if you're not a kid you'll still love it. In every Disney movie I've ever seen there are always jokes that kids will never get but the adults always pick up on. Nemo is no different. And the characters are so funny. There's this one character named Bubbles, he lives in a fish tank and every time this little treasure chest opens it let's out little bubbles. And every time they come out he races over to it screaming ""Bubbles! Bubbles! My bubbles!"" He's just so funny. And the sea turtles are awesome! Totally. =], anyhow, it's really such a wonderful movie, and you really feel for the characters. All Nemo is trying to do it get home to his daddy. Its so sad, but he's got great friends to help him out! Very cute, A+!

5 July 2004,Funny!,"Finding Nemo is a very funny movie!I absolutely loved it.The story follows a father who is overprotective of his son.On the first day of school, Marlin(father) believes that his son,Nemo, is not yet ready for school ,but Nemo thinks otherwise and swims in to open sea and gets fishnapped and Marlin goes in search of him.On the way, he meets a fish with short-term memory loss named Dory and she helps him look for his son.

They also meet a couple of sharks and some totally far out sea turtles.Meanwhile,Nemo is welcomed to a club with a bunch of fish he meets in a tank in a dentists office.And I'll leave the rest for you to watch.

Kids and adults of all ages will most definitely love it.Overall 10/10 stars.

9 July 2004,Pixar has done a good job..,"Finding nemo is not the best film that Disney has ever created, however it can be said that it's very good. I've watched 3 times.. The events in the movie are easily estimated while we are watching. There is not so much surprises but the humor and the characters are fantastic. The kid turtles and vegetarian sharks are very nice.. The story is around a little crown fish which is kidnapped by the people who are living in Sydney.. His father wants to find him and there are humorous events while searching.. The colors are so vivid and the atmosphere of the ocean is very well designated.. I recommend the film but not strongly, It's nice but not perfect.. It can attract the children and it's a family name.

4 August 2003,not a classic,"Pixar has created a visually stunning animated movie. I could spend all day staring at this great animated aquarium that ""Nemo"" has delivered. Nemo with its great animation is worth seeing! but only seeing. the fact than many people are calling this a classic makes me wonder what movie they saw. What makes a classic animated movie is a good story and strong characters. I believe Nemo fails on both counts. The story line is a basic one. We follow the path of two fish, nemo and his father marlin as they get seperated and their attempt to reunite. The scenes depicted are nicely done but you feel like you are being swept from one scene to another, the segways are missing. The story line is not deep enough so you can walk away feeling that you missed something in the storyline, which in fact you haven't, there just isn't anything else there. The film is also missing out on strong characters. The main characters would all be considered good supporting charcters, but unfortunately are asked to carry the movie. But in their defense how much character can a fish have? The point being is that finding nemo is a beautifully animated film about fish delivering a bunch of comedic lines telling a simple story that makes you want more than it delivers. To me a classic delivers more than you want.",4
13 January 2004,A Children's Movie???,"I really can't describe my distaste for a children's movie in which you have to skip the entire first scene so as not to give the children nightmares. It really wasn't necessary to SHOW how Nemo and his father came to be alone. The animation is superb, but I expected, after all the build-up I'd read and heard, to hear a lot more laughter from the children watching it. This flick can't hold a candle to ""Monsters, Inc.""

2 June 2003,Cute characters but too stressful.,"This movie was full of great characters but I was disappointed that it was one non-stop stressful scene after another. My four year old was traumatized. You couldn't even sit back and enjoy the fantastic comedy because the main characters were on the verge of death in practically every scene. What's with all the murdered/dead parent themes in Disney movies anyway? Monsters Inc. and Bug's Life both had much better balances of funny scenes and exciting/scary scenes.

5 May 2015,An Outstanding Movie for All,"""Finding Nemo,"" is an excellent movie for viewers of all ages. In this movie, three valuable life lessons are shared: 1) parents protect their children because they love and care for them, 2) teamwork is important in being successful, and 3) your differences do not define you. These lessons can apply to viewers of all ages and are presented throughout the course of the movie.

Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" was nearly flawless. From the outstanding animation, to the talented voices of actors/actresses, to the entertaining jokes and plot, I find this to be one of Disney Pixar's best movies.

11 June 2003,Not Pixar's best,"I love the Toy Story movies and enjoyed Monsters Inc., so I was looking forward to Finding Nemo. Unfortunately, Nemo was not nearly as enjoyable as Pixar's other fine movies.

I found very few genuine laughs in Nemo. I thought Dory, a fish with short term memory, was cute and had a few funny moments, but otherwise the movie fell flat. A lot of the jokes were just not funny. Some of the characters were your typical run of the mill cartoon characters, such as the 'surfer-dude' turtle, which I could have done without.

Technically, Nemo looks great. The visuals are good. But, I can't help thinking with the whole underwater world that they could not come up with more dazzling characters other than shark, turtle, whale, etc...

The bottom line is that Nemo is a pretty movie that ends up feeling empty with very few laughs and flat characters. I give it a 5 out of 10.",5
16 April 2006,Grrrreat!!,"what a great film. i went to see it with my two girls and we had the best of times. Scary, interesting, full of adventure, intelligent, hopeful, and everything i didn't mention. I loved it and my kids loved it!! Every once in a while Hollywood does produce a good think, especially for kids. When I was young it was snowithe. I remember how great that film was and I felt my girls were having the same experience as i did 30 years earlier. I wish Hollywood wasn't so much about stupidity; rather produce something that is good for the whole humanity and for the kids. I'd give it a 10 just because it has an educational value to it!

23 June 2003,The sea monkey took my money! (You have to see the movie.),"I'm not a parent or an artist, so I can't comment on how kid-friendly this movie is or anything about the technical aspects. I can say, however, as a relatively intelligent 35-year old, I loved this movie. I laughed harder (mostly at Ellen DeGenerges' character Dori) than I've laughed in a movie in a long time. (Even the short before the feature presenation was really funny.) I never really had any doubt how the movie would end, but still enjoyed how it got there. Albert Brooks and Allison Janney were also standouts. The sharks ""in recovery"" were great too.

Tip - - Stay for the little bonus scene within the first couple of minutes of the end credits.

27 June 2006,Brilliant Film,"What can I say about this movie? One word - Brilliant. Pixar have had a long track record of having yet to make anything less than a very good film but even though its almost unanimously agreed that all of them have been great, it seems everyone still has their preferences. To give you an idea of my taste I just adore ""A Bug's Life"" which I think is pretty much a pitch perfect movie with great characters and story. I enjoyed ""Toy Story"" but wasn't a huge fan of it, the sequel however is an absolute classic hands down. After 'Bugs' and 'TS2' though came ""Monsters Inc"" which again was a really good movie but I wasn't a huge fan of as the ""Where the Wild Things Are""-cloned concept was fine but like TS1 the film got too juvenile and sentimentally sweet for me with the humor just worth the odd giggle more than anything else and only the awesome 'doors' sequence standing out in my mind.

'Nemo' however has now taken the crown - its at least equal best with TS2 and the more I think about it the more its rising to be stand out Number One. EVERYTHING about this movie is practically flawless - the animation, the characters, the story, the emotional resonance, the humor, etc. is incredible. Its a film you can't help but get swept up in right from the get-go, in fact I can't remember a film where I really ran the gamut of emotions from happy and awed to despair and terror - and this film manages to do all that in just the opening five-minute sequence. Its a 100 minute underwater road movie but never ever gets slow or tired and even some Disney-style father-son sentimentality bits oddly enough generate genuine heart and warmth.

*Ellen DeGeneres deserved an Osar nomination for her flawless performance as Dory.",10
12 July 2006,The Best Piece of Disney and Pixar,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE! You like coke? This movie will make you love water!! The friendly (or not) expressions from the characters, the funny and perfectly matched voices, the story, the idea, and everything is awesome! The soundtrack is what I like the most, maybe. Thomas Newman is for me an inspiration and my distractor (for good) on every occasion! The Ending song makes me wanna cry... And every moment of this movie is preceded by his music, which creates a natural, exotic, and beautiful climate.

About the animation, is Pixar my friends! It's perfect!

I highly recommend this movie. One of my favorites (I saw the latinoamerican Spanish and English version, i liked both a lot!). It's the perfect movie for every occasion, for adults, kids, and teenagers too!

5/5 *****",10
19 July 2006,2003's Best,"The latest in a string of tightly written and superbly animated features from Pixar Studios, who have risen to become gods of animation. Finding Nemo begins with one of the darkest openings in Disney cartoon history, telling the story of a father clown-fish named Merlin who loses his wife and all but one of his hundreds of fish eggs in a tragedy destined to make you think twice about ordering fish and chips for dinner. Marlin becomes the over-protective father of Nemo, his sole surviving child who is kidnapped by a scuba diving dentist and placed in a fish tank in his operating room. Thus the search begins, and Marlin must travel through the Great Barrier Reef to rescue his son, conquering his fears and meeting all sorts of strange and interesting creatures on the way (Bruce, a shark battling a ravishing fish addiction, is particularly memorable) The story thrives on simplicity, riding a singular concept all the way to a gloriously satisfying conclusion, and the script is choc-a-block full of gags and one-liners that are genuinely funny for all ages. This, in fact, is the perfect family movie: gorgeous to look at, tightly wound and high-octane, without a trace of pretension or dumb-downed ideals that so frequently condescend the younger market. Finding Nemo is one of the best animated films ever made, a glorious awe-inspiring tale comparable to classics like The Lion King.",10
20 July 2006,Animation Masterpiece,"I never thought I would rave about a movie about fish. Actually, this story is about much more than that. It is about family and love and a tender relationship between a father and a son. I am not going to lie. At the end of this movie, I really teared up and almost cried. This movie was very heartfelt and it's definitely, without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen this year.

The casting in this movie was sheer perfection. Brooks and Gould do great as the father and son, but the standout of the movie, is of course, Dory, voiced by the great Ellen DeGeneres. This is the best voice-over work since Robin Williams in Aladdin. A truly stellar voice over job with so many LOL moments. Also great was the 'tank gang,' as I like to call them. Great voice-over works from Garrett, Dafoe, and Janney.

The script for this movie is so fresh and so amazing that it crosses age barriers. It is a simple story that goes very far.

Two 50 year-old, a 19 year-old, and a year-old all laughed equally during this movie. It truly is a movie for all ages. A funny and heart-tugging story for everyone.

Nothing more to say that hasn't already. This is one GREAT movie.",10
2 December 2019,Best pixar movie ever,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I selected it for a movie review in high school and watched it more than 5 times in a row. The ultimate mix, sadness and joy, as usual in Disney movies was certenly included this time.

22 July 2006,Animated Greatness,"Finding Nemo contains a message slightly more complex than usually associated with family films, but as written and co-directed by Andrew Stanton, it's eloquently presented in a context that carries it through with potency. Stanton doesn't shy away from trauma -- the film contains its share, including an opening tragedy that rivals the shooting of Bambi's mother, but also pays respect to the precarious and predatory nature of undersea life. Everything is part of the food chain in the nautical world. It's the best circle of life message since Disney's The Lion King.

The film is awash in humor -- the sharks, for instance, are fearsome in their toothy glory. But these guys are also going through a 12-Step program -- ""Fish are friends, not food "" -- adding a wacky hilarity (when one of them goes for Marlin, the other two rush to block, crying out ""Intervention! ""). One of the movie's funniest bits is also one of its most dazzling, as Marlin and Dory encounter a school of fish who, as a collective, are adept at impersonations. Finding Nemo keeps the excitement quotient on high -- sometimes a little too high, as the action gets to be dizzying in spots. And the narrative transitions between the ocean and the dentist's office are structurally awkward.

The film possesses a luster and beauty never before seen in an animated film, computer or otherwise. The refraction of light, the gentle, cresting wave of sea anemones, the constant flutter of fish, sets up a background environment that is constantly in motion. The computing power alone needed to render this kind of realism is staggering. Finding Nemo lures you into its world, to the point where you feel almost as though you are floating under the sea. It's a remarkable achievement, a perfect pairing of genuine artistry with technology.

Stanton and co-director Lee Unkrich coax stunning vocal performances out of an A-List cast. Albert Brooks, one of my own personal favorites, gives an anything-but-floundering performance as Marlin, the consummate neurotic-yet-loving parent. But it's DeGeneres who steals every frame of film as Dory, who, in an inspired touch, has no short-term memory. And you will not soon forget the brilliantly funny sequence in which Dory attempts to communicate with a whale. DeGeneres transcends the character's surface humor and winds up providing the film's most poignant, heartfelt performance. If there were an Oscar for best portrayal of a tropical fish, our Ellen would win by more than a fin.",10
24 July 2006,Grade A Quality,"I'm always consistently amazed at what Pixar is able to do. With each passing film, they improve their craft again and again, transporting us to worlds where toys talk, insects can make inventions, and where monsters live and work just like we do. With their latest release, ""Finding Nemo,"" I am reminded once again why I love going to the movies.

The environment of the film is painfully detailed and realistic. My favorite example occurs in the salt-water fish tank that Nemo is being held in. In order to escape, the fish have to sabotage the tank. When they do sabotage it, the tank begins to get dirty instantly. If you've ever had a salt-water tank, you know that as soon as the little bubble thing stops working, the grim begins to gather and start forming in the tank almost instantly. It's such a great touch.

Two of my favorite scenes involved the jellyfish forest and the inside of the whale. Marlin and Dory have to race through a jellyfish forest. All around are these pink orbs with tentacles and the animation is sharp and quick. It is a heart racing sequence that I honestly feel had the same excitement level of the car chase scene in ""The Matrix Reloaded."" The whale scene is just beautifully detailed, particularly on the whale's tongue. I honestly thought it was a real tongue.

Speaking of real, Pixar has the incredible ability to cause you to forget that toys, insects, monsters, and now fish aren't actually human. They talk just like humans do (""What is with men and asking for directions?""). A standout scene occurs when Marlin has given up and saving Nemo and is ready to abandon Dory and go back to the reef. Dory gives an impassioned, demonstrative plea to not give up and keep her on as a friend, something that she sees Marlin desperately needs. The scene does not at all feel out place in this tightly paced film.

The reason this film works is because these fish seem human and because the fish display their voice's owners great. Even if you've just seen the previews for ""The In-Laws,"" you can see that Albert Brooks has experience playing the nervous, frantic, neurotic worrywart. Marlin's facial expressions even resemble a few of Brooks'. Dafoe's Gill is edgy, but has a hint of quiet desperation lined with hope of getting back to his home waters and out of that awful tank. But the real scene stealer is DeGeneres as Dory. Scatterbrained, peppy, light-hearted, and caring with an obvious intelligence, Dory is simply the core of the film. DeGeneres deserves an Oscar nomination for such a fine performance.",10
6 November 2003,Home Alone with Fish,"First off: the animation work is excellent. From a technical perspective this is a fine movie. It also has a few truly funny moments (sharks) and fairly decent voice-acting..

But this movie is terribly reminiscent of half the sitcoms and children's movies out there. It is like a cross-section of California stereotypes were given plastic surgery and dropped in water. The formula has been been tortured to death by Hollywood in general and Disney in particular.

Thus, Finding Nemo makes good watching for young children and people who don't see many films, but movie-lovers will find it boring and stale.

On the whole not a bad movie, but hardly an original piece of work: 3/5..

12 February 2023,Nearly perfect,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",10
30 May 2003,Rock on!,"Yeah Pixar! Rock it! You're 5 for 5 and have never made a bad movie. Not many people can say that... enjoy it! Stick it to Disney when you get your chance! Excellent voice work all around.. Albert Brooks may have been a little wasted but Ellen more than made up for it. Oh and I'm sick of all the whining about her being cast in the movie. She's a comedian. She's paid to be funny. She is funny. Nemo is a funnier movie because of her. Quit it! Let the woman do her job. Should Disneyworld start refusing to hire gay people? Come on!

I just can't believe Pixar has successfully made me feel I'm 'in' the oceans with the rest of the millions and billions of fishes! The animations were flawlessly realistic. Everything shown was superb! I will most definitely recommend this movie to friends/people! trust me, it's worthwhile!

10 September 2003,Will be regarded as a modern day classic,"Isn't it great that in these times of war, terror and fear that there is a company like PIXAR, who can produce wonderful, entertaining and intelligent movies. Finding Nemo is their best work yet, but I say that after each of their movies( Toy Stories 1 & II, Monsters INC etc). To achieve such magical effects is a wonderous feat, but to combine this with a magnificent script and to have such brilliant character actors such as Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, and Geoffrey Rush, to name a few, justs tops it off for me. Remember the Wizard of Oz?..... I believe that in many Years to come, when we are long gone.... Finding Nemo will be referred to in the same way... a magical movie classic!

23 September 2003,an instant classic,"A remarkable movie. One of the best animated movie of all time. It has great characters, a load of funny dialogue, and artistic images that only Pixar can create. It's a story of an overprotective father, doing his duty as a single parent for his only son, Nemo. The father, named Marlin, went panic when Nemo got caught by some divers. So, began the journey of finding his son, Nemo (who's now in the aquarium with other fish). Marlin met a forgotful fish named Dory who helped him in finding his son. On the other hand, Nemo and the aquarium gank desperately wanted to get out from the aquarium. This story is full of message, that parents should be more trustful to their children. That teamwork can solve your problems. That, even if you're a handicapped person, doesn't mean that you can't do anything. Doesn't mean that you have to be protected. It's a family entertainment with heavy message. It's an animated feature at it's most amazing graphics. You'll actually feel wet while watching this movie. It's like you are one of the fish in the computer generated ocean.

Finding Nemo takes animation technique further than what Toy Story did. You just have to see it to believe it. What I love the most about this movie is the richness of it's characters. You'll immediately love Marlin, Dory, Nemo and other characters in this picture. Because they are so real. So funny. So memorable. Finding Nemo has a big strenght in comedy too. Just hear the dialogue and get ready to laugh out loud. There's plenty of jokes here. The clownfish who isn't funny. Sharks who don't eat fish. A pelican who befriend with fish. Sea turtles who talks like surfers. As Pixar said, you just gotta sea it. Sea it. It's better than any of the recent Disney films. It's a treasure, and shares a room with Beauty and The Beast, Lion King, Aladdin and others as the best family entertainment of all time. See it, you won't be disappointed, you'll love it, you'll thank me for that, and you'll know that I'm not lying. 9/10",
6 June 2003,Not Just a Kid's Movie,"It seems as though rated ""G"" movies are often under-advertised and never really make money or are even worth watching. Generally they're made specifically for children and any humor in the movie is lost on those over the age of seven. Pixar, in the past, has defied these common sentiments with movies like Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, and Monster's Inc. Pixar continues to defy standard Hollywood practices with the release of Finding Nemo.

This movie is, by at least a little bit, the best rated G movie I've ever seen. Monster's Inc comes in a little behind in second place. The animation in this movie is incredible, the water, the fish, the particles of dirt floating in the water...there were many points when I would watch the movie and could definitely not be sure whether I was looking at a real or animated sea-scape.

The story...the story wasn't anything particularly groundbreaking other than the setting...father loses his son, will do anything to find him. In this case, anything includes taking on sharks, jellyfish, pelicans and other random sea monsters. The father, Marlin, is a clownfish that defies his name by being particularly unfunny...luckily he picks up a sidekick early on with a short term memory problem - a little memento-esque.

Nemo, the son, is captured by divers and put in an aquarium in Australia, where he meets several psychotic fish including ""Gills,"" another fish from the open sea - whose voice belongs to William Dafoe (in a non-bad guy role!).

Of course, being a comedy, the movie does have a happy ending, but the ending isn't nearly as much fun as the trip taken to get there. The movie is great, I went along with two college age friends, and they both laughed as much as I did. If a kid's movie can make three college students laugh as hard as we did...it is definitely worthwhile seeing. The movie is genuinely funny and worth watching with the entire family. The movie is safe for small children, though there are a couple of potentially scary scenes that might frighten *really* young children. However, I would definitely recommend going to a later showing...after most children would be in bed. I made the mistake of watching ""Ice Age"" at 5 PM - and the theater was unfortunately filled the the laughter/screams/crying of children, which took a little away from the movie for me.

One more thing - Pixar shares a short 3-5 minute computer animated short. In fact, it was the first short ever created by Pixar. The short was also very humorous and just made the whole movie experience more enjoyable. There was also a preview for Pixar's upcoming movie: ""The Incredibles"" which seems to be about a dysfunctional family of aging superheroes which I can only assume will be just as enjoyable and amusing as ""Nemo.""",
6 June 2003,Not Just a Kid's Movie,"It seems as though rated ""G"" movies are often under-advertised and never really make money or are even worth watching. Generally they're made specifically for children and any humor in the movie is lost on those over the age of seven. Pixar, in the past, has defied these common sentiments with movies like Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, and Monster's Inc. Pixar continues to defy standard Hollywood practices with the release of Finding Nemo.

This movie is, by at least a little bit, the best rated G movie I've ever seen. Monster's Inc comes in a little behind in second place. The animation in this movie is incredible, the water, the fish, the particles of dirt floating in the water...there were many points when I would watch the movie and could definitely not be sure whether I was looking at a real or animated sea-scape.

The story...the story wasn't anything particularly groundbreaking other than the setting...father loses his son, will do anything to find him. In this case, anything includes taking on sharks, jellyfish, pelicans and other random sea monsters. The father, Marlin, is a clownfish that defies his name by being particularly unfunny...luckily he picks up a sidekick early on with a short term memory problem - a little memento-esque.

Nemo, the son, is captured by divers and put in an aquarium in Australia, where he meets several psychotic fish including ""Gills,"" another fish from the open sea - whose voice belongs to William Dafoe (in a non-bad guy role!).

Of course, being a comedy, the movie does have a happy ending, but the ending isn't nearly as much fun as the trip taken to get there. The movie is great, I went along with two college age friends, and they both laughed as much as I did. If a kid's movie can make three college students laugh as hard as we did...it is definitely worthwhile seeing. The movie is genuinely funny and worth watching with the entire family. The movie is safe for small children, though there are a couple of potentially scary scenes that might frighten *really* young children. However, I would definitely recommend going to a later showing...after most children would be in bed. I made the mistake of watching ""Ice Age"" at 5 PM - and the theater was unfortunately filled the the laughter/screams/crying of children, which took a little away from the movie for me.

23 October 2003,Grab Shell for the ride of your life!,"If you haven't seen this movie get down to the cinema before you miss out on the best film of all time! It is without a doubt the sweetest, funniest, most exciting film I (and many others) have seen in years! The backgrounds are beautiful and so life-like! And I can barely find words to describe the characters. They are superbly animated and are brought to life by some extremly talented actors. If (and I very much doubt it) you aren't sure of the plot, here's an insight to it: After the death of his wife and 399 children, Marlin the Clownfish becomes over-protective of his only surviving son, Nemo. When Nemo gets tired of his fathers protectiveness, he abandons the safety of his home and ends up being captured by an Austrailian diver. Nemo then finds himself in the company of the 'Tank Gang' in a dentists office tank. Meanwhile, Marlin desperatly tries to find his son, with the help of the memory-losing, optimistic and Danger-Prone Dory, a Regal Blue Tang fish. Together they encouter vegitarian sharks, a forest of Jellyfish, the EAC-surfing turtles and many more colourful characters in this story about the seas most dedicated father, Marlin and the funniest fish in the world, Dory. I am positive that any Disney-Pixar, fish or touching-movie fan will not be able to resist the brilliance of this film. Treat yourself to Disney-Pixars Greatest acheivement, Finding Nemo! 10/10!

18 July 2003,Awesome!,"This has to be one of the best animated movies ever! It was funny, exiting, well animated, and suitable for all age groups (well, really young ones might find it a bit scary). The animation was unbelievable - there were scenes that could have been straight out of a photograph, if things weren't moving in it. Of course, the characters don't look that realistic, but they are still very well animated, I was impressed as usual by Pixar's talent. I thought the acting was great, the characters were very well done, and the dentist scenes were just funny beyond belief. And the sea turtles. I usually don't like Disney movies, but this one takes the cake.

31 May 2003,"So cute, and so much fun!","What a cute movie! I saw the previews for it and I was excited, but I wondered how many other people in their early 20's would be excited to see a little fish movie. But tonight the theater was packed with people of all ages. I laughed so hard and was very entertained. The voices were great [Ellen DeGeneres was awesome!] and the special effects were very impressive. I can't wait to buy the DVD! :) A definite must-see: 10/10.

22 July 2003,Finding Nemo is an amazing film.,"Finding Nemo is a very well done movie. The graphics are incredible, the characters are funny, and its a great story. Although it may leave some children under 4 traumatized,(between the angry sharks, exploding mines, and the barracuda attack)it is a great movie for all ages except toddlers.

24 June 2003,The best movie from Pixar to date,"Finding Nemo was the best movie produced at Pixar studios to date. I am so glad this company didn't go under. this movie had enough of everything to keep you interested the entire time. Bruce was my favorite character, but only by a little over Crush.

2 June 2003,I LOVED IT!!!,"OK, I am thirteen years old. I had no intention of seeing Finding Nemo. However, my little sister decided that she wanted to and asked if I wanted to go too. I probably wouldn't have gone, except that the last two Disney movies I had seen (Monsters Inc. and Lilo & Stitch) had actually been pretty good. Those I had seen on DVD, so this time I decided to see it in theatres.

Let me tell you, I am SOOOOO glad I went! The animation was AWESOME- I have never seen water portrayed so realistically in an animated film before. The storyline was great too, not so many sad moments that it killed the film but not so many funny parts that half the movie was completely pointless to the plot. Plus, you've got your suspenseful OMG-a-shark-is-chasing-me scene, gotta love that. The characters were fun to watch but not too cutesy, as I had expected a Disney/Pixar movie about fish to be.

All I have to add is, Finding Nemo has officially beat Monsters, Inc. as my favorite Disney movie. I am soooo going to get it on DVD Go see it soon!

4 June 2003,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT MOVIE!!!!!,"going along with all the other reviews, all I can say is WOW!!! Pixar/Disney has a MASTERPIECE here. We do not go to the movies very often because of the prices nowadays (looking at around 30-35 bucks for a family of 3- refreshments included). So when we go, We are very picky about the movies we see. my wife and son wanted to see Nemo. I was wanting to see something else. I gave in and wasn't expecting much. cmon it's a kids movie. Boy, was I WRONG!!! This is by far the best movie we've watched in years. I was completely impressed. The visuals are outstanding and the characters different personalities are great. The movie kept my son (4) attentive throughout (something that hasn't happened much). Usually it's the ""dad i need a drink, dad i gotta go to the bathroom, dad I want my toys"". Not this one. And I think it relates to kids and adults alike. Very funny and has subtle messages. 1.Nemo taking his disability in stride. 2.Parents have to let their kids grow up and explore. This movie hit home several times. Even though I hate to admit it, I actually got a little choked up when Marlin and Nemo finally got back together. That's how involved in the film you'll get. Do Not Let the chance to see Finding Nemo pass you by. Trust me, you'll love it. Money very well spent. We're going back to watch it again this weekend. and will DEFINITELY add this one to the DVD collection when its released. ABSOLUTELY Five stars!!!!!!!! 5/5",
1 July 2003,Amazing,"(give aways... if not seen movie, do not read b/c i say stuff from movie)

hey! I think this is an amazing movie. It is sooo adorable. I love the way they did animation with the water and everything. These actors put so much into this work, as you can see, they made it work. It just shows in the production. I cried.. lol go figure. It just got me so touchy at the beginning... how after there were all those eggs, that stupid shark ate them all, and coral.. ohhh my poooor coral. i felt soo bad for marlin. Nemo was the last one who survived so obviously you'd guess that marlin would be cautious for his only baby. Then when nemo got caught by those divers... grrr i'm seriously never going fishing again i felt so bad after all those times i go fishing and awwww poor nemo gets stuck in a DENTIST'S OFFICE! poor poor nemo. My favorite character was probably crush, the turtle. and I thought that was soo cute with the whole ""how old did a turtle get"" with nemo and his dad. I also liked dory... I really had a feeling that dory and marlin were gonna hook up or something, but i guess marlin just wasn't ""attracted"" to this short-termed memory fish. And i thought that was sooo funny how she remembered everything after nemo said something to her towards the end and then they found marlin, then dory needed help.. geeze these characters got into a lot of mischief! My favorite scene was probably with the whole ""talking whale."" after all that with dory, and then marlin trying to talk whale ""gee i wish i could talk whale"" lol. Well to wrap this up, i'd like to ask a question.. after Gill and all them escaped from the denists office.. how the hell did they get out of the bags? i saw this with my boyfriend and when gill proposed his idea thats the first thing i said ""how are they gonna get out of the bags?"" It's like, impossible for them to. They'd die! awww poor gill... his dream... well thats all i'm gonna say. I just have to say that i loved this movie. It made me laugh, and it made me cry. well.. ok then.. bye",
16 July 2016,"Great animation, great characters, great movie indeed.","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",8
11 September 2003,AWESOME,"I think this movie is the best movie i've seen in the whole year. I really like the animation and the story.. even though a lot of people said it's for kids but i think there something deep and meaningful about the whole thing. I love the character Dory.. so funny.. Anyway I think it's a very good family movie like other Pixar movie. I love it so much that i can say that people who said that it's a stupid pointless movie are stupid themselves.

28 December 2003,Well done movie,"I loved the movie, funny bits but also well known Disney sweetness and heartache. Even though I loved the movie I think they should stop give human emotions to animals, it only causes animal tragedy. Maybe they could make a movie about a made up animal or get a prehistoric animal. Sooner or later they start with alligators and every kid in the world would want a alligator. After the alligators are well fed on kids guess how much work the plummers will have when parents flush the 'gators down the toilet.

10 December 2003,"pretty movie, but little else","You'd be better off watching Toy Story in the animation category than this, which is a beautiful piece of computer animation, but bland in terms of dialogue particularly. It's actually rather annoying. And it lacks humor in my opinion.

28 March 2004,Amazing!,"Wow, this movie was the best animated film I've ever seen in my life. The animation was excellent, the voices were very energetic, and the characters were hilarious! There was Marlin, who is way too overprotective, there was Dory, who has short-term memory loss, and there were so many funny fish in that movie. The story is charming with some humorous parts. I correct myself: it was all funny! While I don't understand why it couldn't talk, the deep-sea anglerfish actually did scare some people. I think everything was exactly how the directors wanted it and if it wasn't, it turned out excellent anyways. I think that whoever hasn't seen this film should see it immediately!

10 March 2018,"Adventurous, fun, emotional and narratively perfect.","When I was younger, and I watched this movie numerous times, I understood that it was one of those few animated films that made me feel immersed in an adventurous world, full of characteristics close to human. All this through a story of ... FISH.

That, ladies and gentlemen, is difficult to achieve in any story, and to date, after almost 15 years, the film still has the same effect on me.

Thanks to this epic family drama, I was able to approach the work of greats like Pixar, the ingenious Thomas Newman, the fascinating and inspiring Lee Unkrich, and why not, a John Lasseter and an Andrew Stanton and a huge team of talented people. People who are able to bring stories with little appeal to great stories that are stored in the permanent mind of thousands of people.

There is no doubt that visual beauty is not far behind. In fact, that is what makes the film even more attractive, and to this day, it still looks impressive, even with all the great technological advances that exist in the animation and technology film industry.

Undoubtedly, Finding Nemo, will go to the cult cinema in the very near future as did Toy Story.",10
7 October 2004,best animated film i have ever seen,"An animated film, on the life in the ocean. This was the film I was waiting for. Hats off to Pixar studio, for making such an amazing film. They explored a whole lot of space left in the world the ocean. An also a story about a father who is in search of his son, it sounds a little schmaltzy, but you will love this emotion when you watch the film Marlin is the father who is in search of his son Nemo. His son is trapped by the fishermen and is now in an aquarium in a dentist's room.

All the characters in the fish tank were amazing The most amazing fish (character) was Dory who helps Marlin in finding her son. And the fun part is that she has a short term memory loss. This added the funny flavor to the film. And the sharks who take an oath that they will never eat a fish were the funniest of them all. This film is for everybody in the family. I rate this film 9/10

22 December 2004,This movie really blows everything out of the water!,"This Pixar film, I believe, really gone and done it. I truly think they made a 101% job on Finding Nemo. It's funny for all ages, it's emotional, the morals spill out plain to see, it's adventurous, the film is top notch state of the art, and it's original. It really inspired me, and I've been coming up with stories all my life. I never thought to create a story about fish parenting in the ocean. I personally think it's so good that all animation movies should be compared to Finding Nemo before and after release. It was a top box hit, and full of extras as well. Pixar is really reeling in the cash. It was a jackpot of a film, and it will be extremely hard to make another film that will size up to it or even beat Finding Nemo. Of course with tomorrows technology I could see that happening in the next few years. Go see it if for some reason you haven't already.

16 May 2017,This movie is great!,"Wow Finding Nemo is a great film for kids and adults. The characters are great! Definitely Dory!. I find that this movie has quite a few dark scenes especially the shark can be quite scary to younger kids. Nemo ends up in the tank gang who are all wonderful characters. The colours and animation were a perfect match to this film.

I give this film a 10 out of 10 because i really liked it, and i recommend it for adults and kids of all ages although some scenes are a bit dark and its a bit sad at the start. Kids will love Dory as i did! and the other characters!.

This is the funniest animated film I have seen since Toy Story. It's definitely worth seeing. You'll be laughing the whole way through the film!

I didn't really feel any great tension or emotion, despite the fact that I took my young son, who also had just started school. In fact he was even less thrilled with it than I was, as 10 minutes from the end he wanted to leave and I had to persuade him to stay to the end. No surprise then that his preferred animated films are still Shrek, Monsters Inc and A Bug's Life.

7 June 2003,Not quite Monsters Inc. but entertaining nonetheless,"Pixar does it again! Although Finding Nemo lacks the wackiness and quirkiness of Monsters Inc, it is nonetheless an entertaining and ultimately satisfying animated film. The intelligent animation and interesting dialogue helps lift an otherwise predictable and cliched plot into something engrossing. Well worth the price of the movie ticket!

The short animated filmlet at the start of the movie is really good and is an added bonus!

3 August 2003,Truly a gem!,"Since it was hard to imagine Pixar ever topping its original Toy Story, and upon first learning on who was going to provide the voices of the characters, I was not enthusiastic about Finding Nemo. None of the other Pixar releases (Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc.) quite measured up to the original Toy Story, so I had reduced Nemo to rental status. It took a sold out show of Pirates of the Caribbean to make me experience one of the most enjoyable movies I have had the pleasure of watching on the big screen. There are movies that can be enjoyed equally on the theaters or at home, and there are others that you just have to shell out the 8 or so dollars and watch it on theater, and Finding Nemo is definitely one of the latter.

The computer recreation of water and light should in itself amaze you. I know it did to me. The way sand floats, how light shines through rippling water, how algae looks in a dirty aquarium...all recreated in a way that exceeded any expectations I may have had. The story, albeit simplistic in form, is touching and quick paced. The movie never feels like it is an hour and forty minutes long, and that is because Nemo has what I consider one of the best voiced over animated character ever in movie cinema. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that Ellen DeGeneres, whom I never cared for as an actor, could match, and even toppled Woody Allen's comedic delivery as Z in ANTZ, but she delivers the goods, and then some. As the voice of the memory lacking Dory, DeGeneres performance is truly worthy of recognition. Add the amazing way the animators converted DeGeneres excellent voice performance into animated facial expression on Dory, and you have one exquisite character. She is truly the highlight of the film.

Funny, addictive, surprising, mesmerizing, Finding Nemo has the substance to please both young and old alike. Just be sure you experience Nemo on a theater...you will be sorry if you don't.",9
1 June 2003,"10 Stars. More clever than Toy Story & Monsters, Inc.","Played to a packed Saturday matinee. Audience applauded at end. Clever, fun and entertaining, with few slow spots in the plot, our adults and kids enjoyed Finding Nemo very much. We guessed that Disney/Pixar was going to release this in Early December 2003 for Christmas Video/DVD sales - and it will be one of the hottest gift items for Xmas 2003.

Roger Ebert review is very accurate, and I would classify Nemo as a ""must see"" type of movie.

Being a biology student at St. FX university, I found the little science related jokes to be great ""... with fronds like these who need anenomes?"". I highly recommend this movie, it had a great story and had many funny moments throughout.

29 June 2003,"Another world (and, finally, the movie that gets us there)","I think that some of the more recent box-office successes have been attractive because they have been able to transport people out of this hectic world into some other place. These movies, such as the original Star Wars Trilogy, the first Matrix movie, The Lord of the Rings, and others, have created this escape in enough depth and detail such that the viewer feels fully removed from their actual surroundings.

Only a handful of these movies though, can take the audience somewhere else and still deal with real-world issues, all at once. Finding Nemo is one of these movies. And believe me, this ""other world"" is like nothing you've ever seen on the big screen.

Pixar has out-done everyone, INCLUDING themselves. Finding Nemo's underwater world is on the one hand distant and mysterious and on the other distinguishable and realistic. The ocean setting has allowed Pixar to really let loose -- with amazing canvases of brilliant color, a shimmering, shifting, particulate-filled sea, and some of the best drawn non-human characters ever. In Finding Nemo there is a wonderful paradox: a far-away world that you can actually visit when you leave the theater.

But Finding Nemo's fantasy and reality two-step doesn't stop with the animation. The story takes that same theme. The characters -- a family of clown fish, a blue tang, a posse of sharks, pelicans, crazy seagulls, and the demonic dentist's daughter -- add a sense of fantasy and humor. But their trials -- the young one finding himself, a father's struggle against loss, the lonely one's sense of need, and the elder's desire to break free from his trapped life -- are real-world, everyday issues. And, in typical Disney fashion, the movie is moved along by an epic quest that brings all of these disparate pieces together. Everything in Finding Nemo is allegorical, and although the story line itself is not as creative as some show-stopping narrative like Requiem for a Dream, the way the script relates to both the characters at the fantasy level and the audience at the reality level is novel and inspiring.

Despite some of my roommates' skepticism, I wanted to see this movie from the moment I first heard the concept. For me -- that's some hype to live up to. But unlike the sequels in the Matrix and Star Wars series, Finding Nemo delivers -- a fantasy / reality combination that I hope won't soon be forgotten. 10/10",10
7 April 2006,Worth the wait!!,"Disney didn't seem to be delivering the goods like they used to until Nemo came along and boy was he worth the wait. I never thought the clown fish can be so sweet. Finding Nemo is a great family film enjoyed by all. When watching it you'll find that at least two people will come out trying to speak whale or quoting 'Fish are friend, not Food' but that's what makes the film so great and memorable. If you have not seen the film yet - Where have you been? You'll fall completely in love with all of the characters and insist that you buy your own aquarium for your own Nemo cast. I hope that Disney's next project is a good as 'Finding Nemo' - Good Luck.

5 September 2004,terrible,"I hated this movie!! It was awful!! I wish I woulda saved my money so now I

would probably have money now to go see a cool movie, like Spider-Man 2..

even though I saw Spidey 2 times :-D but anyway I think that Finding Nemo is the kind of movie you can only watch once or twice then you get sick of it. Thats my opinion anyway. It was so dumb and childish.... even though I'm sorta a kid my self, I'm 13 and I still thought it was really dumb. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming... that stupid song was stuck in my head all night after I saw that movie!

And the whole ""We are friendly sharks, we don't eat fish"" thing was really really stupid.

16 June 2003,Disney Orphans,"First of all, I loved this movie. Thought everything was well designed and freakin' hilarious. It did lead me to an observation that I find intriguing. Why is it that probably 90% of Disney movies center on characters who are either orphans or have lost one or the other of their parents? Think about it. Name 5 disney movies, and I mean originals (non of those crappy sequels), that have characters with both of their parents. It's tough isn't it? Why does Disney do this? Does it help audiences sympathize with the characters more? I don't know. If I was a parent I might be concerned for my kids. Watching these movies might lead them to believe that their parents are going to die and leave them in the uncapable hands of evil step mothers or something like that. I understand that many families today consist of single parent homes, but many of these movies have scenes or alude to the death of one or both parents. I don't know if anyone has some insight into why this is, but I find it interesting.

21 July 2006,Masterpiece,"It's been seven years since Pixar unleashed Toy Story 2, the first full-length computer animated feature film, on the world, and what a wild, whimsical ride it was. Working in tandem with Disney (an association perilously close to ending), Pixar has provided several equally wondrous rides -- Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., all of which contained themes and characters perfectly suited to the hyper-realistic computer-generated style of animation. Pixar's films feature carefully crafted narratives, simple but not simplistic, offering an ebb and flow of action-stoked set pieces that, at best, stoke our adrenaline while keeping our funny bones on vibrating overdrive.

For it's 2003 release -- and perhaps greatest -- achievement, Pixar looks into the majestic depths of the ocean. The result -- Finding Nemo -- is a movie of extraordinary visual spectacle, astonishing emotional depth, and brilliant voice acting (Ellen deserved an Oscar nomination). It's every bit as inventive as the Toy Story franchise, every bit as charming as Bug's Life, every bit as colorful and vibrant as Monster's Inc. But it's even more compelling, more emotionally driven than these precursors. Everything, in a sense, has led up to Nemo, the best of all possible computer animated worlds.",10
25 July 2006,The Best Animated Film of All Time,"This 2003 triumph from Pixar - the outfit that gave us both ""Toy Story"" movies and ""MonSters, Inc."" - has a more emotionally substantial story than its predecessors, set against stunningly beautiful backgrounds that set a new high-water mark in the digital art form, surpassing even ""Shrek,"" produced by Pixar's arch-rivals at PDI. This film proves Pixar reigns as the finest storytellers in family film. To create a grand odyssey for two lovable underdogs, the Pixar team mixes playfulness, a deep love of film, and a visual beauty that is unmatched in the industry. This is not just a great animated movie  it is a superior film, period.

30 May 2003,The best Pixar film yet!,"Yes, it was THAT good!

First off, the animation was superb. We are talking total immersion in this oceanic adventure. No pun intended. Okay, it was. But still.... The amount of detail to each individual fish, shark, whale, seagull, anemone and turtle is astounding. If not for the human-like facial expressions/exaggeration and characteristics you would almost think you were watching a National Geographic special. Only better! And the water! Of course you have to make it believable that you are watching a movie about being underwater...and they sell it. Very realistic and imaginative depiction of ocean life down to how the sunlight streams through the water.

Okay, the eye-candy out of the way (wow, animation never looked so good!) the voice-acting is fantastic! Albert Brooks as Marlin (Nemo's Dad), Ellen DeGeneres stealing the show as Dory (she was extremely funny), and of course other big names like Geoffrey Rush, and Willem Dafoe and even Eric Bana of soon-to-be HULK fame lent their voice talents to this grand story.

If you don't know the story by now, it's basically this: Nemo is a clown-fish that accidentally ends up being taken from his home. Marlin, his over-protective father sets off to search for him in the big blue, and along the way picks up help from very interesting characters along the way, not the least of which is Dory.

During the first 15 minutes of the film you are introduced of course to the characters and then a tragedy occurs leading us to the events of having to find Nemo. Even though this film like all Disney fare, is intended for kids enjoyment, it has some grown-up themes and plenty of things for adults to enjoy. Pixar has demonstrated their ability to make a film on kids and adults level alike with their other efforts.

I was surprised but how successful and seamless a story this was, considering that it was director Andrew Stanton's first time at the helm of a Pixar studio's film... but he has carried the tradition of perfection with flying colors. Most movies, animated and non-animated alike, usually never get it so right.

The music is a superb mixture of orchestral music and appropriate tropical instrumental music to set the mood and tone of the story and it's various moments. Instead of Pixar favorite Randy Newman doing the score for yet another Pixar flick, the reins were handed to Thomas Newman, who is none other than Randy's cousin as well as the son of Alfred Newman, who is famous in his own right for his film scores before his death in 1970 resulting from emphysema. His (Alfred) most recognized work, and perhaps most insignificant, is the theme you hear during the FOX 20th Century studio trailers before one of their movies. At any rate, Thomas Newman has composed a fantastic score that sets the mood wonderfully, and yet never really stands out above the events of the movie. And why should it? The rendered animation is a sight to behold and carries the story well enough on it's own along with the stellar voice cast.

I give this movie 10 stars!",10
3 August 2003,Over rated,"First of all, let me tell you that I am not someone who just hates all animated movies. Infact I love The Lion King, and recently the only good Disney animated movies are the one's Pixar has made, so I have nothing against Pixar. Both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are great movies,(especially the first one), and A Bug's Life and Monsters Inc. are definitly a cut above the modern animated movie, but I have to say with disappointment that Finding Nemo is not anywhere near those good movies. Let me start with my biggest complaint, TOO MUCH ACTION! This movie had way too much action for an animated movie. Animated movies aren't about action, but I guess the filmmakers of this movie didn't know that. While I don't mind some action sequences in an animated movie,( like the antalope stampede in Lion King), the action sequences in this movie get a little redundent. I guess the animators are tring to ""wow"" you with the animation, and maybe that would of worked if this was the first movie of it's kind, but now that a lot of these type of movies have come out it's just boring. So then you may ask, what are animated movies about? Two things, laughter and fun, which this film is lacking in. While the other Pixar movies have fun jokes for kids and intelligent jokes for adults this film has none. Sure there maybe a few smart jokes about aquatic creatures in the beginning, but most of the time there is an oppertunity for a joke, they start an action sequence. In my opion, Finding Nemo is probably the most over rated animated movie of all-time.",1
11 August 2006,Remarkable Film,"Finding new life in the old fish-story, Finding Nemo is another fine computer animated offering from the people at Pixar, just as family-oriented as their last offerings, and just as adventure and humor-filled as ever. The animation and backgrounds are superb; it's often a remarkable achievement, and the colorful scenes of marine life and reefs makes it a visual treat. Though the film takes a little while to get going, after a truly heart-wrenching tragic beginning (at least for an animated film), once the search for Nemo starts, it's a non-stop quest with one clever thing after another. In fact, much like its previous siblings, the script is full of amusing situations (such as the chaotic climax at the dentist's office), clever dialogue, and humorous finds. It's also packed to the gills (pun intended) with eccentric characters, such as a trio of sharks trying to kick the habit of eating other fish, a pack of surfer-dude sea turtles, and some dim-witted birds. But the funniest bits are, of course, the myriad of dangers the poor fish must face, from a sea of jellyfish, to the threat of predators, to being swallowed up by a whale. The voice actors, from the neurotic Brooks to the spacey DeGeneres, are all terrific, and well chosen.",10
17 October 2021,A favorite childhood movie,"I was a big Finding Nemo fan. I should watch it again as an adult, but almost 20 years ago I was in love with this movie and watched it multiple times!

Nemo had a loving father, which I didn't. And I always wanted a relationship with my father. Seeing them separated made it almost traumatic for me! I was praying for them to reunite the entire film! The way they captured the world under the sea was fantastic! The facts were so accurate and they taught children in a creative way! Seeing the passion nemos father possessed was inspiring in many ways. He didn't quit, and love took him a long way. I will never forget this movie. Its a life long classic in my opinion!

27 December 2020,Best Pixar movie!,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",10
29 May 2003,"Totally Awesome, dude!","Oh, my were do I begin, (smile), it was great. Nemo is fun to be with and you feel like a kid again. when you are really 30 something. ehehe well see it to believe, Pixar seems not to do wrong. OH, find Nemo in Monster Inc. somewhere? He's there, dude!

Pixar did an amazing job, with computer graphics, voice acting and every nuance of wit throughout the plot.

19 November 2004,"Heartwarming and beautifully animated, Finding Nemo is one of the best movies out there","Finding Nemo is, as far as I know, the first animated movie that has real value for adults as well as kids. And not in the way that most kid films do, that are merely bearable and faintly amusing at best to anyone above the age of 14. Finding Nemo has a couple of essentials for all age groups: for kids, there is the moral of the story, the cute and funny characters (think the albatros and the turtle), and of course the happy ending. For adolescents and grown-ups, there are contemporary movie references, and more 'grown-up' jokes that might be hard to grasp for little kids. The amazing animation is always a huge added bonus for anyone who really pays attention to the movie, and would be worth going to the movies for even if the story was only so-so and the dialogue boring.

I know this whole age-group thing because after finally convincing my cousins, who are both boys (ages 10 and 12), to go with me, they watched it and actually enjoyed it. So did a very large part of people my age (16) and my parents have actually seen it twice.

Finding Nemo is a truly great move, and perfect to watch when you don't want to see something complicated, but are more in the mood for something uplifting yet still with substance.

29 September 2003,How do they do it?,"You tend to get bored on an airplane. Not on my flight! From Amsterdam to New York takes about eight hrs, and I wasn't bored for a single minute. Cause they had all these cool movies to watch! So I started with the Matrix; Reloaded (not so good), followed by Finding Nemo.

Those guys @ Pixar, how do they do it? They always seem to find a new angle and a complete different idea for their movies. For instance; Toy Story 2 was totaly different from TS1, although it features a lot of the same characters.

And now this; Finding Nemo...

I didnt really know what to expect; a fish searching for his lost son, who's been kidnapped by a dentist? But hey, its a Pixar movie, so its gotta be good, right?

And so it was! I couldn't get that smile of my face, because this movie is hilarious! Starting with the totally new characters, the crazy storyline, and still it has that great ""Pixar-feel"" to it. Bright, vibrant colours, great voice acting, and -wow- beautifully animated (if that is correct English).

This is another MustHave for my DVD collection!",
19 August 2008,Beautiful animation and Ellen is hilarious,"Finding Nemo is a beautiful work of art. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory is fantastic in this film. The first time I heard Ellen's comedy was a routine that was played on an airplane about bad milk. She has such an interesting, quirky way of looking at the world and the writers of Finding Nemo captured that perfectly in the Dory's character. The animation is gorgeous. The color of the water and the way it changes as the characters swim through it is beautiful. Director Andrew Stanton is hilarious as Crush. What a talented guy. This movie has a great message for parents on good child-rearing and about taking chances and living even when life gives you a a setback like a tiny flipper.

4 November 2003,"No Phil Collins song, but lots of fishy fun.","I thought Pixar would struggle with the ocean but they have pulled it off. An absolutely fantastic storyline with amazing scenery and jokes that will keep you laughing every minute of the movie. My mum and dad loved it and so did my 4 year old god daughter. A movie definitely for all ages. The movie always provides laughter but a bit of sadness to go with it, but who doesn't want that in the storyline. The fish with the voice of Ellen is fantastic, the representation of Seagulls is also something you have to see. I advise...see it and buy it.

16 June 2003,Loved this movie,"This film deserves an Oscar...Or at least deserves a nomination for an Academy Award. Just when you thought PIXAR couldn't top Monsters Inc. They create this masterpiece. It's amazing how far computer animations can go. It's the most visually stunning animated film ever made and how it touches people. Who knew fish could show so much emotion. I give this film 10 thumbs up if I had them. ;c)

17 September 2003,Best film of the summer- maybe of the year....,"I saw this movie and was totally blown away. The previews looked good, so I figured the movie would be decent. But I was not prepared at all for how incredibly the movie drew everyone in. When I saw it, it wasn't with an enormous amount of little kids, but with people of all ages- 3 to 75. The voice acting is some of the best ever- especially Ellen DeGeneres. The character of Dory was taken to a whole other level by the quality of Ellen's voice work- you couldn't help but laugh hysterically at almost everything she said. However, she also proved she could do more than just comedy- I don't know how anyone cannot get the slightest bit misty when she says ""I look at you, and....and I'm home..."" Other great voices by Albert Brooks (Marlin), Allison Janney (Peach), Willem Dafoe (Gil), Alexander Gould (Nemo) and Brad Garrett (Brother Blow) make this movie one of the funniest and feel good films I've seen in a long time. A shoo in for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars this year, and I can even see a nod for Best Picture.

19 July 2003,Best animated movie I have ever seen- definitely worth seeing for anyone,"I don't usually see animated movies in the theater, and when I do, I never see them a second time, except on video. However, this was the first exception. This immediately became my favorite animated movie, and I actually decided to go back and see it a second time. None of my friends who I saw it with the first time wanted to go back so I went with some others who hadn't yet seen it.

As an 18-year-old, I know many kids my age pan animated movies as only for younger kids, and while this is true for many of them, there have been several that are good for anyone. One of the features I have noticed in Pixar movies (Monsters, Inc.; Toy Story; this) is that they direct the action towards younger kids, but add a number of lines that only an older audience will understand.

Finding Nemo was excellent all around. Technically, it was incredibly well made- with realistic fish-like movements and equally realistic human-like facial expressions, not to mention the amazing aquatic scenery. The technical part actually added to the movie as a whole, making the characters more real, and therefore easier to relate to, despite the fact that they were fish. And then, of course, the plot and action of the film were great. It was funny, creative, and simply entertaining in general. The characters were likeable, the action was fast-moving, and the story was well-written. This will easily win best animated feature of 2003.

In fact, the only criticism I have is not of the movie but of Pixar: since they did almost all the work in creating this film, it seems that they really don't need Disney as a distributor. They have already made enough of a name for themselves that without the backing of a giant motion-picture distributor, they could release the films themselves and produce the same amount of money- only they would be able to keep it all, instead of having to fork over huge portions to Disney.",9
13 June 2003,"Pleasant, not exactly funny.","I thought the movie was pleasant--I got a couple of chuckles. I love the Toy Story movies, Shrek, Bug's Life, so with all the great reviews I was primed for a real laugher. I just didn't laugh, though. The whale talk got stale--fast, the 12 step shark program wasn't that funny. I liked the seagulls, and I liked the Psycho reference. Finally, I thought the most striking thing was that Marlin (the father) was the one expected to mature and let Nemo go. Yet, if Nemo had listened to his father in the first place, he wouldn't have had to be found.

19 February 2005,Disappointing.,"I would estimate...about 97% of the movie going world loved this movie.

However, I did not. I'm aware young children have higher pitched voices, but the particular children for supporting roles in this movies had voices I thought were going to bore into my brain.

The story is simple. Nemo, a young fish who is the only survivor of his siblings is dared to go out into open water, and thus is captured. His overprotective father, who seems to have Nemo alone as remaining family, naturally, goes to look for him.

From there, we're introduced to supporting characters who I found weren't much more than cheap laughs. Vegetarian sharks, ooh, that's original! All in all, the plot seems pretty much inconsequential to beautiful sweeping shots of the ocean and the coral reefs the fish call home. The scene with the jelly fish I found quite a treat to look at...but other than being yet another piece of eye candy that seems to be a trend nowadays....this movie has very little to offer.",6

4 June 2003,My kids loved it.,"Finding Nemo is another great animated film by Pixar. We took our kids to go watch it on opening night and they really enjoyed it. Then again, they enjoyed Toy story 1 & 2, A Bugs Life, Monsters Inc., Shrek, Ice Age, and all the other CG films done by Pixar, Dreamworks and Fox. I, myself, thought the movie was pretty darn funny at certain times... at others, touching. For a kids movie, I would give it 9 out of 10 stars. So take your kids to go see the movie, they'll like it.

1 June 2003,"Better than Monsters, Inc. ?","I was truly astounded by what I saw. The effects of the water and little background objects was amazing. On some levels it made Monsters, Inc. look ancient. The story was a typical ""Have to find somebody"" plot but it had a fresh take on it as the single parent made it more real. The thing that sets this movie apart from others is the secondary characters. Pixar really pays attention to getting these right. Sometimes they even overshadow the main characters they get to be so good. As always, lessons are learned and fun was had by all. After Jungle Book 2 and countless other run of the mill sequels Disney is pumping out, Pixar again shows that Disney needs lead or get out of the way. I generally rate a movie on the consumption of food. A lot of food eaten, it was bad. Hardly any food eaten, too good. So let's put it this way: My 6 year old sat transfixed and my 3 year old sat with his face on the seat in front of him watching. All the food consumed? 5 pieces of licorice. That's it. They were just far too busy watching to eat.

3 June 2003,Anti-American slam,"Perhaps you missed. It was quick, but the message was there. The slam on Americans. When Marlin was telling the group of sharks that divers had taken Nemo, the response was ""Humans, they think they own everything."" Then the comment, ""Yeah, must be Americans."" Excuse me Disney, but that offends me. I am American and proud. If you have a problem with this country take your films, parks, cable channels to another country and see if you make nearly as much money as here in America. Walt would be ashamed of what you've become.

22 June 2003,Boring,"Visuals were decent, but its nothing ground-breaking. It doesn't make me go, ""WOW"" like toy story or monsters INC. IMO monsters INC was more brilliant and a better movie, toy story 1 and 2 were better also. Finding Nemo was just really plain. The ocean got really boring after a while, and the voice for Marlin the overprotective father was really annoying also. He was shouting the whole movie, it just got really old. I felt disconnected and bored many times in the movie theatre.

sequences, this would have been a perfect movie. As it was, my seven year old was terrified for the first 5 minutes of the movie.

Beyond that, this was a clever movie with many wonderful scenes, gags and ""one liners"" that kept the kids well entertained.

4 April 2004,The best Pixar movie ever!!!!!,"Being a true fan of the Lion King, and having heard of this record breaking animated picture ""Finding Nemo"", I couldn't believe that this movie could touch me so much!!! I saw it in my English class and was thrilled by the photography, the colours, the voice acting (Willem Dafoe, Albert Brooks, etc), the characters, th script and the humor. I think that everything is perfect here and that Pixar has made it's greatest work since Toy Story, which was my favourite Pixar. It is so amazing how they used technology to make a movie like that, so warm, witty!!! And they didn't even forget the script!!!! A+ However, I don't consider it as my favourite Disney movie. My favourite is the Lio King, which is more perfect, brilliant and powerful, the voice acting is the best in animation history, the story is moving and it resembles so much to life in Africa. But I must say, these two movies blew me away!!!

The story of the film is interesting and thrilling, showing us a true love between father and son, despite the fact that they are clown-fishes. Many awesome jokes in the script, too. The genre's fans should watch it at all cost, I gave it 9/10.

13 October 2003,"Absolutely stunning, a faultless piece of entertainment","This film is quite simply a work of genius. The quality of the animation is stunning, with the effects of waves, reflections, splashes, and underwater motion all perfectly realised. The visual treat is perfectly complemented by a brilliant script that is easy to follow for youngsters, while being full of droll asides and references to keep the adults amused. The idea that the sharks are in therapy to try and overcome their fish-eating tendencies, and the associated psycho-babble is one hilarious example. Another reviewer complained that the basic story is unoriginal, being yet another quest / journey of self-discovery. Well I think younger kids need a simple plotline, and this film delivers it so well that any triteness never jars. My daughter (nearly 5) was held in rapt attention throughout - and so were her mother and I. Highly recommended.

20 October 2003,Pixar does it again!,"Just watched this little gem last night at the flicks. It is another triumph for the guys at Pixar. Fantastic animation, funny and moving in all the right parts. Great little characters, and thats not just the main roles. The turtle was definately a cool dude!! Another note: the short animation at the start (the one with the snowman in the globe) is one of the funniest things Ive seen in ages! Classic, dont miss it!

23 January 2004,cute for all ages,"This movie was exceptionally cute and appropriate for ALL ages! We have a little girl who isn't even 1 year old yet, and we watched it with her and even she reacts and smiles and laughs at it and enjoys the colors and funny characters. It has humor for all ages, as well. Definitely a classic Disney/Pixar movie.

9 July 2022,Very good family film!,"This was one of the most successful Disney films at the cinema to date. It is the underwater story of a young clown fish named Nemo (Alexander Gould) taken by divers and put into a tank. The idea is obviously his Dad, Marlin (Albert Brooks), and new friend Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss, are ""finding"" him. Meanwhile, Nemo along with new friends including fishes Gill (Willem Dafoe), Bloat (Brad Garrett), Peach (Allison Janney), Gurgle (Austin Pendleton), Bubbles (Stephen Root), Deb/Flo (Vicki Lewis), Jacques (Joe Ranft) and pelican Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) are trying to escape. Along the journey Marland and Dory encounter three sharks, including Bruce (Barry Humphries, aka Dame Edna Everage) (named after the rubber Shark in the Jaws series), stinging jellyfish, turtles in a current tunnel, including ""dude"" Crush (Andrew Stanton) and much more, but he finds him eventually, and everything's fine. Also starring Big's Elizabeth Perkins as Coral, Nicholas Bird as Squirt, Bob Peterson as Mr. Ray, Eric Bana as Anchor, and Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as Fish School. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it was nominated for Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, Best Sound Editing, and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. It was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Family Films.",8
1 June 2004,Amazing!,"Another great animation! Yipee! Finding nemo I would have to say one the best Disney films to come out since Monster's Inc,I was really surprised they have jokes that were funny to almost every everybody,it also has moral things like being kind to one other, sticking together,etc which I haven't seen so beautifully presented in family movie in a while. It's such a darn shame that Disney are selling Pixar(people who created this movie) to another company as Pixar and Finding Nemo are taking Disney to a whole new direction and telling people out there that Animation hasn't lost it's spark. It's a really great movie,buy it and enjoy it.

18 March 2013,Very Good Movie,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",10
23 April 2005,Animation at it's best,"I would like to congratulate Pixar studio for this movie, especially because story is so weak and has almost nothing in it. All the other Pixar movies before this had superb stories and now the trick was how did they made it click even then?

One thing I have noticed that Pixar seem to have mastered the art of story telling. Realistic and state-of-the-art animation just add on to it. Good script is something that makes this movie work for every age group. I have seen it many times and found that some of these dialogs could still make me laugh.

I will not say this is the best Pixar movie but it is different and of course it is a visual treat. Dialogues are superb. Characters are well defined and you just fall in love with them. A must for all animation lovers.

23 September 2007,"A ""special ed"" story","This is a great movie filled with beautiful visuals, wonderful voices, and a story that mimics life so heavily that I don't even think people can grasp it. Here you have Nemo, a fish who has a visible handicap (but not handicapping condition). His father, who lost his mate and whole brood (minus Nemo) wants to protect him with everything he has in him, yet Nemo just wants to be like everyone else and do what the other kids are doing. In the process of showing everyone what he can do by swimming further out over the drop than the other fish, he gets scooped up by a scuba diver and all of his father's nightmares come true: he's lost his only son.

The story goes on to show what a parent will do for their child. In his quest to find his child, he runs into other sea life who all have their own disabilities, not all visual, but are able to help him in their own way. Each one of these characters have something very special about them, be it something that helps or hinders their life. They are all living ""normal"" lives in the big blue world of the ocean. From one character with short term memory loss, others with obsessive-compulsive disorders, they all have a limitation but don't let it limit their life.

This movie punctuates how we think about physical differences and want to protect the people who have them yet everyone has some sort of difference, most of us who don't have it visible on our person. Each of us are able to accomplish great things, each of us have to overcome shortcomings in our lives and we all have some specialness, visible or not.",9
3 August 2017,review,"Great movie for kids and family. I was really nervous will Nemo find a way back home, but he did. I am very happy to watch this great movie again with friends. Pixar always make such a great movies. And this animation is something different. The amazing story in the sea. Dory is absolutely my favorite. So glad to watch finding Dory too. :)

1 March 2017,This is a movie about 2 fish who travel through the sea together with many adventures.,"This was a nice and funny movie for kids. I love all of the different adventures they had as they swam through the sea. I recommend this for many of the young age children! Nemo and Dory are a great match and are really good friends. Dory sometimes gets on Nemo's nerves but they still stay close and hang in there together through the good and hard times.

18 March 2017,Lovely because it is about the bonding of sea and surface creatures,"Wow! This is one of the my most loving movie. Cause it's about the fishes and creatures under the sea. Also about the bonding with the sea creatures with the surface creatures. The voices are cool. Dory, Nemo and Marlin. Nemo is so cute. and the most cutest is dory. Although dory's voice is given by Ellen. And the latest part of Finding Dory is also such a wonderful movie. The movie at least you can watch with your family peacefully and that contains no violence or sex.

18 June 2023,Holds up 20 years later and always will,"I remember watching Finding Nemo when I was around 9 years old. My parents made a huge deal of it and we watched it in the theater as soon as it released. It was an amazing theatrical experience and as a child it felt like a fantastical epic. Now 20 years later I have rewatched it at home and it has held up in every regard and was even more enjoyable the second time with a new perspective. The animated world they created is breathtakingly beautiful, the humor is great, and the story keeps you engaged without ever feeling repetitive or lackluster.

Finding Nemo will go down as a cultural and historic achievement and will be enjoyed for centuries to come. I can't wait to watch it with my future children and grandchildren.

19 May 2006,One of a Precious Few,"As a 16 year old, i think of myself as still a child in many ways! My love of Disney Films being one of them. However, i find Finding Nemo is one of a dying breed... a Disney film which is actually good. OK, no matter what Disney films will always be here to delight children, but there are few Disney films being produced at the moment that seem to hold parents and children alike. Now it seems that a lot of the time Disney are just cashing in. EVERYTHING has a sequel! And none of the sequels are half as good as the original. I think the Pixar/Disney collaboration has been good. As i said, Finding Nemo is an amazing Disney film that has many of the memorable characters and witty lines that makes it a film sure to be remembered for years to come. I think Disney should stick to the new ideas for movies. New Stories. You don't need to make 7 Lion King movies or Aladdin movies for kids to still love the characters. The Land Before Time film from Universal was quite probably one of if not my favourite film when i was a kid. Now you look at Sky movies and they are showing Land Before Time IX and even more! So i say keep making stand alone films with the quality, care and thought that you put into Finding Nemo and you'll remain a success forever.

That's my two cents on that then! Hee hee x",10
2 June 2003,little kids might be scared,"While this movie is great and rated ""G"", be careful with the littlest ones, as there are some very exciting and scary scenes in it. I spent some time in the lobby with my youngest(almost 3), although the other two were fine (5 and 7).

As for the movie itself, it was brilliant...the story probably could have been a little deeper, but the scenery was some serious eye candy and Ellen DeGeneres stole the show. My kids and I were all ""speaking whale"" on the way back to the car.

15 June 2003,A Classic!!,"I took my kids (aged 6 and 8)to see this movie this afternoon expecting to spend the next two hours bored at best. At worst, my kids would be as bored as well and I'd be spending that time trying to keep them under control. Not a chance!!! This movie was great--not only for the kids but for me as well! At times, we could barely hear the movie over all the laughing going on in the theatre. I can't wait for this one to come out on DVD. I gave Toy Story an 9/10 but this one was even better. A clear 10/10!!

4 June 2003,I loved it.,"It was a very enjoyable experience. Lots of layers for all ages. Visually stunning.

Pixar has made many break throughs with each movie, with each having a quantum leap in something. The realistic water in Nemo is not quite as noticable as the leap of the fluffy/whispy fur in Monsters, but a big leap non the less.

I loved all the nice inside jokes and homages. I kept expecting a ""Great Escape"" homage with Gill, perhaps having his gimpy fin look like a ball glove or such, but I suppose some would have pointed out that Chicken Run already did it. I did think that Gill's scar looked a lot like the facial scar in Platoon (problem being it was Tom Berenger's character that had the scar not Defoe's), but then again I might have been looking for way too inside jokes (how about a West Wing hint with the Star fish).

I just about wet myself when she started trying to speak Whaaaallllle. I would have killed to have seen Ellen's face for real as she recorded those bits.

1 April 2006,Finding Nemo is a great family film!!!!,"Finding Nemo is a great movie for not only kids, but parents will not mind watching it either. It's a great family film. Finding Nemo is a heart warming tale about a clown fish named Nemo who gets separated from his Father, Marlin and his classmates after Nemo gets captured by a scuba diver. Throughout the movie, Marlin desperately tries to find his son with the help of a lovable fish named Dory. Dory tries to help but has short-term memory loss. This characteristic of her brings a lot of laughs into the movie. As Marlin tries to find Nemo and travel to Australia, where Nemo is taken, he encounters Bruce the shark, Crush the turtle, and many other lovable sea creatures along the way. I will not spoil it for you so to find out the ending, you'll have to watch it for yourself. I highly recommend that you watch this movie!!!

13 March 2019,Disney's Pixar's Finding Nemo,"How are you suppose to find someone you care about, when there are so many fish in the sea? This question can be answered in the kids film, Finding Nemo by Disney Pixar. This adventurous film takes place in the ocean where the main characters are fish. The film really shows family issues and how it affects children of adolescence in a funny kids animation about a real serious issue. The fathers and sons relationship starts out edgy because of the issues in the family, but the father and the sons relationship starts to grow throughout the film. In the end there's almost always a solution to this, but nothing you would quite see in the film, Finding Nemo. When the film is done and over, you will see how this can affect a child and how there can be misunderstandings to every action. But in the end there's only one truth.

The story starts out with the character Marlin and his wife, they are both clownfish. Marlin's wife dies by a tragic attack by a shark out in the open. His wife also laid a lot of eggs but after the shark attacked Marlin's wife, he took the eggs. There was only one left and this made the character Nemo, Marlin starts to get over protective with him because of what happened to his wife and the rest of his kids. But when Nemo starts to go to school he gets taken by divers. So Marlin sets out to find his son Nemo, he crosses by a fish named dory who suffers from short term memory loss. He goes with Dora and fights against many obstacles like sharks, jellyfish, and even seagulls. While nemo is trying to get out of a fish tank in a dentist's office.

Now this isn't the best film in the world, it has its bad sides. For instance this isn't really that accurate of a film. The start of the story line starts out with the mom dying and the dad still living with his son and now the father has nobody and he's lonely. But the truth if the same situation happened in real life, the father would have turned female and the son would have mated with the now turned female. Then nemo would have turned female and would have to find a male mate. But instead this isn't accurate, they use a human interactive way. This is only one of the major things that aren't accurate if this situation happened in real life. But of course this film is a adventure/action, fiction story.

I just want to say that this film is very interesting and has very many positive features in this film despite it not being very accurate to real life. There's so many lessons that kids can learn and also find it very entertaining at the same time. This film definitely shows family issues and how adolescents are affected by it. One way this is shown is by the father and sons relationship. In the film it shows right away at the beginning that the father doesn't want him to go to school while the son is insisting he goes on the first day, Nemo finally convinces his father to let him go. But the dad has to walk him there. This shows that the dad is very over protective over his son because he barely even allows him to go to his school. At some point in that scene he wouldn't even let nemo hangout with some people there. It really points out that there's family issues between the son and the father. Because nemo wants to go out and adventure while the father would just rather him stay safe and not go out. He wants this because he's afraid that he will lose his son if he isn't in his grasp. But all of that really connects with families with real issues like that because it can make them see all views and what's best to do about each situation. So it's a good learning experience in a great kids animation film.

Characters really are the main part of the film. If it wasn't for the characters, the film wouldn't be a film. But it's not just characters that are important in how the characters are, it's what their identity is. If a film had a bad characters then the film wouldn't be that good and it would be a bad film. For instance, in Finding Nemo there's a scene where when Nemo is trapped in the fish tank and a bird comes in the dentist's office window and talks to the fish in the fish tank. About a rumor going around that Marlin is trying to find his lost son. Nemo hears about it and gets excited because he believes he's gonna be saved. Because of the characters in this certain scene it makes people understand better, it makes the film the way it is. Because of the bird spreading around the rumor because he does that a lot, the bird loves gossip. Nemo was able to find out that his dad was going to save him which means the characters were a big role in the film. This showed Marlins and Nemos relationship clearly and how he felt about his dad. Because of the characters and even side characters it gave you a real feel to the film and really showed how this was effecting Nemo.

There's so much in this film, so many lessons hidden in the film through kids animation and child like characters. One of the main lessons was how a child of adolescents is affected by family issues. The way this is shown is by the characters and their development, and how it shows the father and sons relationship. The characters in the film are more child like and don't have anything that's inappropriate and even the animation is innocent. This and the father and son's relationship and what they say to each other shows how Nemo is affected and why he is the way he is. But in the end of the film it shows Marlin successfully getting his son back after almost failing and showing that he should never give up, and even saving Dora which he met on the way to find Nemo. There's a lesson on why you should never quit because if you don't you might even get what you want no matter how impossible it seems. But also it shows the father and sons relationship repaired and better than before. Because the family issues were resolved Nemo felt better and had a better life then with those family issues. This film was really great, it gave lessons for everyone on how you shouldn't quit and how a kid could be affected by family issues, and even how characters can be very important in a innocent animation.",9
15 April 2006,good movie,"I just watched ""Finding Nemo"" with my two-year-old son. (He wasn't even born when this movie came out, which is why I've never seen it until today). I really liked this film for a number of reasons. Not only was it very intense emotionally, but there was no point in the film was anything *bad* happening. There were no cheap innuendos, nothing but good clean fun. At the same time, it was never stupid or clownish (no pun intended). I would really like the creators of this film to know that I appreciated their work as being an effort in ""using one's powers for good, not evil."" In addition, I'm sure that people who have similar dilemmas in their family life: children with special needs, parents who are overprotective, or anyone with a loss or grief in their family, will feel especially attuned to this film. This is a great movie for either families or individuals.

1 May 2006,Finding Nemo review,"Three years ago, Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar teamed up to release Finding Nemo to the masses. The hit children's underwater adventure video is an animated story based on a rebelliously independent young clownfish and his overprotective father's inability to let go. Enticed by a witty trailer and a captivating graphical design, Finding Nemo attracted a wide audience to the theatres. Digitally mastered and exquisitely written, Finding Nemo premiered May 3rd, 2003, as a G rated, light hearted, animated production geared towards children. The familiar voices of main characters, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) and Marlin (Albert Brooks) teamed up in an encore partnership, returning from 1998's Dr. Dolittle. The hour and 44 minute presentation that brought over $300 million to the box office in its first week in the theatres. The script is a roller-coaster of friendly humor, written by Andrew Stanton and is sincerely thought provoking for Disney's adult viewers. Finding Nemo is sure to become a childhood classic. The opening scene is at Nemo's elementary school. Marlin, the widowed single parent, introduces Nemo to his teacher as a timid student, who requires extra attention for his special needs. Crowds will chuckle at the cynical humor, merciless mimicking students in the background and defining sarcastic gestures in this scene. Taunted by his peers, Nemo challenges his father, swimming farther and farther out into the abyss, towards a row boat at the surface. By the time Marlin catches his curiously disobedient son in the act, he swam far away from the group and was at the surface. The authors' creative expressiveness and ingenuity with the line ""he touched the butt!"" is innocent enough for six year olds to repeat, and at the same time harmlessly pokes fun at the daily trials parents face with young children. With the conscious lesson that every ill minded action has consequences, the row boat unexpectedly carries Nemo away from his home. Marlin enlists into a desperate rescue attempt for his beloved son and soon encounters Dory, the annoying travel companion with the funky problem of poor short term memory. In their travels, Marlin and Dory accidentally stumble upon two great white sharks. Instantly intrigued, Dory tries to make new friends, while Marlin backs off because of preconceived stereotypes about vicious great white sharks. As it turns out the two have joined to form an anti fish eating support group. With a membership pledge of ""fish are friends, not food"", Marlin and Dory escape a near death experience. In this fast paced scene that speaks to breaking stereotypes, adults will pick up on the parody on the politics of vegetarianism and a poke at ""meaningless"" support groups. Some of the content in this two minute scene may frighten younger viewers, as the loud noises, exploding mines and sharks with big scary teeth dominate the screen. Pressing on with the goal of finding his son in Sydney, Marlin and Dory ride the East Australian Current with a huge pack of sea turtles, and Marlin has a chance to tell his epic story. One of the elder turtles and an experienced parent, Crush (voice of Andrew Stanton) listens in, imparts some wisdom, and helps Marlin regain a firm a grasp on life. His advice, and the movie's main message, is that children are going to grow up and that part of successful parenting is letting them go and watching them. You have to know that you have done all you can for your children and that they have learned well. The climax of the movie is this scene, where Marlin realizes his error and finally begins to believe in his son. As the music tempo accelerates, the current quickens and the scene makes a dramatic switch back to a comedic tone, keeping children on the edge of their toes and leaving adults satisfied with the depth of content matter. Having arrived in Sydney, Marlin immediately jumps back into the search for his son. While the graphics change with the new on-land scenery, their impressive Pixar quality remains. New sounds from the city and music perfectly accompany every plot curve as the two fish face new challenges of human and bird interaction. A pelican named Nigel flies in to save the two fish from a particularly hungry flock of seagulls placing bids on their next meal, saying ""Mine! Mine! Mine!"" in their thick Australian brogue. The creative scripting is again paired with a hidden message of parenting that sometimes you need to take a risk and trust other people. Finding Nemo is a fantastic film, with much thought, enthusiasm and heart behind the plot, animation and message. Finding Nemo leaves Mom and Dad with a feeling of parental community in that they are not alone in their struggles with parenting. The innocent humor and narrative plot leaves children wanting to watch the movie several times over and quote their favorite lines with friends. The movie is appropriate for all children ages six and older and all adults who are young at heart. The underlying comedy and animation in this film hides a message that speaks of social issues, politics and parenting, which makes Finding Nemo a great movie for children and adults alike. Disney's Finding Nemo jumps a full step above Toy Story and does not even compare to the original classics like Cinderella, winning an Oscar Award and Best Animated Children's movie in the 2004 Academy Awards.",10
3 September 2019,Best animated film I've seen,"I've always been a huge fan of animation but ""Finding Nemo"" has been, and will always be, my favorite animated film. I have yet to find another film as memorable or inspirational.

23 March 2023,my first watched movie,"This is the very first movie i ever saw, at least in my conscious memory. It was 2004 maybe. My uncle took me and my little sis for a visit to one of his friend's place. They had a dvd player. And also a lot of animated films. They suggested that we should watch this new movie that they have bought. Before this i never watched a full length film in one sitting. I remember i watched finding nemo at one breath. Didnt loose my attention for one single frame. Point to note, english is not my first tongue. And at that age i didn't understand it well. But of course that didn't stop me from enjoying the film. I teared up at the end of it and that says something, i barely cry watching movies. This will forever be the best film for me.

1 August 2003,Finding Nemo Is The Funniest Movie Of All Times!!!!!!,"I think is the best movie right after The Lion King. I think it was one of the funniest movies that I have seen. It had a little bit of everything. Marlin and his scary self, Dory and her very funny self and of course Nemo and his brave self.

30 November 2003,An Absolute Experience in the Underwater World!,"This is one movie that doesn't have any age boundaries, anyone from 2 years and above will enjoy this movie. It's a movie that can be seen over and over again, while enjoying it more each time. The voices of Marlin and Cory are fantastic and the beauty of the sea is simply spectacular. I would rate this movie a 9.8/10 for overall imagery, sound and story line.

Definitely, one that must be in your personal collection!

6 October 2006,Finding Nemo,"""Finding Nemo"" How many children love the ocean? The ocean is a fabulous place that holds many of our creatures in the world. Take an adventure with Nemo and his friends through the adventures, and dilemmas of the ocean. You will meet some fish whose home is in the ocean. What sounds like more fun then going on a rip tide ride with a sea turtle? Or meeting a shark who doesn't eat fish anymore? If you find the ocean one of the most fascinating places on earth then ""Finding Nemo"" is just the movie for you.

""Finding Nemo"" came out in 2003, and caught many children's attention. The main characters are Nemo is who the little clown fish who is lost, Marlin who is also a clown fish, looking for his son Nemo, Dory who meets Marlin during his attempt to rescue Nemo. The movie is about a cartoon clown fish fish called Nemo, who wants to prove to his friends that he is not scared and gets taken away by a scuba diver, for a tank in a dentist office. Marlin who is Nemo's father tries to rescue Nemo during the whole movie. Marlin comes across new characters such as Dory, who becomes his partner in searching for Nemo. They go on an underwater adventure to save Nemo and come face to face with sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish, and so much more. It received 81/2 stars out of 10 on the rating scale for movies. It is 100 minutes long and won an Oscar for the making of this outstanding movie. The director of this movie Andrew Stanton and the Co-director is Lee Unkrich. The cartoon characters voices in this movie are done by famous people. Just some examples the voice of Nemo is Alexander Gould, the voice of Marlin is Albert Brooks and the voice of Dory is Ellen Degeneres.

This movie starts out at Nemo's coral reef home. His mother is killed in the beginning which sets the stage for his father taking care of him. Nemo goes to school on the first day. The class is taking a field trip to the drop off, which Marlin, Nemo's father is not happy about. Marlin goes to the drop off to save his son, but when he gets there he witnesses Nemo being taken away by a scuba diver. Nemo was proving to his friends that he can get the closest to a boat, and was kidnapped by a scuba diver for a dentist's fish tank at his office. Marlin decides to go on an adventure and look in the whole ocean to find Nemo. Marlin meets Dory, who is a forgetful, funny fish. She forgets things quickly, and she explains to Marlin she has short term memory. Dory decides to help Marlin find Nemo. They meet a shark called Bruce who is not eating fish anymore, they meet a sea turtle Squirt and go on a rip tide ride with the sea turtles towards where Nemo is, they come across a school of jellyfish, and a lantern fish. Nemo and Marlin come across many hardships during this movie. Now hopefully you are wondering does Marlin ever save Nemo? You will have to watch the movie and find out.

I think Marlin was a determined fish and father. During the whole movie he never once said he was going to give up. Partially I think what kept Marlin going was the fact that he lost his wife and now he doesn't want to loose his son. Marlin comes face to face with a shark Bruce, who brings him back to his other two friends that are sharks. They participate in an AA meeting against eating fish. Dory bumps her nose and starts to create blood this triggers Bruce and he then wants to eat fish. Marlin runs from the shark and never gives up. Even at the end when Marlin is safe he still continues to find Nemo despite what other hardships he will encounter. This shows a child who is watching ""Finding Nemo"" that it is not okay to give up. That when you want to achieve a goal such as Marlin wants to rescue Nemo you should continue you're hardest even when times get tough. This movie is targeted towards children at a young age, and I think it is important to teach them never to give up even when they are not succeeding. This movie, as well as Marlin the character gives a great example that you should never give up.

I thought this movie was an excellent movie for children. It teaches the children about the ocean and certain species that live in the ocean. It explains certain areas in the ocean such as a ""drop off"" or a ""rip tide"". The movie also teaches the children about these topics in a fun way. For example you go on a sea turtle ride down the rip tide. During the ride, the sea turtles are acting like they are surfing and the voices of the sea turtles change too. ""Finding Nemo"" also instills in young children to not give up. That you should continue to try when times get tough. In the beginning it also gives an example of why children should not go off on their own. It demonstrates that Nemo left his class and was taken away by someone that a child can relate to as a stranger. There are many lessons to be learned in the movie and they teach them in a creative way. That's why I think you should go watch ""Finding Nemo"" and take you kids along too. Then you can also find out if Marlin finds Nemo.",8

14 August 2022,a classic,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

3 February 2007,"Acting great, movie not so much at times","The vocal talents in this film are great. I love the way Ellen DeGeneres portrayed Dory. Perfect actress. I find that, at times, the only thing keeping the movie funny is Dory. I found the plot strong but the execution weak in places. I like the movie and I've watched it a few times, but it's not a movie I'd watch over and over. It was a big hit and it'll be around for a while.

I was disappointed in the way that the director chose to portray several scenes. A couple of scenes (or animated motions) are repeated in the exact same way throughout the film. If the script calls for the same text to be repeated, it's okay to repeat it, just don't repeat the entire animation.

8 November 2003,Anybody who doesn't like this movie needs to learn to laugh!,"I enjoyed this movie tremendously. It may be a ""cartoon"", but it has depth (no pun intended) and soul that many movies fail to attain. I laughed out loud at the all-too-human emotions portrayed by the different sea creatures, and forgot I was watching an animation. A must see for all ages.

I think one reason for it is the fact that the fish were colorful enough that it held their interest for the whole movie. They now want everything that is Nemo themed.

28 August 2003,Disappointing,"I'm one of Pixar's greatest fans, but this film was a serious disappointment (I was even looking forward to the flight!).

The animation was, as you'd expected from Pixar flawless. As a scuba diver pretty well everything looked right and felt right - even the transition from reef to sandy bottom was right on the button!

*However* what happened to the story/script and character development? In this respect it wasn't a patch on Pixar's other films. It fell into classic (note with a small 'c') Disney territory - simple story, great for little kids but what about us big ones?

10 June 2008,i didn't understand what is for this,"a very good movie it has a history that make it interesting for any person of any age it shows a fish and another fish searching for a third fish in something as big as ""the ocean"", a very good song of the great band Led Zeppelin, i recommend to listen, the band started at end of the 60's and dissolves in the 80 because of the dead of a member: John Bonham, the drummer who has a Ludwig kit and is of color amber, made of Plexiglas a material which propose a sound with less resonance... and this comes because the fish that is the center of the movie is orange and also the dad and both are clown fishes and don't make laugh anybody with their boring jokes. the clown works usually in the circus or in the street and make some money with the coins that people gives to them and always are reformulating their routine for the public and they can forget something because usually they improvise if they mistake, but Dori that forget everything can't... 'cause forget everything

1 July 2003,A presentation of Dory's personality by expression.,"Dory's terrific facial expressions and splendid eye movements really captivated me. One could almost picture her thought process, such that it was. Dory had a look that you knew she couldn't ""answer the question"" or ""question the answer"", but she had that look that you knew she wouldn't leave your side. Great art work.

10 June 2003,Right up there with Toy Story and Toy Story 2; well-animated with a good plot.,"Finding Nemo was an excellent film, in my humble opinion, from start to finish. I walked into the theater without particularly high expectations. Since the trailers had told us absolutely nothing about the movie, I actually assumed that Dory and Marlin were man and wife (or something); I questioned how a movie of any length could be carried entirely by a fish's search for his son. I must confess that my expectations were completely exceeded. I was blown away.

I'm not going to sit here and summarize the movie for you; just go watch for yourself. (133/135 favorables at RottenTomatoes.com, for the record.) But I will say this: this is not just a kid's film. I'm a 19 year old girl, and I think it's safe for me to say that theoretically I shouldn't empathize overmuch with either father or son (being a far cry from a kid aching to go to school, or a fretting mother). It was funny and exciting, following in the tradition of Pixar films, with jokes for all ages. You know you should expect the happy ending, but certain moments still make you jump and fret a little or sit at the edge of your seat.

Of course, the animation was brilliant. Kudos to the CGI team and RenderMan for a job well done. The water program is very nice, the coral reef brilliant and teeming with life. The scenes from above the water were photorealistic at times. And beyond the computer animation, I'd like to offer a few thanks to the team that made the water gravity work (things fall in water, even fish; they just fall differently) and the fish move. I've hardly seen anything about it, but the movements are very realistic and follow the real patterns of fish movement (Dory swims in short spurts; ""Built for speed"" as she puts it; Marlin rows with his tail and uses his fins in an alternating pattern). Nemo's movement is different, as well; he swims with more of his body to make up for his bad fin. It's seamless, and thus hardly noticable.

The music is whimsical and has a bit of a dreamlike quality. When Marlin loses the boat the music makes me think of a bad dream. I really love the score; I bought it today, and now I like it even better. :)

Themes, themes, themes. Every movie has to have one, and the most frequent complaint seems to be that Finding Nemo's theme is shallow. I don't know much about making a good theme, but I will tell you that what theme there was acted as wonderful character development. There's bravery, friendship, and parenthood stuff going on in there. It stikes a chord partially because those on the developing team know so much about letting children grow up, since many of them have kids, too. I think the feeling the producers put into the film comes through in the film itself, anyway.

On the subject of character development: If Dory was the comic relief, then Marlin was the one that carried the movie. There are those that find Marlin annoying, and those that feel Albert Brooks is undistinguished in this role (apparently Marlin is the quissential Brooks character), but while Dory made me laugh, I always wanted to know what was going to happen next with Marlin. His constant fretting just made sense to me; this is his son we're talking about after all, and Marlin is keenly aware of how much personal danger he is in when he leaves the reef. (He and Dory almost get eaten six times, if you consider that the jellyfish are indeed 'trying' to eat them.) Also, it's understated, but the fact that Marlin leaves the reef is a huge deal for him, being something of a coward; and outside their anemones, clownfish are completely defenseless. Besides, Dory really helps balance out Marlin's pessimism.

Dory/Marlin interaction is funny, actually; Marlin is always the parent with these two. He has to be. And he does indeed equivocate Dory with Nemo in his mind, on some level, as demonstrated in the belly (or mouth) of the whale. But Dory teaches Marlin some things, and Marlin teaches Dory a little, and the audience is thoroughly entertained by their banter in the meantime.

I thought all of the voice acting was brilliant, actually. Degeneres cracks me up. Whale scene; enough said. It apparently took her two days of speaking whale to produce all that. Albert Brooks may have been built for the role, but he's all the better for it. His voice almost breaks in all the right places. Honorable mentions go to Alexander Gould, who really managed to project himself into Nemo. One tends to forget this is a kid's voice-acting. Geoffery Rush, the pelican, is a brilliant character. I only wish there was more of him. Willem Dafoe; do I really have to say anything? Brilliant as always. Crush is voiced by Mr. Stanton himself, and all I have to say is 'Duuuude'. My friends and I have been saying ""You were like, 'Woah!', and we were like, 'Woah!!', and you were like, 'wooooah',"" for days now. Very, very nice.

To quickly compare it to other Pixar films, I'd say this was more ambitious than any of the other films in terms of scope, and more ambitious than every film except A Bug's Life in terms of choice of protagonist. (A movie about fish. Come on!) Depending on your taste, you might like any of the other Pixar movies better, but I'll say now that if Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are my favorites, Nemo is right up there next to them.

My rating: 5 out of 5. Brilliant, witty, goofy, adventurous, and even a bit suspenseful. Well done, Pixar. Well done.",10
3 September 2003,Years Best,"There are not that many movies that I can honestly say that I've watched over and over again. This is one of them. The lines are classic, funny, and the facial expressions of the characters is priceless. Pixar has done it again! Keep up the great work and I can't wait for 'the Incredibles'

19 September 2006,Why I think this movie is horrible in terms of creativity,"Notice I didn't say, ""Why this movie sucks."" I am merely stating my opinion, people. And for those of you who say the Finding Nemo message boards are for people who LIKE the movie--you are wrong. The message boards are supposed to be ABOUT the movie, and that's all. The following message DOES belong in this message board, even though it is a negative message.

Why I don't like this movie (and many other CGI's):

1) Pixar: ""Well we've done a movie about this, we've done a movie about that, now all we need is a movie about fish! But it won't be hard, we'll just take the themes from our other movies and put it underwater.""

2) Pixar movies all have the same unoriginal puns in them, and those puns are the only reason the movies are considered funny. A fish in a Pixar movie would say, ""Give me high fin!"" instead of ""high five."" It's really unoriginal and as un-clever as ""un-clever"" can be. A place in a Pixar movie will say, ""Give me high wing!"" A Bug's Life had another awfully uncreative pun: ""Shoo, fly, don't bother me."" And the funny part? He said it to a fly! HAHAHAHAHAHA, get it?! Jeez, Pixar is ridiculous. Toy story and Ice Age are really the only clever ones out there that don't rely on puns for humor. Superhero Pixar movie: ""Eat your vegetables so you get stronger."" HAHAHAHAHAHA! He's ALREADY strong! HAHA!

3) Dory: more annoying than Chris Rock's voice, more annoying than Chris Tucker screaming at Ice Cube. More annoying than the fact that almost all of the children's movies out there today are CGI.

4) Even in the movies where the characters are HUMANS, they STILL are trying to replace regular animation. CGI art is easier than pencil; computers automate a lot of the movements of things. The artist sets a track for the fish fins to follow, for the tail to follow, for the body to follow, hits okay, and boom, you got a fish swimming.

5) And again, for emphasis: same jokes as every other Pixar movie out there.",4
1 June 2003,Great Movie,"This is a great movie from pixar animation studios, and as good as the two Toy Story's, maybe even better. If you feel like seeing a well-thought out movie thats great for your kids as well as you, check out this flick. ****

14 January 2004,very entertaining,"Was not much of a fan of animation films but I saw Shrek, which was good. Nemo I like more. The turtles killed me. Ironic how the writer/producer is one of the more memorable characters, ""Crush"". I take it Mr. Stanton was a fan of ""Fast times at Ridgemount High"" because his look and sound of Crush is just like Sean Penn's ""Jeff Spicoli.""

30 May 2003,Another beautiful Pixar effort,"I couldn't possibly want more from this film. I really did expect the film to be as visually stunning, touching and outright funny as it was. Pixar continues to improve on it's amazing and, quite frankly, perfect series of films. It's good to know that there's still someone in Hollywood that is being creative and cranking out movies that anyone can enjoy. Pixar has never let me down, and at this rate, I don't think it ever will.

12 June 2003,absolutely hilarious!!,"wow, were some critics wrong when they said this movie is more for children than adults. it definitely is for both. i laughed the whole way through watching this movie and so did all those around me. all the kids were so entertained that they all stopped crying/bouncing/talking the moment the movie began until the end!! and after the movie was over, i could hear adults STILL talking about their favorite lines and arguing about which was their favorite character. and the animation was AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. great screenplay and great characters. and so imaginative. EVERYONE should see this movie.

7 April 2010,A got to see!!!!!,"The pix-tar film Finding Nemo was one of the most entertaining movie i have seen in a long time.The film was directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich.Finding Nemo is a cartoon so there are no real people actually in the movie besides the voices of each character. But each of the actors that did each voice did a wonderful job and should be very proud of the job they did in the film. . There are three main characters in this movie, Marlin which is the father fish, Nemo in the little kid fish, and Dory which is Martin's friend that he finds on his journey he takes. The voice of Martin in played by Albert Brooks which I thought did I great job playing the strict worried father role throughout the movie. The voice of Dory is played by Ellen DeGeneres, which is the best role in this movie. She fits the characters scrip so well it seems like she is really the fish in this movie not an actual person. Ellen keeps you laughing almost the whole movie with her voices and little side humor that some people pick up on and some don't. The last main character is Nemo the son of Martin and is played by Alexander Gould which isn't really a huge actor in the Hollywood scene but did a wonderful job in the Pixar film. His character is a little clown fish that gets lost and has to be found by his father before something else happens. The plot of finding Nemo is wrote very well by the directors. There are many parts in the movie that make you laugh your pants offand other parts that might mae a tear or two come out of your eyes. If you are bored or have a date that wants to watches a funny cartoon movie Finding Nemo is one to see. I don't think anyone in the room wouldn't want to watch the beautiful colors of the Pixtar Film.",

28 June 2010,Subject,"This film is spectacular all around. The story is about two fishes, one father the other son. It being too curious and feeling is father is too overprotective of him. Where one day he decides to get close of a boat in the middle of nowhere after his father told him not to. One thing leads to another and the child Nemo gets kidnapped by the owners of the boat who were scuba diving at that point. Now the father must go on a quest to find his kidnapped son. One the way he meets a companion that slight issues with memory and together they journey to find and retrieve Nemo. The movie show how much a parent is willing to go for their child and what they are willing to do for them. and also it shows that parents are right about somethings that when they ask you not to doing something or touch something, they know what they are talking about.

22 November 2003,stunning animation with intelligent story about a piece of life,"The first time i watched 'Finding Nemo', all i could do was just laugh and laugh... 'cause you can never ever control that!!! it was a complicated feeling i felt then... and still i am amazed by the complexity that the movie has.

'Finding Nemo' is a breakthrough. It's not just about celebrating the creative art work of the professionals, it's more than that. 'Finding Nemo' is a true animation with all that intelligence, taste, and all good things that come in minds of anybody around the world. I think it's like the best modern animated movie that stun people's eyes and mind.

You'll never know how you can even forget about how funny dory was. I mean... all characters are also very special, unique and they build up this animation into something so much real. It's just too real that somehow it makes me think that Those fishes can talk. You know how dory's actually trying to talk with a whale... and for God's sake, she can!!!

'Finding Nemo' itself really speaks. It has so much meanings that we can relate them to our lives. It's... you know... AMAZING. How Fish actually more humanity than a human itself. Hahaha... yeah, that's for sure!!!

This is gonna be like 'Beauty & The Beast' that was nominated as the Best Picture at Oscar several years ago... u see how those critics comment about 'Finding Nemo'??? They give 'FN' the A grade.., almost all!!! better than they actually give to those films that's gonna be predicted to being nominated as the best picture 2004 like mystic river and master and commander.

let's see how 'Finding Nemo' can lead its way to Oscar 2004!!! I bet that it's gonna take the trophy. At least for Best Animated Feature. And I hope it's gonna make steps to the Best Picture, best original screenplay, best original score and song and best art-direction/set decoration or even best director... Let's see!!!

So, u agree with me???",10
9 September 2003,My first animated movie ever!!!!,"It sounds like my first movie ever if I had missed hits like ""Shrek"", ""Monsters Inc."", ""Ice Age"", ""Toy Story"", ""The Lion King"" and the list goes on and on. There had been so many great animated movies but I just hadn't watched one, dunno why.. but I couldn't resist ""Finding Nemo"" and i am soo glad that my first experience is so great.. now i am dying to watch all other animated classics which i have missed.. ""Finding Nemo"" was such a great movie and I think if I wasn't acquainted with ""Aussie accent"", I probably won't have enjoyed the movie this much.. I simply loved it and hey this is the first time I voted for a movie and first time I am commenting on a movie here on imdb... I can't help but reckon everyone who hasn't seen it yet, just go and have great fun....

cheers coolio

28 May 2003,Great Film!,"Finding Nemo is a great film. It is packed with a lot of humor! It also has some parts that can sadden children, but overall it is something that the family can enjoy.

I guess some irony can make the movie interesting, like a shark on a 12-step program to become friends with fish or a pelican telling a fish to hop in it's mouth to save it's life.

The movie opens up with some sad scenes, like Nemo's mother (with the eggs) getting eaten by a barracuda. Nemo is the only child of Marlin, who is now overprotective of his son.

Well, I won't spoil the movie for you, but I have heard from others that, even though it's rated G, some of the younger children did actually cry during the movie.

Well, overall, it was a great movie with amazing graphics. It's no wonder they spent a long time working on this project, but it did pay off.

I rate this film a 9 out of 10.",
26 June 2003,I loved it!!!,"I went to see 'Finding Nemo' with 3 of my friends and my little cousin, and we were very lucky to get tickets, but we all LOVED the movie so much. I personally thought Dory was played very well! I would definatly see it again, and I am definatly getting it when it arrives on DVD!! I would reccommend it to anyone that wants to see a good, funny, movie!!

30 May 2003,WOW,"opening night of finding nemo.. and it rocked my socks ;-) definitely one of pixar's best. the story line is brand new. the animation is incredible. the characters are unforgettable. and the humor is spread well throughout the entire film. i definitely recommend Finding Nemo for anyone of any age.. it has jokes for adults while at the same time being educational for kids.

the only thing i was disappointed with was that there were no outtakes! :-O

31 May 2003,"Totally Excellent, Dude!","This is the BEST movie from Pixar yet. The story line was well thought out, and excellently executed. I was worried that parts of the movie would be too intense. However, the humor that infused the entire movie kept this from happening. Finding Nemo is the best kind of comedy. Totally unlike so many comedies today, where you have a few really funny scenes connected by long periods of not funny. My husband commented that this was the most continuously funny movie that he had seen in a long time. I personally did not expect to like this movie. I don't care for Albert Brooks, or Ellen DeGeneres, but the movie itself distracted me from who was doing the voices.

My two girls, 7 & 9, loved it. My youngest really enjoyed the scenes with the sharks, the turtles and, her favorite part, the whales. My oldest enjoyed the way Marlon and Dorrie escaped from the sharks, and the way the movie ended. We will be purchasing this one when it comes out on DVD.

31 May 2003,Warning! Not just another Pixar Fun Film!,"In `Toy Story: we were treated to a hip, fresh view of life from the toy's point of view. Ditto for `A Bug's Life'. `Monsters Inc' rounded out Pixar's penchant for getting inside the head of the imaginary and creating an intriguing world that.sucked us in and took as for a great ride.

Enter :'Finding Nemo'. It is here Pixar has dropped the ball. Do we get a fresh, unique perspective of life from the Fish point of view? Nope. Fish swim, they are afraid of predators, and well, that's about it. The ocean is a dangerous place, a theme repeated with boring redundancy throughout the film. The plot slogs along from one anxiety invoking mishap to the next, with little humor intervening. What little humor there is comes across as weak. The scene with sharks in an AA type meeting swearing off fish as meals simply doesn't work. I guarantee you will check your watch in the first 30 mins, then regularly thereafter.

I understand kids movies are to be simple and funny, with the occasional sad parts and near misses. This is more near misses and sad parts, and I just expected much more from Pixar in terms of story and imagination. The animation is absolutely breathtaking, and the acting is excellent. Too bad the underlying skeleton is so weak.

I see the next Pixar film, slated for November, is `The Incredibles.' It has a different writer, so hopefully we'll have shot at getting things up to snuff.",
31 May 2003,Laughed and laughed,"Yes, the movie was predictably formulaic - it's a Pixar movie for kids, what were you expecting, ""Roger Rabbit""? Yes, the animation was incredible. Yes, the actors were ideal for the parts.

Most importantly, the movie made me laugh and laugh. I highly recommend this movie for inner children of all ages.

2 June 2003,The bar has been raised yet again.....,"Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes Nemo. Maybe responding to the gauntlets thrown down by DreamWorks (Shrek) and Fox (Ice Age), Disney/Pixar have come out with their most visually stunning and most emotionally moving film yet. The humor, small details, background action, and minor characters (the gulls really cracked me up!) provide the richness that make this a definite see-again. But maybe the best compliment is how thoroughly I forgot the CG wizardry and was drawn into the world of the characters. You don't need to know it's computer animation, it's just *animation*, and it keeps getting better all the time.

Can't wait to see what those folks will come up with next....

30 November 2003,"The sharks not vegetarian, just not fish eaters?","One of the funnier things that I missed initially is that Bruce, a great white, Chum, a mako, and Anchor, a hammerhead are all shark species that attack people... While they may be swearing off eating fish, there is nothing to say that they aren't getting their fill off people instead.

4 June 2003,"Great film, no spoilers, just praise.","Finding Nemo is an excellent family movie. Far above the recent releases of ""Shrek"" and ""Ice Age,"" Finding Nemo achieves the right balance of humor with tragedy. The voices fit the characters neatly and the writing is extremely sharp and innovative.

My only caution would be for the extremely young child. Some scenes are dark and scary, so I would warn parents who think that a toddler should see movies in the theater. (With the exception of the Rugrats movies, children under 5 generally can't sit still long enough...)

Go and see it! Now! Take the entire family, and fear not for bad language or extensive bathroom humor, just enjoy yourself! :)

4 June 2003,This is a charming movie.,"I went into the movie a little suspicious because lately so many movies' highlights are the trailers, and there's nothing more! But this one was delightful. The humor was great, the lessons for children and parents many, the animation breathtaking. My only concerns are a couple of ""scary"" moments for very small children -- even I jumped when the shark (Bruce) first appeared on the screen. But nothing is sustained enough to cause real nightmares (I have a 23 year old who is still scared of clowns and spiders because of movies she saw ... I thought she was old enough!) All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.

I throughly enjoyed 'Finding Nemo' It was cute that most everyone had some kind of disability. Casting Ellen Degeneres as Dory was brilliant. I cracked up everytime she couldn't remember anything. ...and when she was talking 'Whale', she did it brilliantly. The subtle jokes and mannerisms were ingenious. I will never see a sea gull again without thinking of ""Mine, Mine"". I'm still laughing thinking about the movie.

16 June 2003,When will they find the fish so I can go home?,"Unfortunately, I went into Finding Nemo with high expectations. By the end, I left wishing I had just taken a good nap at the theater rather than waste my time (it felt like roughly 12 hours) watching this insipid flick.

The movie made me smile a couple of times (mostly at the forgetful fish), and, if it had been written as a fifth grade class project, would have had an impressive plot. The surfer turtles - lame. Overprotective dad - boring. The bad fin on Nemo - come on! Any potential actual laughing the movie might have engendered was wasted by the fact that I had seen all of the funny scenes approximately 1,721 times in commercials and previews.

As positive a review as I can give: ""Cute film your kids might like. Good animation""

Real Review: ""Waste of time and money. The whole family would have a much better time at the zoo watching monkeys fling poop at each other.""",4
3 July 2003,Not for little guys,"Took my little guys (2 & 3 years old) to see this flick and it scared the pants off them. I am sure this movie is very enjoyable for kids that are a little older but if you do have little ones and are considering this movie - wait for the DVD or VHS and rent it.

6 July 2003,"Pixar has done it, once again...","I remember when I saw the first few trailers for this, I thought that Pixar may have made a movie that wasn't up to par with the others. However, I decided to see it, just because it was Pixar, and I hadn't yet been let down by any of their movies. I sure was wrong in thinking that this was going to be bad!

The movie starts out on a rather dramatic note, but soon, the humor kicks in, especially with the introduction of Dory. She provides much of the humor, but it isn't just her that makes this movie great. Marlin is Nemo's overprotective dad, and he provides a bit of humor as well. The voice acting is spot on, and Ellen Degeneres (Dory) and Albert Brooks (Marlin), do excellent jobs with these characters. What is even better is that the jokes are not just for children; they are pretty enjoyable for adults as well...(I'm a teenager, and the audience I saw this with was mainly made up of adults...without kids.)This just goes to show how great Pixar is.

The computer animation is also quite stunning, from the backdrops of Sydney, Australia, to the murky look of the ocean water in some scenes. I have to admit that I was quite impressed with several scenes in this film.

The minor characters are great as well. The fish in the aquarium also provide for plenty of laughs. The character of Darla, with her introduction including the 'Pyscho' shower music, was pretty interesting as well...She kind of reminded me of Sid from Toy Story.

Anyway, Finding Nemo is an excellent, well-made flick, and it is probably the best movie so far from Pixar. This is definitely one that you should catch in theaters.

The best movie that I've seen so far this year....9/10",9

14 August 2003,Very Inspiration Movie!,"I thought Finding Nemo was one of the best films I have ever seen. Not only did it have excellent animation but it also had a heartwarming story as well. If one were to peel back the layers of this story, some powerful lessons in the game of life could be found. Although the main characters are portrayed as colorful tropical fish, it is easy to apply these messages to ourselves as well. Two lessons from this movie were especially appealing to me. The first was Marlin and the way he overcame his fear of leaving his home and losing sight of his son Nemo. That is quite understandable, for Marlin had gone through a very tragic incident with the destruction of his mate and all but one of his eggs. When Nemo was taken away by divers, he did not just give up and accept that he would never see his son again. He went after his son, faced his fears, overcame enormous obstacles, and discovered the value of trust with another fish he had befriended along the way. The next lesson occurred when Nemo got stuck in the filter and Gill insisted that he get himself out. Nemo assumed that his gimpy fin was an obstacle and would therefore make it impossible for him to get out. Also, his dad always helped him in those situations. When Nemo got himself out, the expression was of confidence and pride. A disability does not mean that person can do less than anyone else. The values of trust, letting go, and facing your fears in the setting of the fascinating ocean environment, along with the comic relief of Dory, proved an ingenious way of making an excellent film. I hope viewers will take the opportunity to take the messages to help themselves grow as people. I know I did.",
19 June 2011,Finding Nemo,"Finding Nemo is an animated film created in 2003 about the father –son adventure through the mysterious wonders of the ocean and the new discoveries of the land of humans. The story begins as Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould) is the only survivor after a shark attacks his mother and the other eggs. Nemo's father takes Nemo under his fins and they begin their new life together. The story unfolds as Nemo is taken by humans from his home on the coral reef. Nemo's father Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) sets out on his journey to find Nemo and bring him back home. Nemo becomes entrapped in a fish tank, in a dentist's office, where Nemo learns that he is the new present for the Dentist's niece. Nemo befriends the other fish and together they make the escape from the land of humans to the deep waters of the ocean once again. The battles that Marlin and his new found friend Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres) encounter on their journey through the dangerous waters will capture the audience's attention and will keep the kids guessing on what will happen next. The vivid colors and real life sounds create a world of imagination and fun as the audience becomes entranced with the feeling of swimming right alongside of these new found friends. Finding Nemo is a family movie that tells the tale of a father -son bond and how far someone will go to save the one they love. We see the theme of defeating all odds and overcoming all obstacles for those you love while battling hand in hand with strangers that they now call friends. We saw how Marlin and Dory survived the chase of a vicious shark and escaped the jaws of an anglerfish as they stayed determined to find and rescue Nemo from the unknown dangers of the open sea and land. The extraordinary will power of Nemo, a young fish, has overcome all the challenges that life has thrown at him and will leave an impression on many young viewers.

The way that the film transitions from Marlin and Dory's journey to the journey of Nemo allows the audience to see the struggles of both audiences while keeping tabs on what is going on. It also creates the anticipation and the importance of overcoming the dangers they encounter. The fast motion allows for the audience to become involved with the multiple life threatening chases that the characters run into without making them too long for a young audience to keep attention. The elaborate colors and the sounds help the audience to become involved and really feel like they are on the journey with Nemo. The darkening of the ocean gives the impression of the deepness and the dangerous parts of the ocean that Marlin must travel to get to where he needs to go, once again seeing the perseverance of Marlin and what he is willing to do to get to Nemo.",10
1 September 2003,From a 40-something,"I have come to expect entertaining and visually engaging family fare from Pixar. ""Finding Nemo"" was that and more! I was awestruck by the underwater effects. I was touched by the story of a father searching for his son (my young son sat next to me as we watched the film). I was impressed by the vocal performances; these actors weren't simply reading lines, they were interpreting the roles. Perhaps this film warrants only a nod of respect from 20-somethings, who acknowledge the technical accomplishments, but take it from this 40-something, this film deserves generous applause for delivering something that connects as well as entertains. Perhaps this accounts for its staying power at the box office?

11 September 2003,Great movie looking forward to it coming out on DVD,"What can I say another Disney/Pixar success. I've gotta say my favourite character is Crush. He's the one that will bring California surf talk back onto the world stage.

It's great to hear real Aussie actors in a big budget animated movie. I've also gotta say that I loved how the little characters made the movie what it is such as our own local tv personality Rove McManus as one of the crabs getting off on the bubbles coming out of the sewer pipe.

On such a sad day like today it's great to be able to smile just a bit. Let's never forget the people who aren't with us today.

Dude... dude...dude...

P.S Sydney Harbour isn't that clean btw. Just thought I'd point that out.

14 July 2011,Journey to the Ends of the Ocean,"In the film ""Finding Nemo"", there are many scenes and events that capture the attention of any viewer of any age. The movie begins in the ocean with a clown fish and his wife. There were expecting hundreds of children together, when something tragic happens to the mom and all her baby eggs, all but one egg died. The clown fish promises to keep that baby safe no matter what and he names him Nemo. The father fish takes Nemo to school one day, and while at school Nemo gets captured by divers. The father fish searches the entire ocean looking for his son, and on his quest to find him, he makes interesting friends and learns many things about the ocean. When the father fish finally finds his son, he is being flushed down the sink because he is ""belly up."" Father fish decides that he has nothing else to lose, and slowly makes his way back to his home in the coral. When the movie takes a turn for the unexpected, the audience cannot help but to stay and see what happens.

Directors Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich try to show the audience many meanings. Some of the meanings would be directed towards adults and some to younger children. One meaning that they portray very well in this movie is the meaning of family value. They show that family is important because the father was willing to go to the ends of the ocean to find his son, and he was willing to do whatever it took to find him. Another meaning which the directors portray is that determination can take us to wherever we want to be, as long as we try. In many scenes in this movie, Nemo or his dad take many risks to achieve something. They both are determined to find each other and to come home safely, and with the determination, they find success and they find out about who they are.

This movie is one of the best movies that I have ever watched. I love that the movie shows a relationship with a father and a son. In most Disney movies, the relationships are between a mother and a daughter. I also enjoyed this movie because the color and images of the ocean were appealing to the eye. The vibrant colors keep a young child's attention and they also match descriptions of what the ocean really looks like. Another reason why I enjoy watching this movie is because the humor that is used can be understood by adults and by young children. I would recommend this movie to anybody who asks, and I would also tell them to be prepared to watch it numerous times.",
6 October 2003,Another (Searching For/Find) Pixar film!!!,"I'm sorry but this film was disappointing! It was of course a great looking film full of eye candy, but plot wise it was little different from the past Pixar films... yet again the main character has to go and search for or find someone!!!

Toy story - Search/Find our way back to Andy's home Toy story 2 - Search/Find Buzz! Bugs Life - Search/Find bugs that can help Finding Nemo - Search/Find a fish with a tiny flipper

I don't know who to blame for this lack of originality... Disney or Pixar?! I have loved every film they have done so far... don't get me wrong I enjoyed Nemo for the first 10 minutes. But it just hit me how similar these films are! I kind of hate myself for realising that too, because I so wanted to enjoy this film. Instead I found my self rolling my eyes at most of the events that occurred. I'm sure this film will entertain the under 16's which is the target audience. I just wish as with the other Pixar films there would be something there to entertain the more mature crowd. I'll try and end by saying if I had to rate this film out of 10 I would give it a 6.

As a little side criticism I thought Disney/Pixar missed a good opportunity to raise awareness of water pollution with this film. It made the ocean seem like a sparkling clean place, with no environment concerns. A little bit of awareness within the film would have been a nice touch.

PS. After saying all this, I have to admit the gulls were some of the funniest characters I've seen in a Disney/Pixar Production.",6
10 October 2003,Awsome!,"I love Pixar movies, there great. Well this isn't the best movie ever, it sure is good. Dory really is the funniest character, but what did you expect. The plot is good, but, as with all recet disney films, its all about comedy.

1 March 2004,"Wow, what a movie!","This movie should go down in history as one of the greatest animated movies of all time! I have not only seen this movie in the theater, but I also own this movie on DVD. It ranks up there with movies like Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. Not only is the movie a superb hit, but the actors who play the voices of the characters do a amazing job! Al Brooks, who plays the voice of Marlin, and Ellen Degeneres, who plays the hilarious roll of Dory, outdo any other movies in their unique and clever voice styles. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend that you go see it RIGHT NOW! Rent it at Blockbuster or buy it at Wal-Mart, wherever you get it, just go and watch it NOW! Its a 12/10!! :)

Also, what kind of fish are Bubbles and Gurgle? Bubbles is my absolute favorite character, he's so cute! I would be MUCH obliged to find this out...thanks a lot!

12 January 2004,Great for parents,"This was a great film for parents to view, as it taught us all a lesson in letting go. It's hard for parents, especially single parents, to let our children go out and experience the world on their own.

It was a fun and fast paced story, with many vivid characters.

16 February 2004,Made me fall in love,"Bet your wonder what I mean of Fall in Love. This movie is my all time favorite. I just love Dory, Bubbles, and Mr. Ray. On the Dvd there is a documantary called Jean-Mitchel Cousteu's exploring the reef. I saw the documentary and It made me fall in love with the ocean. Anyways, the movie rocked! Pixar's just getting better and better every movie.

17 February 2004,A Visual Feast of Fun,"This movie has been acclaimed and heralded for months now, and while it was an enjoyable movie (typical of Pixar/Disney) it wasnt the complete movie that Monsters Inc was. Nemo had many hit and miss moments, and while most of the movie was very enjoyable, so much seemed forced. Young ones will adore this movie, and it is one the whole family can enjoy

27 February 2004,To the point,"Another Pixar beauty. Enjoy it and don't take it too seriously as some reviewers have! If you can't see what the fuss is about, don't worry about it. I'm sure there are those who love it...I know I enjoyed it as did my children.

Didn't you just feel for poor Nemo when the dentist decided to give him to his peculiar looking daughter...she was a truly menacing little brat! As for the super cool turtles...they added a sense of calm humour to counter balance the dangerous and nervy journey through the jelly fish. This was a movie which touched all emotions and ended with a feel good factor. Can't be bad...can it?

27 April 2004,Excellent - Dory Rocks,"Well what can I say - I'm 35 and I love the movie. Ellen DeGeneres is absolutely fantastic as Dory. I've been speaking 'Whale' to people and getting very strange looks. It's so well written. The vibrant optimism of Dory though, steals the show. I think she should be prescribed for depression!

The quality of the Animation is second to none. The voices and characterizations are superb. You can't help thinking that the story could go on and on. I hope that the recent difficulties that Pixar and Disney had won't prevent a second movie.

To sum up - I saw a clip in a friends house and bought the DVD on the way home. Worth every cent!

29 March 2004,Pixar and Walt Disney's Fourth Movie,"Finding Nemo is the fourth movie that Pixar and Walt Disney have created. The movie was directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich. Finding Nemo is a story about a father, Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) and his son, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould).

As the movie opens, Marlin and his wife are staring at their unborn children. Suddenly a large predator fish appears. As they try to protect their children, Marlin is knocked unconscious and is unable to protect his family. When he awakes, he discovers that his wife and children are gone except for one egg. As the story progresses, it shows that that one egg has grown and is named Nemo. Adventure and new experiences is what Nemo longed for. It was hard to satisfy his urges because of his overprotective father always worried that he was in danger. One day while playing dare with his friends, Nemo ventures too close to a boat and is captured by one of the divers. His father tries to save him, but is too late and the journey of Finding Nemo begins.

The critical intentions of the writers and directors of the film were to show that always trying to protect your children can do more harm than good. They also show that the love for a child is strong and powerful thing which pushed Marlin to find his son regardless of the dangers or obstacles that would stand in his way.

Things I liked about the movie were the animation, everything looked real and vibrant, and the appeal of the characters especially Dory who puts a comical twist to the movie. I also enjoyed when the angel fish in the tank, Gill, who taught Nemo a lesson that he couldn't let his deformed fin hold him back from taking risk. Though I thought it to be a little sad when in the beginning of the movie Nemos mother dies. The movie its self I thought to be very cute. I am looking forward to the next Pixar and Walt Disney movie that is produced.",
3 June 2014,Heartwarming,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",9
25 April 2004,how cinematic and dramatic elements bring out its literary elements,"There are a number of ways that the cinematic and literary elements bring out the literary elements in ""Finding Nemo."" The scenery helps the viewer to identify that it is set in an ocean by using reefs and various types of fish and sharks along with the water. The lighting also helps this by the way that it shines through the water. It was kind of milky looking. Sound effects also helped the setting because there were sounds of fishes swimming through the water and engines from boats. Music helped to set the tone at various points throughout the movie by playing happy music when a great event has occured, sad music when something bad occured, and ominous sounding music when the viewer is supposed to not be sure about the outcome of a specific event. Dialogue was a huge factor in this film. Without it, there would be little symbolism, the plot would be unclear, and the character's traits would be a bit murky. In the dialogue, the characters uttered common sayings such as ""I'm glad I got that off my chest,"" which means a problem had been solved, and they also talked about the glass being half full or half empty dilemma which was to symbolize who was the optimist and the pessimist. This was brought up when Dorrie and Marlon were trapped in the whale and the water was going down in the whale's mouth. Dorrie said that the mouth was half full, and Marlon said that it was half empty. Another type of symbolism also occured in the whale when Marlon asked ""How do I taste, Moby?"" That was in reference to Moby Dick, a play in which one of the main characters was a whale. Dialogue also played a huge part in helping the viewer characterize the characters. Marlon was always saying stuff to Nemo like ""You're not going to be able to get out of there yourself,"" and he said to Dorrie that she could not speak whale. This led the viewer to characterize Marlon as an overprotective, negative father. Dorrie and Nemo, on the other hand, were always saying comments like ""Yes, I can,"" and ""Just let me do this!"" This would help to characterize them as the exact opposite of Marlon- they were positive and not overbearing. Dialogue also helped the plot to advance in the movie. In the beginning, Nemo and his dad were on the way to school and they were talking about meeting sharks and sea turtles and wondering how old sea turtles were. Marlon said that he would ask the sea turtle for his age after he met the shark, and he ended up meeting both later in the film while he was looking for Nemo. Dialogue also helped the theme because it was a positive theme, and Dorrie and Nemo and other fish were always positive.",
14 June 2012,Finding Nemo,"The movie ""Finding Nemo""takes place under the coral reef of the open sea water. A clownfish named Marlin lives with his son Nemo and he tells his son about how dangerous it is in the ocean. Nemo is captured by humans and his father Marvin has to go and rescue him. He is so worried that he doesn't know what is going to happen to his only son.  The genre is an adventure comedy for families.

        Nemo sets off into the ocean sea and explores what is around him. He then is abducted by humans and is netted up and taken away to the dentist office in Sydney. Meanwhile Marlin notices that Nemo has disappeared and is nowhere to be found. Marlin meets a fish named Dory who has a short term memory loss. They both travel a very big distance to search for Nemo and soon meet up with sharks, turtles and other sea creatures. While this is happening Nemo and his friends in the tank try to leave the area to go back to their original home.

          In the movie it shows how each of the characters are acting like. At first the movie starts really great because it shows how Nemo didn't want to go to the first day of school and his other friends were begging for him to come with them and they sounded so excited which make them look really cute. Another part that I liked in the movie was when Marlin felt so scared when he had lost his son. I can feel of how his father felt at that time because it's a father-son relationship. Marlin showed that he really cared for Nemo instead of just saying ""oh i don't care its whatever he'll come back eventually"". There was one part where I disliked of how Dory was asked if she seen a boat gone by. Even though she has short term memory she could have just said she didn't see anything instead of playing and joking around with Marlin. Dory says "" oh I seen a boat it went this way no it went this way"", I felt like she wanted to make Marlin feel more worried instead of telling him that she didn't see anything which is really rude.

          The photography in this movie is a dark background in some parts of the movie but there is also light in the movie too. I think that the photography is really great because it creates a mood where it's a calm and peaceful place. You can always see the sea creatures that are moving around the water, which makes the picture looks so beautiful. At the end of the movie, the picture shows that it's in the city and shows the people nature and the seagulls that are flying everywhere. This kind of photography makes the scene more attractive and would make the audience have a good feeling because it wouldn't be a boring scene.

         

        My overall reaction to this movie is that it is such a great movie! I recommend this movie for everyone to watch because it's an adventurous family movie. The world of Finding Nemo is such a pure and simple movie, with cute creatures that live under the ocean,and having lots of fun playing with each other. The music and theme also blend, very well with the movie. This movie shows a father and son relationship which would make little kids feel they should care about their loved ones and know that they are protected and never harmed. As a final thought, watching this movie with a family will absolutely make everyone smile and end the day with a warm feeling. I truly give this movie a rate 10/10!!!!",10
13 May 2004,Dory is the best!,"When I knew that Disney is going to stop making animated films such as Peter Pan or Aladdin, and that is going to make only films with Pixar (computer, computer, computer...), I felt sad. Disney has been with me since I was 3 or 4 and it's a pity that the great designers who work there stop doing such masterpieces. But if you see 'Finding Nemo' everything changes. I think I've never seen a film as good as this is. It's incredible how perfect the ocean and all its animals are designed: the vegetarian sharks (I love Bruce when he smells the blood!), Nemo and his father, the teacher Ray and all his pupils or the little octopus who loses ink. If you watch this film, you'll laugh, you'll feel like crying and you won't want to eat fish never in your life (at least in my case). The first thing I've said, laughing, is the biggest part of the film. In my opinion, Dory would win an Oscar for making me laugh without stopping when she starts to speak whale language or because of her loss of memory. According to the moving moments, what happens at the beginning would make anyone cry, it's very sad. And the most moving scene for me is when there are fishermen in a ship, at the end . And that's why I don't want to eat fish again!! I'm not going to say anything, just watch it! I recommend everybody to do it. You won't lose your time, trust me!!",
7 June 2005,"Some movies are to young, some movies are to mature, this one's good for all ages!","I'm in my ""late teens"" (16-18), and it's not like I still play with Pokémon or the kids meals toys (not that there's anything wrong with that-- especially among actual kids) but me and my friends love this movie. Recently, it's like Disney's kinda been on the down side, with not so good movies since the 90's. This movie is a ""diamond in the rough"". If your young, you'll like this movie. My mom liked this movie, and all my friends do. There's something to like for everyone! Me and my friends, we mostly like Dory. But lots of people like the Sea Turtles, or how Marlin's kinda annoying. So I would recommend this movie to anyone, your sure to find something you'll like about it! Just keep swimming man, just keep swimming! -AJ

""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.

The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.

There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.

I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.

The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.

Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.

Mine, mine, mine!",9
19 July 2004,Alright,"My biggest gripe is not with the movie but with society. This movie parallels An American Tale fairly closely, but yet An American Tale will not live in the lime light as well as Finding Nemo.

Watch American Tale and just try and tell me Finding Nemo is better.

Finding Nemo was dull and I don't think the characters developed much or that much emotion was drawn because there was not much development before the separation of father and son.

It also could have used some good songs, if it even had that.

The sharks should have eaten him at the beginning...

19 July 2004,100% cute and funny,"Finding Nemo is the best movie I have ever seen. It is so cute! I think the school of fish forming shapes is cute.

I just love the characters! Marlin and Dory are my favorite. I don't really think anyone likes Marlin, but I do, no matter how over-protective he is. And I agree with everyone adoring Dory. She is actually my favorite part of the movie. And when it comes to her, the movie is SO FUNNY! I JUST LOVE IT WHEN SHE SPEAKES WHALE; I think it's THE FUNNIEST PART OF THE HOLE MOVIE!

This movie is just so cute. I have no questions for the creators, except: How did you think of such a good movie, and a good DORY character? 100% funny and cute; good work, peoples!

15 November 2012,Pixar Magic at its Best,"Finding Nemo is an animated film that adds on to the list of masterpieces created by Pixar. Although the movie is known for its humorous characters, comedic scenes, and terrific underwater animation, Finding Nemo provides emotional insight to both children and adults of what is most important in life—family.

What separates Finding Nemo from most animated films is the fact that it doesn't connect to just children; it is a movie in which the entire family can enjoy and learn something from. Looking at Marlin (father of Nemo), this movie can relate to adults in that it highlights the cliché quote of ""never give up"" as an extremely important motto to live off by, especially when speaking about something that is very important to you. When looking at Nemo, children are able to realize that during a struggle, it is important to stay positive in order to succeed and receive something good out of a situation. By attracting and connecting to people of all ages, this is why Finding Nemo was not only one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time, but also THE best-selling DVD of all time.

The producers of Finding Nemo also did an excellent job in choosing the voices for the characters. Dory, another main character, plays a quirky fish who adds a vital role in the comedy part of the movie. Choosing Ellen DeGeneres, a well known comedian and talk show host, as the voice for Dory adds to the brilliance of the movie because Ellen is a natural entertainer. Andrew Stanton, the writer and director of Finding Nemo, played the voice of ""Crush,"" a sea turtle Marlin encountered during his journey. With Crush's ""surfer dude"" voice and personality, he adds another source of humor in the movie with his unique qualities.

The ocean is vast and very mysterious. Finding Nemo lets you see what lies below the water with brilliant colors and overwhelming sense of detail. It truly reveals that there is a whole new world that exists in our planet. It not only provides views of underwater landscapes from within the ocean, but also the fish tank setting from a fish's point of view. The vibrant colors and the amount of detail put into this animation is another reason why so many people have been drawn to this movie.

Finding Nemo is more than just a movie about a father fish who loses his beloved son and his journey to find him. The audience is truly drawn into the storyline of the movie because of Marlin's persistent determination and Nemo's lovable and impressionable personality. It allows the viewers to connect emotionally to these two main characters because of the strong bond they have with each other. The movie strongly emphasizes the devotion and enduring love a parent has for his child, and the importance of these qualities during times of complications. Because of this, it shows the reason why family is among the most important things to cherish and have in your life because they are the ones who go through great risks for one another.

The meaning behind the story line, humorous scenes, amount of detail, and unique characters make being disappointed at any time during the movie impossible. It is a film that the whole family will enjoy no matter how old you are. Whether it's watching it during class or at home, I will always be just as excited to watch this wonderful film as I was the first time I watched it in theaters nine years ago.",10
8 November 2012,Cute movie,"The movie ""Finding Nemo"" is a adorable, funny movie for kids and adults alike. The actors are great and and the animation looks some what realistic with the shimmering water. The movie. It takes you on an adventure through the ocean, showing a dad's love for his son.

The actors are good and bring more life into the movie. Ellen Degeneres plays Dory, who is a fish that forgets every five minutes and is very friendly.Dory ""Hey there, Mr. Grumpy Gills, when life gets you down do you wanna know what you've gotta do?"".She befriends Marlin, played by Alex Brooks, he is an overprotective dad that's son has been kidnapped by humans. Both of these actors' characters contrast, which makes the movie funny and enjoyable to watch as the change for the better and become friends.

In Addition, the scenery in the movie looks amazing for animation. It captures the realistic look of the ocean even though its animated. In the first scene Marlin shows his wife Cory, who is only there for a short time, their new home over looking the coral reef. The water shimmers showing the beauty of the ocean.

Although, this is a great movie they could show coral a little more instead of taking her out right away. Maybe Marlin could remember her and let her go, because in about the fist couple of minutes it shows them together in there in home and then she gets taken out of the movie altogether.

Furthermore, this movie is good for kids and adults. It's not to scary like some movies are for kids now, and its funny and also serious. Adults can get bored in movies that are made for kids, but this movie doesn't bore you. It can make you laugh, when Dory forgets things. It shows the characters changing throughout the movie. Henceforth, the movies characters are cute and and there are some sad parts but there are also happy and funny parts. The scary parts in this movie are not to scary and don't scare your kids. Thus, this movie is a great movie for you and your kids.

Accordingly, this is over all a great movie to watch. In the future this would be a good movie to remember, because the style of movies is going to change. Would you want your children to watch something that could scare them or give them nightmares or maybe they just don't enjoy it? If you don't want that to happen, ""Finding Nemo"" is a good movie to watch.",
2 October 2004,Best Pixar film I've seen,"This movie is one of the best I've seen. It managed to be entertaining and hilarious all the way through. Ellen DeGeneres makes a great Dory and Nicholas Bird's cute voice is just perfect for Squirt. And you gotta admire how they used real Aussie actors for parts such as the sharks (I hate fake accents). It's an entertaining, hilarious, amily film (and you don't have to have a family to enjoy it!) I think it deserved the Oscar. The DVD commentary is amusing and informational(unlike ""it was great working with this person"" crap).It includes an audio track and some nice visual commentary. Anyways, its a clever CGI picture. 10/10

28 September 2004,"warning: SPOILER - I liked it, despite the odd lesson being taught...","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.

I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations.

Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",
21 April 2005,Finding Nemo is a children's action that should keep their attention!,"A good movie for both kids and adults. It kept my attention and I didn't see that there was anything that would be inappropriate for children. The movie contains a lot of familiar voices that I recognized and a few that I didn't recognize. All the characters were cute and lovable. You might have to explain the difference between Marlin and Nemo to small children, there is a small difference, but it was hard to tell, even for me. There were a bunch of adorable little tag lines like, ""Fish are friends not food."" ""Ride some shell."" This is definitely one that should go in the DVD collection at home or in a daycare!

27 January 2005,baguiras,"""What many people consider to be witty and original is what I see as imports from early Chaplin films and episodes of the Simpsons. Finding Nemo is the story of the eponymous fish, Nemo. Nemo is the only survivor of his batch after his brothers and sisters (along with his Mother) were eaten by sharks in the egg stage. However Nemo survived (albeit deformed) along with a paranoid Father.

The jokes seem tired and lack any moments of stomach-rumbling chuckling but rather a series of humoured snorts. Although the main character of Nemo is likable, the other two major characters are not. Ellen Degeneres' role as Dory is so irritating that you start hoping the diver comes back and batters Dory then at least somebody will get some use out of the poorly-designed character.

Although there are smart ideas it becomes jumbled up in overly-immature jokes that decrease the entertainment value. For example the sharks that are dedicated to soothing their blood lust is worth some giggles but it gets lost in the sea(pardon the pun) of poor remarks. I should have known that the immaturity and basicness of the jokes would never stop coming. I assumed there would be a 15 minute farting sequence later on.""",

22 May 2005,excellent movie.. the best.,"was an excellent movie, only thing that ruined it was the American accents of the turtles, where as everything else wasn't. but i love the movie all the same.. its my favourite. xx

i loved the graphics of this movie.. very precise as is most of Disney/pixar movies.

Dory was a great character.. wouldn't have been as funny if she was played as a man like it was planned to.

And the director did the right thing by not putting another scene in about nemo learning how to swim with gill.. it would have been too long.

Don't make another movie, because it will just spoil the first one.

11 June 2015,Pretty Good,"This move is very good! It is definitely a great film for the family to watch together before the kids go to bed! You will all get a good laugh out of this film! And if you guys are worried it is absolutely 100% child approved! I also like this film a lot because the personalities of the characters in this film are a lot like the personalities that people we know have! It is a pretty good movie just to sit back laugh, and enjoy what's happening on the screen without having to stay on high-alert for something scary that the children won't like! Again I completely recommend this film for something that a family could watch together!

28 July 2017,Adore this movie,"I absolutely love Finding Nemo! One of the best animated movies i've seen. The theme of trust is very good. I like that marlin really has to learn to trust not just nemo but the world around him as well. I love how they made the ocean look so real for an animated movie as well. Very realistic. I feel all the actors did an amazing job but my favorite was Ellen.Her Dory was great.All of the characters were great to be honest. I loved them all. Another of my favorites was Mr.Ray. He wasn't around a lot but when he was he was a great presence on the screen. The dentist was hilarious as well as the tank friends. I think Dory is my favorite character. There are so many good things about this movie yet I'm having a hard time naming them all. The way the story was told way very well done. It flowed nicely and fit together perfectly. Not once did something feel out of place from scene to scene.

25 November 2005,The best movie for a long time.,"Finding Nemo is the best movie i have seen since The Lion King. I'm only young and even though my 7 year old sister thinks its a kids movie i think its for all ages. It includes lots of different lines, comments and music from a range of different movies and the humour in it is very humorous for 4 year old kids through to 4000 yr old people.Andrew Stanton has done an excellent job in directing this hit. Another thing i absolutely love about it is the casters didn't choose the popular celebrities but used people who i never knew before this. They gave the chance of being famous and well known to people who are usually just stuck behind the scenes of movies. They used a range of different fish that fit into different stereotypes in our communities and our own lives in the modern times. Finding Nemo as well as Shrek and Shrek 2 are some of the most awesome movies that have being put out in the last decade.

14 October 2017,just as good as i remembered,"i know that i'm super late to the party, but this is one of the handful of movies that i grew up watching. maybe i'm biased to Disney/pixar movies, but finding nemo is just one of those films i can keep coming back to. if i'm in a bad mood, i can pop the disc into the DVD player with a sweet tea and some popcorn and relax. am i the only one who feels this way?

25 January 2006,Finding Nemo - Part Deux,"The current range of Penguins in the films - I'm surprised that the artists / production crew didn't beat France to the punch on Penguins March.

Why? If they visited Melbourne just a short flight from Sydney they would have found a follow on - ""March of the Littlest Penguin"" that brings spectators from around the world to watch as these little guys travel off the coast and back bringing food to their young. Evil Gulls, predators, and plot line suggests a movie option next time.

If not try a web search using ""Grand Penguin Parade"" while enjoy the wave after wave of penguins returning.
